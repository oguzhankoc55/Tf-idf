0706.3624	absorption line-strengths of 18 late-type spiral galaxies observed with  sauron	we present absorption line-strength maps for a sample of 18 sb-sd galaxiesobserved using the integral-field spectrograph sauron. the sauron spectralrange allows the measurement of the lick/ids indices hbeta, fe5015 and mgb,which can be used to estimate the stellar population parameters. we presenthere the two-dimensional line-strength maps for each galaxy. from the maps, welearn that late-type spiral galaxies tend to have high hbeta and low fe5015 andmgb values, and that the hbeta index has often a positive gradient over thefield, while the metal indices peak in the central region. we investigate therelations between the central line-strength indices and their correlations withmorphological type and central velocity dispersion, and compare the observedbehaviour with that for ellipticals, lenticulars and early-type spirals fromthe sauron survey. we find that our galaxies lie below the mg - sigma relationdetermined for elliptical galaxies and that the indices show a clear trend withmorphological type. from the line-strength maps we calculate age, metallicityand abundance ratio maps and discuss the results from a one-ssp approach andfrom a two-ssp approach. late-type galaxies are generally younger and moremetal poor than ellipticals and have abundance ratios closer to solar values.we also explore a continuous star formation scenario, and try to recover thestar formation history using the evolutionary models of bruzual &amp; charlot(2003), assuming constant or exponentially declining star formation rate (sfr).we find a correlation between the e-folding time-scale tau of the starburst andthe central velocity dispersion: more massive galaxies tend to have shortertau, suggesting that the star formation happened long ago and has now basicallyended, while for smaller objects with larger values of tau it is still active.

0906.3318	the sauron project - xiii. sauron-galex study of early-type galaxies:  the ultraviolet colour-magnitude relations and fundamental planes	we present galex far (fuv) and near (nuv) ultraviolet imaging of 34 nearbyearly-type galaxies from the sauron representative sample of 48 e/s0 galaxies,all of which have ground-based optical imaging from the mdm observatory. thesurface brightness profiles of nine galaxies show regions with blue uv-opticalcolours suggesting recent star formation. five of these show blue integrateduv-optical colours that set them aside in the nuv integrated colour-magnituderelation. they also have other properties confirming they have had recent starformation, in particular h_beta absorption higher than expected for a quiescentpopulation and a higher co detection rate. nuv-blue galaxies are generallydrawn from the lower stellar velocity dispersion and thus lower dynamical masspart of the sample. we have also constructed the first uv fundamental planesand show that nuv blue galaxies bias the slopes and increase the scatters. ifthey are eliminated the fits get closer to expectations from the virialtheorem. although our analysis is based on a limited sample, it seems that adominant fraction of the tilt and scatter of the uv fundamental planes is dueto the presence of young stars in preferentially low-mass early-type galaxies.interestingly, the uv-optical radial colour profiles reveal a variety ofbehaviours, with many galaxies showing signs of recent star formation, acentral uv-upturn phenomenon, smooth but large-scale age and metallicitygradients, and in many cases a combination of these. in addition, fuv-nuv andfuv-v colours even bluer than those normally associated with uv-upturn galaxiesare observed at the centre of some quiescent galaxies. four out of the fiveuv-upturn galaxies are slow rotators. these objects should thus poseinteresting challenges to stellar evolutionary models of the uv-upturn.

0906.3321	the sauron project - xiv. no escape from v$_{\mathrm{esc}}$: a global  and local parameter in early-type galaxy evolution	we present the results of an investigation of the local escape velocity(vesc) - line strength index relationship for 48 early type galaxies from thesauron sample, the first such study based on a large sample of galaxies withboth detailed integral field observations and extensive dynamical modelling.values of vesc are computed using multi gaussian expansion (mge) photometricfitting and axisymmetric, anisotropic jeans' dynamical modelling simultaneouslyon hst and ground-based images. we determine line strengths and escapevelocities at multiple radii within each galaxy, allowing an investigation ofthe correlation within individual galaxies as well as amongst galaxies. we finda tight correlation between vesc and the line-strength indices. for mgb we findthat this correlation exists not only between different galaxies but alsoinside individual galaxies - it is both a local and global correlation. therelation within individual galaxies has the same slope and offset as the globalrelation to a good level of agreement, though there is significant intrinsicscatter in the local gradients. we transform our line strength indexmeasurements to the single stellar population (ssp) equivalent age (t),metallicity ([z/h]) and enhancement ([$\alpha$/fe]) and carry out a principalcomponent analysis of our ssp and vesc data. we find that in thisfour-dimensional parameter space the galaxies in our sample are to a goodapproximation confined to a plane, given by $\log\mathrm({v}_{\mathrm{esc}}/500\mathrm{km/s}) = 0.85 \mathrm{[z/h]} + 0.43 \log(\mathrm{t}/\mathrm{gyrs})$ - 0.20. it is surprising that it is a combinationof age and metallicity that is conserved; this may indicate a 'conspiracy'between age and metallicity or a weakness in the ssp models.

0912.0275	the sauron project xvi: on the sources of ionisation for the gas in  elliptical and lenticular galaxies	following our study on the incidence, morphology and kinematics of theionised gas in early-type galaxies we now address the question of what ispowering the observed nebular emission. to constrain the likely sources of gasexcitation, we resort to a variety of ancillary data, draw from complementaryinformation on the gas kinematics, stellar populations and galactic potentialfrom the sauron data, and use the sauron-specific diagnostic diagramjuxtaposing the [oiii]/hb and [ni]/hb line ratios. we find a tight correlationbetween the stellar surface brightness and the flux of the hb recombinationline across our sample, which points to a diffuse and old stellar source as themain contributor of ionising photons in early-type galaxies, withpost-asymptotic giant branch (pagb) stars being still the best candidate basedon ionising-balance arguments. other ionising sources such as a central agn,ob-stars, shocks or the interaction between the hot and warm phases of theinterestellar medium are found to play only a limited or localised role inpowering the diffuse nebular emission observed in our sample galaxies. theseresults lead us to investigate the relative importance of stellar and agnphotoionisation in explaining the ionised-gas emission observed in early-typegalaxies by the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). by simulating how our samplegalaxies would appear if placed at further distance and targeted by the sdss,we conclude that only in very few, if any, of the sdss early-type galaxies thatdisplay modest values for the equivalent width of the [oiii] line (less than~2.4\aa) and liner-like [oiii]/hb values, the nebular emission is truly poweredby an agn.

1006.1574	the sauron project - xvii. stellar population analysis of the absorption  line strength maps of 48 early-type galaxies	(abridged) we present a stellar population analysis of the absorption linestrength maps for 48 early-type galaxies from the sauron sample. using the linestrength index maps of hbeta, fe5015, and mgb, measured in the lick/ids systemand spatially binned to a constant signal-to-noise, together with predictionsfrom up-to-date stellar population models, we estimate the simple stellarpopulation-equivalent (ssp-equivalent) age, metallicity and abundance ratio[alpha/fe] over a two-dimensional field extending up to approximately oneeffective radius. we find a large range of ssp-equivalent ages in our sample,of which ~40% of the galaxies show signs of a contribution from a young stellarpopulation. the most extreme cases of post-starburst galaxies, withssp-equivalent ages of &lt;=3 gyr observed over the full field-of-view, andsometimes even showing signs of residual star-formation, are restricted to lowmass systems(sigma_e &lt;= 100 k/ms or ~2x10^10 m_sol). spatially restricted casesof young stellar populations in circumnuclear regions can almost exclusively belinked to the presence of star-formation in a thin, dusty disk/ring, also seenin the near-uv or mid-ir. the flattened components with disk-like kinematicspreviously identified in all fast rotators (krajnovi\'c et al.) are shown to beconnected to regions of distinct stellar populations. these range from theyoung, still star-forming circumnuclear disks and rings with increasedmetallicity preferentially found in intermediate-mass fast rotators, toapparently old structures with extended disk-like kinematics, which areobserved to have an increased metallicity and mildly depressed [alpha/fe] ratiocompared to the main body of the galaxy. the slow rotators generally show nostellar population signatures over and above the well known metallicitygradients and are largely consistent with old (&gt;=10 gyr) stellar populations.

1012.1551	the atlas3d project -- i. a volume-limited sample of 260 nearby  early-type galaxies: science goals and selection criteria	the atlas3d project is a multi-wavelength survey combined with a theoreticalmodeling effort. the observations span from the radio to the millimeter andoptical, and provide multi-colour imaging, two-dimensional kinematics of theatomic (hi), molecular (co) and ionized gas (hbeta, [oiii] and [ni]), togetherwith the kinematics and population of the stars (hbeta, fe5015 and mgb), for acarefully selected, volume-limited (1.16*10^5 mpc^3) sample of 260 early-type(elliptical e and lenticular s0) galaxies (etgs). the models includesemi-analytic, n-body binary mergers and cosmological simulations of galaxyformation. here we present the science goals for the project and introduce thegalaxy sample and the selection criteria. the sample consists of nearby (d&lt;42mpc) morphologically-selected etgs extracted from a parent sample of 871galaxies (8% e, 22% s0 and 70% spirals) brighter than m_k&lt;-21.5 mag (stellarmass m_star&gt;6*10^9 m_sun). we analyze possible selection biases and we concludethat the parent sample is essentially complete and statistically representativeof the nearby galaxy population. we present the size-luminosity relation forthe spirals and etgs and show that the etgs in the atlas3d sample define atight red sequence in a colour-magnitude diagram, with few objects in thetransition from the blue cloud. we describe the strategy of the sauronintegral-field observations and the extraction of the stellar kinematics withthe ppxf method. we give an overview of the characteristics of the other maindatasets already available for our sample and of the ongoing modellingprojects.

1102.0957	the sauron project - xviii. the integrated uv-linestrength relations of  early-type galaxies	using far (fuv) and near (nuv) ultraviolet photometry from guest investigatorprogrammes on the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) satellite, opticalphotometry from the mdm observatory and optical integral-field spectroscopyfrom sauron, we explore the uv-linestrength relations of the 48 nearbyearly-type galaxies in the sauron sample. identical apertures are used for allquantities, avoiding aperture mismatch. we show that galaxies with purely oldstellar populations show well-defined correlations of the integrated fuv-v andfuv-nuv colours with the integrated mgb and hbeta absorption linestrengthindices, strongest for fuv-nuv. correlations with the nuv-v colour, fe5015index and stellar velocity dispersion are much weaker. these correlations putstringent constraints on the origin of the uv-upturn phenomenon in early-typegalaxies, and highlight its dependence on age and metallicity. in particular,despite recent debate, we recover the negative correlation between fuv-v colourand mg linestrength originally publicised by burstein et al. (1988), which werefer to as the "burstein relation", suggesting a positive dependence of theuv-upturn on metallicity. we argue that the scatter in the correlations isreal, and present mild evidence that a strong uv excess is preferentiallypresent in slow-rotating galaxies. we also demonstrate that most outliers inthe correlations are galaxies with current or recent star formation, some atvery low levels. we believe that this sensitivity to weak star formation,afforded by the deep and varied data available for the sauron sample, explainswhy our results are occasionally at odds with other recent but shallowersurveys. this is supported by the analysis of a large, carefully-crafted sampleof more distant early-type galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss),more easily comparable with current and future large surveys.

1102.3801	the atlas3d project - ii. morphologies, kinemetric features and  alignment between photometric and kinematic axes of early-type galaxies	[abridged] we use the atlas3d sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) tostudy the apparent kinematic misalignment angle, psi, defined as the anglebetween the photometric and kinematic major axis. we find that 71% of nearbyetgs are strictly aligned systems (psi &gt; 5 deg), an additional 14% have 5 &lt; psi&lt; 10 deg and 90% of galaxies have psi &lt; 15 deg. taking into account measurementuncertainties, 90% of galaxies can be considered aligned to better than 5 deg,suggesting that only a small fraction of early-type galaxies (~10%) are notconsistent with axisymmetry within the projected half-light radius. we identifymorphological features such as bars and rings (30%), dust structures (16%),blue nuclear colours (6%) and evidence of interactions (8%). we use kinemetryto analyse the mean velocity maps and separate galaxies in two broad types ofregular and non-regular rotators. we find 82% of regular rotators and 17%non-regular rotators, with 2 galaxies that we were not able to classify due todata quality. the non-regular rotators are typically found in dense regions andare massive. the majority of galaxies do not have any specific kinemetricfeatures, but we highlight here the frequency of the kinematically distinctcores (7%) and the aligned double peaks in the velocity dispersion maps (4%).most of the galaxies that are misaligned have complex kinematics and arenon-regular rotators. while the trends are weak, there is a tendency that largevalues of psi are found in galaxies at intermediate environmental densities andamong the most massive galaxies in the sample. we suggest that the most commonformation mechanism for etgs preserves the axisymmetry of the disk progenitors.less commonly, the formation process results in a triaxial galaxy with muchlower net angular momentum.

1102.4444	the atlas3d project - iii. a census of the stellar angular momentum  within the effective radius of early-type galaxies: unveiling the  distribution of fast and slow rotators	we provide a census of the apparent stellar angular momentum within 1 re of avolume-limited sample of 260 early-type galaxies (etgs) in the nearby universe,using integral-field spectroscopy obtained in the course of the atlas3dproject. we exploit the lambdar parameter to characterise the existence of twofamilies of etgs: slow rotators which exhibit complex stellar velocity fieldsand often include stellar kinematically distinct cores (kdcs), and fastrotators which have regular velocity fields. our complete sample of 260 etgsleads to a new criterion to disentangle fast and slow rotators which nowincludes a dependency on the apparent ellipticity (epsilon). it separates thetwo classes significantly better than the previous prescription, and than acriterion based on v/sigma: slow rotators and fast rotators have lambdar lowerand larger than kfsxsqrt(epsilon), respectively, where kfs=0.31 formeasurements made within 1 re. we show that the vast majority of early-typegalaxies are fast rotators: these have regular stellar rotation, with alignedphotometric and kinematic axes (paper ii, krajnovic et al. 2011}, include discsand often bars and represent 86% (224/260) of all early-type galaxies in thevolume-limited atlas3d sample. fast rotators span the full range of apparentellipticities from 0 to 0.85, and we suggest that they cover intrinsicellipticities from about 0.35 to 0.85, the most flattened having morphologiesconsistent with spiral galaxies. only a small fraction of etgs are slowrotators representing 14% (36/260) of the atlas3d sample of etgs. of all slowrotators, 11% (4/36) exhibit two counter-rotating stellar disc-like componentsand are rather low mass objects (mdyn&lt;10^10.5 m_sun). all other slow rotators(32/36) appear relatively round on the sky (epsilon_e&lt;0.4), tend to be massive(mdyn&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), and often (17/32) exhibit kdcs.

1102.4877	the atlas3d project - v. the co tully-fisher relation of early-type  galaxies	we demonstrate here using both single-dish and interferometric observationsthat co molecules are an excellent kinematic tracer, even in high-massgalaxies, allowing us to investigate for the first time the co tully-fisherrelation of early-type galaxies. we compare the tully-fisher relations producedusing both single-dish and interferometric data and various inclinationestimation methods, and evaluate the use of the velocity profile shape as acriterion for selecting galaxies in which the molecular gas extends beyond thepeak of the rotation curve. we show that the gradient and zero-point of thebest-fit relations are robust, independent of the velocity measure andinclination used, and agree with those of relations derived using stellarkinematics. we also show that the early-type co tully-fisher (co-tf) relationis offset from the co-tf of spirals by 0.98 \pm 0.22 magnitude at ks-band, inline with other results. the intrinsic scatter of the relation is found to be\approx 0.4 magnitudes, similar to the level found in the spiral galaxypopulation. next generation facilities such as the large millimeter telescope(lmt) and the atacama large millimeter/sub-millimeter array (alma) should allowthis technique to be used in higher-redshift systems, providing a simple newtool to trace the mass-to-light ratio evolution of the most massive galaxiesover cosmic time.

1104.2326	discovery of an agn-driven molecular outflow in the local early-type  galaxy ngc 1266	we report the discovery of a powerful molecular wind from the nucleus of thenon-interacting nearby s0 field galaxy ngc 1266. the single-dish co profileexhibits emission to +/- 400 km/s and requires a nested gaussian fit to beproperly described. interferometric observations reveal a massive, centrally-concentrated molecular component with a mass of 1.1x10^9 msuns and a molecularoutflow with a molecular mass of 2.4x10^7 msuns. the molecular gas close to thesystemic velocity consists of a rotating, compact nucleus with a mass of about4.1x108 msuns within a radius of approximately 60 pc. this compact molecularnucleus has a surface density of \approx 2.7 \times 10^4 msuns/pc^2, more thantwo orders of magnitude larger than that of giant molecular clouds in the diskof the milky way, and it appears to sit on the kennicutt-schmidt relationdespite its extreme kinematics and energetic activity. we interpret thisnucleus as a disk that confines the outflowing wind. a mass outflow rate of 13msuns/yr leads to a depletion timescale of about 85 myr. the star formation inngc 1266 is insufficient to drive the outflow, and thus it is likely driven bythe active galactic nucleus (agn). the concentration of the majority of themolecular gas in the central 100 pc requires an extraordinary loss of angularmomentum, but no obvious companion or interacting galaxy is present to enablethe transfer. ngc 1266 is the first known outflowing molecular system that doesnot show any evidence of a recent interaction.

1104.3545	the atlas3d project - vii. a new look at the morphology of nearby  galaxies: the kinematic morphology-density relation	we look at the morphology of fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies.edge-on fast rotators are lenticular galaxies. they appear like spiral galaxieswith the gas and dust removed, and in some cases are flat ellipticals withdisky isophotes. fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range ofbulge fractions as spiral galaxies. the slow rotators are rounder and aregenerally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, ellipticalgalaxies. we propose a revision to the tuning-fork diagram by hubble as itgives a misleading description of etgs. we study for the first time thekinematic morphology-density t-sigma relation using fast and slow rotators toreplace lenticulars and ellipticals. we find that our relation is cleaner thanusing classic morphology. slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest densityenvironments [f(sr)&lt;2%] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(sr)~4%] ofthe total galaxy population in the environments explored by our survey, withthe exception of the densest core of the virgo cluster [f(sr)~20%]. we find aclean log-linear relation between the fraction f(sp) of spiral galaxies and thelocal galaxy surface density. the existence of a smooth kinematic t-sigmarelation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment asmain contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast-rotators inlow-density environments. it shows that the segregation is driven by localeffects at the small-group scale. only at the largest densities in the virgocore does the f(sp) relation break down and steepens sharply, while thefraction of slow-rotators starts to significantly increase. this suggests thata different mechanism is at work there.

1105.4076	the atlas3d project - vi. simulations of binary galaxy mergers and the  link with fast rotators, slow rotators, and kinematically distinct cores	we study the formation of early-type galaxies through mergers with a sampleof 70 high-resolution (softening length &lt; 60 pc and 12*10^6 particles)numerical simulations of binary mergers of disc galaxies and 16 simulations ofetg remergers. these simulations, designed to accompany observations and modelsconducted within the atlas3d project, encompass various mass ratios (from 1:1to 6:1), initial conditions and orbital parameters. the progenitor discgalaxies are spiral-like with bulge to disc ratios typical of sb and scgalaxies. we find that binary mergers of disc galaxies with mass ratios of 3:1and 6:1 are nearly always classified as fast rotators according to the atlas3dcriterion (based on the lambda_r parameter): they preserve the structure of theinput fast rotating spiral progenitors. they have intrinsic ellipticitieslarger than 0.5, cover intrinsic lambda_r values between 0.2 and 0.6, withinthe range of observed fast rotators. major disc mergers (mass ratios of 2:1 and1:1) lead to both fast and slow rotators. most of the fast rotators produced inmajor mergers have intermediate flattening, with ellipticities between 0.4 and0.6. most slow rotators formed in these binary disc mergers hold a stellarkinematically distinct core (kdc) in their 1-3 central kilo-parsec: these kdcsare built from the stellar components of the progenitors. besides a handful ofspecific observed systems -- the counter-rotating discs (2-sigma galaxies) --these therefore cannot reproduce the observed population of slow rotators inthe nearby universe. the mass ratio of the progenitors is a fundamentalparameter for the formation of slow rotators in these binary mergers, but italso requires a retrograde spin for the earlier-type (sb) progenitor galaxywith respect to the orbital angular momentum.

1107.5059	the atlas3d project-- viii: modelling the formation and evolution of  fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies within $\lambda$cdm	we propose a simple model for the origin of fast and slow rotator early-typegalaxies (etg) within the hierarchical $\lambda$cdm scenario, that is based onthe assumption that the mass fraction of stellar discs in etgs is a proxy forthe specific angular momentum expressed via $\lambda_r$. within our model wereproduce the fraction of fast and slow rotators as a function of magnitude inthe \atl survey, assuming that fast rotating etgs have at least 10% of theirtotal stellar mass in a disc component. in agreement with \atl observations wefind that slow rotators are predominantly galaxies with $ m_* &gt; 10^{10.5}$m$_{\odot}$ contributing $\sim 20%$ to the overall etg population. we show indetail that the growth histories of fast and slow rotators are different,supporting the classification of etgs into these two categories. slow rotatorsaccrete between $\sim 50% -90%$ of their stellar mass from satellites and theirmost massive progenitors have on average up to 3 major mergers during theirevolution. fast rotators in contrast, accrete less than 50% and have on averageless than one major merger in their past.  we find that the underlying physical reason for the different growthhistories is the slowing down and ultimately complete shut-down of gas coolingin massive galaxies. once cooling and associated star formation in disc stops,galaxies grow via infall from satellites. frequent minor mergers thereby,destroy existing stellar discs via violent relaxation and also tend to lowerthe specific angular momentum of the main stellar body, lowering $\lambda_r$into the slow rotator regime. abridged...

1202.3308	a systematic variation of the stellar initial mass function in  early-type galaxies	much of our knowledge of galaxies comes from analysing the radiation emittedby their stars. it depends on the stellar initial mass function (imf)describing the distribution of stellar masses when the population formed.consequently knowledge of the imf is critical to virtually every aspect ofgalaxy evolution. more than half a century after the first imf determination,no consensus has emerged on whether it is universal in different galaxies.previous studies indicated that the imf and the dark matter fraction in galaxycentres cannot be both universal, but they could not break the degeneracybetween the two effects. only recently indications were found that massiveelliptical galaxies may not have the same imf as our milky way. here we reportunambiguous evidence for a strong systematic variation of the imf in early-typegalaxies as a function of their stellar mass-to-light ratio, producingdifferences up to a factor of three in mass. this was inferred from detaileddynamical models of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the largeatlas3d representative sample of nearby early-type galaxies spanning two ordersof magnitude in stellar mass. our finding indicates that the imf dependsintimately on a galaxy's formation history.

1204.2590	the sauron project-xxi. the spatially-resolved uv-line strength  relations of early-type galaxies	the unexpected rising flux of early-type galaxies at decreasing ultraviolet(uv) wavelengths is a long-standing mystery. one important observationalconstraint is the correlation between uv-optical colours and mg2 line strengthsfound by burstein et al. (1988). the simplest interpretation of this phenomenonis that the uv strength is related to the mg line strength. under thisassumption, we expect galaxies with larger mg gradients to have larger uvcolour gradients. by combining uv imaging from galex, optical imaging from mdmand sauron integral-field spectroscopy, we investigate the spatially-resolvedrelationships between uv colours and stellar population properties of 34early-type galaxies from the sauron survey sample. we find that galaxies withold stellar populations show tight correlations between the fuv colours (fuv-vand fuv-nuv) and the mgb index, h{\beta} index and metallicity [z/h]. theequivalent correlations for the fe5015 index, {\alpha}-enhancement[{\alpha}/fe] and age are present but weaker. we have also derived logarithmicinternal radial colour, measured line strength and derived stellar populationgradients for each galaxy and again found a strong dependence of the fuv-v andfuv-nuv colour gradients on both the mg b line strength and the metallicitygradients for galaxies with old stellar populations. in particular, globalgradients of mg b and [z/h] with respect to the uv colour across galaxies areconsistent with their local gradients within galaxies, suggesting that theglobal correlations also hold locally. from a simple model based on multi-bandcolour fits of uv upturn and uv-weak galaxies, we have identified a plausiblerange of parameters that reproduces the observed radial colour profiles. inthese models, the centers of elliptical galaxies, where the uv flux is strong,are enhanced in metals by roughly 60% compared to uv-weak regions.

1206.0291	the atlas3d project - xii. recovery of the mass-to-light ratio of  simulated early-type barred galaxies with axisymmetric dynamical models	we investigate the accuracy in the recovery of the stellar dynamics of barredgalaxies when using axisymmetric dynamical models. we do this by trying torecover the mass-to-light ratio (m/l) and the anisotropy of realistic galaxysimulations using the jeans anisotropic multi-gaussian expansion (jam) method.however, given that the biases we find are mostly due to an application of anaxisymmetric modeling algorithm to a non-axisymmetric system and in particularto inaccuracies in the de-projected mass model, our results are relevant forgeneral axisymmetric modelling methods. we run n-body collisionless simulationsto build a library with various luminosity distribution, constructed to mimicreal individual galaxies, with realistic anisotropy. the final result of ourevolved library of simulations contains both barred and unbarred galaxies. thejam method assumes an axisymmetric mass distribution, and we adopt a spatiallyconstant m/l and anisotropy beta_z=1-sigma_z^2/sigma_r^2 distributions. themodels are fitted to two-dimensional maps of the second velocity momentsv_rms=sqrt(v^2+sigma^2) of the simulations for various viewing angles (positionangle of the bar and inclination of the galaxy). we find that the inclinationis generally well recovered by the jam models, for both barred and unbarredsimulations. for unbarred simulations the m/l is also accurately recovered,with negligible median bias and with a maximum one of just delta(m/l)&lt;1.5% whenthe galaxy is not too close to face on. at very low inclinations (i&lt;30 deg) them/l can be significantly overestimated (9% in our tests, but errors can belarger for very face-on views). for barred simulations the m/l is on average(when pa=45 deg) essentially unbiased, but we measure an over/under estimationof up to delta(m/l)=15% in our tests. the sign of the m/l bias depends on theposition angle of the bar as expected.

1209.4107	discovery of a giant hi tail in the galaxy group hcg 44	we report the discovery of a giant hi tail in the intra-group medium of hcg44 as part of the atlas3d survey. the tail is ~300 kpc long in projection andcontains ~5x10^8 m_sun of hi. we detect no diffuse stellar light at thelocation of the tail down to ~28.5 mag/arcsec^2 in g band. we speculate thatthe tail might have formed as gas was stripped from the outer regions of ngc3187 (a member of hcg 44) by the group tidal field. in this case, a simplemodel indicates that about 1/3 of the galaxy's hi was stripped during a timeinterval of &lt;1 gyr. alternatively, the tail may be the remnant of aninteraction between hcg 44 and ngc 3162, a spiral galaxy now ~650 kpc away fromthe group. regardless of the precise formation mechanism, the detected hi tailshows for the first time direct evidence of gas stripping in hcg 44. it alsohighlights that deep hi observations over a large field are needed to gather acomplete census of this kind of events in the local universe.

1210.8167	the atlas3d project - xvii. linking photometric and kinematic signatures  of stellar discs in early-type galaxies	[abridged] we analyse the morphological structures in galaxies of the atlas3dsample by fitting a single sersic profile and decomposing all non-barredobjects (180 of 260 objects) in two components parameterised by an exponentialand a general sersic function. the aim of this analysis is to look forsignatures of discs in light distributions of nearby early-type galaxies andcompare them to kinematic properties. using sersic index from single componentfits for a distinction between slow and fast rotators, or even late- andearly-type galaxies, is not recommended. assuming that objects with n&gt;3 areslow rotators (or ellipticals), there is only a 22 per cent probability tocorrectly classify objects as slow rotators (or 37 per cent of previouslyclassified as ellipticals). we show that exponential sub-components, as well aslight profiles fitted with only a single component of a low sersic index, canbe linked with the kinematic evidence for discs in early-type galaxies. themedian disk-to-total light ratio for fast and slow rotators is 0.41 and 0.0,respectively. similarly, the median sersic indices of the bulge (general sersiccomponent) are 1.7 and 4.8 for fast and slow rotators, respectively. overall,discs or disc-like structures, are present in 83 per cent of early-typegalaxies which do not have bars, and they show a full range of disk-to-totallight ratios. discs in early-type galaxies contribute with about 40 per cent tothe total mass of the analysed (non-barred) objects. the decomposition intodiscs and bulges can be used as a rough approximation for the separationbetween fast and slow rotators, but it is not a substitute, as there is only a59 per cent probability to correctly recognise slow rotators. kinematics (i.e.projected angular momentum) remains the best approach to mitigate the influenceof the inclination effects.

1211.2317	the stellar populations of massive galaxies in the local universe	i present a brief review of the stellar population properties of massivegalaxies, focusing on early-type galaxies in particular, with emphasis onrecent results from the atlas3d survey. i discuss the occurrence of youngstellar ages, cold gas, and ongoing star formation in early-type galaxies, thepresence of which gives important clues to the evolutionary path of thesegalaxies. consideration of empirical star formation histories gives ameaningful picture of galaxy stellar population properties, and allows accuratecomparison of mass estimates from populations and dynamics. this has recentlyprovided strong evidence of a non-universal imf, as supported by other recentevidences. spatially-resolved studies of stellar populations are also crucialto connect distinct components within galaxies to spatial structures seen inother wavelengths or parameters. stellar populations in the faint outerenvelopes of early-type galaxies are a formidable frontier for observers, butpromise to put constraints on the ratio of accreted stellar mass versus thatformed 'in situ' - a key feature of recent galaxy formation models. galaxyenvironment appears to play a key role in controlling the stellar populationproperties of low mass galaxies. simulations remind us, however, that currentday galaxies are the product of a complex assembly and environment history,which gives rise to the trends we see. this has strong implications for ourinterpretation of environmental trends.

1212.2288	the atlas3d project - xxii. low-efficiency star formation in early-type  galaxies: hydrodynamic models and observations	we study the global efficiency of star formation in high resolutionhydrodynamical simulations of gas discs embedded in isolated early-type andspiral galaxies. despite using a universal local law to form stars in thesimulations, we find that the early-type galaxies are offset from the spiralson the large-scale kennicutt relation, and form stars 2 to 5 times lessefficiently. this offset is in agreement with previous results on morphologicalquenching: gas discs are more stable against star formation when embedded inearly-type galaxies due to the lower disc self-gravity and increased shear. asa result, these gas discs do not fragment into dense clumps and do not reach ashigh densities as in the spiral galaxies. even if some molecular gas ispresent, the fraction of very dense gas (above 10^4 cm-3) is significantlyreduced, which explains the overall lower star formation efficiency. we alsoanalyse a sample of local early-type and spiral galaxies, measuring their coand hi surface densities and their star formation rates as determined by theirnon-stellar 8um emission. as predicted by the simulations, we find that theearly-type galaxies are offset from the kennicutt relation compared to thespirals, with a twice lower efficiency. finally, we validate our approach byperforming a direct comparison between models and observations. we run asimulation designed to mimic the stellar and gaseous properties of ngc524, alenticular galaxy, and find a gas disc structure and global star formation ratein good agreement with the observations. morphological quenching thus seems tobe a robust mechanism, and is also consistent with other observations of areduced star formation efficiency in early-type galaxies in the cold gasssurvey. this lower efficiency of star formation is not enough to explain theformation of the whole red sequence, but can contribute to the reddening ofsome galaxies.

1301.2589	the atlas3d project - xix. the hot-gas content of early-type galaxies:  fast versus slow rotators	for early-type galaxies, the ability to sustain a corona of hot, x-rayemitting gas could have played a key role in quenching their star-formationhistory. yet, it is still unclear what drives the precise amount of hot gasaround these galaxies. by combining photometric and spectroscopic measurementsfor the early-type galaxies observed during the atlas3d integral-field surveywith measurements of their x-ray luminosity based on x-ray data of both low andhigh spatial resolution we conclude that the hot-gas content of early-typegalaxies can depend on their dynamical structure. specifically, whereas slowrotators generally have x-ray halos with luminosity l_x,gas and temperature tvalues that are in line with what is expected if the hot-gas emission issustained by the thermalisaton of the kinetic energy carried by thestellar-mass loss material, fast rotators tend to display l_x,gas values thatfall consistently below the prediction of this model, with similar t valuesthat do not scale with the stellar kinetic energy as observed in the case ofslow rotators. considering that fast rotators are likely to be intrinsicallyflatter than slow rotators, and that the few l_x,gas-deficient slow rotatorsalso happen to be relatively flat, the observed l_x,gas deficiency in theseobjects would support the hypothesis whereby flatter galaxies have a hardertime in retaining their hot gas. we discuss the implications that a differenthot-gas content could have on the fate of both acquired and internally-producedgaseous material, considering in particular how the l_x,gas deficiency of fastrotators would make them more capable to recycle the stellar-mass loss materialinto new stars than slow rotators. this is consistent with the finding thatmolecular gas and young stars are detected only in fast rotators in the atlas3dsample, and that fast rotators tend to dustier than slow rotators.

(2012) confirm thationized gas emission in the system originate from a shock. galaxies with k+aspectra and shock-like ionized gas line ratios may comprise an important,overlooked segment of the post-starburst population, containing exactly thoseobjects in which the agn is actively expelling the star-forming material. whileagn activity is not the likely driver of the post-starburst event that occurred500 myr ago, the faint spiral structure seen in the hubble space telescope(hst) wide-field camera 3 (wfc3) y-, j- and h-band imaging seems to point tothe possibility of gravitational torques being the culprit. if the moleculargas were driven into the center at the same time as the larger scale galaxydisk underwent quenching, the agn might be able to sustain the presence ofmolecular gas for $\gtrsim 1$ gyr by cyclically injecting turbulent kineticenergy into the dense molecular gas via a radio jet, inhibiting star formation.

1403.0626	identification of old tidal dwarfs near early-type galaxies from deep  imaging and hi observations	it has recently been proposed that the dwarf spheroidal galaxies located inthe local group disks of satellites (doss) may be tidal dwarf galaxies (tdgs)born in a major merger at least 5 gyr ago. whether tdgs can live that long isstill poorly constrained by observations. as part of deep optical and hisurveys with the cfht megacam camera and westerbork synthesis radio telescopemade within the atlas3d project, and follow-up spectroscopic observations withthe gemini-north telescope, we have discovered old tdg candidates aroundseveral early-type galaxies. at least one of them has an oxygen abundance closeto solar, as expected for a tidal origin. this confirmed pre-enriched object islocated within the gigantic, but very low surface brightness, tidal tail thatemanates from the elliptical galaxy, ngc 5557. an age of 4 gyr estimated fromits sed fitting makes it the oldest securely identified tdg ever found so far.we investigated the structural and gaseous properties of the tdg and of acompanion located in the same collisional debris, and thus most likely of tidalorigin as well. despite several gyr of evolution close to their parentgalaxies, they kept a large gas reservoir. their central surface brightness islow and their effective radius much larger than that of typical dwarf galaxiesof the same mass. this possibly provides us with criteria to identify tidalobjects which can be more easily checked than the traditional ones requiringdeep spectroscopic observations. in view of the above, we discuss the survivaltime of tdgs and question the tidal origin of the doss.

1403.4850	the atlas3d project - xxviii. dynamically-driven star formation  suppression in early-type galaxies	we present measurements of the star formation rate (sfr) in the early-typegalaxies (etgs) of the atlas3d sample, based on wide-field infrared surveyexplorer (wise) 22um and galaxy evolution explorer (galex) far-ultravioletemission. we combine these with gas masses estimated from 12co and hi data inorder to investigate the star formation efficiency (sfe) in a larger sample ofetgs than previously available. we first recalibrate (based on wise data) therelation between old stellar populations (traced at ks-band) and 22umluminosity, allowing us to remove the contribution of 22um emission fromcircumstellar dust. we then go on to investigate the position of etgs on thekennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation. molecular gas-rich etgs have comparable starformation surface densities to normal spiral galaxy centres, but they liesystematically offset from the ks relation, having lower star formationefficiencies by a factor of ~2.5 (in agreement with other authors). this effectis driven by galaxies where a substantial fraction of the molecular material isin the rising part of the rotation curve, and shear is high. we show here forthe first time that although the number of stars formed per unit gas mass perunit time is lower in etgs, it seems that the amount of stars formed perfree-fall time is approximately constant. the scatter around this dynamicalrelation still correlates with galaxy properties such as the shape of thepotential in the inner regions. this leads us to suggest that dynamicalproperties (such as shear or the global stability of the gas) may be importantsecond parameters that regulate star formation and cause much of the scatteraround star-formation relations.

1410.0981	the atlas3d project -- xxix. the new look of early-type galaxies and  surrounding fields disclosed by extremely deep optical images	galactic archeology based on star counts is instrumental to reconstruct thepast mass assembly of local group galaxies. the development of new observingtechniques and data-reduction, coupled with the use of sensitive large field ofview cameras, now allows us to pursue this technique in more distant galaxiesexploiting their diffuse low surface brightness (lsb) light. as part of theatlas3d project, we have obtained with the megacam camera at the canada-francehawaii telescope extremely deep, multi--band, images of nearby early-typegalaxies. we present here a catalog of 92 galaxies from the atlas3d sample,that are located in low to medium density environments. the observing strategyand data reduction pipeline, that achieve a gain of several magnitudes in thelimiting surface brightness with respect to classical imaging surveys, arepresented. the size and depth of the survey is compared to other recent deepimaging projects. the paper highlights the capability of lsb--optimized surveysat detecting new prominent structures that change the apparent morphology ofgalaxies. the intrinsic limitations of deep imaging observations are alsodiscussed, among those, the contamination of the stellar halos of galaxies byextended ghost reflections, and the cirrus emission from galactic dust. thedetection and systematic census of fine structures that trace the present andpast mass assembly of etgs is one of the prime goals of the project. we providespecific examples of each type of observed structures -- tidal tails, stellarstreams and shells --, and explain how they were identified and classified. wegive an overview of the initial results. the detailed statistical analysis willbe presented in future papers.

1412.1482	overview of the sdss-iv manga survey: mapping nearby galaxies at apache  point observatory	we present an overview of a new integral field spectroscopic survey calledmanga (mapping nearby galaxies at apache point observatory), one of three coreprograms in the fourth-generation sloan digital sky survey (sdss-iv) that beganon 2014 july 1. manga will investigate the internal kinematic structure andcomposition of gas and stars in an unprecedented sample of 10,000 nearbygalaxies. we summarize essential characteristics of the instrument and surveydesign in the context of manga's key science goals and present prototypeobservations to demonstrate manga's scientific potential. manga employsdithered observations with 17 fiber-bundle integral field units that vary indiameter from 12" (19 fibers) to 32" (127 fibers). two dual-channelspectrographs provide simultaneous wavelength coverage over 3600-10300 a atr~2000. with a typical integration time of 3 hr, manga reaches a target r-bandsignal-to-noise ratio of 4-8 (per a, per 2" fiber) at 23 ab mag per sq. arcsec,which is typical for the outskirts of manga galaxies. targets are selected withstellar mass greater than 1e9 msun using sdss-i redshifts and i-band luminosityto achieve uniform radial coverage in terms of the effective radius, anapproximately flat distribution in stellar mass, and a sample spanning a widerange of environments. analysis of our prototype observations demonstratesmanga's ability to probe gas ionization, shed light on recent star formationand quenching, enable dynamical modeling, decompose constituent components, andmap the composition of stellar populations. manga's spatially resolved spectrawill enable an unprecedented study of the astrophysics of nearby galaxies inthe coming 6 yr.

1501.03723	the atlas3d project - xxx. star formation histories and stellar  population scaling relations of early-type galaxies	we present the stellar population content of early-type galaxies from theatlas3d survey. using spectra integrated within apertures covering up to oneeffective radius, we apply two methods: one based on measuring line-strengthindices and applying single stellar population (ssp) models to derivessp-equivalent values of stellar age, metallicity, and alpha enhancement; andone based on spectral fitting to derive non-parametric star-formationhistories, mass-weighted average values of age, metallicity, and half-massformation timescales. using homogeneously derived effective radii anddynamically-determined galaxy masses, we present the distribution of stellarpopulation parameters on the mass plane (m_jam, sigma_e, r_maj), showing thatat fixed mass, compact early-type galaxies are on average older, moremetal-rich, and more alpha-enhanced than their larger counterparts.  from non-parametric star-formation histories, we find that the duration ofstar formation is systematically more extended in lower mass objects. assumingthat our sample represents most of the stellar content of today's localuniverse, approximately 50% of all stars formed within the first 2 gyrfollowing the big bang. most of these stars reside today in the most massivegalaxies (&gt;10^10.5 m_sun), which themselves formed 90% of their stars by z~2.the lower-mass objects, in contrast, have formed barely half their stars inthis time interval. stellar population properties are independent ofenvironment over two orders of magnitude in local density, varying only withgalaxy mass. in the highest-density regions of our volume (dominated by thevirgo cluster), galaxies are older, alpha-enhanced and have shorterstar-formation histories with respect to lower density regions.

1503.01465	the accretion histories of brightest cluster galaxies from their stellar  population gradients	we analyse the spatially-resolved stellar populations of 9 local ($z&lt;0.1$)brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) observed with vimos in ifu mode. our sampleis composed of 7 slow-rotating and 2 fast-rotating bcgs. we do not find aconnection between stellar kinematics and stellar populations in this smallsample. the bcgs have shallow metallicity gradients (median $\delta$[fe/h] $=-0.11\pm0.1$), high central metallicities (median $[$fe/h]$_{[\alpha/fe]=0} =0.13\pm0.07$), and a wide range of central ages (from 5 to 15 gyr). we proposethat the reason for this is diverse evolutionary paths in bcgs. 67 per cent ofthe sample (6/9) show $\sim 7$ gyr old central ages, which reflects an activeaccretion history, and 33 per cent of the sample (3/9) have central ages olderthan 11 gyr, which suggest no star formation since $z=2$. the bcgs show similarcentral stellar populations and stellar population gradients to early-typegalaxies of similar mass (m$_{dyn}&gt; 10^{11.3}$m$_{\odot}$) from theatlas$^{3d}$ survey (median [z/h] $= 0.04\pm0.07$, $\delta$[z/h] $=-0.19\pm0.1$). however, massive early-type galaxies from atlas$^{3d}$ haveconsistently old ages (median age $=12.0\pm3.8$gyr). we also analyse the closemassive companion galaxies of two of the bcgs. these galaxies have similarstellar populations to their respective bcgs.

1504.03714	the next generation virgo cluster survey. xii. stellar populations and  kinematics of compact, low-mass early-type galaxies from gemini gmos-ifu  spectroscopy	we present gemini gmos-ifu data of eight compact low-mass early-type galaxies(etgs) in the virgo cluster. we analyse their stellar kinematics, stellarpopulation, and present two-dimensional maps of these properties covering thecentral 5"x 7" region. we find a large variety of kinematics: from non- tohighly-rotating objects, often associated with underlying disky isophotesrevealed by deep images from the next generation virgo cluster survey. in halfof our objects, we find a centrally-concentrated younger and more metal-richstellar population. we analyze the specific stellar angular momentum throughthe lambdar parameter and find six fast-rotators and two slow-rotators, onehaving a thin counter-rotating disk. we compare the local galaxy density andstellar populations of our objects with those of 39 more extended low-massvirgo etgs from the smakced survey and 260 massive ($m&gt;10^{10}$\msun) etgs fromthe a3d sample. the compact low-mass etgs in our sample are located in highdensity regions, often close to a massive galaxy and have, on average, olderand more metal-rich stellar populations than less compact low-mass galaxies. wefind that the stellar population parameters follow lines of constant velocitydispersion in the mass-size plane, smoothly extending the comparable trendsfound for massive etgs. our study supports a scenario where low-mass compactetgs have experienced long-lived interactions with their environment, includingram-pressure stripping and gravitational tidal forces, that may be responsiblefor their compact nature.

1504.04218	the stellar spectral features of nearby galaxies in the near-infrared:  tracers of thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch stars?	we analyze the stellar absorption features in high signal-to-noise rationear-infrared (nir) spectra of the nuclear region of 12 nearby galaxies, mostlyspirals. the features detected in some or all of the galaxies in this sampleare the tio (0.843 $\mu$m\ and 0.886 $\mu$m), vo (1.048 $\mu$m), cn (1.1$\mu$m\ and 1.4 $\mu$m), h$\rm _2$o (1.4 $\mu$m\ and 1.9 $\mu$m) and co (1.6$\mu$m\ and 2.3 $\mu$m) bands. the c$\rm _2$ (1.17 $\mu$m\ and 1.76 $\mu$m)bands are generally weak or absent, although c$\rm _2$ (1.76 $\mu$m) may beweakly present in the mean galaxy spectrum. a deep feature near 0.93 $\mu$m,likely caused by cn, tio and/or zro, is also detected in all objects. fitting acombination of stellar spectra to the mean spectrum shows that the absorptionfeatures are produced by evolved stars: cool giants and supergiant stars in theearly- or thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (e-agb or tp-agb) phases.the high luminosity of tp-agb stars, and the appearance of vo and zro featuresin the data, suggest that tp-agb stars dominate these spectral features.however, a contribution from other evolved stars is also likely. comparisonwith evolutionary population synthesis models shows that models based onempirical libraries that predict relatively strong nir features provide a moreaccurate description of the data. however, none of the models tested accuratelyreproduces all of the features observed in the spectra. to do so, the modelswill need to not only improve the treatment of tp-agb stars, but also includegood quality spectra of red giant and e-agb stars. the uninterrupted wavelengthcoverage, high s/n, and quantity of features we present here will provide abenchmark for the next generation of models aiming to explain and predict thenir properties of galaxies.

1507.04358	measuring the mass of the central black hole in the bulgeless galaxy ngc  4395 from gas dynamical modeling	ngc 4395 is a bulgeless spiral galaxy, harboring one of the nearest knowntype 1 seyfert nuclei. although there is no consensus on the mass of itscentral engine, several estimates suggest it to be one of the lightest massiveblack holes (mbhs) known. we present the first direct dynamical measurement ofthe mass of this mbh from a combination of two-dimensional gas kinematic data,obtained with the adaptive optics assisted near infrared integral fieldspectrograph gemini/nifs, and high-resolution multiband photometric data fromhubble space telescope's wide field camera 3 (hst/wfc3). we use the photometricdata to model the shape and stellar mass-to-light ratio (m/l) of the nuclearstar cluster. from the gemini/nifs observations, we derive the kinematics ofwarm molecular hydrogen gas as traced by emission through the h$_2$ 1--0 s(1)transition. these kinematics show a clear rotational signal, with a positionangle orthogonal to ngc 4395's radio jet. our best fitting tilted ring modelsof the kinematics of the molecular hydrogen gas contain a black hole with mass$m=4_{-3}^{+8}\times 10^5$ m$_\odot$ (3$\sigma$ uncertainties) embedded in anuclear star cluster of mass $m=2 \times 10^6$ m$_\odot$. our black hole massmeasurement is in excellent agreement with the reverberation mapping massestimate of peterson et al. (2005), but shows some tension with other massmeasurement methods based on accretion signals.

1509.05236	the hi tully-fisher relation of early-type galaxies	we study the hi k-band tully-fisher relation and the baryonic tully-fisherrelation for a sample of 16 early-type galaxies, taken from the atlas3d sample,which all have very regular hi disks extending well beyond the optical body (&gt;5 r_eff). we use the kinematics of these disks to estimate the circularvelocity at large radii for these galaxies. we find that the tully-fisherrelation for our early-type galaxies is offset by about 0.5-0.7 magnitudes fromthe relation for spiral galaxies. the residuals with respect to the spiraltully-fisher relation correlate with estimates of the stellar mass-to-lightratio, suggesting that the offset between the relations is mainly driven bydifferences in stellar populations. we also observe a small offset between ourtully-fisher relation with the relation derived for the atlas3d sample based onco data representing the galaxies' inner regions (&lt; 1 r_eff). this indicatesthat the circular velocities at large radii are systematically 10% lower thanthose near 0.5-1 r_eff, in line with recent determinations of the shape of themass profile of early-type galaxies. the baryonic tully-fisher relation of oursample is distinctly tighter than the standard one, in particular when usingmass-to-light ratios based on dynamical models of the stellar kinematics. wefind that the early-type galaxies fall on the spiral baryonic tully-fisherrelation if one assumes m/l_k = 0.54 m_sun/l_sun for the stellar populations ofthe spirals, a value similar to that found by recent studies of the dynamics ofspiral galaxies. such a mass-to-light ratio for spiral galaxies would implythat their disks are 60-70% of maximal. our analysis increases the range ofgalaxy morphologies for which the baryonic tully-fisher relations holds,strengthening previous claims that it is a more fundamental scaling relationthan the classical tully-fisher relation.

0807.1505	the sauron project - xii. kinematic substructures in early-type  galaxies: evidence for disks in fast rotators	[abridged] we analysed two-dimensional maps of 48 early-type galaxiesobtained with the sauron and oasis integral-field spectrographs usingkinemetry, a generalisation of surface photometry to the higher order momentsof the line-of-sight velocity distribution (losvd). in the sauron sample, wefind that 31% of early-type galaxies are single component systems. 91% of themulti-components systems have two kinematic subcomponents, the rest havingthree. in addition, 29% of galaxies have kinematically decoupled components,nuclear components with significant kinematic twists. we find that the velocitymaps of fast rotators closely resemble those of inclined disks, except in thetransition regions between kinematic subcomponents. in terms of e/s0classification, this means that 74% of es and 92% of s0s have components withdisk-like kinematics. for the majority of fast rotators, the kinematic axialratios are equal to or less than their photometric axial ratios, contrary towhat is predicted with isotropic jeans models viewed at different inclinations.the position angles of fast rotators are constant, while they vary abruptly inslow rotators. velocity dispersion maps of face-on galaxies have shapes similarto the distribution of light. we constructed local (bin-by-bin) h3 - v/sigmaand h4 - v/sigma diagrams from sauron observations. we confirm the classicalanti-correlation of h3 and v\sigma, but we also find that h3 is almost zero insome objects or even weakly correlated with v/sigma. the distribution of h4 forfast and slow rotators is mildly positive on average. the difference betweenslow and fast rotators is traceable throughout all moments of the losvd, withevidence for different intrinsic shapes and orbital contents and, hence, likelydifferent evolutionary paths.

0807.4175	the einstein cross: constraint on dark matter from stellar dynamics and  gravitational lensing	[abridged] we present two-dimensional line-of-sight stellar kinematics of thelens galaxy in the einstein cross, obtained with the gemini 8m telescope, usingthe gmos integral-field spectrograph. the velocity map shows regular rotationup to ~100 km/s around the minor axis of the bulge, consistent withaxisymmetry. the velocity dispersion map shows a weak gradient increasingtowards a central (r&lt;1") value of sigma_0=170+/-9 km/s. we deproject theobserved surface brightness from hst imaging to obtain a realistic luminositydensity of the lens galaxy, which in turn is used to build axisymmetricdynamical models that fit the observed kinematic maps. we also construct agravitational lens model that accurately fits the positions and relative fluxesof the four quasar images. we find that the resulting luminous and total massdistribution are nearly identical around the einstein radius r_e = 0.89", witha slope that is close to isothermal, but which becomes shallower towards thecenter if indeed mass follows light. the dynamical model fits to the observedkinematic maps result in a total mass-to-light ratio (m/l)_dyn=3.7+/-0.5m_sun/l_sun,i (in the i-band). this is consistent with the einstein mass m_e =1.54 x 10^10 m_sun divided by the (projected) luminosity within r_e, whichyields a total mass-to-light ratio of (m/l)_e=3.4 m_sun/l_sun,i, with an errorof at most a few per cent. we estimate from stellar populations model fits tocolors of the lens galaxy a stellar mass-to-light ratio (m/l)_* from 2.8 to 4.1m_sun/l_sun,i. although a constant dark matter fraction of 20 per cent is notexcluded, dark matter may play no significant role in the bulge of this ~l*early-type spiral galaxy.

astro-ph;0412186	dynamical modelling of stars and gas in ngc2974: determination of  mass-to-light ratio, inclination and orbital structure by schwarzschild's  method	we study the large-scale stellar and gaseous kinematics of the e4 galaxyngc2974, based on panoramic integral-field data obtained with sauron. wequantify the velocity fields with fourier methods (kinemetry), and show thatthe large-scale kinematics is largely consistent with axisymmetry. we constructgeneral axisymmetric dynamical models for the stellar motions usingschwarzschild's orbit-superposition method, and compare the inferredinclination and mass-to-light ratio with the values obtained by modelling thegas kinematics. both approaches give consistent results. however we find thatthe stellar models provide fairly weak constraints on the inclination. theintrinsic orbital distribution of ngc2974, which we infer from our model, ischaracterised by a large-scale stellar component of high angular momentum. wecreate semi-analytic test models, resembling ngc2974, to study the ability ofschwarzschild's modelling technique to recover the given input parameters(mass-to-light ratio and inclination) and the distribution function. we alsotest the influence of a limited spatial coverage on the recovery of thedistribution function (i.e. the orbital structure). we find that the models canaccurately recover the input mass-to-light ratio, but we confirm that even withperfect input kinematics the inclination is only marginally constrained. thissuggests a possible degeneracy in the determination of the inclination, butfurther investigations are needed to clarify this issue. for a given potential,we find that the analytic distribution function of our test model is wellrecovered by the three-integral model within the spatial region constrained byintegral-field kinematics.

astro-ph;0602318	young kinematically decoupled components in early-type galaxies	we present results from a series of follow-up observations of a sub-sample ofthe representative sauron survey elliptical (e) and lenticular (s0) galaxiesusing the oasis integral-field spectrograph. these observations focus on thecentral 10" x 10", with roughly double the spatial resolution of the sauronobservations. this increased spatial resolution reveals a number of interestingand previously unresolved features in the measured stellar kinematics andabsorption-line strengths. we find that galaxies exhibiting the youngest globalstellar populations (as measured with sauron) often contain a distinctly youngcentral region (on scales of a few hundred parsec or less) compared to the restof the galaxy. moreover, these compact, young components are found to be mostlycounter-rotating with respect to the rest of the galaxy. given that there is nowell-established reason for such young components to `prefer' counter- overco-rotation, this finding raises the following questions: how common are thesesmall kdcs as a function of age? why are there more young than old compactkdcs? where are the equivalent co-rotating components? we explore thesequestions using simple simulated velocity fields and stellar population models,and find that the fading of the young component as it evolves, coupled with thefact that counter-rotating components are more easily detected in the velocityfield, may help explain the observed trends.

astro-ph;0605479	the black hole in ngc 3379: a comparison of gas and stellar dynamical  mass measurements with hst and integral-field data	we combine hubble space telescope spectroscopy and ground-basedintegral-field data from the sauron and oasis instruments to study the centralblack hole in the nearby elliptical galaxy ngc 3379. from these data, we obtainkinematics of both the stars and the nuclear gaseous component. axisymmetricthree-integral models of the stellar kinematics find a black hole of mass 1.4(+2.6 / -1.0) x 10^8 m_sun (3 sigma errors). these models also probe thevelocity distribution in the immediate vicinity of the black hole and reveal anearly isotropic velocity distribution throughout the galaxy and down to theblack hole sphere of influence r_bh. the morphology of the nuclear gas discsuggests that it is not in the equatorial plane; however the core of ngc 3379is nearly spherical. inclined thin-disc models of the gas find a nominal blackhole of mass 2.0 (+/- 0.1) x 10^8 m_sun (3 sigma errors), but the model is apoor fit to the kinematics. the data are better fit by introducing a twist inthe gas kinematics (with the black hole mass assumed to be 2.0 x 10^8 m_sun),although the constraints on the nature and shape of this perturbation areinsufficient for more detailed modelling. given the apparent regularity of thegas disc's appearance, the presence of such strong non-circular motionindicates that caution must be used when measuring black hole masses with gasdynamical methods alone.
