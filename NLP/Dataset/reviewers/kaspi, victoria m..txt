0901.2119	x-ray and radio timing of the pulsar in 3c 58	we present timing data spanning 6.4 yr for the young and energetic psrj0205+6449, in the supernova remnant 3c 58. data were obtained with the rossix-ray timing explorer, the jodrell bank observatory and the green banktelescope. we present phase-coherent timing analyses showing timing noise andtwo spin-up glitches with fractional frequency increases of ~3.4e-7 near mjd52555, and ~3.8e-6 between mjds 52777 and 53062. these glitches are unusuallylarge if the pulsar was created in the historical supernova in 1181 as has beensuggested. for the x-ray timing we developed a new unbinned maximum-likelihoodmethod for determining pulse arrival times which performs significantly betterthan the traditional binned techniques. in addition, we present an x-ray pulseprofile analysis of four years of rxte data showing that the pulsar is detectedup to ~40 kev. we also present the first measurement of the phase offsetbetween the radio and x-ray pulse for this source, showing that the radio pulseleads the x-ray pulse by phi=0.10+/-0.01 in phase. we compile all knownmeasurements of the phase offsets between radio and x-ray and radio andgamma-ray pulses for x-ray and gamma-ray pulsars. we show that there is norelationship between pulse period and phase offset, supported by ourmeasurement of the phase offset for psr j0205+6449.

0905.1256	the 2006-2007 active phase of anomalous x-ray pulsar 4u 0142+61:  radiative and timing changes, bursts, and burst spectral features	after at least 6 years of quiescence, anomalous x-ray pulsar (axp) 4u 0142+61entered an active phase in 2006 march that lasted several months and includedsix x-ray bursts as well as many changes in the persistent x-ray emission. thebursts, the first seen from this axp in &gt;11 years of rossi x-ray timingexplorer monitoring, all occurred in the interval between 2006 april 6 and 2007february 7. the burst durations ranged from 0.4-1.8\times103 s. the first fiveburst spectra are well modeled by blackbodies, with temperatures kt ~ 2-9 kev.however, the sixth burst had a complicated spectrum that is well characterizedby a blackbody plus two emission features whose amplitude varied throughout theburst. the most prominent feature was at 14.0 kev. upon entry into the activephase the pulsar showed a significant change in pulse morphology and a likelytiming glitch. the glitch had a total frequency jump of (1.9\pm0.4)\times10-7hz, which recovered with a decay time of 17\pm 2 days by more than the initialjump, implying a net spin-down of the pulsar. within the framework of themagnetar model, the net spin-down of the star could be explained by regions ofthe superfluid that rotate slower than the rest. the bursts, flux enhancements,and pulse morphology changes can be explained as arising from crustaldeformations due to stresses imposed by the highly twisted internal magneticfield. however, unlike other axp outbursts, we cannot account for a major twistbeing implanted in the magnetosphere.

0905.3899	sdss j102347.6+003841: a millisecond radio pulsar binary that had a hot  disk during 2000-2001	the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) source j102347.6+003841 was recentlyrevealed to be a binary 1.69 millisecond radio pulsar with a 4.75 hr orbitalperiod and a ~0.2 m_sun companion. here we analyze the sdss spectrum of thesource in detail. the spectrum was taken on 2001 february 1, when the sourcewas in a bright state and showed broad, double-peaked hydrogen and helium lines-- dramatically different from the g-type absorption spectrum seen from 2003onward. the lines are consistent with emission from a disk around the compactprimary. we derive properties of the disk by fitting the sdss continuum with asimple disk model, and find a temperature range of 2000--34000 k from the outerto inner edge of the disk. the disk inner and outer radii were approximately10^9 and 5.7x10^10 cm, respectively. these results further emphasize the uniquefeature of the source: it is likely a system at the end of its transition froman x-ray binary to a recycled radio pulsar. the disk mass is estimated to havebeen ~10^23 g, most of which would have been lost due to pulsar wind ablation(or due to the propeller effect if the disk had extended inside the lightcylinder of the pulsar) before the final disk disruption event. the systemcould undergo repeated episodes of disk formation. close monitoring of thesource is needed to catch the system in its bright state again, so that thisunusual example of a pulsar-disk interaction can be studied in much finerdetail

0706.4156	glitches in anomalous x-ray pulsars	(abridged) we report on 8.7 and 7.6 yr of rxte observations of the anomalousx-ray pulsars (axps) rxs j170849.0-400910 and 1e 1841-045, respectively. theseobservations, part of a larger rxte axp monitoring program, have allowed us tostudy the long-term timing, pulsed flux, and pulse profile evolution of theseobjects. we report on four new glitches, one from rxs j170849.0-400910 andthree from 1e 1841-045. with nearly all known persistent axps now seen toglitch, such behavior is clearly generic to this source class. we show that interms of fractional frequency change, axps are among the most activelyglitching neutron stars. however, in terms of absolute glitch amplitude, axpglitches are unremarkable. we show that the largest axp glitches observed thusfar have recoveries that are unusual among those of radio pulsar glitches, withthe combination of recovery time scale and fraction yielding changes inspin-down rates following the glitch similar to, or larger than, the long-termaverage. we also observed a large long-term fractional increase in themagnitude of the spin-down rate of 1e 1841-045 following its largest glitch.these observations are challenging to interpret in standard glitch models, asis the frequent occurence of large glitches given axps' high measuredtemperatures. we speculate that the stellar core may be involved in the largestaxp glitches. furthermore, we show that axp glitches appear to fall in twoclasses: radiatively loud and radiatively quiet. the latter, of which theglitches of j170849.0-400910 and 1e 1841-045 are examples, show little evidencefor an accompanying radiative event. we also show, however, that pulse profileand pulsed flux changes are common in these axps, but do not apprear closelycorrelated with any timing behavior.

0707.2093	x-ray and near-ir variability of the anomalous x-ray pulsar 1e  1048.1-5937: from quiescence back to activity	(abridged) we report on new and archival x-ray and near-infrared observationsof the anomalous x-ray pulsar 1e 1048.1-5937 performed between 2001-2007 withrxte, cxo, swift, hst, and vlt. during its ~2001-2004 active period, 1e1048.-5937 exhibited two large, long-term x-ray pulsed-flux flares as well asshort bursts, and large (&gt;10x) torque changes. monitoring with rxte revealedthat the source entered a phase of timing stability in 2004; at the same time,a series of four simultaneous observations with cxo and hst in 2006 showed thatits x-ray flux and spectrum and near-ir flux, all variable prior to 2005,stabilized. the near-ir flux, when detected by hst (h~22.7 mag) and vlt(k_s~21.0 mag), was considerably fainter than previously measured. recently, in2007 march, this newfound quiescence was interrupted by a sudden fluxenhancement, x-ray spectral changes and a pulse morphology change, simultaneouswith a large spin-up glitch and near-ir enhancement. our rxte observationsrevealed a sudden pulsed flux increase by a factor of ~3 in the 2-10 kev band.in observations with cxo and swift, we found that the total x-ray fluxincreased much more than the pulsed flux, reaching a peak value of &gt;7 times thequiescent value (2-10 kev). with these recent data, we find a stronganti-correlation between x-ray flux and pulsed fraction, and a correlationbetween x-ray spectral hardness and flux. simultaneously with the radiative andtiming changes, we observed a significant x-ray pulse morphology change suchthat the profile went from nearly sinusoidal to having multiple peaks. wecompare these remarkable events with other axp outbursts and discussimplications in the context of the magnetar model and other models of axpemission.

1001.3847	on the x-ray spectra of anomalous x-ray pulsars and soft gamma repeaters	we revisit the apparent correlation between soft x-ray band photon index andspin-down rate nudot previously reported for anomalous x-ray pulsars (axps) andsoft gamma repeaters (sgrs) by marsden &amp; white (2001). our analysis, improvedthanks to new source discoveries, better spectral parameter measurements inpreviously known sources, and the requirement of source quiescence forparameter inclusion, shows evidence for the previously noted trend, althoughwith greater scatter. this trend supports the twisted magnetosphere model ofmagnetars although the scatter suggests that factors other than nudot are alsoimportant. we also note possible correlations involving the spectra of axps andsgrs in the hard x-ray band. specifically, the hard-band photon index shows apossible correlation with inferred nudot and b, as does the degree of spectralturnover. if the former trend is correct, then the hard-band photon index foraxp 1e 1048.1-5937 should be ~0--1. this may be testable with long integrationsby integral, or by the upcoming focussing hard x-ray mission nustar.

1110.1312	long-term x-ray monitoring of the young pulsar psr b1509-58	it has long been thought that the pulsed x-ray properties of rotation-poweredpulsars are stable on long time scales. however, long-term, systematic studiesof individual sources have been lacking. furthermore, dramatic x-rayvariability has now been observed from two pulsars having inferred sub-criticaldipole magnetic fields. here we present an analysis of the long-term pulsedx-ray properties of the young, energetic pulsar psr b1509-58 using data fromthe rossi x-ray timing explorer. we measured the 2-50 kev pulsed flux for 14.7yr of x-ray observations and found that it is consistent with being constant onall relevant time scales, and place a 3 sigma upper limit on day-to-weekvariability of &lt;28%. in addition, we searched for magnetar-like x-ray bursts inall observations and found none, which we use to constrain the measurable burstrate to less than one per 750 ks of observations. we also searched forvariability in the pulse profile and found that it is consistent with beingstable on time scales of days to decades. this supports the hypothesis thatx-ray properties of rotation-powered x-ray pulsars can be stable on decade-longtime scales. in addition, we extend the existing timing solution by 7.1 yr to atotal of 28.4 yr and report updated values of the braking index,n=2.832+/-0.003 and the second braking index, m=17.6+/-1.9.

1310.6221	nustar observations of magnetar 1e 1841-045	we report new spectral and temporal observations of the magnetar 1e 1841-045in the kes 73 supernova remnant obtained with the nuclear spectroscopictelescope array (nustar). combined with new swift and archival xmm-newton andchandra observations, the phase-averaged spectrum is well characterized by ablackbody plus double power-law model, in agreement with previous,multi-mission x-ray results. however, we are unable to reproduce the spectralresults reported using suzaku observations. the pulsed fraction of the sourceis found to increase with photon energy. the measured rms pulsed fraction is~12% and ~17% at ~20 kev and ~50 kev, respectively. we detect a new feature inthe 24--35 kev band pulse profile that is uniquely double-peaked. this featuremay be associated with a possible absorption or emission feature in thephase-resolved spectrum. we fit the x-ray data using the recently developedelectron-positron outflow model of beloborodov (2013) for the hard x-rayemission from magnetars. this produces a satisfactory fit allowing a constrainton the angle between the rotation and magnetic axes of the neutron star of ~20degrees and on the angle between the rotation axis and line-of-sight of ~50degrees. in this model, the soft x-ray component is inconsistent with a singleblackbody; adding a second blackbody or a power-law component fits the data.the two-blackbody interpretation suggests a hot spot of temperature kt~0.9 kevoccupying ~1% of the stellar surface.

1311.5161	long-term radio timing observations of the transition millisecond pulsar  psr~j1023+0038	the radio millisecond pulsar psr j1023+0038 exhibits complex timing andeclipse behavior. here we analyze four years' worth of radio monitoringobservations of this object. we obtain a long-term timing solution, albeit withlarge residual timing errors as a result of apparent orbital period variations.we also observe variable eclipses when the companion passes near our line ofsight, excess dispersion measure near the eclipses and at random orbitalphases, and short-term disappearances of signal at random orbital phases. weinterpret the eclipses as possibly due to material in the companion'smagnetosphere supported by magnetic pressure, and the orbital period variationsas possibly due to a gravitational quadrupole coupling mechanism. both of thesemechanisms would be the result of magnetic activity in the companion, inconflict with evolutionary models that predict it should be fully convectiveand hence non-magnetic. we also use our timing data to test for orbital androtational modulation of the system's $\gamma$-ray emission, finding noevidence for orbital modulation and $3.7\sigma$ evidence for modulation at thepulsar period. the energetics of the system make it plausible that the$\gamma$-ray emission we observe is entirely from the millisecond pulsaritself, but it seems unlikely for these $\gamma$-rays to provide theirradiation of the companion, which we attribute instead to x-ray heating froma shock powered by a particle wind.

1312.5039	nustar and swift observations of the fast rotating magnetized white  dwarf ae aquarii	ae aquarii is a cataclysmic variable with the fastest known rotatingmagnetized white dwarf (p_spin = 33.08 s). compared to many intermediatepolars, ae aquarii shows a soft x-ray spectrum with a very low luminosity (l_x~ 10^{31} erg/s). we have analyzed overlapping observations of this system withthe nustar and the swift x-ray observatories in september of 2012. we find the0.5-30 kev spectra to be well fitted by either an optically thin thermal plasmamodel with three temperatures of 0.75 +0.18 -0.45, 2.29 +0.96 -0.82, and 9.33+6.07 -2.18 kev, or an optically thin thermal plasma model with twotemperatures of 1.00 +0.34 -0.23 and 4.64 +1.58 -0.84 kev plus a power-lawcomponent with photon index of 2.50 +0.17 -0.23. the pulse profile in the 3-20kev band is broad and approximately sinusoidal, with a pulsed fraction of 16.6+/- 2.3%. we do not find any evidence for a previously reported sharp featurein the pulse profile.

1401.3085	16 years of rxte monitoring of five anomalous x-ray pulsars	we present a summary of the long-term evolution of various properties of thefive non-transient anomalous x-ray pulsars (axps) 1e 1841-045, rxsj170849.0-400910, 1e 2259+586, 4u 0142+61, and 1e 1048.1-5937, regularlymonitored with rxte from 1996 to 2012. we focus on three properties of thesesources: the evolution of the timing, pulsed flux, and pulse profile. we reportseveral new timing anomalies and radiative events, including a putativeanti-glitch seen in 1e 2259+586 in 2009, and a second epoch of very largespin-down rate fluctuations in 1e 1048.1-5937 following a large flux outburst.we compile the properties of the 11 glitches and 4 glitch candidates observedfrom these 5 axps between 1996 and 2012. overall, these monitoring observationsreveal several apparent patterns in the behavior of this sample of axps: largeradiative changes in axps (including long-lived flux enhancements, shortbursts, and pulse profile changes) are rare, occurring typically only every fewyears per source; large radiative changes are almost always accompanied by someform of timing anomaly, usually a spin-up glitch; only 20-30% of timinganomalies are accompanied by any form of radiative change. we find that axpradiative behavior at the times of radiatively loud glitches is sufficientlysimilar to suggest common physical origins. the similarity in glitch propertieswhen comparing radiatively loud and radiatively silent glitches in axpssuggests a common physical origin in the stellar interior. finally, the overallsimilarity of axp and radio pulsar glitches suggests a common physical originfor both phenomena.

1402.1079	nustar results and future plans for magnetar and rotation-powered pulsar  observations	the nuclear spectroscopic telescope array (nustar) is the first focusing hardx-ray mission in orbit and operates in the 3-79 kev range. nustar's sensitivityis roughly two orders of magnitude better than previous missions in this energyband thanks to its superb angular resolution. since its launch in 2012 june,nustar has performed excellently and observed many interesting sourcesincluding four magnetars, two rotation-powered pulsars and the cataclysmicvariable ae aquarii. nustar also discovered 3.76-s pulsations from thetransient source sgr j1745-29 recently found by swift very close to thegalactic center, clearly identifying the source as a transient magnetar. formagnetar 1e 1841-045, we show that the spectrum is well fit by an absorbedblackbody plus broken power-law model with a hard power-law photon index of~1.3. this is consistent with previous results by integral and rxte. we alsofind an interesting double-peaked pulse profile in the 25-35 kev band. for aeaquarii, we show that the spectrum can be described by a multi-temperaturethermal model or a thermal plus non-thermal model; a multi-temperature thermalmodel without a non-thermal component cannot be ruled out. furthermore, we donot see a spiky pulse profile in the hard x-ray band, as previously reportedbased on suzaku observations. for other magnetars and rotation-powered pulsarsobserved with nustar, data analysis results will be soon available.

1408.1644	a broadband x-ray study of the geminga pulsar with nustar and xmm-newton	we report on the first hard x-ray detection of the geminga pulsar above 10kev using a 150 ks observation with the nustar observatory. the double-peakedpulse profile of non-thermal emission seen in the soft x-ray band persists athigher energies. broadband phase-integrated spectra over the 0.2-20 kev bandwith nustar and archival xmm-newton data do not fit to a conventionaltwo-component model of a blackbody plus power-law, but instead exhibit spectralhardening above ~5 kev. we find two spectral models fit the data well: (1) ablackbody (kt1 ~ 42 ev) with a broken power-law (gamma1 ~ 2.0, gamma2 ~ 1.4 andebreak ~ 3.4 kev), and (2) two blackbody components (kt1 ~ 44 ev and kt2 ~ 195ev) with a power-law component (gamma ~ 1.7). in both cases, the extrapolationof the rayleigh-jeans tail of the thermal component is consistent with the uvdata, while the non-thermal component overpredicts the near-infrared data,requiring a spectral flattening at e ~ 0.01 - 1 kev. while strong phasevariation of the power-law index is present below ~5 kev, our phase-resolvedspectroscopy with nustar indicates that another hard non-thermal component withgamma ~ 1.3 emerges above ~5 kev. the spectral hardening in non-thermal x-rayemission as well as spectral flattening between the optical and x-ray bandsargue against the conjecture that a single power-law may account formulti-wavelength non-thermal spectra of middle-aged pulsars.

1408.2740	constraining the evolutionary fate of central compact objects: "old"  radio pulsars in supernova remnants	central compact objects (ccos) constitute a population of radio-quiet,slowly-spinning ($\ge$100 ms) young neutron stars with anomalously high thermalx-ray luminosities. their spin-down properties imply weak dipole magneticfields ($\sim$$10^{10-11}$ g) and characteristic ages much greater than theages of their host supernova remnants (snrs). however, ccos may possess strong"hidden" internal magnetic fields that may re-emerge on timescales $\gtrsim$10kyr, with the neutron star possibly activating as a radio pulsar in theprocess. this suggests that the immediate descendants of ccos may bemasquerading as slowly spinning "old" radio pulsars. we present an x-ray surveyof all ordinary radio pulsars within 6 kpc that are positionally coincidentwith galactic snrs in order to test the possible connection between thesupposedly old, but possibly very young pulsars, and the snrs. none of thetargets exhibits anomalously high thermal x-ray luminosity, suggesting thatthey are genuine old ordinary pulsars unrelated to the superposed snrs. thisimplies that ccos are either latent radio pulsars that activate long aftertheir snrs dissipate or they remain permanently radio-quiet. the truedescendants of ccos remain at large.

1512.03957	the nustar view of the non-thermal emission from psr j0437-4715	we present a hard x-ray nustar observation of psr j0437-4715, the nearestmillisecond pulsar. the known pulsations at the apparent pulse period ~5.76 msare detected at energies up to 20 kev. we measure a photon index $\gamma=1.65\pm0.24$ (90% confidence) for the power law fit to the non-thermalemission. it had been shown that spectral models with two or three thermalcomponents fit the xmm-newton spectrum of psr j0437-4715, depending on theslope of the power-law component, and the amount of absorption of soft x-rays.the new constraint on the high-energy emission provided by nustar removesambiguities regarding the thermal components of the emission below 3 kev. weperformed a simultaneous spectral analysis of the xmm-newton and nustar data toconfirm that three thermal components and a power law are required to fit the0.3-20 kev emission of psr j0437-4715. adding a rosat-pspc spectrum furtherconfirmed this result and allowed us to better constrain the temperatures ofthe three thermal components. a phase-resolved analysis of the nustar datarevealed no significant change in the photon index of the high-energy emission.this nustar observation provides further impetus for future observations withthe nicer mission (neutron star interior composition explorer) whosesensitivity will provide much stricter constraints on the equation of state ofnuclear matter by combining model fits to the pulsar's phase-folded lightcurvewith the pulsar's well-defined mass and distance from radio timingobservations.

astro-ph;0105372	constraints on thermal emission models of anomalous x-ray pulsars	thermal emission from the surface of an ultramagnetic neutron star isbelieved to contribute significantly to the soft x-ray flux of the anomalousx-ray pulsars. we compare the detailed predictions of models of the surfaceemission from a magnetar to the observed properties of axps. in particular, wefocus on the combination of their luminosities and energy-dependent pulsedfractions. we use the results of recent calculations for strongly magnetizedatmospheres to obtain the angle- and energy-dependence of the surface emission.we include in our calculations the effects of general relativistic photontransport and interstellar extinction. we find that the combination of thelarge pulsed fractions and the high luminosities of axps cannot be accountedfor by surface emission from a magnetar with two antipodal hot regions or atemperature distribution characteristic of a magnetic dipole. this result isrobust for reasonable neutron star radii, for the range of magnetic fieldstrengths inferred from the observed spin down rates, and for surfacetemperatures consistent with the spectral properties of axps. models with asingle hot emitting region can reproduce the observations, provided that thedistance to one of the sources is ~30% less than the current best estimate, andallowing for systematic uncertainties in the spectral fit of a second source.finally, the thermal emission models with antipodal emission geometry predict acharacteristic strong increase of the pulsed fraction with photon energy, whichis apparently inconsistent with the current data. the energy-dependence of thepulsed fraction in the models with one hot region shows a wider range ofbehavior and can be consistent with the existing data. upcoming high-resolutionobservations with chandra and xmm-newton will provide a conclusive test.

astro-ph;0107422	long-term rxte monitoring of anomalous x-ray pulsars	we report on the long-term monitoring of three anomalous x-ray pulsars usingthe rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte). we present a phase-coherent timingephemeris for 4u 0142+61, and show that it has rotated with high stability over4.4 yr, with rms phase deviations of 7% of the pulse period from a simple fitincluding only $\nu$ and $\dot{\nu}$. we report on the continued timingstability of 1e 2259.1+586, for which phase coherence has now been maintainedover 4.5 yr, as well as on the detection of a significant $\ddot{\nu}$ in 1.4yr of monitoring of rxs j170849.0-400910, consistent with recovery following aglitch. we note a correlation in which timing stability in axps decreases withincreasing $\dot{\nu}$. the timing stability of soft gamma repeaters inquiescence is consistent with this trend, given their large spin-down rates.this trend is similar to one seen in radio pulsars, suggesting a connectionbetween the three populations. we find no large variability in pulse morphologyas a function of time. we present high signal-to-noise ratio average pulseprofiles for each axp, and consider them as a function of energy. we find avariety of different behaviors, and consider possible trends in the data. wealso find no large variations in pulsed flux, and set 1 $\sigma$ upper limitsof ~20-30% of the mean. assuming a constant pulsed fraction, either more thanone of the axps are coincidentally in a much more quiescent state during ourrxte monitoring than in the past, or past claims of large flux variations areincorrect.

0812.2815	an accurate determination of the optical periodic modulation in the  x-ray binary sax j1808.4-3658	we report on optical imaging of the x-ray binary sax j1808.4-3658 with the8-m gemini south telescope. the binary, containing an accretion-poweredmillisecond pulsar, appears to have a large periodic modulation in itsquiescent optical emission. in order to clarify the origin of this modulation,we obtained three time-resolved $r'$-band light curves (lcs) of the source infive days. the lcs can be described by a sinusoid, and the long time-spanbetween them allows us to determine optical period p=7251.9 s and phase 0.671at mjd 54599.0 (tdb; phase 0.0 corresponds to the ascending node of the pulsarorbit), with uncertainties of 2.8 s and 0.008 (90 % confidence), respectively.this periodicity is highly consistent with the x-ray orbital ephemeris. byconsidering this consistency and the sinusoidal shape of the lcs, we rule outthe possibility of the modulation arising from the accretion disk. our studysupports the previous suggestion that the x-ray pulsar becomes rotationallypowered in quiescence, with its energy output irradiating the companion star,causing the optical modulation. while it has also been suggested that theaccretion disk would be evaporated by the pulsar, we argue that the disk existsand gives rise to the persistent optical emission. the existence of the diskcan be verified by long-term, multi-wavelength optical monitoring of the sourcein quiescence, as an increasing flux and spectral changes from the source wouldbe expected based on the standard disk instability model.
