0906.3669	the origin of segue 1	we apply the optimal filter technique to sloan digital sky survey photometryaround segue 1 and find that the outer parts of the cluster are distorted.there is strong evidence for ~ 1 degree elongations of extra-tidal stars,extending both eastwards and southwestwards of the cluster. the extensions havesimilar differential hess diagrams to segue 1. a kolmogorov-smirnov testsuggests a high probability that both come from the same parent distribution.the location of segue 1 is close to crossings of the tidal wraps of thesagittarius stream. by extracting blue horizontal branch stars from sloan'sspectral database, two kinematic features are isolated and identified withdifferent wraps of the sagittarius stream. we show that segue 1 is moving witha velocity that is close to one of the wraps. at this location, we estimatethat there are enough sagittarius stars, indistinguishable from segue 1 stars,to inflate the velocity dispersion and hence the mass-to-light ratio. all theavailable evidence is consistent with the interpretation that segue 1 is a starcluster, originally from the sagittarius galaxy, and now dissolving in themilky way.

1003.0758	distance determination for rave stars using stellar models	(abridged) aims:we develop a method for deriving distances from spectroscopicdata and obtaining full 6d phase-space coordinates for the rave survey's seconddata release. methods: we used stellar models combined with atmosphericproperties from rave (teff, logg and [fe/h]) and (j-ks) photometry fromarchival sources to derive absolute magnitudes. we are able to derive the full6d phase-space coordinates for a large sample of rave stars. this method istested with artificial data, hipparcos trigonometric parallaxes andobservations of the open cluster m67. results: when we applied our method to aset of 16 146 stars, we found that 25% (4 037) of the stars have relative(statistical) distance errors of &lt; 35%, while 50% (8 073) and 75% (12 110) haverelative (statistical) errors smaller than 45% and 50%, respectively. ourvarious tests show that we can reliably estimate distances for main-sequencestars, but there is an indication of potential systematic problems with giantstars. for the main-sequence star sample (defined as those with log(g) &gt; 4),25% (1 744) have relative distance errors &lt; 31%, while 50% (3 488) and 75% (5231) have relative errors smaller than 36% and 42%, respectively. our fulldataset shows the expected decrease in the metallicity of stars as a functionof distance from the galactic plane. the known kinematic substructures in the uand v velocity components of nearby dwarf stars are apparent in our dataset,confirming the accuracy of our data and the reliability of our technique. weprovide independent measurements of the orientation of the uv velocityellipsoid and of the solar motion, and they are in very good agreement withprevious work. conclusions: the distance catalogue for the rave second datarelease is available at http://www.astro.rug.nl/~rave

1006.2517	double-lined spectroscopic binary stars in the radial velocity  experiment survey	we devise a new method for the detection of double-lined binary stars in asample of the radial velocity experiment (rave) survey spectra. the method isboth tested against extensive simulations based on synthetic spectra, andcompared to direct visual inspection of all rave spectra. it is based on theproperties and shape of the cross-correlation function, and is able to recover~80% of all binaries with an orbital period of order 1 day. systems withperiods up to 1 year are still within the detection reach. we have applied themethod to 25,850 spectra of the rave second data release and found 123double-lined binary candidates, only eight of which are already marked asbinaries in the simbad database. among the candidates, there are seven thatshow spectral features consistent with the rs cvn type (solar type with activechromosphere) and seven that might be of w uma type (over-contact binaries).one star, hd 101167, seems to be a triple system composed of three nearlyidentical g-type dwarfs. the tested classification method could also beapplicable to the data of the upcoming gaia mission.

1008.3828	origins of the thick disk as traced by the alpha-elements of metal-poor  giant stars selected from rave	theories of thick disk formation can be differentiated by measurements ofstellar elemental abundances. we have undertaken a study of metal-poor starsselected from the rave spectroscopic survey of bright stars to establishwhether or not there is a significant population of metal-poor thick-disk stars([fe/h] &lt;~ -1.0) and to measure their elemental abundances. in this paper, wepresent abundances of four alpha-elements (mg, si, ca, ti) and iron for asubsample of 212 rgb and 31 rc/hb stars from this study. we find that the[alpha/fe] ratios are enhanced implying that enrichment proceeded by purelycore-collapse supernovae. this requires that star formation in each starforming region had a short duration. the relative lack of scatter in the[alpha/fe] ratios implies good mixing in the ism prior to star formation. inaddition, the ratios resemble that of the halo, indicating that the halo andthick disk share a similar massive star imf. we conclude that the alphaenhancement of the metal-poor thick disk implies that direct accretion of starsfrom dwarf galaxies similar to surviving dwarf galaxies today did not play amajor role in the formation of the thick disk.

1011.4092	detection of a radial velocity gradient in the extended local disc with  rave	using a sample of 213,713 stars from the radial velocity experiment (rave)survey, limited to a distance of 2 kpc from the sun and to |z|&lt;1 kpc, we reportthe detection of a velocity gradient of disc stars in the fourth quadrant,directed radially from the galactic centre. in the direction of the galacticcentre, we apply a simple method independent of stellar proper motions and ofgalactic parameters to assess the existence of this gradient in the rave data.this velocity gradient corresponds to |k+c| &lt; 3 km/s/kpc, where k and c are theoort constants measuring the local divergence and radial shear of the velocityfield, respectively. in order to illustrate the effect, assuming a zero radialvelocity of the local standard of rest we then reconstruct the two-dimensionalgalactocentric velocity maps using two different sets of proper motions andphotometric distances based either on isochrone fitting or on k-bandmagnitudes, and considering two sets of values for the galactocentric radius ofthe sun and local circular speed. further observational confirmation of ourfinding with line-of-sight velocities of stars at low latitudes, together withfurther modelling, should help constrain the non-axisymmetric components of thegalactic potential, including the bar, the spiral arms and possibly theellipticity of the dark halo.

1105.1673	single-lined spectroscopic binary star candidates in the rave survey	repeated spectroscopic observations of stars in the radial velocityexperiment (rave) database are used to identify and examine single-lined binary(sb1) candidates. the rave latest internal database (vdr3) includes radialvelocities, atmospheric and other parameters for approximately quarter millionof different stars with little less than 300,000 observations. in the sample of~20,000 stars observed more than once, 1333 stars with variable radialvelocities were identified. most of them are believed to be sb1 candidates. thefraction of sb1 candidates among stars with several observations is between 10%and 15% which is the lower limit for binarity among rave stars. due to thedistribution of time spans between the re-observation that is biased towardsrelatively short timescales (days to weeks), the periods of the identified sb1candidates are most likely in the same range. because of the rave's narrowmagnitude range most of the dwarf candidates belong to the thin galactic diskwhile the giants are part of the thick disk with distances extending to up to afew kpc. the comparison of the list of sb1 candidates to the vsx catalog ofvariable stars yielded several pulsating variables among the giant populationwith the radial velocity variations of up to few tens of km/s. there are 26matches between the catalog of spectroscopic binary orbits (sb9) and the wholerave sample for which the given periastron time and the time of raveobservation were close enough to yield a reliable comparison. rave measurementsof radial velocities of known spectroscopic binaries are consistent with theirpublished radial velocity curves.

1105.4102	accurate stellar kinematics at faint magnitudes: application to the  bootes~i dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we develop, implement and characterise an enhanced data reduction approachwhich delivers precise, accurate, radial velocities from moderate resolutionspectroscopy with the fibre-fed vlt/flames+giraffe facility. this facility,with appropriate care, delivers radial velocities adequate to resolve theintrinsic velocity dispersions of the very faint dsph dwarf galaxies.importantly, repeated measurements let us reliably calibrate our individualvelocity errors ($0.2 \leq \delta_v\leq 5$ km s$^{-1}$) and directly detectstars with variable radial velocities. we show, by application to the bootes-1dwarf spheroidal, that the intrinsic velocity dispersion of this system issignificantly below 6.5\,km/s reported by previous studies. our data favor atwo-population model of bootes-1, consisting of a majority `cold' stellarcomponent, with velocity dispersion $2.4^{+0.9}_{-0.5}$\,km/s, and a minority`hot' stellar component, with velocity dispersion $\sim 9$\,km/s, although wecan not completely rule out a single component distribution with velocitydispersion $4.6^{0.8}_{-0.6}$\,km/s. we speculate this complex velocitydistribution actually reflects the distribution of velocity anisotropy inbootes-1, which is a measure of its formation processes.

0709.4219	is the sky falling? searching for stellar streams in the local milky way  disc in the coravel and rave surveys	we have searched for in-falling stellar streams on to the local milky waydisc in the coravel and rave surveys. the coravel survey consists of localdwarf stars (nordstrom et al. geneva-copenhagen survey) and local famaey et al.giant stars. we select rave stars with radial velocities that are sensitive tothe galactic vertical space velocity (galactic latitude b &lt; -45 deg). kuiperstatistics have been employed to test the symmetry of the galactic verticalvelocity distribution functions in these samples for evidence of a net verticalflow that could be associated with a (tidal?) stream of stars with verticallycoherent kinematics. in contrast to the `field of streams' found in the outerhalo, we find that the local volumes of the solar neighbourhood sampled by thecoravel dwarfs (complete within ~3 x 10^-4 kpc^3), coravel giants (completewithin ~5 x 10^-2 kpc^3) and rave (5-15% complete within ~8 kpc^3) are devoidof any vertically coherent streams containing hundreds of stars. this issufficiently sensitive to allow our rave sample to rule out the passing of thetidal stream of the disrupting sagittarius (sgr) dwarf galaxy through the solarneighbourhood. this agrees with the most recent determination of its orbit anddissociates it from the helmi et al. halo stream. our constraints on theabsence of the sgr stream near the sun could prove a useful tool fordiscriminating between galactic potential models. the lack of a net verticalflow through the solar neighbourhood in the coravel giants and rave samplesargues against the virgo overdensity crossing the disc near the sun. there areno vertical streams in the coravel giants and rave samples with stellardensities &gt;1.6 x 10^4 and 1.5 x 10^3 stars kpc^-3 respectively and therefore noevidence for locally enhanced dark matter.

1107.1256	distance determination for rave stars using stellar models iii: the  nature of the rave survey and milky way chemistry	we apply the method of burnett &amp; binney (2010) for the determination ofstellar distances and parameters to the internal catalogue of the radialvelocity experiment (steinmetz et al. 2006). subsamples of stars that eitherhave hipparcos parallaxes or belong to well-studied clusters, inspireconfidence in the formal errors. distances to dwarfs cooler than ~6000 k appearto be unbiased, but those to hotter dwarfs tend to be too small by ~10% of theformal errors. distances to giants tend to be too large by about the sameamount. the median distance error in the whole sample of 216,000 stars is 28%and the error distribution is similar for both giants and dwarfs. roughly halfthe stars in the rave survey are giants. the giant fraction is largest at lowlatitudes and in directions towards the galactic centre. near the plane themetallicity distribution is remarkably narrow and centred on [m/h]-0.04 dex;with increasing |z| it broadens out and its median moves to [m/h] ~ -0.5. meanage as a function of distance from the galactic centre and distance |z| fromthe galactic plane shows the anticipated increase in mean age with |z|.

1109.6237	automatic stellar spectra parameterisation in the ir caii triplet region	(abridged) galactic archaeology aims to determine the evolution of the galaxyfrom the chemical and kinematical properties of its stars. the analysis ofcurrent large spectroscopic surveys (thousands of stars) and future ones(millions of stars) require automated analysis techniques to obtain robustestimates of the stellar parameters. several on-going and planned spectroscopicsurveys have selected their wavelength region to contain the ir caii tripletand this paper focuses on the automatic analysis of such spectra.  we investigated two algorithms, matisse and degas, both of which compare theobserved spectrum to a grid of synthetic spectra, but each uses a differentmathematical approach for finding the optimum match and hence the best stellarparameters.  we identified degeneracies in different regions of the hr diagram: hot dwarfsand giants share the same spectral signatures. furthermore, the surface gravityof cooler dwarfs is difficult to determine accurately. these effects areintensified when the information decreases (e.g. metal-poor stars or low snrspectra). our results show that the local projection method matisse ispreferred for high snr spectra, whereas the decision-tree method degas ispreferred for noisier spectra. we therefore propose a hybrid approach of bothmethods and show that sufficiently accurate results for the purposes ofgalactic archaeology are retrieved down to snr~20 for typical thin or thickdisc stars, and down to snr~50 for the more metal-poor halo giants.  if unappreciated, degeneracies in stellar parameters can introduce biases inderived quantities for target stars such as distances and full space motions.these biases can be minimised using the knowledge gained by thorough testing ofthe proposed algorithm, which in turn lead to robust automated methods for thecoming extensive stellar spectroscopic surveys in the local group.

1110.5221	a spectroscopic survey of thick disc stars outside the solar  neighbourhood	we performed a spectroscopic survey of nearly 700 stars probing the galacticthick disc far from the solar neighbourhood towards the galactic coordinates(l~277, b~47). the derived effective temperatures, surface gravities andoverall metallicities were then combined with stellar evolution isochrones,radial velocities and proper motions to derive the distances, kinematics andorbital parameters of the sample stars. the targets belonging to each galacticcomponent (thin disc, thick disc, halo) were selected either on theirkinematics or according to their position above the galactic plane, and thevertical gradients were also estimated. we present here atmospheric parameters,distances and kinematics for this sample, and a comparison of our kinematic andmetallicity distributions with the besancon model of the milky way. the thickdisc far from the solar neighbourhood is found to differ only slightly from thethick disc properties as derived in the solar vicinity. for regions where thethick disc dominates, we measured vertical velocity and metallicity trends ofd(v_phi)/dz = 19 +/- 8 km/s/kpc and d[m/h]/dz = -0.14 +/- 0.05 dex/kpc,respectively. these trends can be explained as a smooth transition between thedifferent galactic components, although intrinsic gradients could not beexcluded. in addition, a correlation d(v_phi)/d[m/h] = -45 +/- 12 km/s/dexbetween the orbital velocity and the metallicity of the thick disc is detected.this gradient is inconsistent with the sdss photometric survey analysis, whichdid not detect any such trend, and challenges radial migration models of thickdisc formation. estimations of the scale heights and scale lengths fordifferent metallicity bins of the thick disc result in consistent values, withhr~3.4 \pm 0.7 kpc, and hz~694 \pm 45 pc, showing no evidence of relics ofdestroyed massive satellites.

1204.6502	exploring the morphology of rave stellar spectra	the radial velocity experiment (rave) is a medium resolution r~7500spectroscopic survey of the milky way which already obtained over half amillion stellar spectra. they present a randomly selected magnitude-limitedsample, so it is important to use a reliable and automated classificationscheme which identifies normal single stars and discovers different types ofpeculiar stars. to this end we present a morphological classification of350,000 rave survey stellar spectra using locally linear embedding, adimensionality reduction method which enables representing the complex spectralmorphology in a low dimensional projected space while still preserving theproperties of the local neighborhoods of spectra. we find that the majority ofall spectra in the database ~90-95% belong to normal single stars, but there isalso a significant population of several types of peculiars. among them themost populated groups are those of various types of spectroscopic binary andchromospherically active stars. both of them include several thousands ofspectra. particularly the latter group offers significant further investigationopportunities since activity of stars is a known proxy of stellar ages.applying the same classification procedure to the sample of normal single starsalone shows that the shape of the projected manifold in two dimensional spacecorrelates with stellar temperature, surface gravity and metallicity.

0704.3437	stellar kinematics in the remote leo ii dwarf spheroidal galaxy --  another brick in the wall	we present the projected velocity dispersion profile for the remote(d=233kpc) galactic dwarf spheroidal (dsph) galaxy leo ii, based on 171discrete stellar radial velocities that were obtained from medium-resolutionspectroscopy using the flames/giraffe spectrograph at the european southernobservatory, chile. the dispersion profile of those stars with good membershipprobabilities is essentially flat with an amplitude of 6.6+-0.7 km/s over thefull radial extent of our data, which probe to the stellar boundary of thisgalaxy. we find no evidence of any significant apparent rotation or velocityasymmetry which suggests that tidal effects cannot be invoked to explain leoii's properties. from basic mass modeling, employing jeans' equation, we derivea mass out to the limiting radius of (2.7+-0.5) 10^7 msun and a global mass tolight ratio of 27-45 in solar units, depending on the adopted total luminosity.a cored halo profile and a mild amount of tangential velocity anisotropy isfound to account well for leo ii's observed kinematics, although we cannotexclude the possibility of a cusped halo with radially varying velocityanisotropy. all in all, this galaxy exhibits dark matter properties whichappear to be concordant with the other dsph satellites of the milky way, namelya halo mass profile which is consistent with a central core and a total masswhich is similar to the common mass scale seen in other dsphs.

1302.3466	the relation between chemical abundances and kinematics of the galactic  disc with rave	aims: we study the relations between stellar kinematics and chemicalabundances of a large sample of rave giants in search for selection criterianeeded for disentangling different galactic stellar populations. methods: weselect a sample of 2167 giant stars with signal-to-noise per spectralmeasurements above 75 from the rave chemical catalogue and follow the analysisperformed by gratton and colleagues on 150 subdwarf stars spectroscopicallyobserved at high-resolution. we then use a larger sample of 9131 giants (withsignal-to-noise above 60) to investigate the chemo-kinematical characteristicsof our stars by grouping them into nine subsamples with common eccentricity($e$) and maximum distance achieved above the galactic plane ($z_max$).results: the rave kinematical and chemical data proved to be reliable byreproducing the results by gratton et al. obtained with high-resolutionspectroscopic data. our analysis, based on the $e$-$z_max$ plane combined withadditional orbital parameters and chemical information, provides an alternativeway of identifying different populations of stars. in addition to extractingcanonical thick- and thin-disc samples, we find a group of stars in thegalactic plane ($z_max&lt;1$ kpc and 0.4 $&lt; e &lt; $0.6), which show homogeneouskinematics but differ in their chemical properties. we interpret this as aclear sign that some of these stars have experienced the effects of heatingand/or radial migration, which have modified their original orbits. theaccretion origin of such stars cannot be excluded.

1305.6145	through thick and thin: structure of the galactic thick disc from  extragalactic surveys	we aim to understand the accretion history of the milky way by exploring thevertical and radial properties of the galactic thick disc.  we study the chemical and kinematic properties of roughly a thousand spectraof faint magnitude foreground galactic stars observed serendipitously duringextra-galactic surveys in four lines-of-sight: three in the southern galactichemisphere (surveys of the carina, fornax and sculptor dwarf spheroidalgalaxies) and one in the northern galactic hemisphere (a survey of the sextansdwarf spheroidal galaxy). the foreground stars span distances up to 3kpc fromthe galactic plane and galactocentric radii up to 11kpc.  only three lines-of-sight have a sufficient number of foreground stars for arobust analysis. towards sextans in the northern galactic hemisphere andsculptor in the south, we measure a consistent decrease in mean metallicitywith height from the galactic plane, suggesting a chemically symmetric thickdisc. this decrease can either be due to an intrinsic thick disc metallicitygradient, or simply due to a change in the thin disc/thick disc populationratio and no intrinsic metallicity gradients for the thick disc. we favour thelatter explanation. in contrast, we find evidence of an unpredicted metal-poorpopulation in the direction of carina. this population was earlier detected bywyse et al. (2006), but our more detailed analysis provides robust estimates ofits location (|z|&lt;1kpc), metallicity (-2&lt;[m/h]&lt;-1 dex) and azimuthal orbitalvelocity (v_phi ~120 km/s).  given the chemo-dynamical properties of the over-density towards the carinaline-of-sight, we suggest that it represents the metal-poor tail of thecanonical thick disc. in spite of the small number of stars available, wesuggest that this metal-weak thick disc follows the often suggested thick discvelocity-metallicity correlation of dv_phi/d[m/h]~40-50km/s/dex.

1309.4272	constraints on the galactic bar from the hercules stream as traced with  rave across the galaxy	non-axisymmetries in the galactic potential (spiral arms and bar) inducekinematic groups such as the hercules stream. assuming that hercules is causedby the effects of the outer lindblad resonance of the galactic bar, we modelanalytically its properties as a function of position in the galaxy and itsdependence on the bar's pattern speed and orientation. using data from the ravesurvey we find that the azimuthal velocity of the hercules structure decreasesas a function of galactocentric radius, in a manner consistent with ouranalytical model. this allows us to obtain new estimates of the parameters ofthe milky way's bar. the combined likelihood function of the bar's patternspeed and angle has its maximum for a pattern speed of $\omega_b=(1.89 \pm0.08) \times \omega_0$ where $\omega_0$ is the local circular frequency.assuming a solar radius of 8.05 kpc and a local circular velocity of 238 km/s,this corresponds to $\omega_b=56\pm 2$ km/s/kpc. on the other hand, the bar'sorientation $\phi_b$ cannot be constrained with the available data. in fact,the likelihood function shows that a tight correlation exists between thepattern speed and the orientation, implying that a better description of ourbest fit results is given by the linear relation $\omega_b/\omega_0=1.91 +0.0044[\phi_b(\deg)-48]$, with standard deviation of 0.02. for example, for anangle of $\phi_b=30\deg$ the pattern speed is $54.0\pm0.5$ km/s/kpc. theseresults are not very sensitive to the other galactic parameters such as thecircular velocity curve or the peculiar motion of the sun, and are robust tobiases in distance.

1309.4293	the rave survey: the galactic escape speed and the mass of the milky way	we construct new estimates on the galactic escape speed at variousgalactocentric radii using the latest data release of the radial velocityexperiment (rave dr4). compared to previous studies we have a database largerby a factor of 10 as well as reliable distance estimates for almost all stars.our analysis is based on the statistical analysis of a rigorously selectedsample of 90 high-velocity halo stars from rave and a previously published dataset. we calibrate and extensively test our method using a suite of cosmologicalsimulations of the formation of milky way-sized galaxies. our best estimate ofthe local galactic escape speed, which we define as the minimum speed requiredto reach three virial radii $r_{340}$, is $533^{+54}_{-41}$ km/s (90%confidence) with an additional 5% systematic uncertainty, where $r_{340}$ isthe galactocentric radius encompassing a mean over-density of 340 times thecritical density for closure in the universe. from the escape speed we furtherderive estimates of the mass of the galaxy using a simple mass model with twooptions for the mass profile of the dark matter halo: an unaltered and anadiabatically contracted navarro, frenk &amp; white (nfw) sphere. if we fix thelocal circular velocity the latter profile yields a significantly higher massthan the un-contracted halo, but if we instead use the statistics on haloconcentration parameters in large cosmological simulations as a constraint wefind very similar masses for both models. our best estimate for $m_{340}$, themass interior to $r_{340}$ (dark matter and baryons), is $1.3^{+0.4}_{-0.3}\times 10^{12}$ m$_\odot$ (corresponding to $m_{200} = 1.6^{+0.5}_{-0.4} \times10^{12}$ m$_\odot$). this estimate is in good agreement with recently publishedindependent mass estimates based on the kinematics of more distant halo starsand the satellite galaxy leo i.

1310.1919	in the thick of it: metal-poor disc stars in rave	by selecting in the rave-dr4 survey the stars located between 1 and 2 kpcabove the galactic plane, we question the consistency of the simplestthree-component model (thin disc, thick disc, halo) for the milky way. weconfirm that the metallicity and azimuthal velocity distribution functions ofthe thick disc are not gaussian. in particular, we find that the thick disc hasan extended metallicity tail going at least down to [m/h]=-2 dex, contributingroughly at 3% of the entire thick disc population and having a shorterscale-length compared to the canonical thick disc. the mean azimuthal velocityof these metal-poor stars allows us to estimate the correlation between themetallicity and the orbital velocity, which is an important constraint on theformation mechanisms of the galactic thick disc. given our simple approach, wefind dvphi/d[m/h] ~ 50 km/s/dex, which is in a very good agreement withprevious literature values. we complete the study with a brief discussion onthe implications of the formation scenarios for the thick disc, and suggestthat given the above mentioned characteristics, a thick disc mainly formed byradial migration mechanisms seems unlikely.

1310.5145	a new stellar chemo-kinematic relation reveals the merger history of the  milky way disc	the velocity dispersions of stars near the sun are known to increase withstellar age, but age can be difficult to determine so a proxy like theabundance of alpha elements (e.g., mg) with respect to iron, [alpha/fe], isused. here we report an unexpected behavior found in the velocity dispersion ofa sample of giant stars from the radial velocity experiment (rave) survey withhigh quality chemical and kinematical information, in that it decreasesstrongly for stars with [mg/fe] &gt; 0.4 dex (i.e., those that formed in the firstgyr of the galaxy's life). these findings can be explained by perturbationsfrom massive mergers in the early universe, which have affected more stronglythe outer parts of the disc, and the subsequent radial migration of stars withcooler kinematics from the inner disc. similar reversed trends in velocitydispersion are also found for different metallicity subpopulations. our resultssuggest that the milky way disc merger history can be recovered by relating theobserved chemo-kinematic relations to the properties of past merger events.

0802.2104	complexity on small scales iii: iron and alpha element abundances in the  carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we have obtained high-resolution spectroscopy of ten red giants in the carinadwarf spheroidal (dsph) with uves at the eso/vlt. here we present theabundances of o,na,mg,si,ca,ti and fe. by comparing the iron abundances [fe/h]with calcium triplet (cat) metallicities we show that the empirical cattechnique yields good agreement with the high-resolution data for [fe/h]&gt;-2dex, but tends to deviate at lower metallicities. we identify two metal poorstars with iron abundances of -2.72 and -2.50 dex. these stars are found tohave enhanced [alpha/fe] ratios similar to those of stars in the milky wayhalo. however, the bulk of the carina red giants are depleted in the [alpha/fe]abundance ratios with respect to the galactic halo at a given metallicity. oneof our targets, with a [fe/h] of -1.5 dex, is considerably depleted in almostall of the alpha-elements by ~0.5 dex compared to the solar values. such a low[alpha/fe] can be produced by stochastical fluctuations in terms of anincomplete mixing of single type ia and ii sne events into the ism. our derivedelement ratios are consistent with the episodic and extended sf in carina knownfrom its color-magnitude diagram. we find a considerable star-to-star scatterin the abundance ratios. this suggests that carina's sf history varies withposition within the galaxy, with incomplete mixing. alternatively, the sf rateis so low that the high-mass stellar imf is sparsely populated, asstatistically expected in low-mass star clusters, leading to real scatter inthe resultant mass-integrated yields. both ideas are consistent with slowstochastic sf in dissolving associations, so that one may not speak of a singlesf history at a detailed level (abridged).

1405.7435	kinematic modelling of the milky way using the rave and gcs stellar  surveys	we investigate the kinematic parameters of the milky way disc using the raveand gcs stellar surveys. we do this by fitting a kinematic model to the datataking the selection function of the data into account. for stars in the gcs weuse all phase-space coordinates, but for rave stars we use only $(l,b,v_{\rmlos})$. using mcmc technique, we investigate the full posterior distributionsof the parameters given the data. we investigate the `age-velocity dispersion'relation for the three kinematic components($\sigma_r,\sigma_{\phi},\sigma_z$), the radial dependence of the velocitydispersions, the solar peculiar motion ($u_{\odot},v_{\odot}, w_{\odot} $), thecircular speed $\theta_0$ at the sun and the fall of mean azimuthal motion withheight above the mid-plane. we confirm that the besan\c{c}on-style gaussianmodel accurately fits the gcs data, but fails to match the details of the morespatially extended rave survey. in particular, the shu distribution function(df) handles non-circular orbits more accurately and provides a better fit tothe kinematic data. the gaussian distribution function not only fits the datapoorly but systematically underestimates the fall of velocity dispersion withradius. we find that correlations exist between a number of parameters, whichhighlights the importance of doing joint fits. the large size of the ravesurvey, allows us to get precise values for most parameters. however, largesystematic uncertainties remain, especially in $v_{\odot}$ and $\theta_0$. wefind that, for an extended sample of stars, $\theta_0$ is underestimated by asmuch as $10\%$ if the vertical dependence of the mean azimuthal motion isneglected. using a simple model for vertical dependence of kinematics, we findthat it is possible to match the sgr a* proper motion without any need for$v_{\odot}$ being larger than that estimated locally by surveys like gcs.

1406.4130	constraining the galaxy's dark halo with rave stars	we use the kinematics of $\sim200\,000$ giant stars that lie within $\sim1.5$ kpc of the plane to measure the vertical profile of mass density near thesun. we find that the dark mass contained within the isodensity surface of thedark halo that passes through the sun($(6\pm0.9)\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{m_\odot}$), and the surface density within$0.9$ kpc of the plane ($(69\pm10)\,\mathrm{m_\odot\,pc^{-2}}$) are almostindependent of the (oblate) halo's axis ratio $q$. if the halo is spherical, 46per cent of the radial force on the sun is provided by baryons, and only 4.3per cent of the galaxy's mass is baryonic. if the halo is flattened, thebaryons contribute even less strongly to the local radial force and to thegalaxy's mass. the dark-matter density at the location of the sun is$0.0126\,q^{-0.89}\,\mathrm{m_\odot\,pc^{-3}}=0.48\,q^{-0.89}\,\mathrm{gev\,cm^{-3}}$.when combined with other literature results we find hints for a mildly oblatedark halo with $q \simeq 0.8$. our value for the dark mass within the solarradius is larger than that predicted by cosmological dark-matter-onlysimulations but in good agreement with simulations once the effects of baryonicinfall are taken into account. our mass models consist of threedouble-exponential discs, an oblate bulge and a navarro-frenk-white dark-matterhalo, and we model the dynamics of the rave stars in the correspondinggravitational fields by finding distribution functions $f(\mathbf{j})$ thatdepend on three action integrals. statistical errors are completely swamped bysystematic uncertainties, the most important of which are the distance to thestars in the photometric and spectroscopic samples and the solar distance tothe galactic centre. systematics other than the flattening of the dark haloyield overall uncertainties $\sim 15$ per cent.

1406.4800	filamentary star formation in ngc 1275	we examine the star formation in the outer halo of ngc~1275, the centralgalaxy in the perseus cluster (abell 426), using far ultraviolet and opticalimages obtained with the hubble space telescope. we have identified apopulation of very young, compact star clusters with typical ages of a few myr.the star clusters are organised on multiple-kiloparsec scales. many of thesestar clusters are associated with "streaks" of young stars, the combination ofwhich has a cometary appearance. we perform photometry on the star clusters anddiffuse stellar streaks, and fit their spectral energy distributions to obtainages and masses. these young stellar populations appear to be normal in termsof their masses, luminosities and cluster formation efficiency; &lt;10% of theyoung stellar mass is located in star clusters. our data suggest star formationis associated with the evolution of some of the giant gas filaments in ngc~1275that become gravitationally unstable on reaching and possibly stalling in theouter galaxy. the stellar streaks then could represent stars moving onballistic orbits in the potential well of the galaxy cluster. we propose amodel where star-forming filaments, switched on ~50~myr ago and are currentlyfeeding the growth of the ngc~1275 stellar halo at a rate of ~2-3 solar massesper year. this type of process may also build stellar halos and form isolatedstar clusters in the outskirts of youthful galaxies.

1406.7244	chemical gradients in the milky way from the rave data. ii. giant stars	we provide new constraints on the chemo-dynamical models of the milky way bymeasuring the radial and vertical chemical gradients for the elements mg, al,si, ti, and fe in the galactic disc and the gradient variations as a functionof the distance from the galactic plane ($z$). we selected a sample of giantstars from the rave database using the gravity criterium 1.7$&lt;$log g$&lt;$2.8. wecreated a rave mock sample with the galaxia code based on the besan\c con modeland selected a corresponding mock sample to compare the model with the observeddata. we measured the radial gradients and the vertical gradients as a functionof the distance from the galactic plane $z$ to study their variation across thegalactic disc. the rave sample exhibits a negative radial gradient of$d[fe/h]/dr=-0.054$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ close to the galactic plane ($|z|&lt;0.4$ kpc)that becomes flatter for larger $|z|$. other elements follow the same trendalthough with some variations from element to element. the mock sample hasradial gradients in fair agreement with the observed data. the variation of thegradients with $z$ shows that the fe radial gradient of the rave sample haslittle change in the range $|z|\lesssim0.6$ kpc and then flattens. the ironvertical gradient of the rave sample is slightly negative close to the galacticplane and steepens with $|z|$. the mock sample exhibits an iron verticalgradient that is always steeper than the rave sample. the mock sample alsoshows an excess of metal-poor stars in the [fe/h] distributions with respect tothe observed data. these discrepancies can be reduced by decreasing the numberof thick disc stars and increasing their average metallicity in the besan\c conmodel.

1408.6236	spectroscopic signatures of extra-tidal stars around the globular  clusters ngc 6656 (m22), ngc 3201 and ngc 1851 from rave	stellar population studies of globular clusters have suggested that thebrightest clusters in the galaxy might actually be the remnant nuclei of dwarfspheroidal galaxies. if the present galactic globular clusters formed withinlarger stellar systems, they are likely surrounded by extra-tidal halos and/ortails made up of stars that were tidally stripped from their parent systems.the stellar surroundings around globular clusters are therefore one of the bestplaces to look for the remnants of an ancient dwarf galaxy. here an attempt ismade to search for tidal debris around the supernovae enriched globularclusters m22 and ngc 1851 as well as the kinematically unique cluster ngc 3201.the stellar parameters from the radial velocity experiment (rave) are used toidentify stars with rave metallicities, radial velocities andelemental-abundances consistent with the abundance patterns and properties ofthe stars in m22, ngc 1851 and ngc 3201. the discovery of rave stars that maybe associated with m22 and ngc 1851 are reported, some of which are atprojected distances of ~10 degrees away from the core of these clusters.numerous rave stars associated with ngc 3201 suggest that either the tidalradius of this cluster is underestimated, or that there are some unbound starsextending a few arc minutes from the edge of the cluster's radius. no furtherextra-tidal stars associated with ngc 3201 could be identified. the brightmagnitudes of the rave stars make them easy targets for high resolutionfollow-up observations, allowing an eventual further chemical tagging tosolidify (or exclude) stars outside the tidal radius of the cluster as tidaldebris. in both our radial velocity histograms of the regions surrounding ngc1851 and ngc 3201, a peak of stars at 230 km/s is seen, consistent withextended tidal debris from omega centauri.

1412.1484	characterizing the high-velocity stars of rave: the discovery of a  metal-rich halo star born in the galactic disk	we aim to characterize high-velocity (hivel) stars in the solar vicinity bothchemically and kinematically using the fourth data release of the radialvelocity experiment (rave). we used a sample of 57 hivel stars with galacticrest-frame velocities larger than 275 km s$^{-1}$. with 6d position andvelocity information, we integrated the orbits of the hivel stars and foundthat, on average, they reach out to 13 kpc from the galactic plane and haverelatively eccentric orbits consistent with the galactic halo. using thestellar parameters and [$\alpha$/fe] estimates from rave, we found themetallicity distribution of the hivel stars peak at [m/h] = -1.2 dex and ischemically consistent with the inner halo. there are a few notable exceptionsthat include a hypervelocity star (hvs) candidate, an extremely high-velocitybound halo star, and one star that is kinematically consistent with the halobut chemically consistent with the disk. high-resolution spectra were obtainedfor the metal-rich hivel star candidate and the second highest velocity star inthe sample. using these high-resolution data, we report the discovery of ametal-rich halo star that has likely been dynamically ejected into the halofrom the galactic thick disk. this discovery could aid in explaining theassembly of the most metal-rich component of the galactic halo.

1412.5649	the rich are different: evidence from the rave survey for stellar radial  migration	using the radial velocity experiment fourth data release (rave dr4), and anew metallicity calibration that will be also taken into account in the futurerave dr5, we investigate the existence and the properties of super-solarmetallicity stars ([m/h] &gt; +0.1 dex) in the sample, and in particular in thesolar neighbourhood. we find that rave is rich in super-solar metallicitystars, and that the local metallicity distribution function declines remarkablyslowly up to +0.4 dex. our results show that the kinematics and heightdistributions of the super-solar metallicity stars are identical to those ofthe [m/h] &lt; 0 thin-disc giants that we presume were locally manufactured. theeccentricities of the super-solar metallicity stars indicate that half of themare on a roughly circular orbit (e &lt; 0.15), so under the assumption that themetallicity of the interstellar medium at a given radius never decreases withtime, they must have increased their angular momenta by scattering atcorotation resonances of spiral arms from regions far inside the solar annulus.the likelihood that a star will migrate radially does not seem to decreasesignificantly with increasing amplitude of vertical oscillations within rangeof oscillation amplitudes encountered in the disc.

1501.00581	the nature and orbit of the ophiuchus stream	the ophiuchus stream is a recently discovered stellar tidal stream in themilky way. we present high-quality spectroscopic data for 14 stream memberstars obtained using the keck and mmt telescopes. we confirm the stream as afast moving ($v_{los}\sim290$ km s$^{-1}$), kinematically cold group($\sigma_{v_{los}}\lesssim1$ km s$^{-1}$) of $\alpha$-enhanced and metal-poorstars (${\rm [\alpha/fe]\sim0.4}$ dex, ${\rm [fe/h]\sim-2.0}$ dex). using aprobabilistic technique, we model the stream simultaneously in line-of-sightvelocity, color-magnitude, coordinate, and proper motion space, and sodetermine its distribution in 6d phase-space. we find that that the streamextends in distance from 7.5 to 9 kpc from the sun; it is 50 times longer thanwide, merely appearing highly foreshortened in projection. the analysis of thestellar population contained in the stream suggests that it is $\sim12$ gyrold, and that its initial stellar mass was $\sim2\times10^4$ $m_{\odot}$ (or atleast $\gtrsim7\times10^3$ $m_{\odot}$). assuming a fiducial milky waypotential, we fit an orbit to the stream which matches the observed phase-spacedistribution, except for some tension in the proper motions: the stream has anorbital period of $\sim350$ myr, and is on a fairly eccentric orbit($e\sim0.66$) with a pericenter of $\sim3.5$ kpc and an apocenter of $\sim17$kpc. the phase-space structure and stellar population of the stream show thatits progenitor must have been a globular cluster that was disrupted only$\sim240$ myr ago. we do not detect any significant overdensity of stars alongthe stream that would indicate the presence of a progenitor, and conclude thatthe stream is all that is left of the progenitor.

1504.07695	identification of globular cluster stars in rave data i: application to  stellar parameter calibration	we present the identification of potential members of nearby galacticglobular clusters using radial velocities from the radial velocity experimentdata release 4 (rave-dr4) survey database. our identifications are based onthree globular clusters -- ngc 3201, ngc 5139 ($\omega$ cen) and ngc 362 -- allof which are shown to have |rv|&gt;100 km/s. the identification of globularcluster stars in rave dr4 data offers a unique opportunity to test theprecision and accuracy of the stellar parameters determined with the currentlyavailable stellar parameter pipelines (spps) used in the survey, as globularclusters are ideal testbeds for the validation of stellar atmosphericparameters, abundances, distances and ages. for both ngc 3201 and $\omega$ cen,there is compelling evidence for numerous members (&gt; 10) in the rave database;in the case of ngc 362 the evidence is more ambiguous, and there may besignificant foreground and/or background contamination in ourkinematically-selected sample. a comparison of the rave-derived stellarparameters and abundances with published values for each cluster and with bastiisochrones for ages and metallicities from the literature reveals overall goodagreement, with the exception of the apparent underestimation of surfacegravities for giants, in particular for the most metal-poor stars. moreover, ifthe selected members are part of the main body of each cluster our resultswould also suggest that the distances from binney et al. 2013, where onlyisochrones more metal-rich than -0.9 dex were used, are typicallyunderestimated by ~ 40% with respect to the published distances for theclusters, while the distances from zwitter et al. 2010 show stars ranging from1 to ~ 6.5 kpc -- with indications of a trend toward higher distances at lowermetallicities -- for the three clusters analysed in this study.

1507.08066	the gaia-eso survey: characterisation of the [alpha/fe] sequences in the  milky way discs	we investigate, using the gaia-eso survey internal data-release 2, theproperties of the double sequence of the milky way discs (defined chemically asthe high-alpha and low-alpha populations), and discuss their compatibility withdiscs defined by other means such as metallicity, kinematics or positions.  this investigation uses two different approaches: in velocity space for starslocated in the extended solar neighbourhood, and in chemical space for stars atdifferent ranges of galactocentric radii and heights from the plane. theseparation we find in velocity space allows us to investigate, in a novelmanner, the extent in metallicity of each of the two sequences, identifyingthem with the two discs, without making any assumption about the shape of theirmetallicity distribution functions. then, using the separation in chemicalspace, we characterise the spatial variation of the slopes of the [alpha/fe] -[fe/h] sequences for the thick and thin discs and the way in which the relativeproportions of the two discs change across the galaxy.  we find that the thick disc (high-alpha sequence), extends up to [fe/h]~ +0.2and the thin disc (low-alpha sequence), at least down to [fe/h]~ -0.8. radialand vertical gradients in alpha-abundances are found for the thin disc, withmild spatial variations in its [alpha/fe] - [fe/h] paths, whereas for the thickdisc we do not detect any such spatial variations.  the small variations in the spatial [alpha/fe] - [fe/h] paths of the thindisc do not allow us to distinguish between formation models of this structure.on the other hand, the lack of radial gradients and [alpha/fe] - [fe/h]variations for the thick disc indicate that the mechanism responsible for themixing of the metals in the young galaxy (e.g. radial stellar migration orturbulent gaseous disc) was more efficient before the (present) thin discstarted forming.

1509.05271	the gaia-eso survey: new constraints on the galactic disc velocity  dispersion and its chemical dependencies	understanding the history and the evolution of the milky way disc is one ofthe main goals of modern astrophysics. we study the velocity dispersionbehaviour of galactic disc stars as a function of the [mg/fe] ratio, which canbe used as a proxy of relative age. this key relation is essential to constrainthe formation mechanisms of the disc stellar populations as well as the coolingprocesses. we used the recommended parameters and chemical abundances of 7800fgk milky way field stars from the second internal data release of the gaia-esosurvey. these stars were observed with the giraffe spectrograph, and cover alarge spatial volume (6&lt;r&lt;10kpc and |z|&lt;2kpc). based on the [mg/fe] and [fe/h]ratios, we separated the thin- from the thick-disc sequence. from analysing thegalactocentric velocity of the stars for the thin disc, we find a weak positivecorrelation between vphi and [fe/h], due to a slowly rotating fe-poor tail. forthe thick disc, a strong correlation with [fe/h] and [mg/fe] is established. wehave detected an inversion of the radial velocity dispersion with [mg/fe] forthick-disc stars with [fe/h]&lt;-0.1dex and [mg/fe]&gt;+0.2dex. first, the velocitydispersion increases with [mg/fe] at all [fe/h] ratios for the thin-disc stars,and then it decreases for the thick-disc at the highest [mg/fe] abundances.similar trends are observed within the errors for the azimuthal velocitydispersion, while a continuous increase with [mg/fe] is observed for thevertical velocity dispersion. the velocity dispersion decrease agrees withprevious measurements of the rave survey, although it is observed here for agreater metallicity interval and a larger spatial volume. we confirm theexistence of [mg/fe]-rich thick-disc stars with cool kinematics in thegenerally turbulent context of the primitive galactic disc. this is discussedin the framework of the different disc formation scenarios.

0808.1456	diffuse interstellar bands in rave survey spectra	we have used spectra of hot stars from the rave survey in order toinvestigate the visibility and properties of five diffuse interstellar bandspreviously reported in the literature. the rave spectroscopic survey forgalactic structure and kinematics records ccd spectra covering the 8400-8800ang wavelength region at 7500 resolving power. the spectra are obtained withthe uk schmidt at the aao, equipped with the 6df multi-fiber positioner. thedib at 8620.4 ang is by far the strongest and cleanest of all dibs occurringwithin the rave wavelength range, with no interference by underlying absorptionstellar lines in hot stars. it correlates so tightly with reddening that itturns out to be a reliable tool to measure it, following the relation e(b-v) =2.72 (+/- 0.03) x e.w.(ang), valid throughout the general interstellar mediumof our galaxy. the presence of a dib at 8648 ang is confirmed. its intensityappears unrelated to reddening, in agreement with scanty and preliminaryreports available in the literature, and its measurability is stronglycompromised by severe blending with underlying stellar hei doublet at 8649 ang.the two weak dibs at 8531 and 8572 ang do not appear real and should actuallybe blends of underlying stellar lines. the very weak dib at 8439 ang cannot beresolved within the profile of the much stronger underlying hydrogen paschen 18stellar line.

astro-ph;0306039	the relationship between the optical halpha filaments and the x-ray  emission in the core of the perseus cluster	ngc 1275 in the centre of the perseus cluster of galaxies, abell 426, issurrounded by a spectacular filamentary halpha nebula. deep chandra x-rayimaging has revealed that the brighter outer filaments are also detected insoft x-rays. this can be due to conduction and mixing of the cold gas in thefilaments with the hot, dense intracluster medium. we show the correspondenceof the filaments in both wavebands and draw attention to the relationship oftwo prominent curved nw filaments to an outer, buoyant radio bubble seen as ahole in the x-ray image. there is a strong resemblance in the shape of the holeand the disposition of the filaments to the behaviour of a large air bubblerising in water. if this is a correct analogy, then the flow is laminar and theintracluster gas around this radio source is not turbulent. we obtain a limiton the viscosity of this gas.

astro-ph;0308165	the formation history of the galactic bulge	the distributions of the stellar metallicities of k giant stars in severalfields of the galactic bulge, taken from the literature are compared with asimple model of star formation and chemical evolution. our model assumes aschmidt law of star formation and is described by only a few parameters thatcontrol the infall and outflow of gas and the star formation efficiency. wefind that very short infall timescales are needed, with durations of infall andstar formation greater than 1 gyr being ruled out at the 90% confidence level.the metallicity distributions are compatible with an important amount of gasand metals being ejected in outflows, although a detailed quantification of theejected gas fraction is strongly dependent on a precise determination of theabsolute stellar metallities. the recent bulge data from zoccali et al. arealso analyzed, and the subsample with subsolar metallicities still rules outinfall timescales around 1 gyr at the 90% confidence level. hence, the shorttimescales we derive based on the observed distribution of metallicities arerobust and should be taken as stringent constraints on bulge formation models.

0809.0615	estimation of the tilt of the stellar velocity ellipsoid from rave and  implications for mass models	we present a measure of the inclination of the velocity ellipsoid at 1 kpcbelow the galactic plane using a sample of red clump giants from the rave dr2release. we find that the velocity ellipsoid is tilted towards the galacticplane with an inclination of 7.3 +/-1.8 degree. we compare this value tocomputed inclinations for two mass models of the milky way. we find that ourmeasurement is consistent with a short scale length of the stellar disc (rd ~2kpc) if the dark halo is oblate or with a long scale length (rd~3 kpc) if thedark halo is prolate. once combined with independent constraints on theflattening of the halo, our measurement suggests that the scale length isapproximately halfway between these two extreme values, with a preferred range[2.5-2.7] kpc for a nearly spherical halo. nevertheless, no model can beclearly ruled out. with the continuation of the rave survey, it will bepossible to provide a strong constraint on the mass distribution of the milkyway using refined measurements of the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid.

astro-ph;0509606	deep astrometric standards (das) and galactic structure	the advent of next-generation imaging telescopes such as lsst and pan-starrshas revitalized the need for deep and precise reference frames. the proposedweak-lensing observations with these facilities put the highest demands onimage quality over wide angles on the sky. it is particularly difficult toachieve a sub-arcsecond psf on stacked images, where precise astrometry plays akey role. current astrometric standards are insufficient to achieve the sciencegoals of these facilities. we thus propose the establishing of a few selecteddeep (v=25) astrometric standards (das). these will enable a reliable geometriccalibration of solid-state mosaic detectors in the focal plane of largeground-based telescopes and make a substantial contribution to ourunderstanding of stellar populations in the milky way. in this paper wemotivate the need for such standards and discuss the strategy of theirselection and acquisition and reduction techniques. the feasibility of das isdemonstrated by a pilot study around the open cluster ngc 188, using the kpno4m ccd mosaic camera, and by subaru suprime-cam observations. the goal ofreaching an accuracy of 5-10 mas in positions and obtaining absolute propermotions good to 2 mas/yr over a several square-degree area is challenging, butreachable with the noao 4m telescopes and ccd mosaic imagers or a similarset-up. our proposed das aims to establish four fields near the galactic plane,at widely separated coordinates. in addition to their utilitarian purpose fordas, the data we will obtain in these fields will enable fundamental galacticscience in their own right. the positions, proper motions, and vi photometry offaint stars will address outstanding questions of galactic disk formation andevolution, stellar buildup and mass assembly via merger events.

astro-ph;0511087	complexity on small scales: the metallicity distribution of the carina  dwarf spheroidal galaxy	the carina dwarf spheroidal (dsph) galaxy is the only galaxy of this typethat shows clearly episodic star formation separated by long pauses. here wepresent metallicities for 437 radial velocity members of this galacticsatellite. we obtained medium-resolution spectroscopy with the multi-objectspectrograph flames at the eso vlt. our target red giants cover the entireprojected surface area of carina. our spectra are centered at the near-infraredca triplet, which is a well-established metallicity indicator for old andintermediate-age red giants. the resulting data sample provides the largestcollection of spectroscopically derived metallicities for a local group dsph todate. four of our likely radial velocity members of carina lie outside of thisgalaxy's nominal tidal radius, supporting earlier claims of the possibleexistence of such stars beyond the main body of carina. we find a meanmetallicity of [fe/h]=-1.7 dex. the formal full width at half maximum of themetallicity distribution is 0.92 dex, while the full range of metallicitiesspans ~-3.0&lt;[fe/h]&lt;0.0 dex. the metallicity distribution might be indicative ofseveral subpopulations. there appears to be a mild radial gradient such thatmore metal-rich populations are more centrally concentrated, matching a similartrend for an increasing fraction of intermediate-age stars. this as well as thephotometric colors of the more metal-rich red giants suggest that carinaexhibits an age-metallicity relation. indeed the age-metallicity degeneracyseems to conspire to form a narrow red giant branch despite the considerablespread in metallicity and wide range of ages. the metallicity distribution isnot well-matched by a simple closed-box model of chemical evolution, butrequires models that take into account also infall and outflows.

astro-ph;0605705	an orphan in the "field of streams"	we use sloan digital sky survey data release 5 photometry and spectroscopy tostudy a tidal stream that extends over 50 degrees in the north galactic cap.  from the analysis of the path of the stream and the colors and magnitudes ofits stars, the stream is about 20 kpc away at its nearest detection (thecelestial equator). we detect a distance gradient -- the stream is farther awayfrom us at higher declination. the contents of the stream are made up from apredominantly old and metal-poor population that is similar to the globularclusters m13 and m92. the integrated absolute magnitude of the stream stars isestimated to be m_r = -7.5. there istentative evidence for a velocitysignature, with the stream moving at -40 km/s at low declinations and +100 km/sat high declinations. the stream lies on the same great circle as complex a, aroughly linear association of hi high velocity clouds stretching over 30degrees on the sky, and as ursa major ii, a recently discovered dwarfspheroidal galaxy. lying close to the same great circle are a number ofanomalous, young and metal-poor globular clusters, including palomar 1 andruprecht 106.

astro-ph;0606211	the radial velocity experiment (rave): first data release	we present the first data release of the radial velocity experiment (rave),an ambitious spectroscopic survey to measure radial velocities and stellaratmosphere parameters (temperature, metallicity, surface gravity) of up to onemillion stars using the 6df multi-object spectrograph on the 1.2-m uk schmidttelescope of the anglo-australian observatory (aao). the rave program startedin 2003, obtaining medium resolution spectra (median r=7,500) in the ca-tripletregion ($\lambda\lambda$ 8,410--8,795 \aa) for southern hemisphere stars drawnfrom the tycho-2 and supercosmos catalogs, in the magnitude range 9&lt;i&lt;12. thefirst data release is described in this paper and contains radial velocitiesfor 24,748 individual stars (25,274 measurements when includingre-observations). those data were obtained on 67 nights between 11 april 2003to 03 april 2004. the total sky coverage within this data release is$\sim$4,760 square degrees. the average signal to noise ratio of the observedspectra is 29.5, and 80% of the radial velocities have uncertainties betterthan 3.4 km/s. combining internal errors and zero-point errors, the mode isfound to be 2 km/s. repeat observations are used to assess the stability of ourradial velocity solution, resulting in a variance of 2.8 km/s. we demonstratethat the radial velocities derived for the first data set do not show anysystematic trend with color or signal to noise. the rave radial velocities arecomplemented in the data release with proper motions from starnet 2.0, tycho-2and supercosmos, in addition to photometric data from the major optical andinfrared catalogs (tycho-2, usno-b, denis and 2mass). the data release can beaccessed via the rave webpage: http://www.rave-survey.org.

astro-ph;0608448	cats and dogs, hair and a hero: a quintet of new milky way companions	we present five new satellites of the milky way discovered in sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) imaging data, four of which were followed-up with either thesubaru or the isaac newton telescopes. they include four probable new dwarfgalaxies -- one each in the constellations of coma berenices, canes venatici,leo and hercules -- together with one unusually extended globular cluster,segue 1. we provide distances, absolute magnitudes, half-light radii andcolor-magnitude diagrams for all five satellites. the morphological features ofthe color-magnitude diagrams are generally well described by the ridge line ofthe old, metal-poor globular cluster m92. in the last two years, a total of tennew milky way satellites with effective surface brightness mu_v &gt;~ 28 mag/sq.arcsec have been discovered in sdss data. they are less luminous, moreirregular and appear to be more metal-poor than the previously-known nine milkyway dwarf spheroidals. the relationship between these objects and otherpopulations is discussed. we note that there is a paucity of objects withhalf-light radii between ~40 pc and ~ 100 pc. we conjecture that this mayrepresent the division between star clusters and dwarf galaxies.

astro-ph;0609700	complexity on small scales ii: metallicities and ages in the leo ii  dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we present metallicities and ages for 52 red giants in the remote galacticdwarf spheroidal (dsph) galaxy leo ii. these stars cover the entire surfacearea of leo ii and are radial velocity members. we obtained medium-resolutionmulti-fiber spectroscopy with eso/vlt's flames spectrograph. the metallicitieswere determined based on the near-infrared ca ii triplet. the resultingmetallicity distribution (md) is asymmetric and peaks at [fe/h]=-1.74 dex onthe carretta &amp; gratton scale. the full range in metallicities extends from -2.4to -1.1 dex. as in other dsphs, no extremely metal-poor red giants were found.we compare leo ii's observed md with model predictions for several othergalactic dsphs from the literature. leo ii clearly exhibits a lack of moremetal poor stars, in analogy to the classical g-dwarf problem, which mayindicate a comparable `k-giant problem'. moreover, its evolution appears tohave been affected by galactic winds. we use our inferred metallicities as aninput parameter for isochrone fits to sdss photometry and derive approximateages. the resulting age-metallicity distribution covers the full age range from2-15 gyr on our adopted isochrone scale. during the first 7 gyr relative to theoldest stars [fe/h] appears to have remained almost constant. the almostconstant metallicity at higher ages and a slight drop by about 0.3 dexthereafter may be indicative of rejuvenation by low metallicity gas. overall,the age-metallicity relation appears to support the formation of leo ii frompre-enriched gas. evidence for enrichment is seen during the recent 2-4 gyr.our findings support earlier photometric findings of leo ii as a galaxy with aprominent old and a dominant intermediate-age population. we do not find asignificant radial metallicity gradient nor age gradient in our data.(abridged)

astro-ph;0610638	old and young bulges in late-type disk galaxies	abridged: we use hstacs and nicmos imaging to study the structure and colorsof a sample of nine late-type spirals. we find: (1) a correlation between bulgeand disks scale-lengths, and a correlation between the colors of the bulges andthose of the inner disks. our data show a trend for bulges to be moremetal-enriched than their surrounding disks, but otherwise no simpleage-metallicity connection between these systems; (2) a large range in bulgestellar population properties, and, in particular, in stellar ages.specifically, in about a half of the late-type bulges in our sample the bulk ofthe stellar mass was produced recently. thus, in a substantial fraction of thez=0 disk-dominated bulged galaxies, bulge formation occurs after theformation/accretion of the disk; (3) in about a half of the late-type bulges inour sample, however, the bulk of the stellar mass was produced at early epochs;(4) even these "old" late-type bulges host a significant fraction of stellarmass in a young(er) c component; (5) a correlation for bulges between stellarage and stellar mass, in the sense that more massive late-type bulges are olderthan less massive late-type bulges. since the overall galaxy luminosity (mass)also correlates with the bulge luminosity (mass), it appears that the galaxymass regulates not only what fraction of itself ends up in the bulge component,but also "when" bulge formation takes place. we show that dynamical friction ofmassive clumps in gas-rich disks is a plausible disk-driven mode for theformation of "old" late-type bulges. if disk evolutionary processes areresponsible for the formation of the entire family of late-type bulges, cdmsimulations need to produce a similar number of initially bulgeless disks inaddition to the disk galaxies that are observed to be bulgeless at z=0.

astro-ph;0611372	stellar kinematics and metallicities in the leo i dwarf spheroidal  galaxy -- wide field implications for galactic evolution	we present low-resolution spectroscopy of 120 red giants in the galacticsatellite dwarf spheroidal (dsph) leo i, obtained with the geminin-gmos andkeck-deimos spectrographs. we find stars with velocities consistent withmembership of leo i out to 1.3 king tidal radii. by measuring accurate radialvelocities with a median measurement error of 4.6 km/s we find a mean systemicvelocity of 284.2 km/s with a global velocity dispersion of 9.9 km/s. thedispersion profile is consistent with being flat out to the last data point. weshow that a marginally-significant rise in the radial dispersion profile at aradius of 3' is not associated with any real localized kinematicalsubstructure. given its large distance from the galaxy, tides are not likely tohave affected the velocity dispersion, a statement we support from aquantitative kinematical analysis, as we observationally reject the occurrenceof a significant apparent rotational signal or an asymmetric velocitydistribution. mass determinations adopting both isotropic stellar velocitydispersions and more general models yield a m/l ratio of 24, which isconsistent with the presence of a significant dark halo with a mass of about3x10^7 m_sun, in which the luminous component is embedded. this suggests thatleo i exhibits dark matter properties similar to those of other dsphs in thelocal group. our data allowed us also to determine metallicities for 58 of thetargets. we find a mildly metal poor mean of -1.31 dex and a full spreadcovering 1 dex. in contrast to the majority of dsphs, leo i appears to show noradial gradient in its metallicities, which points to a negligible role ofexternal influences in this galaxy's evolution.

astro-ph;0611671	the rave survey: constraining the local galactic escape speed	we report new constraints on the local escape speed of our galaxy. ouranalysis is based on a sample of high velocity stars from the rave survey andtwo previously published datasets. we use cosmological simulations of diskgalaxy formation to motivate our assumptions on the shape of the velocitydistribution, allowing for a significantly more precise measurement of theescape velocity compared to previous studies. we find that the escape velocitylies within the range $498\kms &lt; \ve &lt; 608 \kms$ (90 per cent confidence), witha median likelihood of $544\kms$. the fact that $\ve^2$ is significantlygreater than $2\vc^2$ (where $\vc=220\kms$ is the local circular velocity)implies that there must be a significant amount of mass exterior to the solarcircle, i.e. this convincingly demonstrates the presence of a dark halo in thegalaxy. for a simple isothermal halo, one can calculate that the minimum radialextent is $\sim58$ kpc. we use our constraints on $\ve$ to determine the massof the milky way halo for three halo profiles. for example, an adiabaticallycontracted nfw halo model results in a virial mass of$1.42^{+1.14}_{-0.54}\times10^{12}m_\odot$ and virial radius of$305^{+66}_{-45}$ kpc (90 per cent confidence). for this model the circularvelocity at the virial radius is $142^{+31}_{-21}\kms$. although our halomasses are model dependent, we find that they are in good agreement with eachother.

astro-ph;9509030	the merging history of the milky way	the age distribution, and chemical elemental abundances, of stars in the haloof the milky way provide constraints on theories of galaxy formation. as onespecific example, the accretion of satellite galaxies similar to the presentretinue of dwarf spheroidals (dsphs) would provide an observable metal-poor,intermediate-age population. this paper presents a quantitative assessment ofany contribution made by such stars to the stellar halo. the bulk of thestellar populations in the halo show a well-defined turn-off, at b-v ~ 0.4,implying that the vast majority of the stars are old. the fraction of starswhich lie blueward of this well-defined turn-off, with metallicities similar tothat of the present dsphs, is used in this paper to place limits on theimportance of the recent accretion of such systems. very few (&lt; ~ 10%) starsare found to be bluer (and by implication, younger) than this limit, with thehighest value found for the more metal-rich halo ([fe/h] &gt;~ -1.5 dex). directcomparison of this statistic with the colour distribution of the turnoff starsin the carina dwarf allows us to derive an upper limit on the number of mergersof such satellite galaxies into the halo of the milky way. this upper limit is~ 40 carina-like galaxies. the higher metallicity data constrain satellitegalaxies like the fornax dwarf; only &lt;~ 5 of these could have been accretedwithin the last &lt; ~ 10 gyr. we note that the low star-formation rates inferredfor dsphs predict distinctive elemental abundance signatures; future data forfield halo stars, including candidate younger stars, will provide a furtherrobust test of accretion models.
