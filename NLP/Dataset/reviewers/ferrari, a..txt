0902.2959	first agile catalog of high confidence gamma-ray sources	we present the first catalog of high-confidence gamma-ray sources detected bythe agile satellite during observations performed from july 9, 2007 to june 30,2008. catalogued sources are detected by merging all the available data overthe entire time period. agile, launched in april 2007, is an asi missiondevoted to gamma-ray observations in the 30 mev - 50 gev energy range, withsimultaneous x-ray imaging capability in the 18-60 kev band. this catalog isbased on gamma-ray imaging detector (grid) data for energies greater than 100mev. for the first agile catalog we adopted a conservative analysis, with ahigh-quality event filter optimized to select gamma-ray events within thecentral zone of the instrument field of view (radius of 40 degrees). this is asignificance-limited (4 sigma) catalog, and it is not a complete flux-limitedsample due to the non-uniform first year agile sky coverage. the catalogincludes 47 sources, 21 of which are associated with confirmed or candidatepulsars, 13 with blazars (7 fsrq, 4 bl lacs, 2 unknown type), 2 with hmxrbs, 2with snrs, 1 with a colliding-wind binary system, 8 with unidentified sources.

0908.1908	agile detection of delayed gamma-ray emission from the short gamma-ray  burst grb 090510	short gamma-ray bursts (grbs), typically lasting less than 2 s, are a specialclass of grbs of great interest. we report the detection by the agile satelliteof the short grb 090510 which shows two clearly distinct emission phases: aprompt phase lasting ~ 200 msec and a second phase lasting tens of seconds. theprompt phase is relatively intense in the 0.3-10 mev range with a spectrumcharacterized by a large peak/cutoff energy near 3 mev, in this phase, nosignificant high-energy gamma-ray emission is detected. at the end of theprompt phase, intense gamma-ray emission above 30 mev is detected showing apower-law time decay of the flux of the type t^-1.3 and a broad-band spectrumremarkably different from that of the prompt phase. it extends from sub-mev tohundreds of mev energies with a photon index alpha ~ 1.5. grb 090510 providesthe first case of a short grb with delayed gamma-ray emission. we present thetiming and spectral data of grb 090510 and briefly discuss its remarkableproperties within the current models of gamma-ray emission of short grbs.

0704.1422	a new, very massive modular liquid argon imaging chamber to detect low  energy off-axis neutrinos from the cngs beam. (project modular)	the paper is considering an opportunity for the cern/gransasso (cngs)neutrino complex, concurrent time-wise with t2k and nova, to search fortheta_13 oscillations and cp violation. compared with large water cherenkov(t2k) and fine grained scintillators (nova), the lar-tpc offers a higherdetection efficiency and a lower backgrounds, since virtually all channels maybe unambiguously recognized. the present proposal, called modular, describes a20 kt fiducial volume lar-tpc, following very closely the technology developedfor the icarus-t60o, and is focused on the following activities, for which weseek an extended international collaboration:  (1) the neutrino beam from the cern 400 gev proton beam and an optimised hornfocussing, eventually with an increased intensity in the framework of the lhcaccelerator improvement program;  (2) a new experimental area lngs-b, of at least 50000 m3 at 10 km off-axisfrom the main laboratory, eventually upgradable to larger sizes. a location isunder consideration at about 1.2 km equivalent water depth;  (3) a new lar imaging detector of at least 20 kt fiducial mass. such anincrease in the volume over the current icarus t600 needs to be carefullyconsidered. it is concluded that a very large mass is best realised with a setof many identical, independent units, each of 5 kt, "cloning" the technology ofthe t600. further phases may foresee extensions of modular to meet futurephysics goals.  the experiment might reasonably be operational in about 4/5 years, provided anew hall is excavated in the vicinity of the gran sasso laboratory and adequatefunding and participation are made available.

0908.4523	high resolution 3d relativistic mhd simulations of jets	relativistic magnetized jets are key elements in active galactic nuclei andin other astrophysical environments. their structure and evolution involves acomplex nonlinear physics that can be approached by numerical studies only.still, owing to a number of challenging computational aspects, only a fewnumerical investigations have been undertaken so far. in this paper, we presenthigh-resolution three dimensional numerical simulations of relativisticmagnetized jets carrying an initially toroidal magnetic field. the presence ofa substantial toroidal component of the field is nowadays commonly invoked andheld responsible for the process of jet acceleration and collimation. we findthat the typical nose cone structures, commonly observed in axisymmetrictwo-dimensional simulations, are not produced in the 3d case. rather, thetoroidal field gives rise to strong current driven kink instabilities leadingto jet wiggling. however, it appears to be able to maintain an highlyrelativistic spine along its full length. by comparing low and high resolutionsimulations, we emphasize the impact of resolution on the jet dynamicalproperties.

0909.3484	agile detection of a rapid gamma-ray flare from the blazar pks 1510-089  during the gasp-webt monitoring	we report the detection by the agile satellite of a rapid gamma-ray flarefrom the powerful gamma-ray quasar pks 1510-089, during a pointing centered onthe galactic center region from 1 march to 30 march 2008. this source has beencontinuosly monitored in the radio-to-optical bands by the glast-agile supportprogram (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope (webt). moreover, thegamma-ray flaring episode triggered three too observations by the swiftsatellite in three consecutive days, starting from 20 march 2008. in the period1-16 march 2008, agile detected gamma-ray emission from pks 1510-089 at asignificance level of 6.2-sigma with an average flux over the entire period of(84 +/- 17) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} for photon energies above 100 mev.after a predefined satellite re-pointing, between 17 and 21 march 2008, agiledetected the source at a significance level of 7.3-sigma, with an average flux(e &gt; 100 mev) of (134 +/- 29) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} and a peak levelof (281 +/- 68) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} with daily integration. duringthe observing period january-april 2008, the source also showed an intense andvariable optical activity, with several flaring episodes and a significantincrease of the flux was observed at millimetric frequencies. moreover, in thex-ray band the swift/xrt observations seem to show an harder-when-brighterbehaviour of the source spectrum. the spectral energy distribution of mid-march2008 is modelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self compton emissionplus contributions from inverse compton scattering of external photons fromboth the accretion disc and the broad line region. indeed, some features in theoptical-uv spectrum seem to indicate the presence of seyfert-like components,such as the little blue bump and the big blue bump.

0910.5344	discovery of extreme particle acceleration in the microquasar cygnus x-3	the study of relativistic particle acceleration is a major topic ofhigh-energy astrophysics. it is well known that massive black holes in activegalaxies can release a substantial fraction of their accretion power intoenergetic particles, producing gamma-rays and relativistic jets. galacticmicroquasars (hosting a compact star of 1-10 solar masses which accretes matterfrom a binary companion) also produce relativistic jets. however, no directevidence of particle acceleration above gev energies has ever been obtained inmicroquasar ejections, leaving open the issue of the occurrence and timing ofextreme matter energization during jet formation. here we report the detectionof transient gamma-ray emission above 100 mev from the microquasar cygnus x-3,an exceptional x-ray binary which sporadically produces powerful radio jets.four gamma-ray flares (each lasting 1-2 days) were detected by the agilesatellite simultaneously with special spectral states of cygnus x-3 during theperiod mid-2007/mid-2009. our observations show that very efficient particleacceleration and gamma-ray propagation out of the inner disk of a microquasarusually occur a few days before major relativistic jet ejections. flaringparticle energies can be thousands of times larger than previously detectedmaximum values (with lorentz factors of 105 and 102 for electrons and protons,respectively). we show that the transitional nature of gamma-ray flares andparticle acceleration above gev energies in cygnus x-3 is clearly linked tospecial radio/x-ray states preceding strong radio flares. thus gamma-raysprovide unique insight into the nature of physical processes in microquasars.

0708.3440	stability and nonlinear adjustment of vortices in keplerian flows	we investigate the stability, nonlinear development and equilibrium structureof vortices in a background shearing keplerian flow. we make use ofhigh-resolution global two-dimensional compressible hydrodynamic simulations.we introduce the concept of nonlinear adjustment to describe the transition ofunbalanced vortical fields to a long-lived configuration. we discuss theconditions under which vortical perturbations evolve into long-lived persistentstructures and we describe the properties of these equilibrium vortices. theproperties of equilibrium vortices appear to be independent from the initialconditions and depend only on the local disk parameters. in particular we findthat the ratio of the vortex size to the local disk scale height increases withthe decrease of the sound speed, reaching values well above the unity. theprocess of spiral density wave generation by the vortex, discussed in ourprevious work, appear to maintain its efficiency also at nonlinear amplitudesand we observe the formation of spiral shocks attached to the vortex. theshocks may have important consequences on the long term vortex evolution andpossibly on the global disk dynamics. our study strengthens the arguments infavor of anticyclonic vortices as the candidates for the promotion of planetaryformation. hydrodynamic shocks that are an intrinsic property of persistentvortices in compressible keplerian flows are an important contributor to theoverall balance. these shocks support vortices against viscous dissipation bygenerating local potential vorticity and should be responsible for the eventualfate of the persistent anticyclonic vortices. numerical codes have be able toresolve shock waves to describe the vortex dynamics correctly.

1111.6147	characterization of a tagged $\gamma$-ray beam line at the da$\phi$ne  beam test facility	at the core of the agile scientific instrument, designed to operate on asatellite, there is the gamma ray imaging detector (grid) consisting of asilicon tracker (st), a cesium iodide mini-calorimeter and an anti-coincidencesystem of plastic scintillator bars. the st needs an on-ground calibration witha $\gamma$-ray beam to validate the simulation used to calculate the energyresponse function and the effective area versus the energy and the direction ofthe $\gamma$ rays. a tagged $\gamma$-ray beam line was designed at the beamtest facility (btf) of the infn laboratori nazionali of frascati (lnf), basedon an electron beam generating $\gamma$ rays through bremsstrahlung in aposition-sensitive target. the $\gamma$-ray energy is deduced by differencewith the post-bremsstrahlung electron energy \cite{prest}-\cite{hasan}. theelectron energy is measured by a spectrometer consisting of a dipole magnet andan array of position sensitive silicon strip detectors, the photon taggingsystem (pts). the use of the combined btf-pts system as tagged photon beamrequires understanding the efficiency of $\gamma$-ray tagging, the probabilityof fake tagging, the energy resolution and the relation of the pts hit positionversus the $\gamma$-ray energy. this paper describes this study comparing datataken during the agile calibration occurred in 2005 with simulation.

1203.3432	search for "anomalies" from neutrino and anti-neutrino oscillations at  delta_m^2 ~ 1ev^2 with muon spectrometers and large lar-tpc imaging detectors	this proposal describes an experimental search for sterile neutrinos beyondthe standard model with a new cern-sps neutrino beam. the experiment is basedon two identical lar-tpc's followed by magnetized spectrometers, observing theelectron and muon neutrino events at 1600 and 300 m from the proton target.this project will exploit the icarus t600, moved from lngs to the cern "far"position. an additional 1/4 of the t600 detector will be constructed andlocated in the "near" position. two spectrometers will be placed downstream ofthe two lar-tpc detectors to greatly complement the physics capabilities.spectrometers will exploit a classical dipole magnetic field with iron slabs,and a new concept air-magnet, to perform charge identification and muonmomentum measurements in a wide energy range over a large transverse area. inthe two positions, the radial and energy spectra of the nu_e beam arepractically identical. comparing the two detectors, in absence of oscillations,all cross sections and experimental biases cancel out, and the twoexperimentally observed event distributions must be identical. any differenceof the event distributions at the locations of the two detectors might beattributed to the possible existence of {\nu}-oscillations, presumably due toadditional neutrinos with a mixing angle sin^2(2theta_new) and a larger massdifference delta_m^2_new. the superior quality of the lar imaging tpc, inparticular its unique electron-pi_zero discrimination allows full rejection ofbackgrounds and offers a lossless nu_e detection capability. the determinationof the muon charge with the spectrometers allows the full separation of nu_mufrom anti-nu_mu and therefore controlling systematics from muonmis-identification largely at high momenta.

1206.4454	the characterization of the distant blazar gb6 j1239+0443 from flaring  and low activity periods	in 2008 agile and fermi detected gamma-ray flaring activity from theunidentified egret source 3eg j1236+0457, recently associated with a flatspectrum radio quasar gb6 j1239+0443 at z=1.762. the optical counterpart of thegamma-ray source underwent a flux enhancement of a factor 15-30 in 6 years, andof ~10 in six months. we interpret this flare-up in terms of a transition froman accretion-disk dominated emission to a synchrotron-jet dominated one. weanalysed a sloan digital sky survey (sdss) archival optical spectrum takenduring a period of low radio and optical activity of the source. we estimatedthe mass of the central black hole using the width of the civ emission line. inour work, we have also investigated sdss archival optical photometric data anduv galex observations to estimate the thermal-disk emission contribution of gb6j1239+0443. our analysis of the gamma-ray data taken during the flaringepisodes indicates a flat gamma-ray spectrum, with an extension of up to 15gev, with no statistically-relevant sign of absorption from the broad lineregion, suggesting that the blazar-zone is located beyond the broad lineregion. this result is confirmed by the modeling of the broad-band spectralenergy distribution (well constrained by the available multiwavelength data) ofthe flaring activity periods and by the accretion disk luminosity and blackhole mass estimated by us using archival data.

1209.0122	experimental search for the lsnd anomaly with the icarus detector in the  cngs neutrino beam	we report an early result from the icarus experiment on the search for nu_muto nu_e signal due to the lsnd anomaly. the search was performed with theicarus t600 detector located at the gran sasso laboratory, receiving cngsneutrinos from cern at an average energy of about 20 gev, after a flight pathof about 730 km. the lsnd anomaly would manifest as an excess of nu_e events,characterized by a fast energy oscillation averaging approximately tosin^2(1.27 dm^2_new l/ e_nu) = 1/2. the present analysis is based on 1091neutrino events, which are about 50% of the icarus data collected in 2010-2011.two clear nu_e events have been found, compared with the expectation of 3.7 +/-0.6 events from conventional sources. within the range of our observations,this result is compatible with the absence of a lsnd anomaly. at 90% and 99%confidence levels the limits of 3.4 and 7.3 events corresponding to oscillationprobabilities of 5.4 10^-3 and 1.1 10^-2 are set respectively. the resultstrongly limits the window of open options for the lsnd anomaly to a narrowregion around (dm^2, sin^2(2 theta))_new = (0.5 ev^2, 0.005), where there is anoverall agreement (90% cl) between the present icarus limit, the publishedlimits of karmen and the published positive signals of lsnd and miniboonecollaborations.

1309.0375	modelling the kinked jet of the crab nebula	we investigate the dynamical propagation of the south-east jet from the crabpulsar interacting with supernova ejecta by means of three-dimensionalrelativistic mhd numerical simulations with the pluto code.  the initial jet structure is set up from the inner regions of the crabnebula.  we study the evolution of hot, relativistic hollow outflows initiallycarrying a purely azimuthal magnetic field.  our jet models are characterized by different choices of the outflowmagnetization ($\sigma$ parameter) and the bulk lorentz factor ($\gamma_{j}$).  we show that the jet is heavily affected by the growth of current-driven kinkinstabilities causing considerable deflection throughout its propagationlength.  this behavior is partially stabilized by the combined action of larger flowvelocities and/or reduced magnetic field strengths.  we find that our best jet models are characterized by relatively large valuesof $\sigma$ ($\gtrsim 1$) and small values of $\gamma_{j}\simeq 2$.  our results are in good agreement with the recent x-ray (\textit{chandra})data of the crab nebula south-east jet indicating that the jet changesdirection of propagation on a time scale of the order of few years.  the 3d models presented here may have important implications in theinvestigation of particle acceleration in relativistic outflows.

0802.2607	on the linear theory of kelvin-helmholtz instabilities of relativistic  magnetohydrodynamic planar flows	we investigate the linear stability properties of the plane interfaceseparating two relativistic magnetized flows in relative motion. the two flowsare governed by the (special) relativistic equations for a magnetized perfectgas in the infinite conductivity approximation. by adopting the vortex-sheetapproximation, the relativistic magnetohydrodynamics equations are linearizedaround the equilibrium state and the corresponding dispersion relation isderived and discussed. the behavior of the configuration and the regimes ofinstability are investigated following the effects of four physical parameters,namely: the flow velocity, the relativistic and alfv\'enic mach numbers and theinclination of the wave vector on the plane of the interface. from thenumerical solution of the dispersion relation, we find in general two separateregions of instability, associated respectively with the slow and fastmagnetosonic modes. modes parallel to the flow velocity are destabilized onlyfor sufficiently low magnetization. for the latter case, stabilization isattained, additionally, at sufficiently large relativistic velocities betweenthe two flows in relative motion. the relevance of these results to the studyof the stability of astrophysical jets is briefly commented.

1406.1023	generalizations related to hypothesis testing with the posterior  distribution of the likelihood ratio	the posterior distribution of the likelihood ratio (plr) is proposed bydempster in 1974 for significance testing in the simple vs composite hypothesescase. in this hypotheses test case, classical frequentist and bayesianhypotheses tests are irreconcilable, as emphasized by lindley's paradox, berger&amp; selke in 1987 and many others. however, dempster shows that the plr (withinner threshold 1) is equal to the frequentist p-value in the simple gaussiancase. in 1997, aitkin extends this result by adding a nuisance parameter andshowing its asymptotic validity under more general distributions. here weextend the reconciliation between the plr and a frequentist p-value for afinite sample, through a framework analogous to the stein's theorem frame inwhich a credible (bayesian) domain is equal to a confidence (frequentist)domain.  this general reconciliation result only concerns simple vs compositehypotheses testing. the measures proposed by aitkin in 2010 and evans in 1997have interesting properties and extend dempster's plr but only by adding anuisance parameter. here we propose two extensions of the plr concept to thegeneral composite vs composite hypotheses test. the first extension can bedefined for improper priors as soon as the posterior is proper. the secondextension appears from a new bayesian-type neyman-pearson lemma and emphasizes,from a bayesian perspective, the role of the lr as a discrepancy variable forhypothesis testing.

0806.1648	formation of dynamical structures in relativistic jets: the fri case	strong observational evidence indicates that all extragalactic jetsassociated with agns move at relativistic speed up to 100 pc - 1 kpc scalesfrom the nucleus. at larger distances, reflecting the fanaroff-riley radiosource classification, we observe an abrupt deceleration in fr-i jets whilerelativistic motions persist up to mpc scale in fr-ii. moreover, vlbiobservations of some object like b2 1144+35, mrk501 and m87 show limbbrightening of the jet radio emission at the parsec scale. this effect isinterpreted kinematically as due to the presence of a deboosted central spineat high lorentz factor and of a weakly relativistic external layer. in thispaper we investigate whether these effects can be interpreted by a breaking ofthe collimated flow by external medium entrainment favored by shearinstabilities, namely kelvin-helmholtz instabilities. we examine in details thephysical conditions under which significant deceleration of a relativistic flowis produced. we investigate the phenomenon by means of high-resolutionthree-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic simulations using the pluto codefor computational astrophysics. we find that the parameter of utmost importancein determining the instability evolution and the entrainment properties is theambient/jet density contrast. we show that lighter jets suffer stronger slowingdown in the external layer than in the central part and conserve a centralspine at high lorentz factor. our model is verified by constructing syntheticemission maps from the numerical simulations that compare reasonably well withvlbi observations of the inner part of fr-i sources.

astro-ph;0006212	kelvin-helmholtz instability in three dimensional radiative jets	the analysis of the stability properties of astrophysical jets againstkelvin-helmholtz (or shear-layer) instabilities plays a basic role in theunderstanding the origin and physical characteristics of these objects.numerical simulations by bodo et al. (1998) have shown that thethree-dimensional non-linear evolution of kh instabilities in supersonic jetsis substantially faster than in the two-dimensional case, leading to a cascadeof modes towards smaller scales and a very effective mixing and momentumtransfer to the ambient medium. on the other hand, rossi et al. (1997) andmicono et al. (1998) found, in two dimensions, that radiative losses tend toreduce and delay mixing effects and momentum transfer to the ambient medium. inthis paper, as a logical next step, we investigate the effects of radiativelosses on the stability of 3d supersonic jets, assuming that the internal jetdensity is initially lower, equal and higher than the ambient medium,respectively. we find that light and equal-density radiative jets evolve in aqualitatively similar fashion with respect to the corresponding adiabatic ones.conversely, we note substantial differences in the evolution of heavy jets:they remain more collimated and do not spread out, while the momentum gained bythe ambient medium stays within ~ 5 jet radii.

astro-ph;0302275	x-ray emission from expanding cocoons	x-ray observations of extragalactic radiosources show strong evidences ofinteraction between the radio emitting plasma and the x-ray emitting ambientgas. in this paper we perform a detailed study of this interaction by numericalsimulations. we study the propagation of an axisymmetric supersonic jet in anisothermal king atmosphere and we analyze the evolution of the resulting x-rayproperties and their dependence on the jet physical parameters. we show theexistence of two distinct and observationally different regimes of interaction,with strong and weak shocks. in the first case shells of enhanced x-rayemission are to be expected, while in the second case we expect deficit ofx-ray emission coincident with the cocoon. by a comparison between analyticalmodels and the results of our numerical simulations, we discuss the dependenceof the transition between these two regimes on the jet parameters and we findthat the mean controlling quantity results to be the jet kinetic power. we thendiscuss how the observed jets can be used to constrain the jet properties.

0808.4053	agile detection of variable gamma-ray activity from the blazar s5  0716+714 in september-october 2007	we report the gamma-ray activity from the intermediate bl lac s5 0716+714during observations acquired by the agile satellite in september and october2007. these detections of activity were contemporaneous with a period ofintense optical activity, which was monitored by gasp-webt. this simultaneousoptical and gamma-ray coverage allows us to study in detail the light curves,time lags, gamma-ray photon spectrum, and spectral energy distributions (seds)during different states of activity. agile observed the source with its twoco-aligned imagers, the gamma-ray imaging detector (grid) and the hard x-rayimager (super-agile), which are sensitive to the 30 mev-50 gev and 18-60 kevenergy ranges, respectively. observations were completed in two differentperiods, the first between 2007 september 4-23, and the second between 2007october 24-november 1. over the period 2007 september 7-12, agile detectedgamma-ray emission from the source at a significance level of 9.6-sigma with anaverage flux (e&gt;100 mev) of (97 +/- 15) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}, whichincreased by a factor of at least four within three days. no emission wasdetected by super-agile for the energy range 18-60 kev to a 3-sigma upper limitof 10 mcrab in 335 ksec. in october 2007, agile repointed toward s5 0716+714following an intense optical flare, measuring an average flux of (47 +/- 11) x10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} at a significance level of 6.0-sigma. thegamma-ray flux of s5 0716+714 detected by agile is the highest ever detectedfor this blazar and one of the most intense gamma-ray fluxes detected from a bllac object. the sed of mid-september appears to be consistent with thesynchrotron self-compton (ssc) emission model, but only by including two ssccomponents of different variabilities.

astro-ph;0408555	heating groups and clusters of galaxies: the role of agn jets	x-ray observations of groups and clusters of galaxies show that theintra-cluster medium (icm) in their cores is hotter than expected fromcosmological numerical simulations of cluster formation which include starformation, radiative cooling and sn feedback. we investigate the effect of theinjection of supersonic agn jets into the icm using axisymmetric hydrodynamicalnumerical simulations. a simple model for the icm, describing the radialproperties of gas and the gravitational potential in cosmological n-body+sphsimulations of one cluster and three groups of galaxies at redshift z=0, isobtained and used to set the environment in which the jets are injected. wevaried the kinetic power of the jet and the emission-weighted x-ray temperatureof the icm. the jets transfer their energy to the icm mainly by the effects oftheir terminal shocks. a high fraction of the injected energy can be depositedthrough irreversible processes in the cluster gas, up to 75% in oursimulations. we show how one single, powerful jet can reconcile the predictedx-ray properties of small groups, e.g. the lx-tx relation, with observations.we argue that the interaction between agn jets and galaxy groups and clusteratmospheres is a viable feedback mechanism.

0809.1737	multiwavelength observations of 3c 454.3. i. the agile 2007 november  campaign on the "crazy diamond"	[abridged] we report on a multiwavelength observation of the blazar 3c 454.3(which we dubbed "crazy diamond") carried out on november 2007 by means of theastrophysical satellites agile, integral, swift, the webt consortium, and theoptical-nir telescope rem. 3c 454.3 is detected at a $\sim 19-\sigma$ levelduring the 3-week observing period, with an average flux above 100 mev of$f_{\rm e&gt;100mev} = (170 \pm 13) \times 10^{-8}$ \phcmsec. the gamma-rayspectrum can be fit with a single power-law with photon index $\gamma_{\rmgrid} = 1.73 \pm 0.16$ between 100 mev and 1 gev. we detect significantday-by-day variability of the gamma-ray emission during our observations, andwe can exclude that the fluxes are constant at the 99.6% ($\sim 2.9 \sigma$)level. the source was detected typically around 40 degrees off-axis, and it wassubstantially off--axis in the field of view of the agile hard x-ray imager.however, a 5-day long too observation by integral detected 3c 454.3 at anaverage flux of about $f_{\rm 20-200 kev} = 1.49 \times 10^{-3}$ \phcmsec withan average photon index of $\gamma_{\rm ibis} = 1.75 \pm 0.24$ between 20--200kev. swift also detected 3c 454.3 with a flux in the 0.3--10 kev energy band inthe range $(1.23-1.40) \times 10^{-2}$ \phcmsec{} and a photon index in therange $\gamma_{\rm xrt} = 1.56-1.73$. in the optical band, both webt and remshow an extremely variable behavior in the $r$ band. a correlation analysisbased on the entire data set is consistent with no time-lags between thegamma-ray and the optical flux variations. our simultaneous multifrequencyobservations strongly indicate that the dominant emission mechanism between 30mev and 30 gev is dominated by inverse compton scattering of relativisticelectrons in the jet on the external photons from the broad line region.

astro-ph;0703064	mhd simulations of jet acceleration from keplerian accretion disks: the  effects of disk resistivity	accretion disks and astrophysical jets are used to model many activeastrophysical objects, viz., young stars, relativistic stars, and activegalactic nuclei. in this paper we present self-consistent time-dependentsimulations of supersonic jets launched from magnetized accretion disks, usinghigh resolution numerical techniques. in particular we study the effects of thedisk magnetic resistivity, parametrized through an alpha-prescription, indetermining the properties of the inflow-outflow system. moreover we analyzeunder which conditions steady state solutions of the type proposed in the selfsimilar models of blandford and payne can be reached and maintained in a selfconsistent nonlinear stage. we use the resistive mhd flash code with adaptivemesh refinement, allowing us to follow the evolution of the structure for atime scale long enough to reach steady state. a detailed analysis of theinitial configuration state is given. we obtain the expected solutions in theaxisymmetric (2.5d) limit. assuming a magnetic field around equipartition withthe thermal pressure of the disk, we show how the characteristics of the diskjet system, as the ejection efficiency and the energetics, are affected by theanomalous resistivity acting inside the disk.

0809.3917	gamma-ray burst detection with the agile mini-calorimeter	the mini-calorimeter (mcal) instrument on-board the agile satellite is anon-imaging gamma-ray scintillation detector sensitive in the 300kev-100mevenergy range with a total on-axis geometrical area of 1400cm^2. gamma-raybursts (grbs) are one of the main scientific targets of the agile mission andthe mcal design as an independent self-triggering detector makes it a valuableall-sky monitor for grbs. furthermore mcal is one of the very few operativeinstruments with microsecond timing capabilities in the mev range. in thispaper the results of grb detections with mcal after one year of operation inspace are presented and discussed. a flexible trigger logic implemented in theagile payload data-handling unit allows the on-board detection of grbs. fortriggered events, energy and timing information are sent to telemetry on aphoton-by-photon basis, so that energy and time binning are limited by countingstatistics only. when the trigger logic is not active, grbs can be detectedoffline in ratemeter data, although with worse energy and time resolution.between the end of june 2007 and june 2008 mcal detected 51 grbs, with adetection rate of about 1 grb/week, plus several other events at a fewmilliseconds timescales. since february 2008 the on-board trigger logic hasbeen fully active. comparison of mcal detected events and data provided byother space instruments confirms the sensitivity and effective areaestimations. mcal also joined the 3rd inter-planetary network, to contribute togrb localization by means of triangulation.

hep-ph;0207035	the fluka atmospheric neutrino flux calculation	the 3-dimensional (3-d) calculation of the atmospheric neutrino flux by meansof the fluka monte carlo model is here described in all details, starting fromthe latest data on primary cosmic ray spectra. the importance of a 3-dcalculation and of its consequences have been already debated in a previouspaper. here instead the focus is on the absolute flux. we stress the relevantaspects of the hadronic interaction model of fluka in the atmospheric neutrinoflux calculation. this model is constructed and maintained so to provide a highdegree of accuracy in the description of particle production. the accuracyachieved in the comparison with data from accelerators and cross checked withdata on particle production in atmosphere certifies the reliability of showercalculation in atmosphere. the results presented here can be already used foranalysis by current experiments on atmospheric neutrinos. however theyrepresent an intermediate step towards a final release, since this calculationdoes not yet include the bending of charged particles in atmosphere. on theother hand this last aspect, while requiring a considerable effort in a fully3-d description of the earth, if a high level of accuracy has to be maintained,does not affect in a significant way the analysis of atmospheric neutrinoevents.

hep-ph;0208047	proton driver optimization for new generation neutrino superbeams to  search for sub-leading numu-&gt;nue oscillations ($\theta_{13}$ angle)	we perform a systematic study of particle production and neutrino yields fordifferent incident proton energies $e_p$ and baselines $l$, with the aim ofoptimizing the parameters of a neutrino beam for the investigation of$\theta_{13}$-driven neutrino oscillations in the $\delta m^2$ range allowed bysuperkamiokande results. we study the neutrino energy spectra in the``relevant'' region of the first maximum of the oscillation at a given baseline$l$. we find that to each baseline $l$ corresponds an ``optimal'' proton energy$e_p$ which minimizes the required integrated proton intensity needed toobserve a fixed number of oscillated events. in addition, we find that theneutrino event rate in the relevant region scales approximately linearly withthe proton energy. hence, baselines $l$ and proton energies $e_p$ can beadjusted and the performance for neutrino oscillation searches will remainapproximately unchanged provided that the product of the proton energy timesthe number of protons on target remains constant. we apply these ideas to thespecific cases of 2.2, 4.4, 20, 50 and 400 gev protons. we simulate focusingsystems that are designed to best capture the secondary pions of the``optimal'' energy. we compute the expected sensitivities to$\sin^22\theta_{13}$ for the various configurations by assuming the existenceof new generation accelerators able to deliver integrated proton intensities ontarget times the proton energy of the order of ${\cal o}(5\times 10^{23})\rm\gev\times\rm pot/year$.

hep-ph;0602032	beam cooling with ionisation losses	a novel type of particle "cooling", called ionization cooling, is applicableto slow (v of the order of 0.1c) ions stored in a small ring. the manytraversals through a thin foil enhance the nuclear reaction probability, in asteady configuration in which ionisation losses are recovered at each turn by arf-cavity. for a uniform target "foil" the longitudinal momentum spreaddiverges exponentially since faster (slower) particles ionise less (more) thanthe average. in order to "cool" also longitudinally, a chromaticity has to beintroduced with a wedge shaped "foil". multiple scattering and straggling arethen "cooled" in all three dimensions, with a method similar to the one ofsynchrotron cooling, but valid for low energy ions. particles then stablycirculate in the beam indefinitely, until they undergo for instance nuclearprocesses in the thin target foil. this new method is under consideration forthe nuclear production of a few mev/a ion beams. simple reactions, for instanceli 7 + d li 8 + p, are more favourably exploited with the heavier ion collidingagainst a gas-jet d2 target. kinematics is generally very favourable, withemission angles in a narrow angular cone and a relatively concentrated outgoingenergy spectrum which allows an efficient collection as a neutral gas in a tinyvolume with a technology at high temperatures perfected at isolde. it ishowever of a much more general applicability. the method appears capable ofproducing a "table top" storage ring with an accumulation rate in excess of10**14 li-8 radioactive ion/s for possible use for radioactive beams forphysics studies (for example for beta-beams) or for therapy.
