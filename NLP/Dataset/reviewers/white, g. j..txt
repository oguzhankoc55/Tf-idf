0707.0169	the james clerk maxwell telescope legacy survey of nearby star-forming  regions in the gould belt	this paper describes a james clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt) legacy surveythat has been awarded roughly 500 hrs of observing time to be carried out from2007 to 2009. in this survey we will map with scuba-2 (submillimetre commonuser bolometer array 2) almost all of the well-known low-mass andintermediate-mass star-forming regions within 0.5 kpc that are accessible fromthe jcmt. most of these locations are associated with the gould belt. fromthese observations we will produce a flux-limited snapshot of star formationnear the sun, providing a legacy of images, as well as point-source andextended-source catalogues, over almost 700 square degrees of sky. theresulting images will yield the first catalogue of prestellar and protostellarsources selected by submillimetre continuum emission, and should increase thenumber of known sources by more than an order of magnitude. we will also obtainco maps with the array receiver harp (heterodyne array receiver programme), inthree co isotopologues, of a large typical sample of prestellar andprotostellar sources. we will then map the brightest hundred sources with thescuba-2 polarimeter (pol-2), producing the first statistically significant setof polarization maps in the submillimetre. the images and source catalogueswill be a powerful reference set for astronomers, providing a detailed legacyarchive for future telescopes, including alma, herschel and jwst.

0707.0489	an unbiased survey of 500 nearby stars for debris disks: a jcmt legacy  program	we present the scientific motivation and observing plan for an upcomingdetection survey for debris disks using the james clerk maxwell telescope. thescuba-2 unbiased nearby stars (suns) survey will observe 500 nearby mainsequence and sub-giant stars (100 of each of the a, f, g, k and m spectralclasses) to the 850 micron extragalactic confusion limit to search for evidenceof submillimeter excess, an indication of circumstellar material. the surveydistance boundaries are 8.6, 16.5, 22, 25 and 45 pc for m, k, g, f and a stars,respectively, and all targets lie between the declinations of -40 deg to 80deg. in this survey, no star will be rejected based on its inherent properties:binarity, presence of planetary companions, spectral type or age. this will bethe first unbiased survey for debris disks since iras. we expect to detect ~125debris disks, including ~50 cold disks not detectable in current shorterwavelength surveys. a substantial amount of complementary data will be requiredto constrain the temperatures and masses of discovered disks. high resolutionstudies will likely be required to resolve many of the disks. therefore, thesesystems will be the focus of future observational studies using a variety ofobservatories to characterize their physical properties. for non-detectedsystems, this survey will set constraints (upper limits) on the amount ofcircumstellar dust, of typically 200 times the kuiper belt mass, but as low as10 times the kuiper belt mass for the nearest stars in the sample(approximately 2 pc).

1005.1565	the physical properties of the dust in the rcw 120 hii region as seen by  herschel	context. rcw 120 is a well-studied, nearby galactic hii region with ongoingstar formation in its surroundings. previous work has shown that it displays abubble morphology at mid-infrared wavelengths and has a massive layer ofcollected neutral material seen at sub-mm wavelengths. given the well-definedphoto-dissociation region (pdr) boundary and collected layer, it is anexcellent laboratory to study the "collect and collapse" process of triggeredstar formation. using herschel space observatory data at 100, 160, 250, 350,and 500 micron, in combination with spitzer and apex-laboca data, we can forthe first time map the entire spectral energy distribution of an hii region athigh angular resolution. aims. we seek a better understanding of rcw120 and itslocal environment by analysing its dust temperature distribution. additionally,we wish to understand how the dust emissivity index, beta, is related to thedust temperature. methods. we determine dust temperatures in selected regionsof the rcw 120 field by fitting their spectral energy distribution (sed),derived using aperture photometry. additionally, we fit the sed extracted froma grid of positions to create a temperature map. results. we find a gradient indust temperature, ranging from &gt;30 k in the interior of rcw 120, to ~20k forthe material collected in the pdr, to ~10k toward local infrared dark cloudsand cold filaments. our results suggest that rcw 120 is in the process ofdestroying the pdr delineating its bubble morphology. the leaked radiation fromits interior may influence the creation of the next generation of stars. wefind support for an anti-correlation between the fitted temperature and beta,in rough agreement with what has been found previously. the extended wavelengthcoverage of the herschel data greatly increases the reliability of this result.

1005.1615	star formation triggered by the galactic hii region rcw 120: first  results from the herschel space observatory	by means of different physical mechanisms, the expansion of hii regions canpromote the formation of new stars of all masses. rcw 120 is a nearby galactichii region where triggered star formation occurs. this region is well-studied -there being a wealth of existing data - and is nearby. however, it issurrounded by dense regions for which far infrared data is essential to obtainan unbiased view of the star formation process and in particular to establishwhether very young protostars are present. we attempt to identify all youngstellar objects (ysos), especially those previously undetected at shorterwavelengths, to derive their physical properties and obtain insight into thestar formation history in this region. we use herschel-pacs and -spire imagesto determine the distribution of ysos observed in the field. we use a spectralenergy distribution fitting tool to derive the ysos physical properties.herschel-pacs and -spire images confirm the existence of a young source andallow us to determine its nature as a high-mass (8-10 msun) class 0 object(whose emission is dominated by a massive envelope) towards the massivecondensation 1 observed at (sub)-millimeter wavelengths. this source was notdetected at 24 micron and only barely seen in the mispgal 70 micron data.several other red sources are detected at herschel wavelengths and coincidewith the peaks of the millimeter condensations. sed fitting results for thebrightest herschel sources indicate that, apart from the massive class 0 thatforms in condensation 1, young low mass stars are forming around rcw 120. theysos observed on the borders of rcw 120 are younger than its ionizing star,which has an age of about 2.5 myr.

1005.2746	herschel-spire observations of the polaris flare : structure of the  diffuse interstellar medium at the sub-parsec scale	we present a power spectrum analysis of the herschel-spire observations ofthe polaris flare, a high galactic latitude cirrus cloud midway between thediffuse and molecular phases. the spire images of the polaris flare reveal forthe first time the structure of the diffuse interstellar medium down to 0.01parsec over a 10 square degrees region. these exceptional observationshighlight the highly filamentary and clumpy structure of the interstellarmedium even in diffuse regions of the map. the power spectrum analysis showsthat the structure of the interstellar medium is well described by a singlepower law with an exponent of -2.7 +- 0.1 at all scales from 30" to 8 degrees.that the power spectrum slope of the dust emission is constant down to thespire angular resolution is an indication that the inertial range of turbulenceextends down to the 0.01 pc scale. the power spectrum analysis also allows theidentification of a poissonian component at sub-arcminute scales in agreementwith predictions of the cosmic infrared background level at spire wavelengths.finally, the comparison of the spire and iras 100 micron data of the polarisflare clearly assesses the capability of spire in maping diffuse emission overlarge areas.

1110.6283	a photometric study of chemically peculiar stars with the stereo  satellites. i. magnetic chemically peculiar stars	about 10% of upper main sequence stars are characterised by the presence ofchemical peculiarities, often found together with a structured magnetic field.the atmospheres of most of those chemically peculiar stars present surfacespots, leading to photometric variability caused by rotational modulation. thestudy of the light curves of those stars therefore, permits a precisemeasurement of their rotational period, which is important to study stellarevolution and to plan further detailed observations. we analysed the lightcurves of 1028 chemically peculiar stars obtained with the stereo spacecraft.we present here the results obtained for the 337 magnetic chemically peculiarstars in our sample. thanks to the cadence and stability of the photometry,stereo data are perfectly suitable to study variability signals with aperiodicity typical of magnetic chemically peculiar stars. using a matchedfilter algorithm and then two different period searching algorithms, wecompiled a list of 82 magnetic chemically peculiar stars for which we measureda reliable rotational period; for 48 of them this is the first measurement oftheir rotational period. the remaining 255 stars are likely to be constant,although we cannot exclude the presence of long period variability. in somecases, the presence of blending or systematic effects prevented us fromdetecting any reliable variability and in those cases we classified the star asconstant. for each star we classified as variable, we determined temperature,luminosity, mass and fractional age, but the limited statistics, biased towardsthe shorter periods, prevented us from finding any evolutionary trend of therotational period. for a few stars, the comparison between their projectedrotational velocity and equatorial velocity let us believe that their realrotational period might be longer than that found here and previously obtained.

1111.3653	spatial variation of the cooling lines in the orion bar from  herschel/pacs	we present spatially resolved herschel/pacs observations of the orion bar. wehave characterise the emission of the far-infrared fine-structure lines of[cii] (158um), [oi] (63 and 145um), and [nii] (122um) that trace the gas localconditions. the observed distribution and variation of the lines are discussedin relation to the underlying geometry and linked to the energetics associatedwith the trapezium stars. these observations enable us to map the spatialdistribution of these fine-structure lines with a spatial resolution between 4"and 11" and covering a total square area of about 120"x105". the spatialprofile of the emission lines are modelled using the radiative transfer codecloudy. we find that the spatial distribution of the [cii] line coincides withthat of the [oi] lines. the [nii] line peaks closer to the ionising star thanthe other three lines, but with a small region of overlap. we can distinguishseveral knots of enhanced emission within the bar indicating the presence of aninhomogenous and structured medium. the emission profiles cannot be reproducedby a single photo-dissociation region, clearly indicating that, besides thebar, there is a significant contribution from additional photo-dissociationregion(s) over the area studied. the combination of both the [nii] and [oi]145um lines can be used to estimate the [cii] emission and distinguish betweenits ionised or neutral origin. we have calculated how much [cii] emission comesfrom the neutral and ionised region, and find that at least 82% originates fromthe photo-dissocciation region. together, the [cii] 158um and [oi] 63 and 145umlines account for 90% of the power emitted by the main cooling lines in the bar(including co, h2, etc...), with [oi] 63um alone accounting for 72% of thetotal.

1111.7021	herschel observations of a potential core forming clump: perseus b1-e	we present continuum observations of the perseus b1-e region from theherschel gould belt survey. these herschel data reveal a loose grouping ofsubstructures at 160 - 500 micron not seen in previous submillimetreobservations. we measure temperature and column density from these data andselect the nine densest and coolest substructures for follow-up spectral lineobservations with the green bank telescope. we find that the b1-e clump has amass of ~ 100 solar masses and appears to be gravitationally bound.furthermore, of the nine substructures examined here, one substructure (b1-e2)appears to be itself bound. the substructures are typically less than a jeanslength from their nearest neighbour and thus, may interact on a timescale of ~1 myr. we propose that b1-e may be forming a first generation of dense cores,which could provide important constraints on the initial conditions ofprestellar core formation. our results suggest that b1-e may be influenced by astrong, localized magnetic field, but further observations are still required.

1112.4850	detection of warm water vapour in taurus protoplanetary discs by  herschel	line spectra of 68 taurus t tauri stars were obtained with the herschel-pacs(photodetector array camera &amp; spectrometer) instrument as part of the gasps(gas evolution in protoplanetary systems) survey of protoplanetary discs. acareful examination of the line scans centred on the [oi] 63.18 micronsfine-structure line unveiled a line at 63.32 micron in some of these spectra.we identify this line with a transition of ortho-water. it is detectedconfidently (i.e., &gt;3 sigma) in eight sources, i.e., 24% of the sub-sample withgas-rich discs. several statistical tests were used to search for correlationswith other disc and stellar parameters such as line fluxes of [oi] 6300armstrong and 63.18 microns; x-ray luminosity and continuum levels at 63microns and 850 microns. correlations are found between the water line fluxesand the [oi] 63.18 microns line luminosity, the dust continuum, and possiblywith the stellar x-ray luminosity. this is the first time that this line ofwarm water vapour has been detected in protoplanetary discs. we discuss itsorigins, in particular whether it comes from the inner disc and/or disc surfaceor from shocks in outflows and jets. our analysis favours a disc origin, withthe observed water vapour line produced within 2-3au from the central stars,where the gas temperature is of the order of 500-600 k.

1201.0797	the akari nep-deep survey: a mid-infrared source catalogue	we present a new catalogue of mid-ir sources using the akari nep-deep survey.the infrared camera (irc) onboard akari has a comprehensive mid-ir wavelengthcoverage with 9 photometric bands at 2 - 24 micron. we utilized all of thesebands to cover a nearly circular area adjacent to the north ecliptic pole(nep). we designed the catalogue to include most of sources detected in 7, 9,11, 15 and 18 micron bands, and found 7284 sources in a 0.67 deg^2 area. fromour simulations, we estimate that the catalogue is ~80 per cent complete to 200micro jy at 15 - 18 micron, and ~10 per cent of sources are missed, owing tosource blending. star-galaxy separation is conducted using only akariphotometry, as a result of which 10 per cent of catalogued sources are found tobe stars. the number counts at 11, 15, 18, and 24 micron are presented for bothstars and galaxies. a drastic increase in the source density is found inbetween 11 and 15 micron at the flux level of ~300 micro jy. this is likely dueto the redshifted pah emission at 8 micron, given our rough estimate ofredshifts from an akari colour-colour plot. along with the mid-ir sourcecatalogue, we present optical-nir photometry for sources falling inside asubaru/sprime-cam image covering part of the akari nep-deep field, which isdeep enough to detect most of akari mid-ir sources, and useful to study opticalcharacteristics of a complete mid-ir source sample.

1202.1413	the herschel view of the on-going star formation in the vela-c molecular  cloud	as part of the herschel guaranteed time key program 'hobys', we present thephotometric survey of the star forming region vela-c, one of the nearest sitesof low-to-high-mass star formation in the galactic plane. vela-c has beenobserved with pacs and spire in parallel mode between 70 um and 500 um over anarea of about 3 square degrees. a photometric catalogue has been extracted fromthe detections in each band, using a threshold of 5 sigma over the localbackground. out of this catalogue we have selected a robust sub-sample of 268sources, of which 75% are cloud clumps and 25% are cores. their spectral energydistributions (seds) have been fitted with a modified black body function. weclassify 48 sources as protostellar and 218 as starless. for two furthersources, we do not provide a secure classification, but suggest they are class0 protostars.  from sed fitting we have derived key physical parameters. protostellarsources are in general warmer and more compact than starless sources. boththese evidences can be ascribed to the presence of an internal source(s) ofmoderate heating, which also causes a temperature gradient and hence a morepeaked intensity distribution. moreover, the reduced dimensions of protostellarsources may indicate that they will not fragment further. a virial analysis ofthe starless sources gives an upper limit of 90% for the sourcesgravitationally bound and therefore prestellar. we fit a power law n(logm) propm^-1.1 to the linear portion of the mass distribution of prestellar sources.this is in between that typical of co clumps and those of cores in nearbystar-forming regions. we interpret this as a result of the inhomogeneity of oursample, which is composed of comparable fractions of clumps and cores.

1203.3403	the pipe nebula as seen with herschel: formation of filamentary  structures by large-scale compression ?	a growing body of evidence indicates that the formation of filaments ininterstellar clouds is a key component of the star formation process. in thispaper, we present new herschel pacs and spire observations of the b59 and stemregions in the pipe nebula complex, revealing a rich, organized network offilaments. the asymmetric column density profiles observed for severalfilaments, along with the bow-like edge of b59, indicates that the pipe nebulais being compressed from its western side, most likely by the winds from thenearby sco ob2 association. we suggest that this compressive flow hascontributed to the formation of some of the observed filamentary structures. inb59, the only region of the entire pipe complex showing star formationactivity, the same compressive flow has likely enhanced the initial columndensity of the clump, allowing it to become globally gravitationally unstable.although more speculative, we propose that gravity has also been responsiblefor shaping the converging filamentary pattern observed in b59. while thequestion of the relative impact of large-scale compression and gravity remainsopen in b59, large-scale compression appears to be a plausible mechanism forthe initial formation of filamentary structures in the rest of the complex

0711.0775	a scuba survey of bright-rimmed clouds	context: bright-rimmed clouds (brcs) are potential examples of triggered starformation regions, in which photoionisation driven shocks caused by theexpansion of hii regions induce protostellar collapse within the clouds. aims:the main purpose of the paper is to establish the level of star formationoccuring within a known set of brcs. a secondary aim is to determine theextent, if any, to which this star formation has been promulgated by theprocess of photoionisation triggering. methods:a primary set of observations ispresented obtained with submillimeter scuba observations and archival data fromnear-ir and mid- to far-ir have been explored for relevant observations andincorporated where appropriate. results:scuba observations show a total of 47dense cores within the heads of 44 observed brcs drawn from a catalogue of irassources embedded within hii regions, supportive of the scenario proposed by rdimodels. the physical properties of these cores indicate star formation acrossthe majority of our sample. this star formation appears to be predominately inthe regime of intermediate to high mass and may indicate the formation ofclusters. ir observations indicate the association of early star formingsources with our sample. a fundamental difference appears to exist betweendifferent morphological types of brc, which may indicate a differentevolutionary pathway toward star formation in the different types of brc.conclusions:bright-rimmed clouds are found to harbour star formation in itsearly stages. different evolutionary scenarios are found to exist for differentmorphological types of brc. the morphology of a brc is described as type `a',moderately curved rims, type `b', tightly curved rims, and `c', cometary rims.`b' and `c' morphological types...

1206.5442	a corona australis cloud filament seen in nir scattered light. iii.  modelling and comparison with herschel sub-millimetre data	with recent herschel observations, the northern filament of the coronaaustralis cloud has now been mapped in a number of bands from 1.2um to 870um.the data set provides a good starting point for the study of the cloud overseveral orders of magnitude in density. we wish to examine the differences ofthe column density distributions derived from dust extinction, scattering, andemission, and to determine to what extent the observations are consistent withthe standard dust models. from herschel data, we calculate the column densitydistribution that is compared to the corresponding data derived in thenear-infrared regime from the reddening of the background stars, and from thesurface brightness attributed to light scattering. we constructthree-dimensional radiative transfer models to describe the emission and thescattering. the scattered light traces low column densities of a_v~1mag betterthan the dust emission, remaining useful to a_v ~ 10-15 mag. based on themodels, the extinction and the level of dust emission are surprisinglyconsistent with a sub-millimetre dust emissivity typical of diffuse medium.however, the intensity of the scattered light is very low at the centre of thedensest clump and this cannot be explained without a very low grain albedo.both the scattered light and dust emission indicate an anisotropic radiationfield. the modelling of the dust emission suggests that the radiation fieldintensity is at least three times the value of the normal interstellarradiation field. the inter-comparison between the extinction, light scattering,and dust emission provides very stringent constraints on the cloud structure,the illuminating radiation field, and the grain properties.

1301.3805	herschel observations of the w3 gmc: clues to the formation of clusters  of high-mass stars	the w3 gmc is a prime target for the study of the early stages of high-massstar formation. we have used herschel data from the hobys key program toproduce and analyze column density and temperature maps. two preliminarycatalogs were produced by extracting sources from the column density map andfrom herschel maps convolved to the 500 micron resolution. herschel revealsthat among the compact sources (fwhm&lt;0.45 pc), w3 east, w3 west, and w3 (oh)are the most massive and luminous and have the highest column density.considering the unique properties of w3 east and w3 west, the only clumps withon-going high-mass star formation, we suggest a 'convergent constructivefeedback' scenario to account for the formation of a cluster with decreasingage and increasing system/source mass toward the innermost regions. thisprocess, which relies on feedback by high-mass stars to ensure the availabilityof material during cluster formation, could also lead to the creation of anenvironment suitable for the formation of trapezium-like systems. in commonwith other scenarios proposed in other hobys studies, our results indicate thatan active/dynamic process aiding in the accumulation, compression, andconfinement of material is a critical feature of the high-mass star/clusterformation, distinguishing it from classical low-mass star formation. theenvironmental conditions and availability of triggers determine the form inwhich this process occurs, implying that high-mass star/cluster formation couldarise from a range of scenarios: from large scale convergence of turbulentflows, to convergent constructive feedback or mergers of filaments.

1305.0155	dust around nearby stars. the survey observational results	debris discs are a consequence of the planet formation process and constitutethe fingerprints of planetesimal systems. their solar system's counterparts arethe asteroid and edgeworth-kuiper belts. the dunes survey aims at detectingextra-solar analogues to the edgeworth-kuiper belt around solar-type stars,putting in this way the solar system into context. the survey allows us toaddress some questions related to the prevalence and properties of planetesimalsystems. we used {\it herschel}/pacs to observe a sample of nearby fgk stars.data at 100 and 160 $\mu$m were obtained, complemented in some cases withobservations at 70 $\mu$m, and at 250, 350 and 500 $\mu$m using spire. theobserving strategy was to integrate as deep as possible at 100 $\mu$m to detectthe stellar photosphere. debris discs have been detected at a fractionalluminosity level down to several times that of the edgeworth-kuiper belt. theincidence rate of discs around the dunes stars is increased from a rate of$\sim$ 12.1% $\pm$ 5% before \emph{herschel} to $\sim$ 20.2% $\pm$ 2%. asignificant fraction ($\sim$ 52%) of the discs are resolved, which representsan enormous step ahead from the previously known resolved discs. some stars areassociated with faint far-ir excesses attributed to a new class of cold discs.although it cannot be excluded that these excesses are produced by coincidentalalignment of background galaxies, statistical arguments suggest that at leastsome of them are true debris discs. some discs display peculiar seds withspectral indexes in the 70-160$\mu$m range steeper than the rayleigh-jeans one.an analysis of the debris disc parameters suggests that a decrease might existof the mean black body radius from the f-type to the k-type stars. in addition,a weak trend is suggested for a correlation of disc sizes and ananticorrelation of disc temperatures with the stellar age.

1306.2855	herschel's "cold debris disks": background galaxies or quiescent rims of  planetary systems?	(abridged) infrared excesses associated with debris disk host stars detectedso far peak at wavelengths around ~100{\mu}m or shorter. however, six out of 31excess sources in the herschel otkp dunes have been seen to show significant -and in some cases extended - excess emission at 160{\mu}m, which is larger thanthe 100{\mu}m excess. this excess emission has been suggested to stem fromdebris disks colder than those known previously. using several methods, were-consider whether some or even all of the candidates may be associated withunrelated galactic or extragalactic emission and conclude that it is highlyunlikely that none of the candidates represents a true circumstellar disk. fortrue disks, both the dust temperatures inferred from the seds and the diskradii estimated from the images suggest that the dust is nearly as cold as ablackbody. this requires the grains to be larger than ~100{\mu}m, regardless oftheir material composition. to explain the dearth of small grains, we exploreseveral conceivable scenarios: transport-dominated disks, disks of lowdynamical excitation, and disks of unstirred primordial macroscopic grains. ourqualitative analysis and collisional simulations rule out the first two ofthese scenarios, but show the feasibility of the third one. we show that suchdisks can survive for gigayears, largely preserving the primordial sizedistribution. they should be composed of macroscopic solids larger thanmillimeters, but smaller than kilometers in size. thus planetesimal formation,at least in the outer regions of the systems, has stopped before "cometary" or"asteroidal" sizes were reached.

1311.3664	pillars and globules at the edges of h ii regions, confronting herschel  observations and numerical simulations	pillars and globules are present in many high-mass star-forming regions, suchas the eagle nebula (m16) and the rosette molecular cloud, and understandingtheir origin will help characterize triggered star formation. the formationmechanisms of these structures are still being debated. recent numericalsimulations have shown how pillars can arise from the collapse of the shell inon itself and how globules can be formed from the interplay of the turbulentmolecular cloud and the ionization from massive stars. the goal here is to testthis scenario through recent observations of two massive star-forming regions,m16 and rosette. the column density structure of the interface betweenmolecular clouds and h ii regions was characterized using column density mapsobtained from far-infrared imaging of the herschel hobys key programme. then,the disperse algorithm was used on these maps to detect the compressed layersaround the ionized gas and pillars in different evolutionary states. finally,their velocity structure was investigated using co data, and all observationalsignatures were tested against some distinct diagnostics established fromsimulations. the column density profiles have revealed the importance ofcompression at the edge of the ionized gas. the velocity properties of thestructures, i.e. pillars and globules, are very close to what we predict fromthe numerical simulations. we have identified a good candidate of a nascentpillar in the rosette molecular cloud that presents the velocity pattern of theshell collapsing on itself, induced by a high local curvature. globules have abulk velocity dispersion that indicates the importance of the initialturbulence in their formation, as proposed from numerical simulations.altogether, this study re-enforces the picture of pillar formation by shellcollapse and globule formation by the ionization of highly turbulent clouds.

1312.5146	can eccentric debris disks be long-lived? a first numerical  investigation and application to $\zeta^2$ reticuli	imaging of debris disks has found evidence for both eccentric and offsetdisks. one hypothesis is that these provide evidence for massive perturbersthat sculpt the observed structures. one such disk was recently observed in thefar-ir by the herschel space observatory around $\zeta^2$ ret. in contrast withpreviously reported systems, the disk is significantly eccentric, and thesystem is gyr-old. we aim to investigate the long-term evolution of eccentricstructures in debris disks caused by a perturber on an eccentric orbit. bothanalytical predictions and numerical n-body simulations are used to investigatethe observable structures that could be produced by eccentric perturbers. thelong-term evolution of the disk geometry is examined, with particularapplication to the $\zeta^2$ ret system. in addition, synthetic images of thedisk are produced for comparison with herschel observations. we show that aneccentric companion can produce both the observed offsets and eccentric disks.such effects are not immediate and we characterise the timescale required forthe disk to develop to an eccentric state. for the case of $\zeta^2$ ret, weplace limits on the mass and orbit of the companion required to produce theobservations. synthetic images show that the pattern observed around $\zeta^2$ret can be produced by an eccentric disk seen close to edge-on, and allow us tobring additional constraints on the disk parameters of our model (disk flux,extent). we determine that eccentric planets or stellar companions can inducelong-lived eccentric structures in debris disks. observations of such eccentricstructures provide potential evidence of the presence of such a companion in aplanetary system. we consider the example of $\zeta^2$ ret, whose observedeccentric disk can be explained by a distant companion at tens of au, on aneccentric orbit ($e_p\gtrsim 0.3$).

1401.6896	how dusty is alpha centauri? excess or non-excess over the infrared  photospheres of main-sequence stars	[abridged] debris discs around main-sequence stars indicate the presence oflarger rocky bodies. the components of the nearby binary acentauri have higherthan solar metallicities, which is thought to promote giant planet formation.we aim to determine the level of emission from debris in the acen system.having already detected the temperature minimum, tmin, of acena, we hereattempt to do so also for the companion acenb. using the acen stars astemplates, we study possible effects tmin may have on the detectability ofunresolved dust discs around other stars. we use herschel and apex photometryto determine the stellar spectral energy distributions. in addition, we useapex for spectral line mapping to study the complex background around acen seenin the photometric images. models of stellar atmospheres and discs are used toestimate the amount of debris around these stars. for solar-type stars, afractional dust luminosity fd 2e-7 could account for seds that do not exhibitthe tmin-effect. slight excesses at the 2.5 sigma level are observed at 24 mufor both stars, which, if interpreted to be due to dust, would correspond to fd(1-3)e-5. dynamical disc modelling leads to rough mass estimates of theputative zodi belts around the acen stars, viz. &lt;~4e-6 mmoon of 4 to 1000 musize grains, distributed according to n a^-3.5. similarly, for filled-in tminemission, corresponding ekbs could account for ~1e-3 mmoon of dust. lightscattered and/or thermally emitted by exo-zodi discs will have profoundimplications for future spectroscopic missions designed to search forbiomarkers in the atmospheres of earth-like planets. the f-ir sed of acenb ismarginally consistent with the presence of a minimum temperature region in theupper atmosphere. we also show that an acena-like temperature minimum mayresult in an erroneous apprehension about the presence of dust around otherstars.

1401.7333	ionization compression impact on dense gas distribution and star  formation, probability density functions around h ii regions as seen by  herschel	ionization feedback should impact the probability distribution function (pdf)of the column density around the ionized gas. we aim to quantify this effectand discuss its potential link to the core and initial mass function (cmf/imf).we used in a systematic way herschel column density maps of several regionsobserved within the hobys key program: m16, the rosette and vela c molecularcloud, and the rcw 120 h ii region. we fitted the column density pdfs of allclouds with two lognormal distributions, since they present a double-peak orenlarged shape in the pdf. our interpretation is that the lowest part of thecolumn density distribution describes the turbulent molecular gas while thesecond peak corresponds to a compression zone induced by the expansion of theionized gas into the turbulent molecular cloud. the condensations at the edgeof the ionized gas have a steep compressed radial profile, sometimesrecognizable in the flattening of the power-law tail. this could lead to anunambiguous criterion able to disentangle triggered from pre-existing starformation. in the context of the gravo-turbulent scenario for the origin of thecmf/imf, the double peaked/enlarged shape of the pdf may impact the formationof objects at both the low-mass and the high-mass end of the cmf/imf. inparticular a broader pdf is required by the gravo-turbulent scenario to fitproperly the imf with a reasonable initial mach number for the molecular cloud.since other physical processes (e.g. the equation of state and the variationsamong the core properties) have already been suggested to broaden the pdf, therelative importance of the different effects remains an open question.

1504.06642	the peculiar radio galaxy 4c 35.06: a case for recurrent agn activity?	using observations obtained with the low fequency array (lofar), thewesterbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt) and archival very large array (vla)data, we have traced the radio emission to large scales in the complex source4c 35.06 located in the core of the galaxy cluster abell 407. at higher spatialresolution (~4"), the source was known to have two inner radio lobes spanning31 kpc and a diffuse, low-brightness extension running parallel to them, offsetby about 11 kpc (in projection).  at 62 mhz, we detect the radio emission of this structure extending out to210 kpc. at 1.4 ghz and intermediate spatial resolution (~30"), the structureappears to have a helical morphology.  we have derived the characteristics of the radio spectral index across thesource. we show that the source morphology is most likely the result of atleast two episodes of agn activity separated by a dormant period of around 35myr.  the agn is hosted by one of the galaxies located in the cluster core of abell407. we propose that it is intermittently active as it moves in the denseenvironment in the cluster core. using lofar, we can trace the relic plasmafrom that episode of activity out to greater distances from the core than everbefore.  using the the wsrt, we detect hi in absorption against the center of theradio source. the absorption profile is relatively broad (fwhm of 288 km/s),similar to what is found in other clusters.  understanding the duty cycle of the radio emission as well as the triggeringmechanism for starting (or restarting) the radio-loud activity can provideimportant constraints to quantify the impact of agn feedback on galaxyevolution. the study of these mechanisms at low frequencies using morphologicaland spectral information promises to bring new important insights in thisfield.

1507.02055	herschel observations of the w3 gmc (ii): clues to the formation of  clusters of high-mass stars	the w3 gmc is a prime target for investigating the formation of high-massstars and clusters. this second study of w3 within the hobys key programprovides a comparative analysis of subfields within w3 to further constrain theprocesses leading to the observed structures and stellar population.probability density functions (pdfs) and cumulative mass distributions (cmds)were created from dust column density maps, quantified as extinction av. theshape of the pdf, typically represented with a lognormal function at low av"breaking" to a power-law tail at high av, is influenced by various processesincluding turbulence and self-gravity. the breaks can also be identified, oftenmore readily, in the cmds. the pdf break from lognormal (av(sf)= 6-10 mag)appears to shift to higher av by stellar feedback, so that high-massstar-forming regions tend to have higher pdf breaks. a second break at av &gt; 50mag traces structures formed or influenced by a dynamic process. because such aprocess has been suggested to drive high-mass star formation in w3, this secondbreak might then identify regions with potential for hosting high-massstars/clusters. stellar feedback appears to be a major mechanism driving thelocal evolution and state of regions within w3. a high initial star formationefficiency in a dense medium could result in a self-enhancing process, leadingto more compression and favourable star-formation conditions (e.g., collidingflows), a richer stellar content, and massive stars. this scenario would becompatible with the "convergent constructive feedback" model introduced in ourprevious herschel study.

1507.05926	a census of dense cores in the aquila cloud complex: spire/pacs  observations from the herschel gould belt survey	we present and discuss the results of the herschel gould belt surveyobservations in a ~11 deg^2 area of the aquila molecular cloud complex at d~260pc, imaged with the spire/pacs cameras from 70 to 500 micron. we identify acomplete sample of starless dense cores and embedded protostars in this region,and analyze their global properties and spatial distributions. we find a totalof 651 starless cores, ~60% of which are gravitationally bound prestellarcores, and they will likely form stars in the future. we also detect 58protostellar cores. the core mass function (cmf) derived for the prestellarcores is very similar in shape to the stellar initial mass function (imf),supporting the earlier view that there is a close physical link between the imfand the cmf. the global shift in mass scale observed between the cmf and theimf is consistent with a typical star formation efficiency of ~40%. bycomparing the numbers of starless cores to the number of young stellar objects,we estimate that the lifetime of prestellar cores is ~1 myr. we find a strongcorrelation between the spatial distribution of prestellar cores and thedensest filaments. about 90% of the herschel-identified prestellar cores arelocated above a background column density corresponding to a_v~7, and ~75% ofthem lie within filamentary structures with supercritical masses per unitlength &gt;~16 m_sun/pc. these findings support a picture wherein the cores makingup the peak of the cmf (and probably responsible for the base of the imf)result primarily from the gravitational fragmentation of marginallysupercritical filaments. given that filaments appear to dominate the massbudget of dense gas at a_v&gt;7, our findings also suggest that the physics ofprestellar core formation within filaments is responsible for a characteristic"efficiency" sfr/m_dense ~5+-2 x 10^-8 yr^-1 for the star formation process indense gas.

1510.01479	agn duty cycle estimates for the ultra-steep spectrum radio relic vlss  j1431.8+1331	steep spectrum radio sources associated with active galactic nuclei (agn) maycontain remnants of past agn activity episodes. novel instruments like the lowfrequency array (lofar) are enabling studies of these fascinating structures tobe made at tens to hundreds of mhz with sufficient resolution to analyse theircomplex morphology. our goal is to characterize the integrated and resolvedspectral properties of vlss j1431+1331 and estimate source ages based onsynchrotron radio emission models, thus putting constraints on the agn dutycycle. using a broad spectral coverage, we have derived spectral and curvaturemaps, and used synchrotron ageing models to determine the time elapsed from thelast time the source plasma was energized. we used lofar, giant metrewave radiotelescope (gmrt) and jansky very large array (vla) data. based on our ageinganalysis, we infer that the agn that created this source currently has very lowlevels of activity or that it is switched off. the derived ages for the largersource component range from around 60 to 130 myr, hinting that the agn activitydecreased or stopped around 60 myr ago. our analysis suggests that vlssj1431.8+1331 is an intriguing, two-component source. the larger component seemsto host a faint radio core, suggesting that the source may be an agn radiorelic. the spectral index we observe from the smaller component is distinctlyflatter at lower frequencies than the spectral index of the larger component,suggesting the possibility that the smaller component may be a shocked plasmabubble. from the integrated source spectrum, we deduce that its shape and slopecan be used as tracers of the activity history of this type of steep spectrumradio source.

1510.09175	from forced collapse to h ii region expansion in mon r2: envelope  density structure and age determination with herschel	the surroundings of hii regions can have a profound influence on theirdevelopment, morphology, and evolution. this paper explores the effect of theenvironment on h ii regions in the monr2 molecular cloud. we aim to investigatethe density structure of envelopes surrounding hii regions and to determinetheir collapse and ionisation expansion ages. the mon r2 molecular cloud is anideal target since it hosts an h ii region association. column density andtemperature images derived from herschel data were used together to model thestructure of hii bubbles and their surrounding envelopes. the resultingobservational constraints were used to follow the development of the mon r2ionised regions with analytical calculations and numerical simulations. thefour hot bubbles associated with h ii regions are surrounded by dense, cold,and neutral gas envelopes. the radial density profiles are reminiscent of thoseof low-mass protostellar envelopes. the inner parts of envelopes of all fourhii regions could be free-falling because they display shallow densityprofiles. as for their outer parts, the two compact hii regions show a densityprofile, which is typical of the equilibrium structure of an isothermal sphere.in contrast, the central uchii region shows a steeper outer profile, that couldbe interpreted as material being forced to collapse. the size of the heatedbubbles, the spectral type of the irradiating stars, and the mean initialneutral gas density are used to estimate the ionisation expansion time, texp,0.1myr,for the dense uchii and compact hii regions and 0.35 myr for theextended hii region. the envelope transition radii between the shallow andsteeper density profiles are used to estimate the time elapsed since theformation of the first proto stellar embryo, tinf : 1myr, for theultra-compact, 1.5 / 3myr for the compact, and greater than 6myr for theextended hii regions.

0810.2619	an investigation on the morphological evolution of bright-rimmed clouds	a new radiative driven implosion (rdi) model based on smoothed particlehydrodynamics (sph) technique is developed and applied to investigate themorphological evolutions of molecular clouds under the effect of ionisingradiation. this model self-consistently includes the self-gravity of the cloudin the hydrodynamical evolution, the uv radiation component in the radiationtransfer equations, the relevant heating and cooling mechanisms in the energyevolution and a comprehensive chemical network. the simulation results revealthat under the effect of ionising radiation, a molecular cloud may evolvethrough different evolutionary sequences. dependent on its initialgravitational state, the evolution of a molecular cloud does not necessarilyfollow a complete morphological evolution sequence from type a to b to c, asdescribed by previous rdi models. when confronted with observations, thesimulation results provide satisfactory physical explanations for a series ofpuzzles derived from bright-rimmed clouds (brcs) observations. the consistencyof the modelling results with observations shows that the self-gravity of amolecular cloud should not be neglected in any investigation on the dynamicalevolution of molecular clouds when they are exposed to ionising radiation.
