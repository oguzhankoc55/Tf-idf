0903.0838	highly structured wind in vela x-1	we present an in-depth analysis of the spectral and temporal behavior of along almost uninterrupted integral observation of vela x-1 in nov/dec 2003. inaddition to an already high activity level, vela x-1 exhibited several veryintense flares with a maximum intensity of more than 5 crab in the 20-40 kevband. furthermore vela x-1 exhibited several off states where the source becameundetectable with isgri. we interpret flares and off states as being due to thestrongly structured wind of the optical companion: when vela x-1 encounters acavity in the wind with strongly reduced density, the flux drops, thuspotentially triggering the onset of the propeller effect which inhibits furtheraccretion, thus giving rise to the off states. the required drop in density totrigger the propeller effect in vela x-1 is of the same order as predicted bytheoretical papers for the densities in the ob star winds. the same structuredwind can give rise to the giant flares when vela x-1 encounters a dense blob inthe wind. further temporal analysis reveals that a short lived qpo with aperiod of ~6800 sec is present. the part of the light curve during which theqpo is present is very close to the off states and just following a highintensity state, thus showing that all these phenomena are related.

0904.1896	episodic random accretion and the cosmological evolution of supermassive  black hole spins	the growth of supermassive black holes (bhs) located at the centers of theirhost galaxies comes mainly from accretion of gas, but how to fuel them remainsan outstanding unsolved problem in quasar evolution. this issue can beelucidated by quantifying the radiative efficiency parameter ($\eta$) as afunction of redshift, which also provides constraints on the average spin ofthe bhs and its possible evolution with time. we derive a formalism to link$\eta$ with the luminosity density, bh mass density, and duty cycle of quasars,quantities we can estimate from existing quasar and galaxy survey data. we findthat $\eta$ has a strong cosmological evolution: at z~2, $\eta \approx 0.3$,and by $z\approx 0$ it has decreased by an order of magnitude, to $\eta\approx0.03$. we interpret this trend as evolution in bh spin, and we appeal toepisodic, random accretion as the mechanism for reducing the spin. theobservation that the fraction of radio-loud quasars decreases with increasingredshift is inconsistent with the popular notion that bh spin is a criticalfactor for generating strong radio jets. in agreement with previous studies, weshow that the derived history of bh accretion closely follows the cosmichistory of star formation, consistent with other evidence that bhs and theirhost galaxies coevolve.

0911.3566	variable precession of the neutron star in her x-1	we present evidence for an identical behavior of the precession of theaccretion disk and that of the neutron star (ns) in her x-1, based oninvestigating the well established 35 day modulation in her x-1 in twodifferent ways: 1) following the turn-ons, thought to be due to the precessionof the accretion disk, and 2) following the re-appearance of the shape of thepulse profiles, which we assume to be due to precession of the ns. the turn-onevolution and the evolution of the phase-zero values of the precessing ns (asdetermined from the pulse profiles) track each other very closely. since theturn-on evolution is strongly correlated with the pulse period evolution, thismeans that there is also a strong correlation between the spin and theprecession of the ns. there is a very strong physical coupling between the nsand the accretion disk, we suggest through physical feedback in the binarysystem. the apparent long-term stability of the 35 d clock may be due to theinterior of the ns, the coupling of which to the observable surface effects isof general importance for the physics of super-dense, highly magnetizedmaterial.

1107.1118	her x-1: the positive cyclotron line energy / luminosity correlation	studies of some bright, super-eddington transient pulsars show a negativecorrelation between the energy of the cyclotron resonance scattering feature(crsf) and the bolometric luminosity. for her x-1, using repeated rxteobservations during 1996-2005, the inverse dependence was found: the energy ofthe cyclotron line increases as the luminosity increases. the x-ray fluxmeasured by the rxte/asm (2-10 kev) has been assumed to represent theluminosity - more precisely: the maximum x-ray flux reached during therespective 35 d main-on. here, we question whether the asm flux is really anaccurate measure of the bolometric luminosity of the source. we redeterminedthe energy of the cyclotron line and performed spectral fits using the combineddata from the pca (3.5-60 kev) and hexte (20-75 kev) instruments on rxte of thesame 35 d cycles as used in the original work to determine the bolometric fluxfrom those spectra. we confirm the result of the original analysis that thecyclotron line energy changes by ~7% for a change in flux by a factor of two.

(1986) thatfree precession of the neutron star may be responsible for the variation of thepulse profiles, we had developed physical models of strong feedback interactionbetween the neutron star and the accretion disk in order to explain theseemingly identical values for the periods of the two types of variations. in adeep analysis of pulse profiles observed by several different satellites overthe last three decades we find now that the clock behind the pulse profilevariations shows exactly the same erratic behavior as the turn-on clock, evenon short time scales (100 d), suggesting that there may in fact be only one 35d clock in the system. if this is true, it presents a serious challenge for theidea of free precession of the neutron star and calls for alternative physicalmodels for the variation in pulse shape.

1204.0978	the relative and absolute timing accuracy of the epic-pn camera on  xmm-newton, from x-ray pulsations of the crab and other pulsars	reliable timing calibration is essential for the accurate comparison ofxmm-newton light curves with those from other observatories, to ultimately usethem to derive precise physical quantities. the xmm-newton timing calibrationis based on pulsar analysis. however, as pulsars show both timing noise andglitches, it is essential to monitor these calibration sources regularly. tothis end, the xmm-newton observatory performs observations twice a year of thecrab pulsar to monitor the absolute timing accuracy of the epic-pn camera inthe fast timing and burst modes. we present the results of this monitoringcampaign, comparing xmm-newton data from the crab pulsar (psr b0531+21) withradio measurements. in addition, we use five pulsars (psr j0537-69, psrb0540-69, psr b0833-45, psr b1509-58 and psr b1055-52) with periods rangingfrom 16 ms to 197 ms to verify the relative timing accuracy. we analysed 38xmm-newton observations (0.2-12.0 kev) of the crab taken over the first tenyears of the mission and 13 observations from the five complementary pulsars.all the data were processed with the sas, the xmm-newton scientific analysissoftware, version 9.0. epoch folding techniques coupled with \chi^{2} testswere used to derive relative timing accuracies. the absolute timing accuracywas determined using the crab data and comparing the time shift between themain x-ray and radio peaks in the phase folded light curves. the relativetiming accuracy of xmm-newton is found to be better than 10^{-8}. the strongestx-ray pulse peak precedes the corresponding radio peak by 306\pm9 \mus, whichis in agreement with other high energy observatories such as chandra, integraland rxte. the derived absolute timing accuracy from our analysis is \pm48 \mus.

1205.5316	spectral formation in accreting x-ray pulsars: bimodal variation of the  cyclotron energy with luminosity	accretion-powered x-ray pulsars exhibit significant variability of thecyclotron resonance scattering feature (crsf) centroid energy on pulse-to-pulsetimescales, and also on much longer timescales. two types of spectralvariability are observed. for sources in group 1, the crsf energy is negativelycorrelated with the variable source luminosity, and for sources in group 2, theopposite behavior is observed. the physical basis for this bimodal behavior iscurrently not understood. we explore the hypothesis that the accretion dynamicsin the group 1 sources is dominated by radiation pressure near the stellarsurface, and that coulomb interactions decelerate the gas to rest in the group2 sources. we derive a new expression for the critical luminosity such thatradiation pressure decelerates the matter to rest in the supercritical sources.the formula for the critical luminosity is evaluated for 5 sources, using themaximum value of the crsf centroid energy to estimate the surface magneticfield strength. the results confirm that the group 1 sources are supercriticaland the group 2 sources are subcritical, although the situation is less clearfor those highly variable sources that cross over the critical line. we alsoexplain the variation of the crsf energy with luminosity as a consequence ofthe variation of the characteristic emission height. the sign of the heightvariation is opposite in the supercritical and subcritical cases, hencecreating the observed bimodal behavior.

0805.1811	integral observations of the variability of oao 1657-415	the galactic plane scan (gps) was one of the core observation programmes ofthe integral satellite. the highly variable accreting pulsar oao 1657-415 wasfrequently observed within the gps. we investigate the spectral and timingproperties of oao 1657-415 and their variability on short and long time scalesin the energy range 6-160 kev. during the time covered by the integralobservations, the pulse period evolution shows an initial spin-down, which isfollowed by an equally strong spin-up. in combining our results with historicalpulse period measurements (correcting them for orbital variation) and withstretches of continuous observations by batse, we find that the long-termperiod evolution is characterised by a long-term spin-up overlayed by sets ofrelative spin-down/spin-up episodes, which appear to repeat quasi-periodicallyon a 4.8 yr time scale. we measure an updated local ephemeris and confirm thepreviously determined orbital period with an improved accuracy. the spectraclearly change with pulse phase. the spectrum measured during the main peak ofthe pulse profile is particularly hard. we do not find any evidence of acyclotron line, wether in the phase-averaged spectrum or in phase-resolvedspectra.

0805.3411	the multiwavelength variability of 3c 273	we present an update of 3c 273's database hosted by the isdc, completed withdata from radio to gamma-ray observations over the last 10 years. we use thislarge data set to study the multiwavelength properties of thisquasar,especially focussing on its variability behaviour. we study theamplitude of the variations and the maximum variability time scales across thebroad-band spectrum and correlate the light curves in different bands,specifically with the x-rays, to search for possible connections between theemission at different energies. 3c 273 shows variability at all frequencies,with amplitudes and time scales strongly depending on the energy and being thesignatures of the different emission mechanisms. the variability properties ofthe x-ray band imply the presence of either two separate components (possibly aseyfert-like and a blazar-like) or at least two parameters with distinct timingproperties to account for the x-ray emission below and above ~20 kev. thedominant hard x-ray emission is most probably not due to electrons acceleratedby the shock waves in the jet as their variability does not correlate with theflaring millimeter emission, but seems to be associated to long-timescalevariations in the optical. this optical component is consistent with beingoptically thin synchrotron radiation from the base of the jet and the hardx-rays would be produced through inverse compton processes (ssc and/or ec) bythe same electron population. we show evidence that this synchrotron componentextends from the optical to the near-infrared domain, where it is blended byemission of heated dust that we find to be located within about 1 light-yearfrom the ultraviolet source.

astro-ph;0101110	discovery of a cyclotron resonant scattering feature in the rxte  spectrum of 4u 0352+309 (x per)	we have discovered a ~29 kev cyclotron resonant scattering feature (crsf) inthe x-ray spectrum of 4u 0352+309 (x per) using observations taken with therossi x-ray timing explorer. 4u 0352+309 is a persistent low luminosity (l_x =4.2x10^34 ergs/s) x-ray pulsar, with a 837 s period and which accretes materialfrom the be star x per. the x-ray spectrum, unusual when compared to brighteraccreting pulsars, may be due to the low mass accretion rate and could betypical of the new class of persistent low luminosity be/x-ray binary pulsars.we attempted spectral fits with continuum models used historically for 4u0352+309, and found that all were improved by the addition of a crsf at ~29kev. the model that best fit the observations is a combination of a 1.45+/-0.02kev blackbody with a 5.4x10^8 cm^2 area, and a power-law with a 1.83+/-0.03photon index modified by the crsf. in these fits the crsf energy is28.6+1.5-1.7 kev, implying a magnetic field strength of 2.5(1+z)x10^12 g in thescattering region (where z is the gravitational redshift). phase resolvedanalysis shows that the blackbody and cyclotron line energies are consistentwith being constant through the pulse.

astro-ph;0202258	long term variability of cyg x-1 i. x-ray spectral-temporal correlations  in the hard state	we present the long term evolution of the timing properties of the black holecandidate cygnus x-1 in the 0.002-128 hz frequency range as monitored from 1998to 2001 with the rxte. the hard state power spectral density (psd) is wellmodeled as the sum of four lorentzians, which describe distinct broad noisecomponents. before 1998 july, cyg x-1 was in a "quiet" hard state characterizedprimarily by the first three of these broad lorentzians. around 1998 may, thisbehavior changed: the total fractional rms amplitude decreased, the peakfrequencies of the lorentzians increased, the average time lag slightlyincreased, and the x-ray spectrum softened. the change in the timing parametersis mainly due to a strong decrease in the amplitude of the third lorentzian.since then, an unusually large number of x-ray flares have been observed.during these "failed state transitions", the x-ray power spectrum changes tothat of the intermediate state. modeling this psd with the four lorentzians, wefind that the first lorentzian component is suppressed relative to the secondand third lorentzian. also the frequency-dependent time lags increasesignificantly. we confirm the interpretation as failed state transitions withobservations from the 2001 jan. and 2001 oct. soft states. such behaviorsuggests that some or all of the lorentzian components are associated with theaccretion disk corona. we discuss the physical interpretation of our results.

astro-ph;0203213	a her x-1 turn-on: using the pulse profile to probe the outer edge of an  accretion disk	the x-ray binary pulsar her x-1 shows a wide variety of long and short termvariabilities in the x-ray light curve. the 35 d variability of the source isinterpreted as the influence of a warped, inclined, and twisted accretion diskperiodically covering the line of sight to the central neutron star. in 1997september we observed the ``turn-on'' of a 35 d cycle with the rossi x-raytiming explorer (rxte). spectral analysis reveals that during early phases ofthe turn-on the overall spectrum is composed of x-rays scattered into the lineof sight plus heavily absorbed x-rays. this interpretation is consistent withthe variation of the pulse profile observed at the same time. the overall shapeof the pulse profile is not changing, but towards earlier phases of the turn-onthe pulse signature is steadily ``washed out''. this behavior can be understoodas an influence of scattering and absorption due to the presence of theaccretion disk rim. using a monte carlo code we simulate the influence of bothprocesses on a time variable, beamed emission characteristic, similar to thepulse profile of her x-1. by comparing the results of the simulation with theobserved profiles we determine the amount of scattered radiation, absorbedradiation, and the size of the scattering region.

astro-ph;0401305	on the deep minimum state in the seyfert galaxy mcg-6-30-15	(abridged) we present a detailed spectral analysis of the first observationof the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg-6-30-15 by the european photon imaging camera onboard the xmm-newton observatory, together with contemporaneous data from theproportional counter array on the rossi x-ray timing explorer. confirming ourpreviously published result, we find that the presence of extremely broadenedreflection features from an ionized relativistic accretion disk is requiredeven when one employs the latest x-ray reflection models and includes theeffect of complex absorption. the extremely broadened reflection features arealso present if the primary continuum is modeled with a thermal comptonisationspectrum rather than a simple power-law continuum. with this fact established,we examine these data using a relativistic smearing function corresponding to a``generalized thin accretion disk'' model. we find strong evidence for torquingof the central parts of the accretion disk (presumably through magneticinteractions with the plunging region of the disk and/or the rotating blackhole itself). we also perform a study of spectral variability within ourobservation. we find that the disk reflection features maintain roughly aconstant equivalent width with respect to the observed continuum, as predictedby simple reflection models. taken together with other studies of mcg-6-30-15that find disk features to possess constant intensity at higher flux states, wesuggest that the flux of disk features undergoes a saturation once the sourceemerges from a deep minimum state.

astro-ph;0403197	timing and spectroscopy of accreting x-ray pulsars: the state of  cyclotron line studies	a great deal of emphasis on timing in the rxte era has been on pushing towardhigher and higher frequency phenomena, particularly khz qpos. however, thelarge areas of the rxte pointed instruments provide another capability which iskey for the understanding of accreting x-ray pulsars -- the ability toaccumulate high quality spectra in a limited observing time. for the accretingx-ray pulsars, with their relatively modest spin frequencies, this translatesinto an ability to study broad band spectra as a function of pulse phase. thisis a critical tool, as pulsar spectra are strong functions of the geometry ofthe "accretion mound" and the observers' viewing angle to the ~10^12 g magneticfield. in particular, the appearance of "cyclotron lines" is sensitivelydependent on the viewing geometry, which must change with the rotation of thestar. these spectral features, seen in only a handful of objects, are quiteimportant, as they give us our only direct measure of neutron star magneticfields. furthermore, they carry a great deal of information as to the geometryand physical conditions in the accretion mound. in this paper, we review thestatus of cyclotron line studies with the rxte. we present an overview ofphase-averaged results and give examples of observations which illustrate thepower of phase-resolved spectroscopy.

astro-ph;0407070	long term variability of cygnus x-1, iii. radio-x-ray correlations	long time scale radio-x-ray correlations in black holes during the hard statehave been found in many sources and there seems to emerge a universalunderlying relationship which quantitatively describes this behavior. althoughit would appear only natural to detect short term emission patterns in thex-ray and - with a certain time lag - in the radio, there has been littleevidence for this up to now. the most prominent source for radio-x-raycorrelations on short time scales (minutes) so far remains grs 1915+105 where asingle mass ejection could be detected successively in the x-ray, ir, and radiowavebands. we analyze a database of more than 4 years of simultaneousradio-x-ray data for cygnus x-1 from the ryle telescope and rxte pca/hexte. weconfirm the existence of a radio-x-ray correlation on long time scales,especially at hard energies. we show that apparent correlations on short timescales in the lightcurves of cygnus x-1 are most likely the coincidentaloutcome of white noise statistics. interpreting this result as a breakdown ofradio-x-ray correlations on shorter time scales, this sets a limit to the speedof the jet.

astro-ph;9601159	vertical structure and spectrum of accretion disks in active galactic  nuclei	radiation emitted from an accretion disk around a massive black hole is awidely discussed model for the uv/soft x-ray excess emission observed in thespectra of many agn. a self-consistent calculation of the structure and theemerging spectrum of geometrically thin alpha-accretion disks in agn ispresented. the central object is assumed to be a kerr black hole; fullrelativistic corrections are included. the local dissipation of gravitationalenergy is assumed to be entirely due to turbulence. since these disks aremainly supported by radiation pressure, the assumption that the viscous energyproduction is proportional to the total pressure leads to diverging temperaturestructures in the upper parts of the disk, where the total optical depths issmall. we therefore modify the standard expression for the turbulent viscosityby taking into account the radiative energy loss of turbulent elements in anoptically thin regime. compton scattering is treated in the fokker-planckapproximation using the kompaneets oparator. the absorption cross sectioncontains only free-free processes for a pure hydrogen atmosphere. we presentseveral calculations for various parameters such as the accretion rate, theviscosity parameter, the specific angular momentum of the black hole and theinclination angle of the observer. the resulting temperature and densityprofiles show that the disks are optically thick for compton scattering andeffectively optically thin for most frequencies. this leads to spectra that arediluted with respect to the photon number but contain a comptonized high energytail in order to carry the required energy flux. in addition the electrontemperature deviates strongly from the equilibrium temperature. therefore, themodel can in general account for the observed soft x--ray excess.

astro-ph;9706118	uv to x-ray spectra of radio-quiet quasars. comparison with accretion  disk models	we present uv to soft x-ray spectra of 31 radio-quiet quasars, comprisingdata from the iue ulda database and the rosat pointed observation phase. 90 %of the sample members show a soft x-ray excess above an underlying hard x-raypower law spectrum. particularly for the steep x-ray spectrum (alpha_energy &gt;1.5), low redshift subsample (17 objects) the x-ray spectral power law index isstrongly correlated with the optical to x-ray broad-band spectral indexalpha_ox, indicating that the main contribution to the soft x-ray and opticalemission is due to the same emission component. we model the uv/soft x-rayspectra in terms of thermal emission from a geometrically thin alpha-accretiondisk. the structure and radiation field of the disk is calculatedself-consistently and compton scattering is treated by the kompaneets equation.all relativistic effects on the disk structure and the emergent disk spectrumare included. satisfactory spectral fits of the uv and soft x-ray continuumspectra are achieved when additional non-thermal hard x-ray and ir power lawemission components are taken into account. the uv and soft x-ray spectra arewell described by emission resulting from accretion rates in the range ~0.1 to~0.3 times the eddington accretion rate. low mass/low redshift objects arefound to accret at &lt; 0.15 mdot_eddington. correlations of the accretion diskparameters with alpha_ox are discussed.

astro-ph;9712127	properties of the x-ray pulsar gx 301-2 in hard x-rays	in 1993-1994 a series of observations of the x-ray pulsar gx 301-2 by hexeonboard mir-kvant was made. a period of pulsations was measured (it variedbetween 675 and 678 s) and pulse profiles in different energy bands wereproduced. the measured luminosity in the 20-100 kev energy range changedsubstantially between 8x10^34 and 7x10^35 d^2 erg/s (d is the distance to thesource in kpc). the obtained spectrum is quite satisfactory described by thecanonical model for x-ray pulsars with gamma=1.3, e_c~23 kev, e_f~9 kev. itchanged weakly between the observations, but was softest at brightness maximum.significant variations of the spectral hardness over the pulse phase weredetected, but the accumulated data are insufficient to quantify variations inspectral parameters. no significant traces of cyclotron lines were found. aninterpretation of the pulse profiles as superposition of emissions from twoflat polar caps (with inclusion of gravitational lensing) leads to an estimateof the angle between the magnetic axis and axis of rotation of 40-70 deg and anangle between the direction to the observer and the rotation axis of 75-85 deg.

astro-ph;9804181	hard x-ray observations of the x-ray pulsar a0535+26	we present the results of the observations of the giant bursts from the x-raypu lsar a0535+26 made by hexe onboard mir-kvant in april 1989, november 1993and february 1994. the pulse periods were measured, pulse profiles in differentenergy bands were produced, and their variability was investigated.  the power density spectra (pds) in 2x10^(-3)-1 hz range is presented, whichshape is typical for flicker-noise processes, usually observed in black holecandidates. the noise rms grows with energy from ~20% at 20 kev to ~30% at 80kev. the source photon spectrum in the 15-200 kev energy range and itsvariability over the pulse phase are reported. approximately the shape of thespectrum can be described by the "canonical" model for x-ray pulsars withpower-law index g~1.1, cut-off energy e_c~23 kev and folding energy e_f~19 kev.all these parameters are weakly dependent on the luminosity. the mostsignificant deviation from this continuum is observed at ~100 kev in thespectrum of the main pulse maximum. this feature is interpreted as a cyclotronline. comparison of the hexe data with the data from batse/cgro (bildsten etal., 1997) shows that in the high luminosity state (l~10^38 erg/s) the pulsar'spulse profile differs substantially from the pulse profile in thelow-luminosity (l~5x10^36 erg/s) state. this difference is explained by thequalitative change of the polar cap structure with formation of the accretioncolumns.

astro-ph;9810282	vela x-1 as seen by rxte	we present results from four observations of the accreting x-ray pulsar velax-1 with rxte in 1996 february.  the light curves show strong pulse to pulse variations, while the averagepulse profiles are quite stable, similar to previous results. below 5kev thepulse profiles display a complex, 5-peaked structure with a transition to asimple, double peak above about 15kev.  we analyze phase-averaged, phase-resolved, and on-pulse minus off-pulsespectra. the best spectral fits were obtained using continuum models with asmooth high-energy turnover. in contrast, the commonly used power law withexponential cutoff introduced artificial features in the fit residuals. using apower law with a fermi-dirac cutoff modified by photoelectric absorption and aniron line, the best fit spectra are still unacceptable. we interpret largedeviations around 25 and 55kev as fundamental and second harmonic cyclotronabsorption lines. if this result holds true, the ratio of the line energiesseems to be larger than 2. phase resolved spectra show that the cyclotron linesare strongest on the main pulse while they are barely visible outside thepulses.

0809.4190	giant outburst of exo 2030+375: pulse-phase resolved analysis of  integral data	in june-september 2006 the be/x-ray binary exo 2030+375 experienced thesecond giant outburst since its discovery. the source was shown to have acomplicated pulse-averaged x-ray spectral continuum with possible evidence ofcyclotron absorption features. in this paper we present the first pulse-phaseresolved analysis of the broad band x-ray spectra of exo 2030+375 obtained withthe integral observatory close to the maximum and during the decay phase of thegiant outburst. we report a strong variability of the spectrum with pulsephase. alternative spectral continuum models are discussed. the dependence ofthe spectral parameters on pulse phase during the maximum of the outburst andthe evolution of the pulse profiles with time are qualitatively consistent withthe pulsar's emission diagram changing from the fan-beam geometry close to themaximum of the outburst to a combination of pencil and fan beams (of comparableintesities) at the end of the decay phase. evidence of a cyclotron absorptionline around 63 kev at the pulse phase interval preceeding the main peak of thepulse profile is present in the spectrum obtained close to the maximum of theoutburst.

0811.4045	two ~35 day clocks in her x-1: evidence for neutron star free precession	we present evidence for the existence of two ~35 day clocks in the her x-1/hzher binary system. ~35 day modulations are observed 1) in the turn-on cycleswith two on- and two off-states, and 2) in the changing shape of the pulseprofiles which re-appears regularly. the two ways of counting the 35 day cyclesare generally in synchronization. this synchronization did apparently breakdown temporarily during the long anomalous low (al3) which her x-1 experiencedin 1999/2000, in the sense that there must have been one extra turn-on cycle.our working hypothesis is that there are two clocks in the system, both with aperiod of about ~35 days: precession of the accretion disk (the less stable"turn-on clock") and free precession of the neutron star (the more stable"pulse profile clock"). we suggest that free precession of the neutron star isthe master clock, and that the precession of the accretion disk is basicallysynchronized to that of the neutron star through a feed-back mechanism in thebinary system. however, the turn-on clock can slip against its master when theaccretion disk has a very low inclination, as is observed to be the case duringal3. we take the apparent correlation between the histories of the turn-ons, ofthe anomalous lows and of the pulse period evolution, with a 5 yrquasi-periodicity, as evidence for strong physical interaction and feed-backbetween the major components in the system. we speculate that the 5 yr (10 yr)period is either due to a corresponding activity cycle of hz her or a naturalringing period of the physical system of coupled components. the questionwhether free precession really exists in neutron stars is of great importancefor the understanding of matter with supra-nuclear density.

0812.0766	integral observation of hard x-ray variability of the tev binary ls5039  / rx j1826.2-1450	ls 5039/rx j1826.2-1450 is one of the few high mass x-ray binary systems fromwhich radio and high energy tev emission has been observed. moreover,variability of the tev emission with orbital period was detected.  we investigate the hard x-ray (25 - 200kev) spectral and timing properties ofthe source with the monitoring ibis/isgri instrument on-board the integralsatellite.  we present the analysis of integral observations for a total of about 3 msecexposure time, including both public data and data from the key programme. wesearch for flux and spectral variability related to the orbital phase.  the source is observed to emit from 25 up to 200 kev and the emission isconcentrated around inferior conjunction. orbital variability in the hard x-rayband is detected and established to be in phase with the orbitally modulatedtev emission observed with h.e.s.s. for this energy range we determine anaverage flux for the inferior conjunction phase interval of $(3.54 \pm 2.30)\times 10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, and a flux upper limit for thesuperior conjunction phase interval of $1.45 \times 10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ (90% conf. level respectively). the spectrum for the inferiorconjunction phase interval follows a power law with an index $\gamma =2.0^{+0.2}_{-0.2} $ (90% conf. level).
