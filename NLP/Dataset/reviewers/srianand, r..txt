0902.3016	21-cm absorbers at intermediate redshifts	damped lyman-alpha systems (dlas) seen in the spectra of high-z qsos allow usto probe the physical conditions in protogalaxies. our understanding ofphysical conditions in dlas at high-z is primarily based on the absorptionlines of h_2 molecules and fine-structure transitions. another important way ofprobing the thermal state of interstellar medium in these systems is bystudying the 21-cm absorption in the spectra of background quasars. here wereport the main results of our gmrt survey to search for 21-cm absorption in arepresentative and unbiased sample of 35 dla candidates at 1.10&lt;z&lt;1.45. oursample of dla candidates is drawn from the strong mgii systems in sdss dr5 andhas resulted in discovery of 9 new 21-cm absorbers. prior to our survey onlyone 21-cm absorber was known in the redshift range: 0.7&lt;z&lt;2. this survey hasallowed us to investigate the dependence of detectability of 21-cm absorptionon the properties of uv absorption lines detected in sdss spectra and estimatethe number per unit redshift of 21-cm absorbers. our gmrt survey provides arepresentative sample of systems that can be used in combination with variousfollow-up observations: (1) for investigating the physical conditions in theabsorbing gas using spin temperature measurements, (2) for investigating theeffect of metallicity and dust content on the detectability of 21-cmabsorption, (3) for studying the morphology of the absorbing gas and (4) forprobing the time evolution of various fundamental constants. results from thefirst phase of our survey are presented in gupta et al.

0904.2878	a complete sample of 21-cm absorbers at z~1.3: giant metrewave radio  telescope survey using mgii systems	we present the results of a systematic giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt)survey of 21-cm absorption in a representative and unbiased sample of 35 strongmgii systems in the redshift range: zabs~1.10-1.45, 33 of which have w_r&gt;1 \aa.the survey using ~400hrs of telescope time has resulted in 9 new 21-cmdetections and stringent 21-cm optical depth upper limits (median 3-sigmaoptical depth per 10 km/s of 0.017) for the remaining 26 systems. this is byfar the largest number of 21-cm detections from any single survey ofintervening absorbers. prior to our survey no intervening 21-cm system wasknown in the above redshift range and only one system was known in the redshiftrange 0.7&lt;z&lt;1.5. we discuss the relation between the detectability of 21-cmabsorption and various properties of uv absorption lines. we show that if mgiisystems are selected with the following criteria, mgii doublet ratio &lt;1.3 andw_r(mgi)/w_r(mgii)&gt;0.3, then a detection rate of 21-cm absorption up to 90% canbe achieved. we estimate n_{21}, the number per unit redshift of 21-cmabsorbers with w_r(mg(ii)&gt;w_o and integrated optical depth tau_{21}&gt;tau_o andshow that n_{21} decreases with increasing redshift. in particular, for w_o=1.0\aa and tau_o&gt;0.3 km\s, n_{21} falls by a factor 4 from &lt;z&gt;=0.5 to &lt;z&gt;=1.3. theevolution seems to be stronger for stronger mgii systems. using a subsample ofsystems for which high frequency vlba images are available, we show that theeffect is not related to the structure of the background radio sources and ismost probably due to the evolution of the cold neutral medium filling factor inmgii systems. we find no correlation between the velocity spread of the 21-cmabsorption feature and w_r(mgii) at z~1.3.

0906.1585	diffuse molecular gas at high redshift: detection of co molecules and  the 2175 {\aa} dust feature at z=1.64	we present the detection of carbon monoxide molecules (co) at z=1.6408towards the quasar sdssj160457.50+220300.5 using the vlt ultraviolet and visualechelle spectrograph. co absorption is detected in at least two components inthe first six a-x bands and one d-x(5-0) inter-band system. this is the seconddetection of this kind along a quasar line of sight. the co absorption profilesare well modelled assuming a rotational excitation of co in the range 6&lt;tex&lt;16k, which is consistent with or higher than the temperature of the cmb radiationat this redshift. we derive a total co column density of n(co)=4e14 cm^-2. themeasured column densities of si, mgi, znii, feii and siii indicate a dustdepletion pattern typical of cold gas in the galactic disc. the backgroundquasar spectrum is significantly reddened (u-k~4.5 mag) and presents apronounced 2175 a dust absorption feature at the redshift of the co absorber.using a control sample of ~500 quasars we find the chance probability for thisfeature to be spurious is ~0.3%. we show that the sed of the quasar is wellfitted with a qso composite spectrum reddened with a lmc supershell extinctionlaw at the redshift of the absorber. it is noticeable that this quasar isabsent from the colour-selected sdss quasar sample. this demonstrates ourcurrent view of the universe may be biased against dusty sightlines. thesedirect observations of carbonaceous molecules and dust open up the possibilityof studying physical conditions and chemistry of diffuse molecular gas in highredshift galaxies.

0908.1574	evolution of the cosmological mass density of neutral gas from sloan  digital sky survey ii - data release 7	we present the results of a search for damped lyman-alpha (dla) systems inthe sloan digital sky survey ii (sdss), data release 7. we use a fullyautomatic procedure to identify dlas and derive their column densities. theprocedure is checked against the results of previous searches for dlas in sdss.we discuss the agreements and differences and show the robustness of ourprocedure. for each system, we obtain an accurate measurement of the absorber'sredshift, the hi column density and the equivalent width of associated metalabsorption lines, without any human intervention. we find 1426 absorbers with2.15 &lt; z &lt; 5.2 with log n(hi)&gt;=20, out of which 937 systems have log n(hi)&gt;=20.3. this is the largest dla sample ever built, made available to thescientific community through the electronic version of this paper. in thecourse of the survey, we discovered the intervening dla with highest hi columndensity known to date with log n(hi)=22.0+/-0.1. this single system provides astrong constraint on the high-end of the n(hi) frequency distribution nowmeasured with high accuracy. we show that the presence of a dla at the blue endof a qso spectrum can lead to important systematic errors and propose a methodto avoid them. this has important consequences for the measurement of thecosmological mass density of neutral gas at z~2.2 and therefore on ourunderstanding of galaxy evolution over the past 10 billion years.

0909.0018	sdss j092712.64+294344.0: recoiling black hole or merging galaxies?	we report long-slit spectroscopic observations of sdss j092712+294344carried-out at the recently commissioned 2m telescope in iucaa girawaliobservatory, india. this agn-like source is known to feature three sets ofemission lines at zem = 0.6972, 0.7020 and 0.7128. different scenarios such asa recoiling black hole after asymmetric emission of gravitational waves, binaryblack holes and possible merging systems are proposed for this object. we testthese scenarios by comparing our spectra with that from the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss), obtained 4 years prior to our observations. comparing theredshifts of [oiii]4960,5008 we put a 3 sigma limit on the relativeacceleration to be less than 32 km s^-1 yr^-1 between different emittingregions. using the 2d spectra obtained at different position angles we showthat the [oiii]5008 line from the zem = 0.7128 component is extended beyond thespectral point spread function. we infer the linear extent of this lineemitting region is ~8 kpc. we also find a tentative evidence for an offsetbetween the centroid of the [oiii]5008 line at zem = 0.7128 and the qso tracewhen the slit is aligned at a position angle of 299 degrees. this correspondsto the zem = 0.7128 system being at an impact parameter of ~1 kpc with respectto the zem = 0.6972 in the north west direction. based on our observations weconclude that the binary black hole model is most unlikely. the spatial extentand the sizes are consistent with both black hole recoil and merging scenarios.

0909.0464	optical identification of xmm sources in the cfhtls	we present optical spectroscopic identifications of x-ray sources in ~3square degrees of the xmm-large scale structure survey (xmm-lss), also coveredby the canada france hawaii telescope legacy survey (cfhtls), obtained with theaaomega instrument at the anglo australian telescope. in a flux limited sampleof 829 point like sources in the optical band with g' &lt;~22 mag and the 0.5-2kev flux &gt; 1x10^{-15}erg/cm^2/s, we observed 695 objects and obtained reliablespectroscopic identification for 489 sources, ~59% of the overall sample. wetherefore increase the number of identifications in this field by a factorclose to five. galactic stellar sources represent about 15% of the total(74/489). about 55% (267/489) are broad-line active galactic nuclei (agns)spanning redshifts between 0.15 and 3.87 with a median value of 1.68. theoptical-to-x-ray spectral index of the broad-line agns is 1.47, typical ofoptically-selected type i quasars and is found to correlate with the rest framex-ray and optical monochromatic luminosities at 2 kev and 2500 angstromsrespectively. consistent with previous studies, we find alpha_ox not to becorrelated with z. in addition, 32 and 116 x-ray sources are, respectivelyabsorption and emission-line galaxies at z&lt;0.76. from a line ratio diagnosticdiagram it is found that in about 50% of these emission line galaxies, theemission lines are powered significantly by the agn. thirty of the xmm sourcesare detected at one or more radio frequencies. in addition, 24 sources haveambiguous identification: in 8 cases, two xmm sources have a single opticalsource within 6 arcsecs of each of them, whereas, 2 and 14 xmm sources have,respectively, 3 and 2 possible optical sources within 6 arcsecs of each ofthem.

0912.0736	quasars probing intermediate redshift star-forming galaxies	we present a sample of 46 [oiii]-emitting galaxies at z&lt;0.8 detected in thefibre spectra of quasars from the sdss-dr7 through an automatic searchprocedure. we also detect [oii] and hb emission lines from most of thesegalaxies in the sdss spectra. we study both the emission and absorptionproperties of a sub-sample of 17 galaxies in the redshift range z=0.4-0.7,where mgii lines are covered by the sdss spectra. the measured lower-limits onthe star-formation rates of these galaxies are in the range 0.2-20 m_sun/yr.the emission line luminosities and (o/h) metallicities from r23 measured inthis sample are similar to what is found in normal galaxies at these redshifts.thus, this constitutes a unique sample of intermediate redshift star-forminggalaxies where we can study the qso absorber - galaxy connection. strong mgii(w&gt;1a) as well as mgi absorption lines are detected in the qso spectra at theredshift of most of these galaxies. strong feii (w&gt;1a) absorption lines arealso generally detected whenever the appropriate wavelength ranges are covered.this suggests that most of these systems could be bona-fide damped lyman-alphasystems. we investigate various possible relations between the mgii restequivalent widths and the emission line properties. we find a possible (2sigma) correlation between the emission-line metallicity of the galaxies andthe mgii rest equivalent width of the absorbers [truncated].

1002.2107	hd molecules at high redshift: the absorption system at z=2.3377 towards  q 1232+082	we present a detailed analysis of the h_2 and hd absorption lines detected inthe damped lyman-alpha (dla) system at z_abs=2.3377 towards the quasarq1232+082. we show that this intervening cloud has a covering factor smallerthan unity and covers only part of the qso broad emission line region. the zeroflux level has to be corrected at the position of the saturated h_2 andoptically thin hd lines by about 10%. we accurately determine the dopplerparameter for hd and ci lines (b = 1.86+/-0.20 km/s). we find a ration(hd)/n(h_2)=(7.1 +3.7 -2.2)x10^-5 that is significantly higher than what isobserved in molecular clouds of the galaxy. chemical models suggest that in thephysical conditions prevailing in the central part of molecular clouds,deuterium and hydrogen are mostly in their molecular forms. assuming this istrue, we derive d/h = (3.6 +1.9 -1.1)x10^-5. this implies that thecorresponding baryon density of the universe is \omega_b h^2 = (0.0182 +0.0047-0.0042). this value coincides within 1\sigma with that derived fromobservations of the cmbr as well as from observations of the d/h atomic ratioin low-metallicity qso absorption line systems. the observation of hd at highredshift is therefore a promising independent method to constrain \omega_b.this observation indicates as well a low astration factor of deuterium. thiscan be interpreted as the consequence of an intense infall of primordial gasonto the associated galaxy.

1002.4620	detection of 21-cm, h2 and deuterium absorption at z&gt;3 along the  line-of-sight to j1337+3152	we report the detection of 21-cm and h2 absorption lines in the same dlasystem (log n(hi)=21.36+-0.10) at zabs=3.17447 towards sdssj133724+315254(z=3.174). we estimate the spin temperature of the gas to be, ts~600 k,intermediate between the expected values for cold and warm neutral media. thissuggests that the hi absorption originates from a mixture of different phases.the total molecular fraction is low, f=10^-7, and h2 rotational levelpopulations are not in equilibrium. the average abundance of the alpha-elementsis, [s/h]=-1.45. n and fe are found underabundant with respect toalpha-elements by ~1.0 dex and ~0.5 dex respectively. using photoionizationmodels we conclude that the gas is located more than 270 kpc away from the qso.while the position of 21-cm absorption line coincides with the h2 velocityprofile, their centroid are shifted by 2.7+-1.0 km/s from each other. however,the position of the strongest metal absorption component matches the positionof the 21-cm absorption line within 0.5 km/s. from this, we constrain thevariation of the combination of fundamental constants x=alpha^2 gp/mu, deltax/x=-(1.7+-1.7)x10^-6. this system is unique as we can at the same time have anindependent constrain on mu using h2 lines. however only werner band absorptionlines are seen and the range of sensitivity coefficients is too narrow toprovide a stringent constraint: delta mu/mu &lt;= 4.0x10^-4. the vlt/uves spectrumreveals another dla at zabs=3.16768 with log n(hi)=20.41+-0.15 and lowmetallicity, [si/h]=-2.68+-0.11. we derive log n(di)/n(hi)=-(4.93+-0.15) inthis system. this is a factor of two smaller than the value expected from thebest fitted value of omega_b from the wmap 5 yr data. this confirms thepresence of astration of deuterium even at very low metallicity.

0707.4479	excitation mechanisms in newly discovered h2-bearing damped lyman-alpha  clouds: systems with low molecular fractions	we probe the physical conditions in high-redshift damped ly-alpha systemsusing the observed molecular fraction and the rotational excitation ofmolecular hydrogen. we report two new detections of h2 at z = 2.402 and 1.989toward, respectively, he 0027-1836 and he 2318-1107. we also present a detailedanalysis of our recent h2 detection toward q2343+125. all three systems havelow molecular fractions, log f &lt; -4, with f = 2n(h2)/(2n(h2) + n(hi)). only onesuch h2 system was known previously. the depletion patterns for si, s, ti, cr,mn, fe and ni in the three systems are found to be very similar to what isobserved in diffuse gas of the galactic halo. h2 absorption from rotationallevels up to j = 5 is observed in a single component toward he 0027-1836. weshow that the width (doppler parameter) of the h2 lines increases withincreasing j and that the kinetic energy derived from the doppler parameter islinearly dependent on the relative energy of the rotational levels. theexcitation temperature is found to be 90 k for j = 0 to j = 2 and ~500 k forhigher j levels. single isothermal pdr models fail to reproduce the observedrotational excitations. a two-component model is needed: one component of lowdensity (~50 cm-3) with weak illumination (chi = 1) to explain the j &lt;= 2rotational levels and another of high density (~500 cm-3) with strongillumination (chi = 30) for j &gt;= 3 levels. however, the juxtaposition of thesetwo pdr components may be ad-hoc and the multicomponent structure could resulteither from turbulent dissipation or c-shocks.

1007.0288	gmrt mini-survey to search for 21-cm absorption in quasar-galaxy pairs  at z~0.1	we present the results from our 21-cm absorption survey of a sample of 5quasar-galaxy pairs (qgps), with the redshift of the galaxies in the range0.03&lt;zg&lt;0.18, selected from the sdss. the hi 21-cm absorption was searchedtowards the 9 sight lines with impact parameters ranging from 10 to 55 kpcusing gmrt. 21-cm absorption was detected only in one case i.e. towards thequasar (zq=2.625 sdss j124157.54+633241.6)-galaxy (zg=0.143 sdssj124157.26+633237.6) pair with the impact parameter 11 kpc. the quasar sightline in this case pierces through the stellar disk of a galaxy having nearsolar metallicity (i.e (o/h)+12=8.7) and star formation rate uncorrected fordust attenuation of 0.1 m_odot/yr. the quasar spectrum reddened by theforeground galaxy is well fitted with the milky way extinction curve (with anav of 0.44) and the estimated hi column density is similar to the valueobtained from 21-cm absorption assuming spin temperature of 100k. combining oursample with the z&lt;0.1 data available in the literature, we find thedetectability of 21-cm absorption with integrated optical depth greater than0.1 km\s to be 50% for the impact parameter less than 20 kpc. using the surfacebrightness profiles and relationship between the optical size and extent of thehi disk known for nearby galaxies, we conclude that in most of the cases of21-cm absorption non-detection, the sight lines may not be passing through thehi gas. we also find that in comparison to the absorption systems associatedwith these qgps, z&lt;1 dlas with 21-cm absorption detections have lower caiiequivalent widths despite having higher 21-cm optical depths and smaller impactparameters. this suggests that the current sample of dlas may be a biasedpopulation that avoids sight lines through dusty star-forming galaxies. asystematic survey of qgps is needed to confirm these findings and understandthe nature of 21-cm absorbers.

1008.0637	a translucent interstellar cloud at z=2.69: co, h2 and hd in the  line-of-sight to sdss j123714.60+064759.5	we present the analysis of a sub-dla system (log n(h^0)=20.0+/-0.15,z_abs=2.69) toward sdss j123714+064759 (z_em=2.78). using the vlt/uves andx-shooter spectrographs, we detect h2, hd and co molecules in absorption withlog n(h2,hd,co)=(19.21,14.48,14.17). the overall metallicity of the system issuper-solar ([zn/h]=+0.34) and iron is highly depleted ([fe/zn]=-1.39),revealing metal-rich and dusty gas. the strongest h2 component does notcoincide with the centre of the hi absorption. this implies that the molecularfraction in this component, f=2n(h2)/(2n(h2)+n(h^0)), is larger than the meanmolecular fraction &lt;f&gt;=1/4 in the system. this is supported by the detection ofcl^0 associated with this h2-component having n(cl^0)/n(cl^+)&gt;0.4. since cl^0is tied up to h2 by charge exchange reactions, this means that the molecularfraction in this component is not far from unity. the size of the molecularcloud is probably smaller than 1pc. both the co/h2=10^-5 and co/c^0~1 ratiosfor f&gt;0.24 indicate that the cloud classifies as translucent, i.e., a regimewhere carbon is found both in atomic and molecular form. the correspondingextinction, av=0.14, albeit lower than the definition of a translucentsightline (based on extinction properties), is high for the observed h^0 columndensity. this means that intervening clouds with similar local properties butwith larger column densities could be missed by current magnitude-limited qsosurveys. the excitation of co is dominated by radiative interaction with thecosmic microwave background radiation (cmbr) and we derive tex(co)=10.5+0.8-0.6k when tcmbr(z=2.69)=10.05 k is expected. the astration factor of deuterium-with respect to the primordial d/h ratio- is only about 3. this can be theconsequence of accretion of unprocessed gas from the intergalactic medium ontothe associated galaxy.

1009.1395	the lyman-alpha emission of high-z damped lyman-alpha systems	using a spectral stacking technique we searched for the average \lya emissionfrom high-z damped \lya (dla) galaxies detected in the sloan digital sky surveyqso spectra. we used a sample of 341 dlas of mean redshift &lt;z&gt;= 2.86 and logn(hi) &gt; 20.62 to place a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 3.0 \times 10^{-18} ergs^{-1} cm^{-2} on the \lya flux emitted within $\sim$1.5 arcsec (or 12 kpc)from the qso line of sight. this corresponds to an average \lya luminosity of &lt;2 \times 10^{41} erg s^{-1} or 0.03 $l_\star$(\lya). this limit is deeper thanthe limit of most surveys for faint \lya emitters. the lack of \lya emission indlas is consistent with the in situ star formation, for a given n(hi), beingless efficient than what is seen in local galaxies. thus, the overall dlapopulation seems to originate from the low luminosity end of the high redshift\lya emitting galaxies and/or to be located far away from the star formingregions. the latter may well be true since we detect strong ovi absorption inthe stacked spectrum, indicating that dlas are associated with a highly ionizedphase possibly the relics of galactic winds and/or originating from coldaccretion flows. we find the contribution of dla galaxies to the global starformation rate density to be comparatively lower than that of lyman breakgalaxies.

1012.2425	x-ray and optical properties of broad absorption line quasars in the  canada-france-hawaii telescope legacy survey	we study the x-ray and optical properties of 16 broad absorption line (bal)quasars detected in about 3 degree square region common to the wide synoptic(w-1) component of the canada-france-hawaiitelescope legacy survey (cfhtls) andthe xmm large scale structure survey (xmm-lss). the bal fraction is found to be10% in full sample, 7% for the optical colour selected qsos and as high as 33%if we consider qsos selected from their ir colours. the x-ray detected non-baland bal quasars have a mean observed x-ray-to-optical spectral slope of -1.47+/- 0.13 and -1.66 +/- 0.17 respectively. we also find that the bal qsos havealpha_ox systematically smaller than what is expected from the relationshipbetween optical luminosity and alpha_ox as derived from our sample. based onthis, we show, as already reported in the literature for quasars with highoptical luminosities, our new sample of bal qsos have x-ray luminosity a factorof three smaller than what has been found for non-bal qsos with similar opticalluminosities. comparison of hardness ratio of the bal and non-bal qsos suggestsa possible soft x-ray weakness of bal qsos. combining our sample, of relativelyfainter qsos, with others from the literature we show that larger balnicityindex (bi) and maximum velocity (v_max) of the c iv absorption are correlatedwith steeper x-ray to optical spectral index. we argue that this is most likelya consequence of the existence of a lower envelope in the distribution of bi(or v_max) values versus optical luminosity. our results thus show that thepreviously known x-ray weakness of bal qsos extends to lower opticalluminosities as well.

1107.4808	partial coverage of the broad line region of q1232+082 by an intervening  h2-bearing cloud	we present a detailed analysis of the partial coverage of the q1232+082 (z_em=2.57) broad line region by an intervening h_2-bearing cloud at z_abs=2.3377.using curve of growth analysis and line profile fitting, we demonstrate thatthe h_2-bearing component of the cloud covers the qso intrinsic continuumsource completely but only part of the broad line region (blr). we find thatonly 48\pm6 % of the c iv blr emission is covered by the c i absorbing gas. weobserve residual light (~6 %) as well in the bottom of the o i {\lambda}1302absorption from the cloud, redshifted on top of the qso lyman-{\alpha} emissionline. therefore the extent of the neutral phase of the absorbing cloud is notlarge enough to cover all of the background source. the most likely explanationfor this partial coverage is the small size of the intervening cloud, which iscomparable to the blr size. we estimate the number densities in the cloud:n_h2~110 cm^{-3} for the h_2-bearing core and n_h ~30 cm^{-3} for the neutralenvelope. given the column densities, n(h2)=(3.71\pm0.97)\times10^19 cm^{-2}and n(h i)=(7.94\pm1.6)\times10^20 cm^{-2}, we derive the linear size of theh_2-bearing core and the neutral envelope along the line of sight to bel_h2~0.15^{+0.05}_{-0.05} pc and l_hi~8.2^{+6.5}_{-4.1} pc, respectively. weestimate the size of the c iv blr by two ways (i) extrapolating size-luminosityrelations derived from reverberation observations and (ii) assuming that theh_2-bearing core and the blr are spherical in shape and the results are ~0.26and ~0.18 pc, respectively. the large size we derive for the extent of theneutral phase of the absorbing cloud together with a covering factor of ~0.94of the lyman-{\alpha} emission means that the lyman-{\alpha} blr is probablyfully covered but that the lyman-{\alpha} emission extends well beyond thelimits of the blr.

1112.1438	search for cold gas in z&gt;2 damped lyman-alpha systems: 21-cm and h_2  absorption	(abridged) we present the results of a systematic gbt and gmrt survey for21-cm absorption in a sample of 10 dlas at 2&lt;z_abs&lt;3.4. analysis of l-band vlbaimages of the background qsos are also presented. we detect 21-cm absorption inonly one dla (at z_abs = 3.1745 towards j1337+3152). combining our data withthe data from the literature (a sample of 28 dlas) and assuming the measuredcore fraction at milliarcsecond scale to represent the gas covering factor, wefind that the hi gas in dlas at z&gt; 2 is predominantly constituted by wnm. thedetection rate of 21-cm absorption seems to be higher for systems with highern(hi) or metallicity. however, no clear correlation is found between theintegrated 21-cm optical depth (or spin temperature) and either n(hi),metallicity or velocity spread of the low ionization species. there are 13 dlasin our sample for which high resolution optical spectra covering the expectedwavelength range of h_2 absorption are available. we report the detection ofh_2 molecules in the z_abs = 3.3871 21-cm absorber towards j0203+1134 (pks0201+113). in 8 cases, neither h_2 nor 21-cm absorption are detected. the lackof 21-cm and h_2 absorption in these systems can be explained if most of the hiin these dlas originate from low density high temperature gas. in one case wehave a dla with 21-cm absorption not showing h_2 absorption. in two cases, bothspecies are detected but do not originate from the same velocity component. inthe remaining 2 cases 21-cm absorption is not detected despite the presence ofh_2 with evidence for the presence of cold gas. all this is consistent with theidea that the h_2 components seen in dlas are compact (with sizes of &lt; 15 pc)and contain only a small fraction (i.e typically &lt;10%) of the total n(hi)measured in the dlas.

1201.0431	dynamically evolving mg ii broad absorption line flow in sdss  j133356.02+001229.1	we report a dynamically evolving low ionization broad absorption line flow inthe qso sdss j133356.02+001229.1 (at z_em = 0.9197). these observations arepart of our ongoing monitoring of low ionization broad absorption line (bal)qsos with the 2m telescope at iucaa girawali observatory (igo). the broad mg iiabsorption with an ejection velocity of 1.7x10^4 km/s, found in the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) spectra, has disappeared completely in our igospectra. we found an emerging new component at an ejection velocity of 2.8 x10^4 km/s. during our monitoring period this component has shown strongevolution both in its velocity width and optical depth and nearly disappearedin our latest observations. acceleration of a low velocity component seen insdss spectrum to a higher velocity is unlikely as the mg ii column densitiesare always observed to be higher for the new component. we argue that theobserved variations may not be related to ionization changes and are consistentwith absorption produced by multi-streaming flow transiting across our line ofsight. we find a possible connection between flux variation of the qso and n(mgii) of the newly emerged component. this could mean the ejection beingtriggered by changes in the accretion disk or dust reddening due to theoutflowing gas.

1202.0280	discovery of a compact gas-rich dla galaxy at z = 2.2: evidences for a  starburst-driven outflow	we present the detection of ly-alpha, [oiii] and h-alpha emission associatedwith an extremely strong dla system (n(hi) = 10^22.10 cm^-2) at z=2.207 towardsthe quasar sdss j113520-001053. this is the largest hi column density evermeasured along a qso line of sight, though typical of what is seen in grb-dlas.this absorption system also classifies as ultrastrong mgii system withw2796_r=3.6 a. the mean metallicity of the gas ([zn/h]=-1.1) and dust depletionfactors ([zn/fe]=0.72, [zn/cr]=0.49) are consistent with (and only marginallylarger than) the mean values found in the general qso-dla population. the[oiii]-ha emitting region has a very small impact parameter with respect to theqso line of sight, b=0.1", and is unresolved. from the ha line, we measuresfr=25 msun/yr. the ly-a line is double-peaked and is spatially extended. morestrikingly, the blue and red ly-a peaks arise from distinct regions extendedover a few kpc on either side of the star-forming region. we propose that thisis the consequence of ly-a transfer in outflowing gas. the presence ofstarburst-driven outflows is also in agreement with the large sfr together witha small size and low mass of the galaxy (mvir~10^10 msun). from the stellar uvcontinuum luminosity of the galaxy, we estimate an age of at most a few 10^7yr, again consistent with a recent starburst scenario. we interpret the data asthe observation of a young, gas rich, compact starburst galaxy, from whichmaterial is expelled through collimated winds powered by the vigorous starformation activity. we substantiate this picture by modelling the radiativetransfer of ly-a photons in the galactic counterpart. though our model (aspherical galaxy with bipolar outflowing jets) is a simplistic representationof the true gas distribution and velocity field, the agreement between theobserved and simulated properties is particularly good.

0711.0335	on the enhanced cosmic-ray ionization rate in the diffuse cloud towards  zeta persei	the spatial distribution of the cosmic-ray flux is important in understandingthe interstellar medium (ism) of the galaxy. this distribution can be analyzedby studying different molecular species along different sight lines whoseabundances are sensitive to the cosmic-ray ionization rate. recently severalgroups have reported an enhanced cosmic-ray ionization rate in diffuse cloudscompared to the standard value, zeta(average)=2.5e-17 s^-1, measured towarddense molecular clouds. in an earlier work we reported an enhancement in thecosmic ray rate of 20 towards hd185418. mccall et al. have reportedenhancements of 48 towards zeta persei based on the observed abundance ofh$_{3}^+ while le petit et al. found a cosmic ray enhancement of ~10 to beconsistent with their models for this same sight line. here we revisit zetapersei and perform a detailed calculation using a self-consistent treatment ofthe hydrogen chemistry, grain physics, energy and ionization balance, andexcitation physics. we show that the value of zeta deduced from the h$_{3}^+$column density in the diffuse region of the sightline depends strongly on theproperties of the grains because they remove free electrons and change thehydrogen chemistry. the observations are largely consistent with a cosmic rayenhancement of 40, with several diagnostics indicating higher values. thisunderscores the importance of a full treatment of grain physics in studies ofinterstellar chemistry.

1204.3629	probing the time variability of five fe low broad absorption line  quasars	we study the time variability of five fe low ionization broad absorption line(felobal) qsos using repeated spectroscopic observations with the 2m telescopeat iucaa girawali observatory (igo) spanning an interval of upto 10 years. wereport a dramatic variation in al iii and fe iii fine-structure lines in thespectra of sdss j221511.93-004549.9 (z_em ~ 1.478). however, there is no suchstrong variability shown by the c iv absorption. this source is known to beunusual with (i) the continuum emission dominated by fe emission lines, (ii) feiii absorption being stronger than fe ii and (iii) the apparent ratio of fe iiiuv 48 to fe iii uv 34 absorption suggesting an inverted population ratio. thisis the first reported detection of time variability in the fe iiifine-structure lines in qso spectra. there is a strong reduction in theabsorption strength of these lines between year 2000 and 2008. using thetemplate fitting techniques, we show that the apparent inversion of strength ofuv lines could be related to the complex spectral energy distribution of thisqso. the observed variability can be related to change in the ionization stateof the gas or due to transverse motion of this absorbing gas. the shortestvariability timescale of al iii line gives a lower limit on the electrondensity of the absorbing gas as n_e &gt;= 1.1 x 10^4 cm^-3. the remaining 4felobals do not show any changes beyond the measurement uncertainties either inoptical depth or in the velocity structure. we present the long-termphotometric light curve for all of our sources. among them only sdssj221511.93-004549.9 shows significant (&gt;= 0.2 mag) variability.

1205.4029	search for cold gas in strong mgii absorbers at 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.5: nature and  evolution of 21-cm absorbers	we report 4 new detections of 21-cm absorption from a systematic search of21-cm absorption in a sample of 17 strong (wr(mgii 2796)&gt;1a) intervening mgiiabsorbers at 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.5. we also present 20-cm milliarcsecond scale maps of 40quasars having 42 intervening strong mgii absorbers for which we have searchedfor 21-cm absorption. combining 21-cm absorption measurements for 50 strongmgii systems from our surveys with the measurements from literature, we obtaina sample of 85 strong mgii absorbers at 0.5&lt;z&lt;1 and 1.1&lt;z&lt;1.5. we presentdetailed analysis of this sample, taking into account the effect of the varying21-cm optical depth sensitivity and covering factor associated with thedifferent quasar sight lines. we find that the 21-cm detection rate is highertowards the quasars with flat or inverted spectral index at cm wavelengths.about 70% of 21-cm detections are towards the quasars with linear size, ls&lt;100pc. the 21-cm absorption lines having velocity widths, deltav&gt;100 km/s aremainly seen towards the quasars with extended radio morphology at arcsecondscales. however, we do not find any correlation between the integrated 21-cmoptical depth or deltav with the ls measured from the milliarcsecond scaleimages. all this can be understood if the absorbing gas is patchy with atypical correlation length of ~30-100 pc. we show that within the measurementuncertainty, the 21-cm detection rate in strong mgii systems is constant over0.5&lt;z&lt;1.5, i.e., over ~30% of the total age of universe. we show that thedetection rate can be underestimated by up to a factor 2 if 21-cm opticaldepths are not corrected for the partial coverage estimated usingmilliarcsecond scale maps. since stellar feedback processes are expected todiminish the filling factor of cold neutral medium over 0.5&lt;z&lt;1, this lack ofevolution in the 21-cm detection rate in strong mgii absorbers is intriguing.[abridged]

0712.2760	the nitrogen and oxygen abundances in the neutral gas at high redshift	we study the oxygen and nitrogen abundances in the interstellar medium ofhigh-redshift galaxies. we use high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratiospectra of damped lyman-alpha (dla) systems detected along the line-of-sight toquasars to derive robust abundance measurements from unsaturated metalabsorption lines. we present results for a sample of 16 high-redshift dlas andstrong sub-dlas (log n(hi)&gt;19.5, 2.4&lt;zabs&lt;3.6) including 13 new measurements.we find that the oxygen to iron abundance ratio is pretty much constant with[o/fe]=+0.32+-0.10 for -2.5&lt;[o/h]&lt;-1.0 with a small scatter around this value.the oxygen abundance follows quite well the silicon abundance within 0.2dexalthough the silicon abundance could be slightly smaller for [o/h]&lt;-2. thedistribution of the [n/o] abundance ratio, measured from components that aredetected in both species, is somehow double peaked: five systems have [n/o]&gt;-1and nine systems have [n/o]&lt;-1.15. in the diagram [n/o] versus [o/h], a looseplateau is possibly present at [n/o]=-0.9 that is below the so-called primaryplateau as seen in local metal-poor dwarf galaxies ([n/o] in the range -0.57 to-0.74). no system is seen above this primary plateau whereas the majority ofthe systems lie well below with a large scatter. all this suggests a picture inwhich dlas undergo successive star-bursts. during such an episode, the [n/o]ratio decreases sharply because of the rapid release of oxygen by massive starswhereas inbetween two bursts, nitrogen is released by low and intermediate-massstars with a delay and the [n/o] ratio increases.

1305.1884	the uves large program for testing fundamental physics: i bounds on a  change in alpha towards quasar he 2217-2818	absorption line systems detected in quasar spectra can be used to compare thevalue of the fine-structure constant, {\alpha}, measured today on earth withits value in distant galaxies. in recent years, some evidence has emerged ofsmall temporal and also spatial variations of {\alpha} on cosmological scaleswhich may reach a fractional level of ~ 10 ppm (parts per million). to testthese claims we are conducting a large program with the vlt uves . we areobtaining high-resolution (r ~ 60000 and high signal-to-noise ratio (s/n ~ 100)uves spectra calibrated specifically for this purpose. here we analyse thefirst complete quasar spectrum from this program, that of he 2217-2818. weapply the many multiplet method to measure {\alpha} in 5 absorption systemstowards this quasar: zabs = 0.7866, 0.9424, 1.5558, 1.6279 and 1.6919. the mostprecise result is obtained for the absorber at zabs = 1.6919 where 3 fe iitransitions and al ii {\lambda}1670 have high s/n and provide a wide range ofsensitivities to {\alpha}. the absorption profile is complex, with several verynarrow features, and requires 32 velocity components to be fitted to the data.our final result for the relative variation in {\alpha} in this system isdelta{\alpha}/{\alpha} = +1.3 +/- 2.4stat +/- 1.0sys ppm. this is one of thetightest current bounds on {\alpha} variation from an individual absorber. theabsorbers towards quasar he 2217-2818 reveal no evidence for variation in{\alpha} at the 3 ppm precision level (1{\sigma} confidence). if the recentlyreported 10 ppm dipolar variation of {\alpha} across the sky were correct, theexpectation at this sky position is (3.2-5.4) +/-1.7 ppm depending on dipolemodel used . our constraint of delta{\alpha}/{\alpha}=+1.3+/-2.4stat +/-1.0sysppm is not inconsistent with this expectation.

[o/h] = -1.63(0.07) and [zn/h] = - 0.57(0.05) relative tosolar). while the depletion of refractory elements onto dust grains in bothsub-dlas is not noteworthy, photoionization models show that ionization effectsare important in a part of the absorbing gas of the sub-dla at z_abs = 1.6359(hi is 95 percent ionized) and in part of the gas of the sub-dla at z_abs =1.6359. the civ clustering properties along the line of sight is studied inorder to investigate the nature of the observed overdensity. we conclude thatdespite the unusually high number of civ systems detected along the line ofsight, there is no compelling evidence for the presence of a single unusualoverdensity and that the situation is consistent with chance coincidence.

1402.5219	galaxies in hi 21-cm absorption at z&lt;3.5	we present recent results from our searches of 21-cm absorption using gbt,gmrt, vlba and wsrt to trace the evolution of cold gas in galaxies. using ~130sight lines with 21-cm absorption measurements, we find that within themeasurement uncertainty, the 21-cm detection rate in strong mgii systems isconstant over 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.5. since stellar feedback processes are expected todiminish the filling factor of cnm over 0.5&lt;z&lt;1, this lack of evolution in the21-cm detection rate in mgii absorbers is intriguing. further, we find that ifthe majority of 21-cm absorbers arise from dlas then the cross-section of 21-cmabsorbing gas i.e. cold neutral medium amongst dlas has increased from z=3.5 toz=0.5. in a sample of 13 z&gt;2 dlas with both 21-cm and h$_2$ (another tracer ofcold gas) absorption measurements, we report two new h$_2$ detections and findthat in 8/13 cases neither 21-cm nor h$_2$ is detected. this confirms that thehi gas in z&gt;2 dlas is predominantly warm. interestingly, there are two caseswhere 21-cm absorption is not detected despite the presence of h$_2$ withevidence for the presence of cold gas. this can be explained if h$_2$components seen in dla are compact (&lt;15 pc) and contain &lt;10% of the totaln(hi). we briefly discuss results from our ongoing survey to identify 21-cmabsorbers at low-z to establish connection between 21-cm absorbers andgalaxies, and constrain the extent of absorbing gas.

1409.1923	the uves large program for testing fundamental physics - iii.  constraints on the fine-structure constant from 3 telescopes	large statistical samples of quasar spectra have previously indicatedpossible cosmological variations in the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$. asmaller sample of higher signal-to-noise ratio spectra, with dedicatedcalibration, would allow a detailed test of this evidence. towards that end, weobserved equatorial quasar hs 1549$+$1919 with three telescopes: the very largetelescope, keck and, for the first time in such analyses, subaru. by directlycomparing these spectra to each other, and by `supercalibrating' them usingasteroid and iodine-cell tests, we detected and removed long-range distortionsof the quasar spectra's wavelength scales which would have caused significantsystematic errors in our $\alpha$ measurements. for each telescope we measurethe relative deviation in $\alpha$ from the current laboratory value,$\delta\alpha/\alpha$, in 3 absorption systems at redshifts$z_{\mathrm{abs}}=1.143$, 1.342, and 1.802. the nine measurements of$\delta\alpha/\alpha$ are all consistent with zero at the 2-$\sigma$ level,with 1-$\sigma$ statistical (systematic) uncertainties 5.6--24 (1.8--7.0) partsper million (ppm). they are also consistent with each other at the 1-$\sigma$level, allowing us to form a combined value for each telescope and, finally, asingle value for this line of sight: $\delta\alpha/\alpha=-5.4 \pm3.3_{\mathrm{stat}} \pm 1.5_{\mathrm{sys}}$ ppm, consistent with both zero andprevious, large samples. we also average all large programme results measuring$\delta\alpha/\alpha=-0.6 \pm 1.9_{\mathrm{stat}} \pm 0.9_{\mathrm{sys}}$ ppm.our results demonstrate the robustness and reliability at the 3 ppm levelafforded by supercalibration techniques and direct comparison of spectra fromdifferent telescopes.

1501.07165	neutral chlorine and molecular hydrogen at high redshift	chlorine and molecular hydrogen are known to be tightly linked together inthe cold phase of the local interstellar medium through rapid chemicalreactions. we present here the first systematic study of this relation at highredshifts using h$_2$-bearing damped ly$\alpha$ systems (dlas) detected alongquasar lines of sight. using high-resolution spectroscopic data from vlt/uvesand keck/hires, we report the detection of cl$\,$i in 9 dlas (including 5 newdetections) out of 18 high-$z$ dlas with $n($h$_2) \ge 10^{17.3}\,$cm$^{-2}$(including a new h$_2$ detection at $z=3.09145$ towards j$\,$2100$-$0641) andpresent upper limits for the remaining 9 systems. we find a $\sim$5$\,\sigma$correlation between $n$(cl$\,$i) and $n$(h$_2$) with only $\sim$0.2$\,$dexdispersion over the range 18.1$\,&lt;\,$log$\,n$(h$_2$)$\,&lt;\,$20.1, thus probingcolumn densities 10 times lower those seen towards nearby stars, roughlyfollowing the relation $n$(cl$\,$i$) \approx 1.5\times10^{-6} \times n($h$_2)$.this relation between column densities is surprisingly the same at low and highredshift suggesting that the physical and chemical conditions are similar for agiven h$_2$ (or cl$\,$i) column density. in turn, the $n({cl$\,$i})/n({\rmh_2})$ ratio is found to be uncorrelated with the overall metallicity in thedla. our results confirm that neutral chlorine is an excellent tracer ofmolecule-rich gas and show that the molecular fraction or/and metallicity inthe h$_2$-bearing component of dla could possibly be much higher than theline-of-sight average values usually measured in dlas.

1501.07210	partial covering of emission regions of q 0528-250 by intervening h$_2$  clouds	we present an analysis of the molecular hydrogen absorption system at z$_{\rmabs}$ = 2.811 in the spectrum of the blazar q0528-250. we demonstrate that themolecular cloud does not cover the background source completely. the partialcoverage reveals itself as a residual flux in the bottom of saturated h_2absorption lines. this amounts to about (2.22$\pm$0.54)% of the continuum anddoes not depend on the wavelength. this value is small and it explains why thiseffect has not been detected in previous studies of this quasar spectrum.however, it is robustly detected and significantly higher than the zero fluxlevel in the bottom of saturated lines of the ly-alpha forest,(-0.21$\pm$0.22)%. the presence of the residual flux could be caused byunresolved quasar multicomponents, by light scattered by dust, and/or byjet-cloud interaction. the h$_2$ absorption system is very well described by atwo-component model without inclusion of additional components when we takepartial coverage into account. the derived total column densities in the h$_2$absorption components a and b are logn(h$_2$)[cm$^{-2}$] = 18.10$\pm$0.02 and17.82$\pm$0.02, respectively. hd molecules are present only in component b.given the column density, logn(hd)= 13.33$\pm$0.02, we findn(hd)/2n(h$_2$)=(1.48$\pm$0.10)x10$^{-5}$, significantly lower than previousestimations. we argue that it is crucial to take into account partial coverageeffects for any analysis of h$_2$ bearing absorption systems, in particularwhen studying the physical state of high-redshift interstellar medium.

1502.01354	cold parsec-scale gas in a zabs~0.1 sub-dla with disparate h2 and 21-cm  absorption	we present a detailed analysis of a h2-bearing metal-rich sub-dampedlyman-alpha system at zabs = 0.10115 towards the radio-loud quasar j0441-4313,at a projected separation of ~7.6 kpc from a star-forming galaxy. the h2, c iand na i absorption are much stronger in the redder of the two components seenin the hubble space telescope / cosmic origins spectrograph spectrum. the bestsingle component fit to the strong h2 component gives log n(h2) = 16.61 +/-0.05. however, possible hidden saturation in the medium resolution spectrum canallow for log n(h2) to be as high as 18.9. the rotational excitationtemperature of h2 in this component is 133 +33/-22 k. photoionization modelssuggest 30-80% of the total n(h i) is associated with the strong h2 component,that has a density &lt;= 100 cm^-3 and is subject to a radiation field that is &lt;=0.5 times the galactic mean field. the very large baseline array 1.4 ghzcontinuum image of the radio source contains only 27% of the arcsecond scaleemission. using a previously published spectrum, no 21-cm absorption is foundto be associated with the strong h2 component. this suggests that either then(h i) associated with this component is &lt;= 50% of the total n(h i) or the gascovering factor is &lt;= 0.27. this is consistent with the results of thephotoionization model that uses uv radiation due to stars in the associatedgalaxy. the 21-cm absorption previously reported from the weaker h2 componentsuggests a spin temperature of &lt;= 90 k, at odds with the weakness of h2, c iand na i absorption in this component. from the inferred physical and chemicalconditions, we suggest that the gas may be tracing a recent metal-rich outflowfrom the host-galaxy.

1505.01551	circumnuclear and infalling hi gas in a merging galaxy pair at z=0.123	using long-slit optical spectra obtained with the 2-m telescope at iucaagirawali observatory, we show that the radio source j094221.98+062335.2(z=0.123) is associated with a galaxy pair undergoing a major merger. itscompanion is a normal star-forming galaxy infalling with a velocity of 185 km/sat a projected separation of 4.8 kpc. using the westerbork synthesis radiotelescope (wsrt) and giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt) we detect a stronghi 21-cm absorption at the systemic redshift of the radio galaxy withn(hi)~9x10^21 cm^{-2} for an assumed spin-temperature of 100 k. such a stronghi 21-cm absorption is rare and has been seen only in a few compact radiosources associated with similar merging galaxy pairs. milliarcsecond resolutionvery long baseline array (vlba) observations resolve the radio source into acompact symmetric object with the hotspot separation of 89 pc. the 21-cmabsorption is detected in the vlba spectra towards both the radio lobes albeitwith a strong optical depth gradient. we show that the strong 21-cm absorptionis consistent with it being arising from a clumpy circumnuclear disk/torus. wealso detect two weaker absorption lines redshifted with respect to the radiosource in the wsrt/gmrt spectrum. they probably represent cold (i.e. t&lt; 10^4 k)hi gas falling into the radio source. the presence of high concentration of higas in the circumnuclear regions and signature of infalling cold gas allows usto conjecture that the young radio source may have been triggered by the gasinfall due to the ongoing merger.

1505.04997	the elusive hi-&gt; h2 transition in high-z damped lyman-alpha systems	we study the h2 molecular content in high redshift damped lyman-alpha systems(dlas) as a function of the hi column density. we find a significant increaseof the h2 molecular content around log n(hi) (cm^-2)~21.5-22, a regime unprobeduntil now in intervening dlas, beyond which the majority of systems have logn(h2) &gt; 17. this is in contrast with lines of sight towards nearby stars, wheresuch h2 column densities are always detected as soon as log n(hi)&gt;20.7. thiscan qualitatively be explained by the lower average metallicity and possiblyhigher surrounding uv radiation in dlas. however, unlike in the milky way, theoverall molecular fractions remain modest, showing that even at a large n(hi)only a small fraction of overall hi is actually associated with theself-shielded h2 gas. damped lyman-alpha systems with very high-n(hi) probablyarise along quasar lines of sight passing closer to the centre of the hostgalaxy where the gas pressure is higher. we show that the colour changesinduced on the background quasar by continuum (dust) and line absorption (hilyman and h2 lyman &amp; werner bands) in dlas with log n(hi)~22 and metallicity~1/10 solar is significant, but not responsible for the long-discussed lack ofsuch systems in optically selected samples. instead, these systems are likelyto be found towards intrinsically fainter quasars that dominate the quasarluminosity function. colour biasing should in turn be severe at highermetallicities.

1509.08471	transient c iv broad absorption lines in radio detected qsos	we study the transient (i.e. emerging or disappearing) c iv broad absorptionline (bal) components in 50 radio detected qsos using multi-epoch spectraavailable in sloan digital sky survey dr10. we report the detectionof 6 balqsoshaving at least one distinct transient c iv absorption component. based on thestructure function analysis of optical light curves, we suggest that thetransient absorption is unlikely to be triggered by continuum variations.transient absorption components usually have low c iv equivalent widths (&lt; 8\aa), high ejection velocities (&gt; 10000 \kms) and typically occur overrest-frame timescales &gt; 800 days. the detection rate of transient c ivabsorption seen in our sample is higher than that reported in the literature.using a control sample of qsos, we show that this difference is most likely dueto the longer monitoring time-scale of sources in our sample while the effectof small number statistics cannot be ignored. thus, in order to establish therole played by radio jets in driving the bal outflows, we need a larger sampleof radio detected bals monitored over more than 3 years in the qso's restframe. we also find that the transient phenomenon in radio detected and radioquiet bals does not depend on any of the qso properties i.e. the eddingtonratio, black hole mass, bolometric luminosity and optical-to-ir colours. allthis suggests that transient bal phenomenon is simply the extreme case of balvariability.

astro-ph;0005252	semi analytic approach to understanding the distribution of neutral  hydrogen in the universe	analytic derivations of the correlation function and the column densitydistribution for neutral hydrogen in the igm are presented, assuming that thenon-linear baryonic mass density distribution in the igm is lognormal. thisansatz was used earlier by bi &amp; davidsen (1997) to perform 1d simulations oflines-of-sight and analyse the properties of absorption systems. our approachis completely analytic, which allows us to explore a wide region of theparameter space for our model. the analytic results have been compared withobservations, whenever possible. two kinds of correlation functions aredefined: along the line-of-sight (los) and across the transverse direction. wefind that the effects on the los correlation due to change in cosmology and theslope of the equation of state of the igm, \gamma are of the same order, whichmeans that we cannot constrain both the parameters simultaneously. however, itis possible to constrain \gamma and its evolution using the observed loscorrelation function at different epochs, provided one knows the backgroundcosmology. we suggest that the constraints on the evolution of \gamma obtainedusing the los correlation can be used as an independent tool to probe thereionisation history of the universe. from the transverse correlation function,we find that the excess probability, over random, of finding two neutralhydrogen overdense regions separated by an angle \theta, is always less than 1per cent for redshifts greater than 2. our models also reproduce the observedcolumn density distribution for neutral hydrogen and the shape of thedistribution depends on \gamma. our calculations suggest that one can rule out\gamma &gt; 1.6 for z \simeq 2.31 using the column density distribution. however,one cannot rule higher values of \gamma at higher redshifts.

astro-ph;0105170	a near-solar metallicity damped lyman-alpha system toward the bal quasar  tol 1037-2703	we report the detection of a broad absorption line (bal) outflow in thespectrum of tol 1037-2703 with three main bals at 36000, 25300 and 22300~\kmsoutflow velocities. although the overall flow is dominated by high ionizationlines like and c iv, the gas of highest velocity shows absorption from mg i, mgii and fe ii. covering factor arguments suggest that the absorbing complexesare physically associated with the qso and have transverse dimensions smallerthan that of the uv continuum emitting region (r&lt;0.1 pc). we show that the c ivabsorption at \zabs=2.082 has a covering factor $\sim$ 0.86 and the absorptionprofile has varied over the last four years. the detection of absorption fromexcited fine structure levels of c ii and si ii in narrow components embeddedin the c iv trough reveals large density inhomogeneities. ir pumping is themost likely excitation process. the \zabs=2.139 system is a damped system withlog n(h i) ~ 19.7. the weakness of the metal lines together with the highquality of the data make the metallicity measurements particularly reliable.the absolute metallicity is close to solar with [zn/h]=-0.26. the$\alpha$-chain elements have metallicities consistently solar (respectively+0.05, -0.02, -0.03 and -0.15 for [mg/h], [si/h], [p/h] and [s/h]) and ironpeak elements are depleted by a factor of about two ([fe/zn], [cr/zn], [mn/zn]and [ni/zn] are equal to -0.39, -0.27, -0.49, -0.30). lines from c i aredetected but h$_2$ is absent with a molecular fraction less than8$\times10^{-6}$. high metallicity and low nitrogen abundance, [n/zn]=-1.40,favor the idea that metals have been released by massive stars during astarburst of less than 0.5 gyr of age.

astro-ph;0201477	molecular hydrogen at z=1.973 toward q0013-004: dust depletion pattern  in damped lyman-alpha systems	we study the dust depletion pattern in eight well separated components of thez=1.973, logn(hi)=20.83, damped lyman-alpha system toward q0013-004, four ofwhich have detectable h2 absorption. the apparent correlation between theabundance ratios [fe/s] and [si/s] in the components indicates that theabundance pattern is indeed due to dust-depletion. in particular, we findevidence for depletion similar to what is observed in cold gas of the galacticdisk ([fe/zn]=-1.59, fe/s=-1.74, zn/s=-0.15, [si/s]=-0.85) in one of theweakest components in which molecular hydrogen is detected with logn(h2)=16.5.this is the first time such a large depletion is seen in a dla system. thisobservation supports the possibility that current samples of dla systems mightbe biased against the presence of cold and dusty gas along the line of sight.the overall metallicities of this peculiar dla system in which oi and cii arespread over 1050 km/s are [p/h]=-0.64, [zn/h]=-0.74 and [s/h]=-0.82 relative tosolar. the sub-dla system at z=1.96753 has [p/h]&gt;0.06, [zn/h]&gt;-0.02 and[s/h]&gt;-0.18. the overall molecular fraction is in the range -2.7&lt;logf&lt;-0.6. cois not detected (logn(co)/n(hi)&lt;-8) and hd could be present at z=1.97380. weshow that the presence of h2 is closely related to the physical conditions ofthe gas: high particle density together with low temperature. the observedexcitation of high j h2 levels and the molecular fraction show large variationsfrom one component to the other suggesting that the uv radiation field ishighly inhomogeneous throughout the system. gas pressure, estimated from ciabsorptions, is larger than what is observed in the ism of our galaxy. all thisis probably a consequence of intense star-formation activity in the vicinity ofthe absorbing gas.

astro-ph;0205524	a collimated flow driven by radiative pressure from the nucleus of  quasar q~1511+091	high velocity outflows from quasars are revealed by the absorption signaturesthey produce in the spectrum of the quasar. clues on the nature and origin ofthese flows are important for our understanding of the dynamics of gas in thecentral regions of the active galactic nucleus (agns) but also of the metalenrichment of the intergalactic space. line radiation pressure has often beensuggested to be an important process in driving these outflows, however noconvincing evidence has been given so far. here we report observation of ahighly structured flow, toward q~1511+091, where the velocity separationsbetween distinct components are similar to o vi, n v and c iv doubletsplittings with some of the profiles matching perfectly. this strongly favorsthe idea that the absorbing clumps originate at similar physical location andare driven by radiative acceleration due to resonance lines. the complexabsorption can be understood if the flow is highly collimated so that thedifferent optically thick clouds are aligned and cover the same region of thebackground source. one component shows saturated h i lyman series linestogether with absorptions from excited levels from c ii and si ii but coversonly 40% of the source of continuum. the fact that clouds cover only part ofthe small continuum source implies that the flow is located very close to it.

astro-ph;0401094	probing the cosmological variation of the fine-structure constant:  results based on vlt-uves sample	development of fundamental physics relies on the constancy of variousfundamental quantities such as the fine structure constant. detecting orconstraining the possible time variations of these fundamental physicalquantities is an important step toward a complete understanding of basicphysics. here we present the results from a detailed many-multiplet analysisperformed using high signal-to-noise ratio, high spectral resolutionobservations of 23 mg ii systems detected toward 18 qsos in the redshift range0.4&lt;z&lt;2.3 obtained using uves at the vlt. we validate our procedure and definethe selection criteria that will avoid possible systematics using detailanalysis of simulated data set. we show our voigt profile fitting code recoversthe variation in \alpha very accurately when we use single component systemsand multiple component systems that are not heavily blended. spuriousdetections are frequently seen when we use heavily blended systems or thesystems with very weak lines. thus we avoided heavily blended systems and thesystems with fe ii column density &lt; 2x10^12 cm^-2 in the analysis. all stepsinvolved in the analysis are presented in detail. the weighted mean value ofthe variation in \alpha obtained from our analysis over the redshift range0.4&lt;z&lt;2.3 is {\delta\alpha/\alpha} = (-0.06+/-0.06)x10^-5. the median redshiftof our sample is 1.55 the 3\sigma upper limit on the time variation of $\alpha$is -2.5x10^-16 yr^-1&lt; (\delta\alpha/\alpha\delta t) &lt;+1.2x10^-16 yr^-1. to ourknowledge this is the strongest constraint from quasar absorption line studiestill date.

astro-ph;0502284	the density structure around quasars from optical depth statistics	we present a method for studying the proximity effect and the densitystructure around redshift z=2-3 quasars. it is based on the probabilitydistribution of lyman-alpha pixel optical depths and its evolution withredshift.  we validate the method using mock spectra obtained from hydrodynamicalsimulations, and then apply it to a sample of 12 bright quasars at redshifts2-3 observed with uves at the vlt-ut2 kueyen eso telescope. these quasars donot show signatures of associated absorption and have a mean monochromaticluminosity of 5.4 10^{31} h^{-2} erg/s/hz at the lyman limit. the observeddistribution of optical depth within 10 mpc/h from the qso is statisticallydifferent from that measured in the general intergalactic medium at the sameredshift. such a change will result from the combined effects of the increasein photoionisation rate above the mean uv-background due to the extra ionizingphotons from the quasar radiation (proximity effect), and the higher density ofthe igm if the quasars reside in overdense regions (as expected from biasedgalaxy formation). the first factor decreases the optical depth whereas thesecond one increases the optical depth, but our measurement cannot distinguisha high background from a low overdensity. an overdensity of the order of a fewis required if we use the amplitude of the uv-background inferred from the meanlyman-$\alpha$ opacity. if no overdensity is present, then we require theuv-background to be higher, and consistent with the existing measurements basedon standard analysis of the proximity effect.

astro-ph;0504402	the mass-metallicity relation for high-redshift damped ly-alpha galaxies	we used our database of eso vlt-uves spectra of quasars to build up a sampleof 67 damped lyman-alpha (dla) systems with redshifts 1.7&lt;zabs&lt;3.7. for eachsystem, we measured average metallicities relative to solar, [x/h] (with eitherx=zn, s or si), and the velocity widths of low-ionization line profiles, w1. wefind that there is a tight correlation between the two quantities, detected atthe 5sigma significance level. the existence of such a correlation, over morethan two orders of magnitude spread in metallicity, is likely to be theconsequence of an underlying mass-metallicity relation for the galaxiesresponsible for dla absorption lines. the best-fit linear relation is[x/h]=1.35(\pm 0.11)\log w1 -3.69(\pm 0.18)$ with w1 expressed in km/s. whilethe slope of this velocity-metallicity relation is the same withinuncertainties between the higher and the lower redshift bins of our sample,there is a hint of an increase of the intercept point of the relation withdecreasing redshift. this suggests that galaxy halos of a given mass tend tobecome more metal-rich with time. moreover, the slope of this relation isconsistent with that of the luminosity-metallicity relation for local galaxies.the dla systems having the lowest metallicities among the dla population wouldtherefore, on average, correspond to the galaxies having the lowest masses. inturn, these galaxies should have the lowest luminosities among the dla galaxypopulation. this may explain the recent result that the few dla systems withdetected ly-alpha emission have higher than average metallicities.

astro-ph;0611836	detecting cold gas at intermediate redshifts: gmrt survey using mg ii  systems	intervening hi 21-cm absorption systems at z &gt; 1.0 are very rare and only 4confirmed detections have been reported in the literature. despite theirscarcity, they provide interesting and unique insights into the physicalconditions in the interstellar medium of high-z galaxies. moreover, they canprovide independent constraints on the variation of fundamental constants. wereport 3 new detections based on our ongoing giant metrewave radio telescope(gmrt) survey for 21-cm absorbers at 1.10&lt; z_abs&lt; 1.45 from candidate dampedlyman_alpha systems. the 21-cm lines are narrow for the z_abs = 1.3710 systemtowards sdss j0108-0037 and z_abs = 1.1726 system toward sdss j2358-1020. basedon line full-width at half maximum, the kinetic temperatures are &lt;= 5200 k and&lt;=800 k, respectively. the 21-cm absorption profile of the third system, z_abs=1.1908 system towards sdss j0804+3012, is shallow, broad and complex,extending up to 100 km/s. the centroids of the 21-cm lines are found to beshifted with respect to the corresponding centroids of the metal lines derivedfrom sdss spectra. this may mean that the 21-cm absorption is not associatedwith the strongest metal line component.

astro-ph;0702369	evidence for overdensity around z_em &gt; 4 quasars from the proximity  effect	we study the density field around z_em &gt; 4 quasars using high quality mediumspectral resolution esi-keck spectra (r~4300, snr &gt; 25) of 45 high-redshiftquasars selected from a total of 95 spectra. this large sample considerablyincreases the statistics compared to previous studies. the redshift evolutionof the mean photo-ionization rate and the median optical depth of theintergalactic medium (igm) are derived statistically from the observedtransmitted flux and the pixel optical depth probability distribution functionrespectively. this is used to study the so-called proximity effect, that is,the observed decrease of the median optical depth of the igm in the vicinity ofthe quasar caused by enhanced photo-ionization rate due to photons emitted bythe quasar. we show that the proximity effect is correlated with the luminosityof the quasars, as expected. by comparing the observed decrease of the medianoptical depth with the theoretical expectation we find that the optical depthdoes not decrease as rapidly as expected when approaching the quasar if the gasin its vicinity is part of the standard igm. we interpret this effect asrevealing gaseous overdensities on scales as large as ~15 mpc/h. the meanoverdensity is of the order of two and five within, respectively, 10 and 3mpc/h. if true, this would indicate that high redshift quasars are located inthe center of overdense regions that could evolve with time into massiveclusters of galaxies. the overdensity is correlated with luminosity: brighterquasars show higher overdensities.

astro-ph;0703218	physical conditions in the neutral interstellar medium at z=2.43 toward  q2348-011	we obtained a high-resolution vlt-uves spectrum of the quasar q2348-011 overa wavelength range that covers most of the prominent metal and molecularabsorption lines from the log n(hi)=20.50+-0.10 damped lyman-alpha system atzabs=2.43. from the column density ratios and the relative populations of h2rotational and ci fine-structure levels, we derive the physical conditions(relative abundances, dust-depletion, particle density, kinetic temperature andionizing flux) and discuss physical conditions in the neutral phase. molecularhydrogen is detected in seven components in the first four rotational levels (j= 0-3) of the vibrational ground state. absorption lines of h2 j = 4 (resp. j =5) are also detected in six (resp. two) of these components. this leads to atotal molecular fraction of log f = -1.69+0.37-0.58. we confirm the earlierfindings that there is a correlation between n(feii)/n(sii) and n(siii)/n(sii)indicative of a dust-depletion pattern. surprisingly, however, the depletion ofmetals onto dust in the h2 components is not large in this system: [fe/s] =-0.8 to -0.1. the gas in h2-bearing components is found to be cold but stillhotter than similar gas in our galaxy (t &gt; 130 k, instead of typically 80 k).and dense (n=100-200 cm^-3). there is an anti-correlation between the logarithmof the photo-absorption rate, and log n(h2)/n(ci) derived for each h2component. we show that this is mostly due to shielding effects and impliesthat the photo- absorption rate is a good indicator of the physical conditionsin the gas. we find that the gas is immersed in a intense uv field, about oneorder of magnitude higher than in the solar vicinity. the results suggest thatthe gas in h2-bearing dlas is clumpy, and star-formation occurs in theassociated object.

astro-ph;9511048	analysis of ly ${\alpha}$ absorption lines in the vicinity of qsos	we have compiled, from the literature, a sample of ly ${\alpha}$ forest linesin the spectra of 69 qsos, all observed with a resolution between 60 to 100 kms$^{-1}$. the sample is studied for proximity effect. we have tried to accountfor the effect of blending which is inherent in the intermediate resolutionsample, by calculating the column density distribution, using an effectivevelocity dispersion parameter, from the observed equivalent width distribution.the use of this column density distribution in the proximity effect analysisreduces the background intensity values by a factor of 2 to 3 compared to thevalues obtained by using the column density distribution obtained from highresolution observations. evidence is presented for a weak correlation betweenthe effective velocity dispersion parameter and equivalent width. such acorrelation if present can increase the background values by a factor of up to1.5. considerations of proximity in the spectra of 16 qsos, from our sample,exhibiting damped ly ${\alpha}$ lines gives a background intensity which is 3times smaller than the values obtained from the whole sample, confirming thepresence of dust in the damped ly $\alpha$ systems. lines close to the qsos areshown to be marginally stronger and broader compared to lines away from theqsos. the ly $\alpha$ lines with absorption redshift larger than emissionredshift are shown to be uncorrelated with qso luminosity, radio loudness oroptical spectral index. these lines occur more frequently at high redshifts.their presence is correlated weakly with the presence of associated metal linesystems. the possibilities that the qso emission redshift is considerablyhigher and that either the ly $\alpha$ clouds or the qsos have peculiarvelocities are considered. it is argued that a combination of both these

astro-ph;9803183	do the central engines of quasars evolve by accretion ?	according to a currently popular paradigm, nuclear activity in quasars issustained via accretion of material onto super-massive black holes located atthe quasar nuclei. a useful tracer of the gravitational field in the vicinityof such central black holes is available in the form of extremely dense gasclouds within the broad emission-line region (blr) on the scale of $\sim1~$parsec. likewise, the radio sizes of the lobe-dominated radio sources arebelieved to provide a useful statistical indicator of their ages. using twohomogeneously observed (and processed) sets of lobe-dominated radio-loudquasars, taken from literature, we show that a positive correlation existsbetween the radio sizes of the quasars and the widths of their broad $h\beta$emission lines, and this correlation is found to be significantly stronger thanthe other well known correlations involving radio size. this statisticalcorrelation is shown to be consistent with the largest (and, hence, verypossibly the oldest) radio sources harboring typically an order-of-magnitudemore massive central engines, as compared to the physically smaller and, hence,probably much younger radio sources. this inference is basically in accord withthe "accreting central engine" picture for the radio-loud quasars.

astro-ph;9902070	the zabs=zem absorption line systems toward qso j2233-606 in the hubble  deep field south: neviii770,780 absorption and partial coverage	results of a careful analysis of the highly ionized absorption systems,observed over the redshift range 2.198--2.2215 in the zem=2.24 hdfs-qsoj2233-606, are presented. strong ovi and neviii absorptions are detected. mostof the lines show signature of partial coverage which varies from species tospecies. this can be understood if the clouds cover the continuum emissionregion completely and only a fraction of the broad emission line region. usingphoto-ionization models we analyze in more detail the component at zabs =2.198. absolute abundances are close to solar but the [n/c] abundance ratio islarger than solar. this result, which is consistent with the analysis of high-zqso broad emission-lines, confirms the physical association of the absorbinggas with the agn. the observed column densities of niv, nv and neviii favor atwo-zone model for the absorbing region where neviii is predominantly producedin the highly ionized zone. it is most likely that in qso j2233-606, the regionproducing the neviii absorption can not be a warm absorber. one of the lyalphaabsorption lines at zabs = 2.2215 has a flat bottom typical of saturated linesand non-zero residual intensity in the core, consistent with partial coverage.there is no metal-line from this lyalpha cloud detectable in the spectrum whichsuggests either large chemical inhomogeneities in the gas or that the gas isvery highly ionized. if the latter is true the cloud could have a totalhydrogen column density consistent with that of x-ray absorbers. it istherefore of first importance to check whether or not there is an x-raywarm-absorber in front of this qso.
