0707.0490	the galactic deuterium abundance and dust depletion: insights from an  expanded ti/h sample	the primordial abundance of deuterium (d/h) yields a measure of the densityof baryons in the universe and is an important complement to determinationsfrom cosmic microwave background (cmb) experiments. indeed, the current smallsample of high redshift d/h measurements from quasar absorption line studiesare in excellent agreement with cmb-derived values. conversely, absorption linemeasurements of the galactic d/h ratio in almost 50 stellar sightlines show apuzzlingly large scatter outside the local bubble which is difficult to explainsimply by astration from the primordial value. here, we investigate the dustdepletion scenario by studying the correlation between d/h and the abundance oftitanium, one of the most refractory elements readily observed in the ism. witha sample 3 times larger than previous work, we confirm a correlation betweenti/h and d/h at the 97% confidence level. however, the magnitude of thisdependence is difficult to reconcile with a simple model of dust depletion fortwo reasons. first, contrary to what is expected from local depletion rates,the gradient of the highly refractory ti is much shallower than that observedfor fe and si. second, we do not observe the established tight, steepcorrelation between [ti/h] and the mean volume density of hydrogen. therefore,whilst dust remains a plausible explanation for the local d/h variations, theabundances of at least some of the refractory elements do not provide unanimoussupport for this scenario. we also argue that the correlations of [si/h],[fe/h], and [ti/h] with d/h are inconsistent with a simple infall model of lowmetallicity gas with approximately solar abundances as the dominant cause for dvariations.

0707.2594	a new constraint on the escape fraction in distant galaxies using  gamma-ray burst afterglow spectroscopy	we describe a new method to measure the escape fraction fesc of ionizingradiation from distant star-forming galaxies using the afterglow spectra oflong-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs). optical spectra of grb afterglows allowus to evaluate the optical depth of the host ism, according to the neutralhydrogen column density n(hi) observed along the sightlines toward thestar-forming regions where the grbs are found. different from previous effortin searching for faint, transmitted lyman continuum photons, our method is notsubject to background subtraction uncertainties and does not require priorknowledge of either the spectral shape of the host galaxy population or the igmlya forest absorption along these grb sightlines. because most grbs occur insub-l_* galaxies, our study also offers the first constraint on fesc fordistant low-mass galaxies that dominate the cosmic luminosity density. we havecompiled a sample of 27 grbs at redshift z&gt;2 for which the underlying n(hi) inthe host ism are known. these grbs together offer a statistical sampling of theintegrated optical depth to ionizing photons along random sightlines fromstar-forming regions in the host galaxies, and allow us to estimate the meanescape fraction &lt;fesc&gt; averaged over different viewing angles. we find&lt;fesc&gt;=0.02\pm 0.02 and place a 95% c.l. upper limit &lt;fesc&gt; &lt;= 0.075 for thesehosts. we discuss possible biases of our approach and implications of theresult. finally, we propose to extend this technique for measuring &lt;fesc&gt; atz~0.2 using spectra of core-collapse supernovae.

0708.0236	the chemical evolution of high z galaxies from the relative abundances  of n, si, s, and fe in damped lyman alpha systems	abundances of n, si, s, and fe for 45 damped lyman alpha systems (dlas) havebeen compiled and detailed one-zone chemical evolution models have beenconstructed for 30 of them. assuming continuous star formation, we found thatfinal abundances in each object can be modelled by adjusting only twoparameters, i.e. its time-averaged star formation efficiency and evolutionaryage, with ranges in our sample of 0.01-1.5 gyr^-1 and 0.18-2.0 gyr,respectively. in addition, average star formation efficiency and evolutionaryage appear to be anticorrelated for the sample, suggesting that the starformation efficiency in a typical dla decreases with age. at the same time,n/si in dlas is directly linked to an object's age. there is an apparentbimodality in the distribution of n/si values which could be the result of astatistical accident or an effect produced by a truncated or flattened imf. wefind that the mean and small dispersion of si/fe values is related to thegenerally young ages of dlas, wherein not all fe has yet been expelled by typeia supernovae. finally, the large scatter and generally lower values of n/si ofdlas with respect to blue compact galaxies, despite their partially overlappingmetallicities, indicate that dlas are generally younger than the latter.

1010.1002	a mature dusty star-forming galaxy hosting grb080607 at z=3.036	we report the discovery of the host galaxy of dark burst grb080607 atz_grb=3.036. grb080607 is a unique case of a highly extinguished (a_v~3 mag)afterglow that was yet sufficiently bright for high-quality absorption-linespectroscopy. the host galaxy is clearly resolved in deep hst wf3/ir f160wimages and well detected in the spitzer irac 3.5 micron and 4.5 micronchannels, while displaying little/no fluxes in deep optical images from keckand magellan. the extremely red optical-infrared colors are consistent with thelarge extinction seen in the afterglow light, suggesting that the large amountof dust and gas surface mass density seen along the afterglow sightline is notmerely local but likely reflects the global dust content across the entire hostgalaxy. adopting the dust properties and metallicity of the host ism derivedfrom studies of early-time afterglow light and absorption-line spectroscopy, weperform a stellar population synthesis analysis of the observed spectral energydistribution to constrain the intrinsic luminosity and stellar population ofthis dark burst host. the host galaxy is best described by an exponentiallydeclining star formation rate of e-folding time tau=2 gyr and an age of ~2 gyr.we also derive an extinction corrected star formation rate of sfr 125 h^{-2}m_sun/yr and a total stellar mass of m_* ~ 4x10^11 h^{-2} m_sun. our studyprovides an example of massive, dusty star-forming galaxies contributing to thegrb host galaxy population, supporting the notion that long-duration grbs tracethe bulk of cosmic star formation.

1102.3927	the first observations of low redshift damped lyman-alpha systems with  the cosmic origins spectrograph	we report on the first cosmic origins spectrograph (cos) observations ofdamped and sub-damped lyman-alpha (dla) systems discovered in a new survey ofthe gaseous halos of low-redshift galaxies. from observations of 37 sightlines,we have discovered three dlas and four sub-dlas. we measure the neutral gasdensity omega(hi), and redshift density dn/dz, of dla and sub-dla systems atz&lt;0.35. we find dn/dz=0.25 and omega(hi)=1.4x10^-3 for dlas, and dn/dz=0.08with omega(hi)=4.2x10^-5 for sub-dlas over a redshift path delta z=11.9. todemonstrate the scientific potential of such systems, we present a detailedanalysis of the dla at z=0.1140 in the spectrum of sdss j1009+0713. profilefits to the absorption lines determine log n(h i)=20.68pm0.10 with ametallicity determined from the undepleted element sulfur of [s/h]=-0.62pm0.18.the abundance pattern of this dla is similar to that of higher z dlas, showingmild depletion of the refractory elements fe and ti with [s/fe]=+0.24pm0.22 and[s/ti]=+0.28pm0.15. nitrogen is underabundant in this system with[n/h]=-1.40pm0.14, placing this dla below the plateau of the [n/alpha]measurements in the local universe at similar metallicities. this dla has asimple kinematic structure with only two components required to fit theprofiles and a kinematic width of 52 km/s. imaging of the qso field with wfc3reveals a spiral galaxy at very small impact parameter to the qso and severalgalaxies within 10". followup spectra with lris reveal that none of the nearbygalaxies are at the redshift of the dla. the spiral galaxy is identified as thehost galaxy of the qso based on the near perfect alignment of the nucleus anddisk of the galaxy as well as spectra of an h ii region showing emission linesat the qso redshift. a small feature appears 0.70" from the nucleus of the qsoafter psf subtraction, providing another candidate for the host galaxy of thedla.

1209.3320	project lyman: quantifying 11 gyrs of metagalactic ionizing background  evolution	the timing and duration of the reionization epoch is crucial to the emergenceand evolution of structure in the universe. the relative roles thatstar-forming galaxies, active galactic nuclei and quasars play in contributingto the metagalactic ionizing background across cosmic time remains uncertain.deep quasar counts provide insights into their role, but the potentiallycrucial contribution from star-formation is highly uncertain due to our poorunderstanding of the processes that allow ionizing radiation to escape into theintergalactic medium (igm). the fraction of ionizing photons that escape fromstar-forming galaxies is a fundamental free parameter used in models to"fine-tune" the timing and duration of the reionization epoch that occurredsomewhere between 13.4 and 12.7 gyrs ago (redshifts between 12 &gt; z &gt; 6).however, direct observation of lyman continuum (lyc) photons emitted below therest frame \ion{h}{1} ionization edge at 912 \aa\ is increasingly improbable atredshifts z &gt; 3, due to the steady increase of intervening lyman limit systemstowards high z. thus uv and u-band optical bandpasses provide the only hope fordirect, up close and in depth, observations of the types of environment thatfavor lyc escape. by quantifying the evolution over the past 11 billion years(z &lt; 3) of the relationships between lyc escape and local and global parameters..., we can provide definitive information on the lyc escape fraction that isso crucial to answering the question of, how did the universe come to beionized? here we provide estimates of the ionizing continuum flux emitted by"characteristic" (l_{uv}^*) star-forming galaxies as a function of look backtime and escape fraction, finding that at z = 1 (7.6 gyrs ago) l_{uv}^*galaxies with an escape fraction of 1% have a flux of 10^{-19} ergs cm^{-2}s^{-1} \aa^{-1}.

0712.1108	the color excess of quasars with intervening dla systems- analysis of  the sdss data release five	we analyzed the spectroscopic and photometric database of the 5th datarelease of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) to search for evidence of thequasar reddening produced by dust embedded in intervening damped ly alpha (dla)systems. from a list of 5164 quasars in the interval of emission redshift 2.25&lt;/= z_e &lt;/= 3.5 and sdss spectra with signal-to-noise ratio snr &gt;/= 4, we builtup an "absorption sample" of 248 qsos with a single dla system in the intervalof absorption redshift 2.2 &lt; z_a &lt;/= 3.5 and a "pool" of 1959 control qsoswithout dla systems or strong metal systems. for each qso of the absorptionsample we extracted from the pool a subset of control qsos that are closest inredshift and magnitude. the mean color of this subset was used as a zero pointto measure the "deviation from the mean color" of individual dla-qsos, delta_i.the colors were measured using "best" ugriz sdss imaging data. the mean colorexcess of the absorption sample, &lt;e&gt;, was estimated by averaging the individualcolor deviations delta_i. we find &lt;e(r-z)&gt; = 27 +/- 9 x 10**(-3) mag and&lt;e(g-z)&gt; = 54 +/- 12 x 10**(-3) mag. these values are representative of thereddening of dla systems at z_a ~ 2.7 in sdss qsos with limiting magnitude r=/~ 20.2. the detection of the mean reddening is confirmed by severalstatistical tests. analysis of the results suggests an origin of the reddeningin dust embedded in the dla systems, with an smc-type extinction curve. byconverting the reddening into rest-frame extinction, we derive a meandust-to-gas ratio &lt;a_v/n(hi)&gt; ~ 2 to 4 x 10**(-23) mag cm^2. this value is ~-1.25 dex lower than the mean dust-to-gas ratio of the milky way, in line withthe lower level of metallicity in the present dla sample.

1302.2948	on the redshift of the very high energy blazar 3c 66a	as a bright gamma-ray source, 3c 66a is of great interest to the high-energyastrophysics community, having a potential for placing cosmological constraintson models for the extragalactic background light (ebl) and the processes whichcontribute to this photon field. no firm spectroscopic redshift measurement hasbeen possible for this blazar due to a lack of intrinsic emission andabsorption features in optical spectra. we present new far-ultraviolet spectrafrom the hubble space telescope/cosmic origins spectrograph (hst/cos) of the bllac object 3c 66a covering the wavelength range 1132 to 1800 angstroms . thedata show a smooth continuum with intergalactic medium absorption featureswhich can be used to place a firm lower limit on the blazar redshift ofz&gt;0.3347. an upper limit is set by statistically treating the non-detection ofadditional absorbers beyond z=0.3347, indicating a redshift of less than 0.41at 99% confidence and ruling out z&gt;0.444 at 99.9% confidence. we conclude byshowing how the redshift limits derived from the cos spectra remove thepotential for this gamma-ray emitting blazar to place an upper limit on theflux of the ebl using high energy data from a flare in october of 2009.

1305.4941	the nature of massive black hole binary candidates: i. spectral  properties and evolution	theoretically, bound binaries of massive black holes are expected as thenatural outcome of mergers of massive galaxies. from the observational side,however, massive black hole binaries remain elusive. velocity shifts betweennarrow and broad emission lines in quasar spectra are considered a promisingobservational tool to search for spatially unresolved, dynamically boundbinaries. in this series of papers we investigate the nature of such candidatesthrough analyses of their spectra, images and multi-wavelength spectral energydistributions. here we investigate the properties of the optical spectra,including the evolution of the broad line profiles, of all the sourcesidentified in our previous study. we find a diverse phenomenology of broad andnarrow line luminosities, widths, shapes, ionization conditions and timevariability, which we can broadly ascribe to 4 classes based on the shape ofthe broad line profiles: 1) objects with bell-shaped broad lines with bigvelocity shifts (&gt;1000 km/s) compared to their narrow lines show a variety ofbroad line widths and luminosities, modest flux variations over a few years,and no significant change in the broad line peak wavelength. 2) objects withdouble-peaked broad emission lines tend to show very luminous and broadenedlines, and little time variability. 3) objects with asymmetric broad emissionlines show a broad range of broad line luminosities and significant variabilityof the line profiles. 4) the remaining sources tend to show moderate to lowbroad line luminosities, and can be ascribed to diverse phenomena. we discussthe implications of our findings in the context of massive black hole binarysearches.

0802.0737	the molecular hydrogen deficit in gamma-ray burst afterglows	recent analysis of five gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglow spectra reveal theabsence of molecular hydrogen absorption lines, a surprising result in light oftheir large neutral hydrogen column densities and the detection of h$_2$ insimilar, more local star-forming regions like 30 doradus in the largemagellanic cloud (lmc). observational evidence further indicates that the bulkof the neutral hydrogen column in these sight lines lies 100 pc beyond theprogenitor and that h$_2$ was absent prior to the burst, suggesting that directflux from the star, fuv background fields, or both suppressed its formation. wepresent one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical models of grb host galaxyenvironments, including self-consistent radiative transfer of both ionizing andlyman-werner photons, nine-species primordial chemistry with dust formation ofh$_2$, and dust extinction of uv photons. we find that a single grb progenitoris sufficient to ionize neutral hydrogen to distances of 50 - 100 pc but that agalactic lyman-werner background is required to dissociate the molecularhydrogen in the ambient ism. intensities of 0.1 - 100 times the galactic meanare necessary to destroy h$_2$ in the cloud, depending on its density andmetallicity. the minimum radii at which neutral hydrogen will be found inafterglow spectra is insensitive to the mass of the progenitor or the initialmass function (imf) of its cluster, if present.

1403.4931	the nature of massive black hole binary candidates: ii. spectral energy  distribution atlas	recoiling supermassive black holes (smbhs) are considered one plausiblephysical mechanism to explain high velocity shifts between narrow and broademission lines sometimes observed in quasar spectra. if the sphere of influenceof the recoiling smbh is such that only the accretion disc is bound, the dustytorus would be left behind, hence the sed should then present distinctivefeatures (i.e. a mid-infrared deficit). here we present results from fittingthe spectral energy distributions (seds) of 32 type-1 agn with high velocityshifts between broad and narrow lines. the aim is to find peculiar propertiesin the multi-wavelength seds of such objects by comparing their physicalparameters (torus and disc luminosity, intrinsic reddening, and size of the12$\mu$m emitter) with those estimated from a control sample of $\sim1000$\emph{typical} quasars selected from the sloan digital sky survey in the sameredshift range. we find that all sources, with the possible exception ofj1154+0134, analysed here present a significant amount of 12~$\mu$m emission.this is in contrast with a scenario of a smbh displaced from the center of thegalaxy, as expected for an undergoing recoil event.

1503.02084	baryon cycling in the low-redshift circumgalactic medium: a comparison  of simulations to the cos-halos survey	we analyze the low-redshift (z~0.2) circumgalactic medium by comparingabsorption-line data from the cos-halos survey to absorption around a matchedgalaxy sample from two cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. the modelsinclude different prescriptions for galactic outflows, namely hybridenergy/momentum driven wind (ezw), and constant winds (cw). we extract forcomparison direct observables including equivalent widths, covering factors,ion ratios, and kinematics. both wind models are generally in good agreementwith these observations for hi and certain low ionization metal lines, but showpoorer agreement with higher ionization metal lines including siiii and ovithat are well-observed by cos-halos. these discrepancies suggest that both windmodels predict too much cool, metal-enriched gas and not enough hot gas, and/orthat the metals are not sufficiently well-mixed. this may reflect our modelassumption of ejecting outflows as cool and unmixing gas. our ezw simulationincludes a heuristic prescription to quench massive galaxies by super-heatingits ism gas, which we show yields sufficient low ionisation absorption to bebroadly consistent with observations, but also substantial ovi absorption thatis inconsistent with data, suggesting that gas around quenched galaxies in thereal universe does not cool. at impact parameters of &lt;50 kpc, recycling windsdominate the absorption of low ions and even hi, while ovi almost always arisesfrom metals ejected longer than 1 gyr ago. the similarity between the windmodels is surprising, since we show that they differ substantially in theirpredicted amount and phase distribution of halo gas. we show that thissimilarity owes mainly to our comparison here at fixed stellar mass rather thanat fixed halo mass in our previous works, which suggests that cgm propertiesare more closely tied to the stellar mass of galaxies rather than halo mass.

astro-ph;0002449	what damped ly-alpha systems tell us about the radial distribution of  cold gas at high redshift	we investigate the properties of damped lyman-alpha systems (dlas) insemi-analytic models, focusing on whether the models can reproduce thekinematic properties of low-ionization metal lines described by prochaska &amp;wolfe (1997b, 1998). we explore a variety of approaches for modelling theradial distribution of the cold neutral gas associated with the galaxies in ourmodels, and find that our results are very sensitive to this ingredient. if weuse an approach based on fall &amp; efstathiou (1980), in which the sizes of thediscs are determined by conservation of angular momentum, we find that themajority of the dlas correspond to a single galactic disc. these modelsgenerically fail to reproduce the observed distribution of velocity widths. inalternative models in which the gas discs are considerably more extended, asignificant fraction of dlas arise from lines of sight intersecting multiplegas discs in a common halo. these models produce kinematics that fit theobservational data, and also seem to agree well with the results of recenthydrodynamical simulations. thus we conclude that cold dark matter based modelsof galaxy formation can be reconciled with the kinematic data, but only at theexpense of the standard assumption that dlas are produced by rotationallysupported gas discs whose sizes are determined by conservation of angularmomentum. we suggest that the distribution of cold gas at high redshift may bedominated by another process, such as tidal streaming due to mergers.

astro-ph;0009001	the origin of a chemically enriched lya absorption system at z=0.167	we present the first detailed analysis of the chemical abundances, ionizationstate, and origin of a partial lyman limit system (n(\hi) ~ 10^{16} \cmjj) atlow redshift (z=0.167 towards pks0405-1219). two galaxies at ~ 70 h^{-1} kpcprojected distance to the qso have been identified at the absorber redshift. weanalyze an echelle spectrum of the qso obtained with the space telescopeimaging spectrograph and find that this absorption system exhibits associatedlines produced by c^+, n^+, o^0, si^+, si^{++}, si^{+3}, fe^+, and fe^{++}, andmost interestingly, o^{+5} and n^{+4}. the results of our analysis show thatthe partial lyman limit system traced by various ions is likely to be embeddedin a collisionally ionized \ovi gas of larger spatial extent. furthermore, thepartial lyman limit system appears to have a metallicity of {\em at least} 1/10solar and most likely solar or super solar despite the fact that no luminousgalaxies are seen within a projected distance \rho = 60 h^{-1} kpc to the qso.finally, adopting the temperature estimated for the hot gas t ~ 2.5\times 10^5k and assuming a simple isothermal halo, we estimate that the galaxy or galaxygroup that supports the extended gas may have a total mass ~ 1.5\times 10^{12}m_\odot and a gas number density \apl 3\times 10^{-5} cm^{-3}.

astro-ph;0009081	ionized gas in damped lyman alpha protogalaxies: i. model-independent  inferences from kinematic data	we investigate the kinematics of ionized and neutral gas in a sample of 35damped lyman alpha protogalaxies (dlas) with hires on the keck i 10 mtelescope. velocity profiles with resolution of ~ 8 km/s are obtained for highions such as c iv and si iv, and for intermediate ions such as al iii.combining these profiles with accurate low-ion (e.g., fe ii) profiles, weinvestigate the kinematic state of dlas in the redshift range 1.8 &lt; z &lt; 4.4 bycomparisons between data for various ion pairs.  we find the dlas comprise distinct kinematic subsystems: a low ion subsystemin which the low ions are physically associated with intermediate ions, and ahigh subsystem containing neither low nor intermediate ions. the evidence fortwo subsystems stems from (a) differences between the widths of the velocityprofiles, (b) misalignment in velocity space between the narrow componentscomprising the profiles in each subsystem, and (c) significant dissimilaritiesbetween the mean velocities of the high ion and low ion velocity profiles. inevery case we find that test statistics such as velocity width and variousasymmetry parameters distribute differently for low ions than for high ions.  despite misalignment in velocity space, the low and high ion kinematicsubsystems are interrelated. this is indicated by detection of a statisticallysignificant c iv versus low-ion cross correlation function, and by a systematiceffect where the c iv velocity widths are greater than or equal to the low ionvelocity widths in 29 out of 32 systems. these phenomena are consistent withthe location of the two subsystems in the same potential well.

astro-ph;0009082	ionized gas in damped lyman alpha protogalaxies: ii. comparison between  models and the kinematic data	we test semi-analytic models for galaxy formation with accurate kinematicdata of damped lyman alpha protogalaxies (dlas) presented in the companionpaper i. the models envisage centrifugally supported exponential disks at thecenters of dark matter halos which are filled with ionized gas undergoingradial infall to the disks. the halo masses are drawn from cross-sectionweighted mass distributions predicted by cdm cosmogonies, or by the nullhypothesis (tf model) that the dark matter mass distribution has not evolvedsince z ~ 3. in our models, c iv absorption lines detected in dlas arise ininfalling ionized clouds while the low-ion absorption lines arise from neutralgas in the disks. using monte carlo methods we find: (a) the cdm models areincompatible with the low-ion statistics at more than 99% confidence whereassome tf models cannot be excluded at more than 88% confidence. (b) both cdm andtf models agree with the observed distribution of c iv velocity widths. (c) thecdm models generate differences between the mean velocities of c iv and low ionprofiles in agreement with the data, while the tf model produces differences inthe means that are too large. (d) both cdm and tf models produce ratios of c ivto low-ion velocity widths that are too large. (e) both cdm and tf modelsgenerate c iv versus low-ion cross-correlation functions incompatible with thedata.  while it is possible to select model parameters resulting in consistency withthe data, the disk-halo configuration assumed in both cosmogonies still doesnot produce significant overlap in velocity space between c iv low-ion velocityprofiles. we conjecture that including angular momentum of the infalling cloudswill increase the overlap between c iv and low-ion profiles.

astro-ph;0104466	the first detection of co in a damped lyman alpha system	the study of elemental abundances in damped lyman alpha systems (dlas) athigh redshift represents one of our best opportunities to probe galaxyformation and chemical evolution at early times. by coupling measurements madein high z dlas with our knowledge of abundances determined locally and withnucleosynthetic models, we can start to piece together the star formationhistories of these galaxies. here, we discuss the clues to galactic chemicalevolution that may be gleaned from studying the abundance of co in dlas. wepresent high resolution echelle spectra of two qsos, q2206-199 and q1223+17,both already known to exhibit intervening damped systems. these observationshave resulted in the first ever detection of co at high redshift, associatedwith the z= 1.92 dla in the sightline towards q2206-199. we find that theabundance of co is approximately 1/4 solar and that there is a clearoverabundance relative to iron, [co/fe] = +0.31 +/- 0.05. from the abundance ofzn, we determine that this is a relatively metal-rich dla, with a metallicityapproximately 1/3 solar. therefore, this first detection of co is similar tothe marked overabundance relative to fe seen in galactic bulge and thick diskstars.

astro-ph;0202036	metal abundances and ionization conditions in a possibly dust-free  damped ly-alpha system at z=2.3	we have obtained a high resolution, high s/n uves spectrum of the bright qsohe2243-6031 to analyze the damped ly-alpha system (dla) observed at z=2.33. themetallicity of this system is 1/12 solar at a neutral hydrogen column densityof log n(hi)=20.7. from the observed ratios [zn/cr]=-0.01+/-0.05 and[s/si]=-0.06+/-0.03$ we conclude that dust is very likely absent from the ismof this protogalaxy. we observe an enhancement of the alpha/fe-peak ratios of+0.2 dex for various elements, a marked odd-even effect in mn, and a strongunderabundance of n relative to si and s, [n/si,s]=-1 at [si/h]=-0.86. all ofthese ratios support an environment that is in an early evolutionary stage,where the onset of star formation has begun only shortly before the dla wasobserved. we also perform a cloud-by-cloud analysis -- without precedent athigh redshift -- and find a tight correlation of all low-ionization specieswith respect to feii extending over 2.5 orders of magnitude in n(feii). weinterpret this trend as being due to homogeneous physical conditions (very mildionization effects, common dust-destruction histories, same chemicalcomposition) and propose that this line of sight encounters absorbing cloudsthat share a common environment. in addition, photoionization models show thatthese single clouds are shielded from the external ionizing radiation, so thefraction of ionized gas is small and, except for argon, does not influence themeasured metal abundances. the observed aliii/low-ion ratios suggest the mildlyionized gas occurs in shells surrounding neutral cores of alii.

astro-ph;0202140	the ucsd hires/kecki damped lya abundance database iii. an empirical  study of photoionization in the damped lya system toward gb1759+7539	we investigate the ionization state of the damped lya system at z=2.62 towardgb1759+7539 through an analysis of ionic ratios sensitive to photoionization:ari/sii, feiii/feii, nii/ni, aliii/alii. approximately half of the metals arisein a mostly neutral velocity component with hi/h &gt; 0.9, based on feiii/feii &lt;0.013. in contrast, the remaining half exhibits feiii/feii~0.3 indicative of apartially ionized medium with hi/h~0.5. these conclusions are supported by theobserved nii/ni, aliii/alii, and ari/sii ratios.  we assess ionization corrections for the observed column densities throughphotoionization models derived from the cloudy software package. in the neutralgas, the ionization corrections are negligible except for ari. however for thepartially ionized gas, element abundance ratios differ from the ionic ratios by0.1-0.3 dex for (siii, sii, niii, alii)/feii ratios and more for (ni,ari)/feii. independent of the shape of the photoionizing spectrum andassumptions on the number of ionization phases, these ionization correctionshave minimal impact (&lt;0.1dex) on the total metallicity inferred for this dampedlya system. measurements on the relative elemental abundances of the partiallyionized gas, however, have a greater than ~0.15 dex uncertainty which hides theeffects of nucleosynthesis and dust depletion.  we caution the reader that this damped system is unusual for a number ofreasons (e.g. a very low ari/sii ratio) and we believe its ionizationproperties are special but not unique. nevertheless, it clearly shows the valueof examining photoionization diagnostics like feiii/feii in a larger sample ofsystems.

astro-ph;0203524	metallicity evolution of damped lyman alpha systems in lambda cdm  cosmology	utilizing a new, high mass resolution hydrodynamic simulation we compute themetallicity evolution of damped lyman alpha systems (dlas) and find areasonable agreement with observations. in particular, the observed slowevolution of the dla metallicity occurs naturally in the simulation due to thecombined effects of physical and observational selection. the slow metallicityevolution is caused by the steady transformation, with increasing time, of thehighest metallicity systems to "galaxies", thus depleting this category, whileall the lower metallicity systems show, individually, an increase inmetallicity. although the trend of dla metallicity with redshift is in goodagreement with observations, it appears that the average metallicity ofsimulated dlas is higher than observed by 0.3-0.5 dex in the probed redshiftrange (z=0-5). our study indicates that this difference may be attributed toobservational selection effects due to dust obscuration. if we allow for a dustobscuration effect, our model reproduces the observed metallicity evolution inboth amplitude and slope. we find that dlas are not a simple population butprobe a range of different systems and the mix changes with redshift. about 50%of all metals in the gaseous phase is in dlas at all times from z=5 to z=1,making a rapid downturn at z\le 1 to ~20% by z=0, as metals are swept into thehotter components of the igm as well as locked up in stars. while not theprimary focus of this study, we find that the model provides good matches toobservations with respect to column density distribution and evolution ofneutral gas content, if the same dust obscuration is taken into account. wefind omega_{dla,comp}=(1-3)e-3, depending on the effect of dust obscuration.

astro-ph;0211231	damped lyman alpha systems and galaxy formation models - ii. high ions  and lyman limit systems	we investigate a model for the high-ionization state gas associated withobserved damped lyman-alpha systems, based on a semi-analytic model of galaxyformation set within the paradigm of hierarchical structure formation. in ourmodel, the hot gas in halos and sub-halos gives rise to civ absorption, whilethe low-ionization state gas is associated with the cold gas in galaxies. themodel matches the distribution of civ column densities and leads naturally tokinematic properties that are in good agreement with the data.  we examine the contribution of both hot and cold gas to sub-damped systemsand suggest that the properties of these systems can be used as an importanttest of the model. we expect that sub-dla systems will generally be composed ofa single gas disk and thus predict that they should have markedly differentkinematics than the damped systems.  finally, we find that hot halo gas produces less than one third of lymanlimit systems at redshift three. we model the contribution of mini-halos (haloswith virial velocities &lt; 35 km/s) to lyman limit systems and find that they maycontain as much gas as is observed in these systems. however, if we adoptrealistic models of the gas density distribution we find that these systems arenot a significant source of lyman limit absorption. instead we suggest thatuncollapsed gas outside of virialized halos is responsible for most of thelyman limit systems at high redshift.

astro-ph;0305004	the elemental abundance pattern in a galaxy at z=2.626	the discovery of metal-poor stars (where metal is any element more massivethan helium) has enabled astronomers to probe the chemical enrichment historyof the milky way. more recently, element abundances in gas inside high-redshiftgalaxies has been probed through the absorption lines imprinted on the spectraof background quasars, but these have typically yielded measurements of only afew elements. furthermore, interpretation of these abundances is complicated bythe fact that differential incorporation of metals into dust can produce anabundance pattern similar to that expected from nucleosynthesis by massivestars. here we report the observation of over 25 elements in a galaxy atz=2.626. with these data, we can examine nucleosynthetic processes independentof the uncertainty arising from depletion. we find that the galaxy was enrichedmainly by massive stars (m &gt; 15 solar masses) and propose that it is theprogenitor of a massive, elliptical galaxy. the detailed abundance patternssuggest that boron is produced through processes that act independently ofmetallicity, and may require alternative mechanisms for the nucleosynthesis ofgermanium.

astro-ph;0403391	the sdss damped lya survey: data release 1	we present the results from an automated search for damped lya (dla) systemsin the quasar spectra of data release 1 from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss-dr1). at z~2.5, this homogeneous dataset has greater statisticalsignificance than the previous two decades of research. we derive a statisticalsample of 71 damped lya systems (&gt;50 previously unpublished) at z&gt;2.1 andmeasure hi column densities directly from the sdss spectra. the number of dlasystems per unit redshift is consistent with previous measurements and weexpect our survey has &gt;95% completeness. we examine the cosmological baryonicmass density of neutral gas omega_g inferred from the damped lya systems fromthe sdss-dr1 survey and a combined sample drawn from the literature. contraryto previous results, the omega_g values do not require a significant correctionfrom lyman limit systems at any redshift. we also find that the omega_g valuesfor the sdss-dr1 sample do not decline at high redshift and the combined sampleshows a (statistically insignificant) decrease only at z&gt;4. future datareleases from sdss will provide the definitive survey of dla systems at z~2.5and will significantly reduce the uncertainty in omega_g at higher redshift.

astro-ph;0407465	discovery of a primitive damped lyman alpha absorber near an x-ray  bright galaxy group in the virgo cluster	we present a new uv echelle spectrum of pg1216+069, obtained with hst+stis,which reveals damped lya (dla) absorption as well as o i, c ii, si ii, and feii absorption lines at z(abs) = 0.00632 near the ngc4261 group. the absorbershows no evidence of highly-ionized gas, which places constraints on "warm-hot"missing baryons in the ngc4261 group. the well-developed damping wings of thelya line tightly constrain the h i column density; we find log n(h i) =19.32+/-0.03. the metallicity of this sub-dla is remarkably low, [o/h] =-1.60^{+0.09}_{-0.11}, which is comparable to many analogous high-redshiftsystems, and the iron abundance indicates that this absorber contains little orno dust. nitrogen is underabundant; we detect neither n i or n ii, and we showthat this is not due to ionization effects but rather indicates that [n/o] &lt;-0.28 (3sigma). despite the proximity to ngc4261 group, there are no brightgalaxies close to the sight line at the absorption redshift. the nearest knowngalaxy is a sub-l* galaxy with a projected distance rho = 86 kpc; the closestl* galaxy is ngc4260 at rho = 246 kpc. the low metallicity and [n/o] indicatethat this low-z sub-dla is a relatively primitive gas cloud. we consider thenature and origin of the sub-dla, and we find several possibilities. theproperties of the sub-dla are similar to those of the interstellar media inblue compact dwarf galaxies and are also reminiscent of milky way hvcs. or, theobject could simply be a small dark-matter halo, self-enriched by a smallamount of internal star formation but mostly undisturbed since its initialformation. in this case, the small halo would likely be an ancient buildingblock of galaxy formation that formed before the epoch of reionization.

astro-ph;0407517	on the nature of the heat source for damped lya systems	we investigate the heat source of the neutral gas comprising dlas. unlike thelya forest, where the extragalactic background radiation field ionizes andheats the gas, we find that grain photoelectric heating by the fuv backgroundis not sufficient to balance the c ii 158um cooling rate inferred from dlas. inthese systems, a local energy source is required. we show that in the case ofthe z=1.919 dla toward q2206-19, the local source is fuv emission from theassociated galaxy found by moller et al (2002): the mean intensity inferredfrom photometry is in good agreement with the intensity jnu required to explainthe cooling rate. the fuv mean intensity predicted for a cold neutral medium(cnm) model, jnu=(1.7+2.7-1.0)x10^(-18) cgs (95% c.l.), is the largest expectedfrom our cii* study of 45 dlas. this may explain why this is the only confirmeddla yet detected in emission at z&gt;1.9. we argue that in most dlas with detectedcii* absorption, jnu is between 10^{-19} and 10^{-18} and heats the gas whichis a cnm. by contrast, in most dlas with upper limits on cii* absorption thegas is a warm neutral medium (wnm). surprisingly, the upper limits arecompatible with the same range of jnu values suggesting the majority of dlasare heated by radiation fields generated by a limited range of star formationrates per unit h i area, between 10^{-3} and 10^{-2} msol/kpc^2. we also showthat cii* absorption is unlikely to arise in gas that is ionized.

astro-ph;0408294	probing the igm/galaxy connection toward pks0405-123 i: uv spectroscopy  and metal-line systems	we present results from an analysis of fuse and hst/stis spectroscopy of thez_em=0.57 quasar pks0405-123. we focus on the intervening metal-line systemsidentified along the sightline and investigate their ionization mechanism,ionization state, and chemical abundances. we identify six ovi absorbers to a3sigma equivalent width (ew) limit of 60ma. this implies an incidence dn/dz =16^{+9}_{-6} consistent with previous ovi studies. in half of the ovi systemswe report positive detections of ciii suggesting the gas is predominantlyphotoionized, has multiple ionization phases, or is in a non-equilibrium state.this contrasts with the general description of the warm-hot intergalacticmedium (whim) as described by numerical simulations where the gas ispredominantly in collisional ionization equilibrium. we have also searched thesightline for the neviii doublet (a better probe of whim gas with t&gt;10^6k) overthe redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;z_em and report no positive detections to an ew limitof 80ma giving dn/dz&lt;40 at 95% c.l. the photoionized metal-line systems exhibita correlation between the ionization parameter (u) and hi column density forn(hi) = 10^(14-16) cm^-2. both the slope and normalization of this correlationmatch the prediction inferred from the results of dave and tripp for the low zlya forest. in turn, the data show a tentative, unexpected result: five out ofthe six photoionized metal-line systems show a total hydrogen column densitywithin a factor of 2 of 10^18.7 cm^-2. finally, the median metallicity [m/h] oftwelve z~0.3 absorbers with n(hi)&gt;10^14 cm^-2 is [m/h] ~&gt; -1.5 with largescatter. this significantly exceeds the median metallicity of civ and ovisystems at z~3 and indicates enrichment of the intergalactic medium over thepast 10gyr.

astro-ph;0411776	on the incidence and kinematics of strong mg ii absorbers	we present the results of two investigations into the nature of strong (restequivalent width &gt; 1.0 ang) mg ii absorption systems at high redshift. thefirst line of questioning examines the complete sdss- dr3 set of quasar spectrato determine the evolution of the incidence of strong mg ii absorption. theredshift evolution of the comoving line-of-sight number density, l(x), ischaracterized by a roughly constant value at z &gt; 0.8, indicating that theproduct of the number density and gas cross-section of halos hosting strong mgii is unevolving at these redshifts. at z &lt; 0.8 there is a decline in l(x),which we interpret as a decrease in the gas cross-section to strong mg iiabsorption and therefore a decline in the physical processes relevant to suchabsorption. this evolution roughly tracks the global evolution of the sfrdensity. the decrease of l(x) is more pronounced for larger equivalent widthsystems. we also present the results of a search for strong mg ii absorption in91 high resolution quasar spectra, which allow us to investigate the kinematicsof such systems. these systems are characterized by the presence of numerouscomponents spread over a ~200 km/s velocity width and the presence of morehighly ionized species, which display kinematic profiles similar to thecorresponding mg ii absorption. we consider these results in light of twocompeting theories to explain strong mg ii absorption: post-starburst,sn-driven galactic winds and accreting gas in the halos of massive galaxies.the later model is disfavored by the absence of evolution in l(x) at z &gt; 1. weargue that the strong mg ii phenomenon primarily arises from feedback processesin relatively low mass galactic halos related to star formation.

(2) a maximum-likelihood analysis shows that lya absorbers of logn(hi) &lt; 13.6 are consistent with being more randomly distributed with respectto known galaxies. finally, (3) we find based on this single sightline that theamplitude of xi_{ga} does not depend sensitively on n(hi) for strong absorbersof log n(hi) &gt;= 13.6.

astro-ph;0508270	echelle spectroscopy of a grb afterglow at z=3.969: a new probe of the  interstellar and intergalactic media in the young universe	we present an echelle spectrum of the swift grb 050730, obtained four hoursafter the burst using the mike spectrograph on the magellan clay telescope whenthe afterglow was at r=17.7. the spectrum reveals a forest of absorptionfeatures superimposed on a simple power-law shaped continuum, best described asf_nu(lambda)\propto lambda^{alpha} with alpha =1.88\pm 0.01 overlambda=7000-9000 a. we identify the grb host at z_grb=3.96855 based on thehydrogen lyman absorption series, narrow absorption lines due to heavy ionssuch as oi, cii, siii, sii, niii, feii, civ, siiv, and nv, and fine structuretransitions such as oi*, oi**, siii*, cii*, and feii*. together thesetransitions allow us to study the the properties of the interstellar medium(ism) in the grb host. the principal results are as follows. (1) we estimate aneutral hydrogen column density of log n(hi)=22.15\pm 0.05 in the host. (2) theassociated metal lines exhibit multiple components over a velocity range of ~80km/s, with &gt;90% of the neutral gas confined in 20 km/s. (3) comparisons betweendifferent ionic transitions show that the host has little/no dust depletion andhas 1/100 solar metallicity. (4) the absorbing gas has much higher density thanthat of intervening damped lya absorption (dla) systems. in addition, we reportthe identification of an intervening dla system at z_dla=3.56439 with logn(hi)=20.3\pm 0.1 and &lt; 5% solar metallicity, a lyman limit system atz_lls=3.02209 with log n(hi)=19.9\pm 0.1, a strong mgii absorber atz_mgii=2.25313, and a pair of mgii absorbers at z_mgii=1.7731, 57 km/s apart.we demonstrate that rapid echelle spectroscopy of grb afterglows helps toreveal a wealth of information in the ism and the intergalactic medium alongthe sightline (abridged).

astro-ph;0510786	adaptive mesh refinement simulations of the ionization structure and  kinematics of damped ly$\alpha$ systems with self-consistent radiative  transfer	we use high resolution eulerian hydrodynamics simulations to study kinematicproperties of the low ionization species in damped ly-alpha systems at redshiftz=3. our adaptive mesh refinement simulations include most key ingredientsrelevant for modeling neutral gas in high-column density absorbers:hydrodynamics, gravitational collapse, continuum radiative transfer and gaschemistry, but no star formation. we model high-resolution keck spectra withunsaturated low ion transitions in two si ii lines (1526 and 1808 a), andcompare simulated line profiles to the data from the sdss dla survey.  we find that with increasing grid resolution the models show a trend inconvergence towards the observed distribution of hi column densities. while inour highest resolution model we recover the cumulative number of dlas per unitabsorption distance, none of our models predicts dla velocity widths as high asindicated by the data, suggesting that feedback from star formation might beimportant. at z=3 a non-negligible fraction of dlas with column densities below10^21 cm^-2 is caused by tidal tails due to galaxy-galaxy interactions in moremassive halo environments. lower column density absorbers with n_hi &lt; 10^21.4cm^-2 are sensitive to changes in the uv background resulting in a 10%reduction of the cumulative number of dlas for twice the quasar backgroundrelative to the fiducial value. we find that the mass cut-off below which alarge fraction of dwarf galaxies cannot retain gas after reionization is 7*10^7msun, lower than the previous estimates. finally, we show that models withself-shielding commonly used in the literature produce significantly lower dlavelocity widths than the full radiative transfer runs.

astro-ph;0606500	on the perils of curve-of-growth analysis: systematic abundance  underestimates for the gas in gamma-ray burst host galaxies	we examine the practice of deriving interstellar medium (ism) abundances fromlow-resolution spectroscopy of grb afterglows. we argue that the multi-ionsingle-component curve-of-growth analysis technique systematicallyunderestimates the column densities of the metal-line profiles commonlyobserved for grb. this systematic underestimate is accentuated by the fact thatmany grb line-profiles (e.g. grb 050730, grb 050820, grb 051111) are comprisedof `clouds' with a bi-modal distribution of column density. such line-profilesmay be characteristic of a sightline which penetrates both a high densitystar-forming region and more distant, ambient ism material. our analysissuggests that the majority of abundances reported in the literature aresystematically underestimates and that the reported errors are frequentlyover-optimistic. further, we demonstrate that one cannot even report preciserelative abundances with confidence. the implications are profound for ourcurrent understanding on the metallicity, dust-to-gas ratio, and chemicalabundances of the ism in grb host galaxies. for example, we argue that all buta few sightlines allow for the gas to have at least solar metallicity. finally,we suggests new approaches for constraining the abundances.

astro-ph;0606573	super-solar super lyman limit systems	we present abundance measurements for two super lyman limit systems (slls;quasar absorption line systems with 10^19 cm^-2 &lt; n_hi &lt; 10^20.3 cm^-2)selected from a set of metal-strong absorbers in the sloan digital sky surveyquasar database. after applying estimate corrections for photoionizationeffects, we derive gas-phase metallicities of [m/h]=+0.7 +/- 0.2 dex for theslls at z=1.7749 toward sdss0927+5621 and [m/h]=+0.05 +/- 0.1 dex for the sllsat z=1.7678 toward sdss0953+5230. the former exhibits among the highest gasmetallicity of any astrophysical environment and its total metal surfacedensity exceeds that of nearly every known damped lya system. the properties ofthese absorbers -- high metallicity and large velocity width (&gt; 300 km/s) --resemble those of gas observed in absorption in the spectra of bright,star-forming galaxies at high redshift. we discuss the metal mass density ofthe slls based on these observations and our ongoing slls survey and argue thata conservative estimate to the total metal budget at z=2 is greater than 15% ofthe total, suggesting that the metal-rich lls may represent the dominant metalreservoir in the young universe.

astro-ph;0607149	survey for galaxies associated with z~3 damped lyman alpha systems ii:  galaxy-absorber correlation functions	we use 211 galaxy spectra from our survey for lyman break galaxies (lbgs)associated with 11 damped lyman alpha systems (dlas) to measure thethree-dimensional lbg auto-correlation and dla-lbg cross-correlation functionswith the primary goal of inferring the mass of dlas at z~3. conventionalbinning of the data while varying both r_0 and gamma parameters of the fiducialmodel of the correlation function xi(r)=(r/r_0)^{-gamma} resulted in the bestfit values and 1 sigma uncertainties of r_0=2.65+/-0.48, gamma=1.55+/-0.40 forthe lbg auto-correlation and r_0=3.32+/-1.25, gamma=1.74+/-0.36 for dla-lbgcross-correlation function. to circumvent shortcomings found in binning smalldatasets, we perform a maximum likelihood analysis based on poisson statistics.  the best fit values and 1 sigma confidence levels from this analysis werefound to be r_0=2.91(+1.0,-1.0), gamma=1.21(+0.6,-0.3) for the lbgauto-correlation and r_0=2.81(+1.4,-2.0), gamma=2.11(+1.3,-1.4) for the dla-lbgcross-correlation function. we report a redshift spike of five lbgs with deltaz = 0.015 of the z=2.936 dla in the pss0808+5215 field and find that thedla-lbg clustering signal survives when omitting this field from the analysis.using the correlation functions measurements and uncertainties, we compute thez~3 lbg galaxy bias b_lbg to be 1.5&lt;b_lbg&lt;3 corresponding to an average halomass of 10^(9.7)&lt;m_lbg&lt;10^(11.6) m_odot and the z~3 dla galaxy bias b_dla to be1.3&lt;b_dla&lt;4 corresponding to an average halo mass of 10^(9)&lt;m_lbg&lt;10^(12)m_odot. lastly, two of the six qsos discovered in this survey were found to liewithin delta z = 0.0125 of two of the survey dlas. we estimate the probabilityof this occurring by chance is 1 in 940 and may indicate a possiblerelationship between the distribution of qsos and dlas at z~3.

astro-ph;0611079	on the absence of wind signatures in grb afterglow spectra: constraints  on the wolf-rayet winds of grb progenitors	we investigate available constraints on the circumstellar medium (csm) aroundlong-duration gamma-ray burst (grb) progenitors from afterglow spectra. wefirst establish a statistical sample of five grb afterglow spectra that havebeen collected and analyzed with no prior knowledge of the line-of-sightproperties. this sample is then adopted for a uniform search of wolf-rayet windsignatures, as represented by civ 1548, 1550 absorption doublets at dv=-1000 to-5000 km/s from the grbs (hereafter civ_{15}). we report the detection of asingle civ_{15} absorber at dv ~ -1500 km/s from grb 050730 and none in therest. our search yields an estimate of 20% for the incidence of civ_{15}absorbers with rest-frame absorption equivalent width ew(civ 1548)&gt;0.2 ang neargrb host galaxies, consistent with the incidence of intergalactic civ_{15} nearclassical damped lya absorbers toward quasar sightlines. including the twociv_{15} absorbers previously known toward grb 021004, we further demonstratethat the presence of h^0, c^+, and si^+ together with the absence of excitedc^+ or si^+ argue against a csm origin. the null result is consistent with theexpectation that the circumburst medium is fully ionized by the afterglowradiation field. we examine possible scenarios for the survival of the c^{3+}ions, including a clumpy wind model. we find that a clumpy wind is unable toeffectively shield the ionizing radiation and allow c^{3+} to survive at r&lt;10pc from the afterglow. we conclude that the lack of csm-originated civ_{15}absorbers is consistent with wolf-rayet winds terminating at &lt; 30 pc from theirprogenitor stars.

astro-ph;0703594	the sdss-dr5 survey for proximate damped lya systems	using the sloan digital sky survey, data release 5, we survey proximatedamped lya systems (pdlas): absorption line systems with hi column densityn(hi)&gt; 2x10^20 cm^{-2} at velocity separation dv &lt; 3000 km/s from theirbackground quasar. these absorbers are physically associated with theirbackground quasars, and their statistics allow us to study quasar environmentsout to z~5. however, the large ionizing flux emitted by a quasar can ionize theneutral gas in a nearby galaxy possibly giving rise to a ``proximity effect'',analogous to the similar effect observed in the lya forest. from a sample of111 pdlas, we measure the hi frequency distribution f(n), incidence, and gasmass density of the pdlas near luminous quasars over the redshift interval z=2.2 to 5. the incidence and mass density of pdlas at z~3 is approximately twicethat of intervening dlas, but at z&lt;2.5 and z&gt;3.5 the f(n) distribution isconsistent with the intervening population. we interpret the observedenhancement of pdlas around quasars in terms of quasar-galaxy clustering, andcompare the strength of the clustering signal to the expectation fromindependent measures of the respective clustering strengths of dlas andquasars, as well as a complementary analysis of the clustering of absorbersaround quasars in the transverse direction. we find that there are a factor of5-10 fewer pdlas around quasars than expected and interpret this result asevidence for the hypothesis that the ionizing flux from the quasarsphotoevaporates hi in nearby dla galaxies, thus reducing their cross-sectionfor dla absorption. this constitues the first detection of a ``proximityeffect'' for dlas.

astro-ph;0703665	probing the ism near star forming regions with grb afterglow  spectroscopy: gas, metals, and dust	we study the chemical abundances of the interstellar medium surrounding highz gamma-ray bursts (grbs) through analysis of the damped lya systems (dlas)identified in afterglow spectra. these grb-dlas are characterized by large hicolumn densities n(hi) and metallicities [m/h] spanning 1/100 to nearly solar,with median [m/h]&gt;-1. the majority of grb-dlas have [m/h] values exceeding thecosmic mean metallicity of atomic gas at z&gt;2, i.e. if anything, the grb-dlasare biased to larger metallicity. we also observe (i) large [zn/fe] values(&gt;+0.6) and sub-solar ti/fe ratios which imply substantial differentialdepletion, (ii) large a/fe ratios suggesting nucleosynthetic enrichment bymassive stars, and (iii) low c^0/c^+ ratios (&lt;10^{-4}). quantitatively, theobserved depletion levels and c^0/c^+ ratios of the gas are not characteristicof cold, dense hi clouds in the galactic ism. we argue that the grb-dlasrepresent the ism near the grb but not gas directly local to the grb (e.g. itsmolecular cloud or circumstellar material). we compare these observations withdlas intervening background quasars (qso-dlas). the grb-dlas exhibit largern(hi) values, higher a/fe and zn/fe ratios, and have higher metallicity thanthe qso-dlas. we argue that the differences primarily result fromgalactocentric radius-dependent differences in the ism: grb-dlas preferentiallyprobe denser, more depleted, higher metallicity gaslocated in the inner few kpcwhereas qso-dlas are more likely to intersect the less dense, less enriched,outer regions of the galaxy. finally, we investigate whether dust obscurationmay exclude grb-dla sightlines from qso-dla samples; we find that the majorityof grb-dlas would be recovered which implies little observational bias againstlarge n(hi) systems.

astro-ph;0703666	missing molecular hydrogen and the physical conditions of grb host  galaxies	we examine the abundance of molecular hydrogen (h2) in the spectra of gammaray burst afterglows (grbs). in nearby galaxies h2 traces the cold neutralmedium (cnm) and dense molecular star-forming interstellar gas. though h2 isdetected in at least half of all sightlines towards hot stars in the magellanicclouds and in ~25% of damped lya systems toward quasars, it is not detected inany of the five grb environments with a similar range of neutral hydrogencolumn and metallicity. we detect no vibrationally-excited h2 that would implythe grb itself has photodissociated its parent molecular cloud, so such modelsare ruled out unless the parent cloud was &lt;~4 pc in radius and was fullydissociated prior to the spectroscopic observations, or the star escaped itsparent cloud during its main-sequence lifetime. the low molecular fractions forthe grbs are mysterious in light their large column densities of neutral h andexpectations based on local analogs, i.e. 30 doradus in the lmc. thissurprising lack of h2 in grb-dlas indicates that the destruction processes thatsuppress molecule formation in the lmc and smc are more effective in the grbhosts, most probably a combination of low metallicity and an fuv radiationfield 10--100 times the galactic mean field. these inferred conditions placestrong constraints on the star forming regions in these early galaxies.

astro-ph;0703701	on the nature of velocity fields in high z galaxies	we analyze the gas kinematics of damped lya systems (dlas) hosting high zgamma-ray bursts (grbs) and those toward quasars (qso-dlas) focusing onthreestatistics: (1) dv, the velocity interval encompassing 90% of thetotaloptical depth, (2,3) wsi and wciv, the rest equivalent widths of thesiii1526 and civ1548 transitions. the dv distributions of the grb-dlas andqso-dlas are similar, each has median dv~80km/s and a significant tail toseveral hundred km/s. this suggests comparable galaxy masses for the parentpopulations of grb-dlas and qso-dlas and we infer the average dark matter halomass of grb galaxies is &lt;~10^{12} msol. the unique configuration of grb-dlasightlines and the presence (and absence) of fine-structure absorption togethergive special insight into the nature of high z, protogalactic velocity fields.the data support a scenario where the dv statistic reflects dynamics in theinterstellar medium (ism) and wsi traces motions outside the ism (e.g. halogas, galactic-scale winds). the wsi statistic and gas metallicity [m/h] aretightly correlated, especially for the qso-dlas: [m/h]=a + b log(wsi/1a) witha=-0.92+/-0.05 and b=-1.41+/-0.10. we argue that the wsi statistic primarilytracks dynamical motions in the halos of high z galaxies and interpret thiscorrelation as a mass-metallicity relation with very similar slope to the trendobserved in local, low-metallicity galaxies. finally, the grb-dlas exhibitsystematically larger wsi values (&gt;0.5a) than the qso-dlas (&lt;wsi&gt;~ 0.5a) whichmay suggest galactic-scale outflows contribute to the largest observed velocityfields.

astro-ph;9704169	on the kinematics of the damped lyman alpha protogalaxies	we present the first results of an ongoing program to investigate thekinematic characteristics of high redshift damped lya systems. because dampedlya systems are widely believed to be the progenitors of current massivegalaxies, an analysis of their kinematic history allows a direct test of galaxyformation scenarios.  we have collected a kinematically unbiased sample of 17 high s/n ratio, highresolution damped lya spectra taken with hires on the 10m w.m. keck telescope.our study focuses on the unsaturated, low-ion transitions of these systemswhich reveal their kinematic traits. the profiles exhibit a nearly uniformdistribution of velocity widths ranging from 20 - 200 km/s and a relativelyhigh degree of asymmetry. in an attempt to explain these characteristics, weintroduce several physical models, which have previously been attributed todamped lya systems, including rapidly rotating cold disks, slowly rotating hotdisks, massive isothermal halos, and a hydrodynamic spherical accretion model.  using standard monte carlo techniques, we run sightlines through these modelsystems to derive simulated low-ion profiles. comparing statistical measures ofthe simulated profiles with the observed profiles, we determine that therapidly rotating cold disk model is the only tested model consistent with thedata at high confidence levels. a relative likelihood test of the rapidlyrotating cold disk model indicates the disks must have large rotation speeds; v&gt; 180 km/s at the 99% c.l. in turn, we demonstrate that the cold dark mattermodel, as developed by kauffmann (1996), is inconsistent with the damped lyadata at very high c.l. this is because the cdm model does not predict a largeenough fraction of rapidly rotating disks at z approx 2.5.

astro-ph;9706290	damped lyman alpha systems at high redshift and models of protogalactic  disks	we employ observationally determined intrinsic velocity widths and columndensities of damped lyman-alpha systems at high redshift to investigate thedistribution of baryons in protogalaxies within the context of a standard colddark matter model. we proceed under the assumption that damped lyman alphasystems represent a population of cold, rotationally supported, protogalacticdisks and that the abundance of protogalactic halos is well approximated by acold dark matter model with critical density and vanishing cosmologicalconstant. using conditional cross sections to observe a damped system with agiven velocity width and column density, we compare observationally inferredvelocity width and column density distributions to the correspondingtheoretically determined distributions for a variety of disk parameters and cdmnormalizations. in general, we find that the observations can not be reproducedby the models for most disk parameters and cdm normalizations. whereas thecolumn density distribution favors small disks with large neutral gas fraction,the velocity width distribution favors large and thick disks with small neutralgas fraction. the possible resolutions of this problem in the context of thiscdm model may be: (1) an increased contribution of rapidly rotating diskswithin massive dark matter halos to damped lyman-alpha absorption or (2) theabandoning of simple disk models within this cdm model for damped lyman-alphasystems at high redshift. here the first possibility may be achieved bysupposing that damped lya system formation only occurs in halos with fairlylarge circular velocities and the second possibility may result from a largecontribution of mergers and double-disks to damped lya absorption at highredshift.

astro-ph;9712050	on the evolution of damped lyman alpha systems to galactic disks	the mean metallicity of the thick disk of the galaxy is 0.5 dex higher thanthat of the damped lyman alpha systems. this has been interpreted to argue thatstars in the former do not arise out of gas in the latter. using newmetallicity and h i column-density data we show the metal-rich damped systemsdo contain sufficient baryons at the thick-disk metallicity to account for thestellar masses of thick disks. comparing our kinematic data with themetallicities we show that damped lyman alpha systems exhibiting the largestprofile velocity widths span a narrow range of high metallicities, whilesystems with small velocity widths span a wider range of metallicities. this isnaturally explained by passage of the damped lyman alpha sightlines throughrapidly rotating disks with negative radial gradients in metallicity. thesystematically lower n(h i) of systems with high velocity widths indicates (a)the gaseous disks have centrally located holes, and (b) an apparentinconsistency with the protogalactic clump model for damped lyman alphasystems. the higher metallicity of systems with low n(h i) further implies thatstars rather than gas dominate the baryonic content of the most metal-richdamped systems.

astro-ph;9805293	protogalactic disk models of damped lya kinematics	we present new observational results on the kinematics of the damped lyasystems. our full sample is now comprised of 31 low-ion profiles and exhibitssimilar characteristics to the sample from paper i. the primary exception isthat the new distribution of velocity widths includes values out to a maximumof nearly 300 km/s, approx 100 km/s greater than the previous maximum. thesehigh velocity width systems will significantly leverage models introduced toexplain the damped lya systems. comparing the characteristics from low-redshiftand high-redshift sub-samples, we find no evidence for significant evolution inthe kinematic properties of protogalaxies from z = 2.0 - 3.3.  the new observations give greater statistical significance to the mainconclusions of our first paper. in particular, those models inconsistent withthe damped lya observations in paper i are ruled out at even higher levels ofconfidence. at the same time, the observations are consistent with a populationof rapidly rotating, thick disks (the trd model) at high redshift.  buoyed by the success of the trd model, we investigate it more closely byconsidering more realistic disk properties. our goal is to demonstrate thestatistical power of the damped lya observations by investigating therobustness of the trd model. in particular, we study the effects of warping,realistic rotation curves, and photoionization on the kinematics of disks inthe trd model. the principal results are: (1) disk warping has only minimaleffect on the kinematic results, primarily influencing the effective diskthickness, (2) the trd model is robust to more realistic rotation curves; (3)the effects of photoionization require thicker disks to give consistentvelocity width distributions.

astro-ph;9810381	chemical abundances of the damped lya systems at z&gt;1.5	we present chemical abundance measurements for 19 damped lya systems observedwith hires on the 10m w.m. keck telescope. our principal goal is to investigatethe abundance patterns of the damped systems and thereby determine theunderlying physical processes which dominate their chemical evolution. we placeparticular emphasis on gauging the relative importance of two complementaryeffects often invoked to explain the damped lya abundances: (1) nucleosyntheticenrichment from type ii supernovae and (2) an ism-like dust depletion pattern.  similar to the principal results of lu et al. (1996), our observations lendsupport both for dust depletion and type ii sn enrichment. specifically, theobserved overabundance of zn/fe and underabundance of ni/fe relative to solarabundances suggest significant dust depletion within the damped lya systems.meanwhile, the relative abundances of al, si, and cr vs. fe are consistent withboth dust depletion and type ii supernova enrichment. our measurements of ti/feand the mn/fe measurements from lu et al. (1996), however, cannot be explainedby dust depletion and indicate an underlying type ii sn pattern. finally, theobserved values of [s/fe] are inconsistent with the combined effects of dustdepletion and the nucleosynthetic yields expected for type ii supernovae. thislast result emphasizes the need for another physical process to explain thedamped lya abundance patterns.  we also examine the metallicity of the damped lya systems both with respectto zn/h and fe/h. our results confirm previous surveys by pettini andcollaborators, i.e., [&lt;zn/h&gt;] = -1.15 +/- 0.15 dex.

astro-ph;9812296	investigating the metal line systems at z=1.9 toward j2233-606 in the  hdf-s	the combination of stis and optical spectroscopy with stis imaging of thefield surrounding j2233-606 afford a unique opportunity to study the physicalnature of the quasar absorption line systems. we present an analysis of theionization state, chemical abundances, and kinematic characteristics of twometal-line systems at z=1.92 and z=1.94 toward j2233-606. we focus on these twosystems because (i) the observations provide full coverage of the lyman series,hence an accurate determination of their hi column densities and (ii) themetal-line transitions allow a measurement of their ionization state.  line-profile fits of the lyman series for the two systems indicate log n(hi)= 17.15 \pm 0.02 cm^-2 evenly distributed between two components for the z=1.92system and log n(hi) = 16.33 \pm 0.04 cm^-2 for the z=1.94 system. by comparingobserved ionic ratios of c and si against calculations performed with thecloudy software package, we find the ionization state is high and wellconstrained in both systems. applying ionization corrections to the measuredionic column densities, we determine that the systems exhibit significantlydifferent metallicities: ~ 1/50 solar and &lt; 1/200 solar for the two componentsof z=1.92 and ~40% solar at z=1.94. the properties of the z=1.92 system areconsistent with a low metallicity galaxy (e.g. a dwarf galaxy) as well asabsorption by large scale structure of the igm. on the other hand, the highmetallicity of the z=1.94 system suggests significant star formation and istherefore most likely associated with a galactic system. furthermore, wepredict it is the most likely to be observed with the stis imaging andfollow-up observations. if a galaxy is identified, our results provide directmeasurements on the properties of the ism for a z~2 galaxy.

astro-ph;9812369	making damped lyman alpha systems in semi-analytic models	the velocity profiles of weak metal absorption lines can be used toobservationally probe the kinematic state of gas in damped lyman-alpha systems.prochaska and wolfe have argued that the flat distribution of velocity widthscombined with the asymmetric line profiles indicate that the dlas are diskswith large rotation velocities. an alternative explanation has been proposed byhaehnelt, steinmetz, and rauch, in which the observed large velocity widths andasymmetric profiles can be produced by lines of sight passing through two ormore clumps each having relatively small internal velocity dispersions. weinvestigate the plausibility of this scenario in the context of semi-analyticmodels based on hierarchical merging trees and including simple treatments ofgas dynamics, star formation, supernova feedback, and chemical evolution. wefind that all the observed properties of the metal-line systems including thedistribution of velocities and the asymmetric profiles, can be reproduced bylines of sight passing through sub-clumps that are bound within largervirialized dark matter halos. in order to produce enough multiple hits, we findthat the cold gas must be considerably more extended than the optical radius ofthe proto-galaxies, perhaps even beyond the tidal radius of the sub-halo. thiscould occur due to tidal stripping or supernova-driven outflows.

0810.5131	dust depletion, chemical uniformity and environment of caii h&amp;k quasar  absorbers	caii 3934,3969 absorbers, which are likely to be a subset of damped lymanalpha systems, are the most dusty quasar absorbers known, with an order ofmagnitude more extinction in e(b-v) than other absorption systems. there isalso evidence that caii absorbers trace galaxies with more ongoingstar-formation than the average quasar absorber. despite this, relativelylittle is known in detail about these unusual absorption systems. here wepresent the first high resolution spectroscopic study of 19 caii quasarabsorbers, in the range 0.6&lt;= z_abs&lt;=1.2, with w3934&gt;=0.2a. their generaldepletion patterns are similar to measurements in the warm halo phase of themilky way and magellanic clouds ism. dust depletions and alpha-enrichmentsprofiles of sub-samples of 7 and 3 absorbers, respectively, are measured usinga combination of voigt profile fitting and apparent optical depth techniques.deviations in [cr/zn]~0.3+-0.1dex and in [si/fe]&gt;~0.8+-0.1dex are detectedacross the profile of one absorber, which we attribute to differential dustdepletion. the remaining absorbers have &lt;0.3dex (3sigma limit) variation in[cr/zn], much like the general dla population, though the dustiest caiiabsorbers remain relatively unprobed in our sample. a limit on electrondensities in caii absorbers, n_e&lt;0.1cm^-3, is derived using the ratio ofneutral and singly ionised species, assuming a mw-like radiation field. theseelectron densities may imply hydrogen densities sufficient for the presence ofmolecular hydrogen in the absorbers. the caii absorber sample comprises a widerange of velocity widths, v_90=50-470km/s, and velocity structures, thus arange of physical models for their origin, from simple discs to galacticoutflows and mergers, would be required to explain the observations.

0811.2408	an 84 microgauss magnetic field in a galaxy at redshift z=0.692	the magnetic field pervading our galaxy is a crucial constituent of theinterstellar medium: it mediates the dynamics of interstellar clouds, theenergy density of cosmic rays, and the formation of stars. the field associatedwith ionized interstellar gas has been determined through observations ofpulsars in our galaxy. radio-frequency measurements of pulse dispersion and therotation of the plane of linear polarization, i.e., faraday rotation, yield anaverage value b ~ 3 microgauss. the possible detection of faraday rotation oflinearly polarized photons emitted by high-redshift quasars suggests similarmagnetic fields are present in foreground galaxies with redshifts z &gt; 1. asfaraday rotation alone, however, determines neither the magnitude nor theredshift of the magnetic field, the strength of galactic magnetic fields atredshifts z &gt; 0 remains uncertain. here we report a measurement of a magneticfield of b ~ 84 microgauss in a galaxy at z =0.692, using the samezeeman-splitting technique that revealed an average value of b = 6 microgaussin the neutral interstellar gas of our galaxy. this is unexpected, as theleading theory of magnetic field generation, the mean-field dynamo model,predicts large-scale magnetic fields to be weaker in the past rather thanstronger.

0706.1285	characterizing the low-redshift intergalactic medium towards pks1302-102	we present a detailed analysis of the intergalactic metal-line absorptionsystems in the archival hst/stis and fuse ultraviolet spectra of thelow-redshift quasar pks1302-102 (z_qso = 0.2784). we supplement the archivedata with cloudy ionization models and a survey of galaxies in the quasarfield. there are 15 strong lya absorbers with column densities logn_hi &gt; 14. ofthese, six are associated with at least ciii 977 absorption (logn(c^++) &gt; 13);this implies a redshift density dn_ciii/dz = 36+13/-9 (68% confidence limits)for the five detections with rest equivalent width w_r &gt; 50 ma. two systemsshow ovi 1031,1037 absorption in addition to ciii (logn(o^+5) &gt; 14). one is apartial lyman limit system (logn_hi = 17) with associated ciii, ovi, and siiii1206 absorption. there are three tentative ovi systems that do not have ciiidetected. for one ovi doublet with both lines detected at 3 sigma with w_r &gt; 50ma, dn_ovi/dz = 7+9/-4. we also search for ovi doublets without lya absorptionbut identify none. from cloudy modeling, these metal-line systems havemetallicities spanning the range -4 &lt; [m/h] &lt; -0.3. the two ovi systems withassociated ciii absorption cannot be single-phase, collisionally-ionized mediabased on the relative abundances of the metals and kinematic arguments. fromthe galaxy survey, we discover that the absorption systems are in a diverse setof galactic environments. each metal-line system has at least one galaxy within500 km/s and 600 h^-1 kpc with l &gt; 0.1 l_*.
