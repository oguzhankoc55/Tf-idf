0912.0773	the uffo (ultra-fast flash observatory) pathfinder	hundreds of gamma-ray burst (grb) uv-optical light curves have been measuredsince the discovery of optical afterglows, however, even after nearly 5 yearsof operation of the swift observatory, only a handful of measurements have beenmade soon (within a minute) after the gamma ray signal. this lack of earlyobservations fails to address burst physics at the short time scales associatedwith burst events and progenitors. because of this lack of sub-minute data, thecharacteristics of the uv-optical light curve of short-hard type grb andrapid-rising grb, which may account for ~30% of all grb, remain practicallyunknown. we have developed methods for reaching the sub-minute and thesub-second timescales in a small spacecraft observatory appropriate for launchon a microsatellite. rather than slewing the entire spacecraft to aim theuv-optical instrument at the grb position, we use rapidly moving mirrors toredirect our optical beam. our collaboration has produced a unique mems(microelectromechanical systems) micromirror array which can point and settleon target in only 1 ms. this technology is proven, flying successfully as themtel (mems telescope for extreme lightning) on the tatiana-2 spacecraft inseptember 2009 and as the kamtel on the international space station in april2008. the sub-minute measurements of the uv-optical emission of dozens of grbeach year will result in a more rigorous test of current internal shock models,probe the extremes of bulk lorentz factors, and provide the first early anddetailed measurements of fast-rise and short type grb uv-optical light curves.

1001.3321	planck pre-launch status: design and description of the low frequency  instrument	in this paper we present the low frequency instrument (lfi), designed anddeveloped as part of the planck space mission, the esa program dedicated toprecision imaging of the cosmic microwave background (cmb). planck-lfi willobserve the full sky in intensity and polarisation in three frequency bandscentred at 30, 44 and 70 ghz, while higher frequencies (100-850 ghz) will becovered by the hfi instrument. the lfi is an array of microwave radiometersbased on state-of-the-art indium phosphide cryogenic hemt amplifiersimplemented in a differential system using blackbody loads as referencesignals. the front-end is cooled to 20k for optimal sensitivity and thereference loads are cooled to 4k to minimise low frequency noise. we provide anoverview of the lfi, discuss the leading scientific requirements and describethe design solutions adopted for the various hardware subsystems. the maindrivers of the radiometric, optical and thermal design are discussed, includingthe stringent requirements on sensitivity, stability, and rejection ofsystematic effects. further details on the key instrument units and the resultsof ground calibration are provided in a set of companion papers.

1004.1046	probing cosmic strings with satellite cmb measurements	we study the problem of searching for cosmic string signal patterns in thepresent high resolution and high sensitivity observations of the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb). this article discusses a technique capable ofrecognizing kaiser-stebbins effect signatures in total intensity anisotropymaps, and shows that the biggest factor that produces confusion is representedby the acoustic oscillation features of the scale comparable to the size ofhorizon at recombination. simulations show that the distribution of nullsignals for pure gaussian maps converges to a $\chi^2$ distribution, withdetectability threshold corresponding to a string induced step signal with anamplitude of about 100 $\muk$ which corresponds to a limit of roughly $g\mu &lt;1.5\times 10^{-6}$. we study the statistics of spurious detections caused byextra-galactic and galactic foregrounds. for diffuse galactic foregrounds,which represents the dominant source of contamination, we derive sky masksoutlining the available region of the sky where the galactic confusion issub-dominant, specializing our analysis to the case represented by thefrequency coverage and nominal sensitivity and resolution of the planckexperiment.

1101.2023	planck early results. ii. the thermal performance of planck	the performance of the planck instruments in space is enabled by their lowoperating temperatures, 20k for lfi and 0.1k for hfi, achieved through acombination of passive radiative cooling and three active mechanical coolers.the scientific requirement for very broad frequency coverage led to twodetector technologies with widely different temperature and cooling needs.active coolers could satisfy these needs; a helium cryostat, as used byprevious cryogenic space missions (iras, cobe, iso, spitzer, akari), could not.radiative cooling is provided by three v-groove radiators and a large telescopebaffle. the active coolers are a hydrogen sorption cooler (&lt;20k), a 4hejoule-thomson cooler (4.7k), and a 3he-4he dilution cooler (1.4k and 0.1k). theflight system was at ambient temperature at launch and cooled in space tooperating conditions. the hfi bolometer plate reached 93mk on 3 july 2009, 50days after launch. the solar panel always faces the sun, shadowing the rest ofplanck, andoperates at a mean temperature of 384k. at the other end of thespacecraft, the telescope baffle operates at 42.3k and the telescope primarymirror operates at 35.9k. the temperatures of key parts of the instruments arestabilized by both active and passive methods. temperature fluctuations aredriven by changes in the distance from the sun, sorption cooler cycling andfluctuations in gas-liquid flow, and fluctuations in cosmic ray flux on thedilution and bolometer plates. these fluctuations do not compromise the sciencedata.

1101.2024	planck early results viii: the all-sky early sunyaev-zeldovich cluster  sample	we present the first all-sky sample of galaxy clusters detected blindly bythe planck satellite through the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) effect from its sixhighest frequencies. this early sz (esz) sample is comprised of 189 candidates,which have a high signal-to-noise ratio ranging from 6 to 29. its highreliability (purity above 95%) is further ensured by an extensive validationprocess based on planck internal quality assessments and by externalcross-identification and follow-up observations. planck provides the firstmeasured sz signal for about 80% of the 169 previously-known esz clusters.planck furthermore releases 30 new cluster candidates, amongst which 20 meetthe esz signal-to-noise selection criterion. at the submission date, twelve ofthe 20 esz candidates were confirmed as new clusters, with eleven confirmedusing xmm-newton snapshot observations, most of them with disturbedmorphologies and low luminosities. the esz clusters are mostly at moderateredshifts (86% with z below 0.3) and span more than a decade in mass, up to therarest and most massive clusters with masses above 10^15 msol.

1101.2025	planck early results. ix. xmm-newton follow-up for validation of planck  cluster candidates	we present the xmm-newton follow-up for confirmation of planck clustercandidates. twenty-five candidates have been observed to date using snapshot(~10 ksec) exposures, ten as part of a pilot programme to sample a low range ofsignal-to-noise ratios (4&lt;s/n&lt;6), and a further 15 in a programme to observe asample of s/n&gt;5 candidates. the sensitivity and spatial resolution ofxmm-newton allows unambiguous discrimination between clusters and falsecandidates. the 4 false candidates have s/n &lt;= 4.1. a total of 21 candidatesare confirmed as extended x-ray sources. seventeen are single clusters, themajority of which are found to have highly irregular and disturbed morphologies(about ~70%). the remaining four sources are multiple systems, including theunexpected discovery of a supercluster at z=0.45. for 20 sources we are able toderive a redshift estimate from the x-ray fe k line (albeit of variablequality). the new clusters span the redshift range 0.09 &lt;= z &lt;= 0.54, with amedian redshift of z~0.37. a first determination is made of their x-rayproperties including the characteristic size, which is used to improve theestimate of the sz compton parameter, y_sz. the follow-up validation programmehas helped to optimise the planck candidate selection process. it has alsoprovided a preview of the x-ray properties of these newly-discovered clusters,allowing comparison with their sz properties, and to the x-ray and szproperties of known clusters observed in the planck survey. our results suggestthat planck may have started to reveal a non-negligible population of massivedynamically perturbed objects that is under-represented in x-ray surveys.however, despite their particular properties, these new clusters appear tofollow the y_sz-y_x relation established for x-ray selected objects, where y_xis the product of the gas mass and temperature.

1101.2027	planck early results: cluster sunyaev-zeldovich optical scaling  relations	we present the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal-to-richness scaling relation(y500-n200) for the maxbcg cluster catalogue. employing a multi-frequencymatched filter on the planck sky maps, we measure the sz signal for eachcluster by adapting the filter according to weak-lensing calibratedmass-richness relations (n200-m500). we bin our individual measurements anddetect the sz signal down to the lowest richness systems (n200=10) with highsignificance, achieving a detection of the sz signal in systems with mass aslow as m500~5e13 msolar. the observed y500-n200 relation is well modeled by apower law over the full richness range. it has a lower normalisation at givenn200 than predicted based on x-ray models and published mass-richnessrelations. an x-ray subsample, however, does conform to the predicted scaling,and model predictions do reproduce the relation between our measuredbin-average sz signal and measured bin-average x-ray luminosities. at fixedrichness, we find an intrinsic dispersion in the y500-n200 relation of 60%rising to of order 100% at low richness. thanks to its all-sky coverage, planckprovides observations for more than 13,000 maxbcg clusters and an unprecedentedsz/optical data set, extending the list of known cluster scaling laws toinclude sz-optical properties. the data set offers essential clues for modelsof galaxy formation. moreover, the lower normalisation of the sz-mass relationimplied by the observed sz-richness scaling has important consequences forcluster physics and cosmological studies with sz clusters.

1101.2028	planck early results xviii: the power spectrum of cosmic infrared  background anisotropies	using planck maps of six regions of low galactic dust emission with a totalarea of about 140 square degrees, we determine the angular power spectra ofcosmic infrared background (cib) anisotropies from multipole l = 200 to l =2000 at 217, 353, 545 and 857 ghz. we use 21-cm observations of hi as a tracerof thermal dust emission to reduce the already low level of galactic dustemission and use the 143 ghz planck maps in these fields to clean out cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies. both of these cleaning processes arenecessary to avoid significant contamination of the cib signal. we measurecorrelated cib structure across frequencies. as expected, the correlationdecreases with increasing frequency separation, because the contribution ofhigh-redshift galaxies to cib anisotropies increases with wavelengths. we findno significant difference between the frequency spectrum of the cibanisotropies and the cib mean, with delta i/i=15% from 217 to 857 ghz. in termsof clustering properties, the planck data alone rule out the linear scale- andredshift-independent bias model. non-linear corrections are significant.consequently, we develop an alternative model that couples a dusty galaxy,parametric evolution model with a simple halo-model approach. it provides anexcellent fit to the measured anisotropy angular power spectra and suggeststhat a different halo occupation distribution is required at each frequency,which is consistent with our expectation that each frequency is dominated bycontributions from different redshifts. in our best-fit model, half of theanisotropy power at l=2000 comes from redshifts z&lt;0.8 at 857 ghz and z&lt;1.5 at545 ghz, while about 90% come from redshifts z&gt;2 at 353 and 217 ghz,respectively.

1101.2031	planck early results. xx. new light on anomalous microwave emission from  spinning dust grains	anomalous microwave emission (ame) has been observed by numerous experimentsin the frequency range ~10-60 ghz. using planck maps and multi-frequencyancillary data, we have constructed spectra for two known ame regions: theperseus and rho ophiuchi molecular clouds. the spectra are well fitted by acombination of free-free radiation, cosmic microwave background, thermal dust,and electric dipole radiation from small spinning dust grains. the spinningdust spectra are the most precisely measured to date, and show the highfrequency side clearly for the first time. the spectra have a peak in the range20-40 ghz and are detected at high significances of 17.1 sigma for perseus and8.4 sigma for rho ophiuchi. in perseus, spinning dust in the dense moleculargas can account for most of the ame; the low density atomic gas appears to playa minor role. in rho ophiuchi, the ~30 ghz peak is dominated by dense moleculargas, but there is an indication of an extended tail at frequencies 50-100 ghz,which can be accounted for by irradiated low density atomic gas. the dustparameters are consistent with those derived from other measurements. we havealso searched the planck map at 28.5 ghz for candidate ame regions, bysubtracting a simple model of the synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust. wepresent spectra for two of the candidates; s140 and s235 are bright hii regionsthat show evidence for ame, and are well fitted by spinning dust models.

1101.2032	planck early results. xxi. properties of the interstellar medium in the  galactic plane	(abridged) planck has observed the entire sky from 30 ghz to 857ghz. theobserved foreground emission contains contributions from different phases ofthe interstellar medium (ism). we have separated the observed galactic emissioninto the different gaseous components (atomic, molecular and ionised) in eachof a number of galactocentric rings. templates are created for variousgalactocentric radii using velocity information from atomic (neutral hydrogen)and molecular (12co) observations. the ionised template is assumed to be tracedby free-free emission as observed by wmap, while 408 mhz emission is used totrace the synchrotron component. gas emission not traced by the abovetemplates, namely "ark gas", as evidenced using planck data, is included as anadditional template, the first time such a component has been used in this way.these templates are then correlated with each of the planck frequency bands, aswell as other ancillary data. the emission per column density of the gastemplates allows us to create distinct spectral energy distributions (seds) pergalactocentric ring and in each of the gaseous tracers from 1.4 ghz to 25 thz(12\mu m). apart from the thermal dust and free-free emission, we have probedthe galaxy for anomalous (e.g., spinning) dust as well as synchrotron emission.we show that anomalous dust emission is present in the atomic, molecular anddark gas phases throughout the galactic disk. the derived dust propetiesassociated with the dark gas phase are derived but do not allow us to revealthe nature of this phase. for all environments, the anomalous emission isconsistent with rotation from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) and,according to our simple model, accounts for $(25\pm5)%$ (statistical) of thetotal emission at 30 ghz.

1101.2035	planck early results: the galactic cold core population revealed by the  first all-sky survey	we present the statistical properties of the first version of the cold corecatalogue of planck objects (c3po), in terms of their spatial distribution,temperature, distance, mass, and morphology. we also describe the statistics ofthe early cold core catalogue (ecc, delivered with the early release compactsource catalogue, ercsc) that is the subset of the 915 most reliable detectionsof the complete catalogue. we have used the cococodet algorithm to extract10783 cold sources. temperature and dust emission spectral index {\beta} valuesare derived using the fluxes in the iras 100 \mum band and the three highestfrequency planck bands. temperature spans from 7k to 17k, and peaks around 13k.data are not consistent with a constant value of {\beta} over the alltemperature range. {\beta} ranges from 1.4 to 2.8 with a mean value around 2.1,and several possible scenarios are possible, including {\beta}(t) and theeffect of multiple t components folded into the measurements. for one third ofthe objects the distances are obtained. most of the detections are within 2 kpcin the solar neighbourhood, but a few are at distances greater than 4 kpc. thecores are distributed from the deep galactic plane, despite the confusion, tohigh latitudes (&gt;30$^{\circle}$). the associated mass estimates range from 1 to$10^5$ solar masses. using their physical properties these cold sources areshown to be cold clumps, defined as the intermediate cold sub-structuresbetween clouds and cores. these cold clumps are not isolated but mostlyorganized in filaments associated with molecular clouds. the cold corecatalogue of planck objects (c3po) is the first unbiased all-sky catalogue ofcold objects. it gives an unprecedented statistical view to the properties ofthese potential pre-stellar clumps and offers a unique possibility for theirclassification in terms of their intrinsic properties and environment.

1101.2036	planck early results xxiv: dust in the diffuse interstellar medium and  the galactic halo	this paper presents the first results of comparison of planck along with irasdata with green bank telescope 21-cm observations in 14 fields covering morethan 800 square degrees at high galactic latitude. galactic dust emission forfields with average hi column density lower than 2 x 10^20 cm^-2 is wellcorrelated with 21-cm emission. the residual emission in these fields, once thehi-correlated emission is removed, is consistent with the expected statisticalproperties of the cosmic infrared background fluctuations. fields with largercolumn densities show significant excess dust emission compared to the hicolumn density. regions of excess lie in organized structures that suggest thepresence of hydrogen in molecular form, though they are not always correlatedwith co emission. dust emission from intermediate-velocity clouds is detectedwith high significance. its spectral properties are consistent with, comparedto the local ism values, significantly hotter dust (t~20 k), lowersub-millimeter dust opacity, and a relative abundance of very small grains tolarge grains about four times higher. these results are compatible withexpectations for clouds that are part of the galactic fountain in which thereis dust shattering and fragmentation. correlated dust emission in hvcs is notdetected; the average of the 99.9% confidence upper limits to the emissivity is0.15 times the local ism value at 857 and 3000 ghz, in accordance with gasphase evidence for lower metallicity and depletion in these clouds. unexpectedanti-correlated variations of the dust temperature and emission cross-sectionper h atom are identified in the local ism and ivcs, a trend that continuesinto molecular environments. this suggests that dust growth throughaggregation, seen in molecular clouds, is active much earlier in the cloudcondensation and star formation processes.

1101.2037	planck early results: thermal dust in nearby molecular clouds	planck allows unbiased mapping of galactic sub-millimetre and millimetreemission from the most diffuse regions to the densest parts of molecularclouds. we present an early analysis of the taurus molecular complex, online-of-sight-averaged data and without component separation. the emissionspectrum measured by planck and iras can be fitted pixel by pixel using asingle modified blackbody. some systematic residuals are detected at 353 ghzand 143 ghz, with amplitudes around -7 % and +13 %, respectively, indicatingthat the measured spectra are likely more complex than a simple modifiedblackbody. significant positive residuals are also detected in the molecularregions and in the 217 ghz and 100 ghz bands, mainly caused by to thecontribution of the j=2-1 and j=1-0 12co and 13co emission lines. we derivemaps of the dust temperature t, the dust spectral emissivity index beta, andthe dust optical depth at 250 microns tau. the temperature map illustrates thecooling of the dust particles in thermal equilibrium with the incidentradiation field, from 16-17 k in the diffuse regions to 13-14 k in the denseparts. the distribution of spectral indices is centred at 1.78, with a standarddeviation of 0.08 and a systematic error of 0.07. we detect a significantt-beta anti-correlation. the dust optical depth map reveals the spatialdistribution of the column density of the molecular complex from the densestmolecular regions to the faint diffuse regions. we use near-infrared extinctionand hi data at 21-cm to perform a quantitative analysis of the spatialvariations of the measured dust optical depth at 250 microns per hydrogen atomtau/nh. we report an increase of tau/nh by a factor of about 2 between theatomic phase and the molecular phase, which has a strong impact on theequilibrium temperature of the dust particles.

1101.2044	planck early results: statistical properties of extragalactic radio  sources in the planck early release compact source catalogue	the data reported in planck's early release compact source catalogue (ercsc)are exploited to measure the number counts (dn/ds) of extragalactic radiosources at 30, 44, 70, 100, 143 and 217 ghz. due to the full-sky nature of thecatalogue, this measurement extends to the rarest and brightest sources in thesky. at lower frequencies (30, 44, and 70 ghz) our counts are in very goodagreement with estimates based on wmap data, being somewhat deeper at 30 and 70ghz, and somewhat shallower at 44 ghz. planck's source counts at 143 and 217ghz join smoothly with the fainter ones provided by the spt and act surveysover small fractions of the sky. an analysis of source spectra, exploitingplanck's uniquely broad spectral coverage, finds clear evidence of a steepeningof the mean spectral index above about 70 ghz. this implies that, at thesefrequencies, the contamination of the cmb power spectrum by radio sources belowthe detection limit is significantly lower than previously estimated.

1101.2045	planck early results: the planck view of nearby galaxies	the all-sky coverage of the planck early release compact source catalogue(ercsc) provides an unsurpassed survey of galaxies at submillimetre (submm)wavelengths, representing a major improvement in the numbers of galaxiesdetected, as well as the range of far-ir/submm wavelengths over which they havebeen observed. we here present the first results on the properties of nearbygalaxies using these data. we match the ercsc catalogue to iras-detectedgalaxies in the imperial iras faint source redshift catalogue (iifscz), so thatwe can measure the spectral energy distributions (seds) of these objects from60 to 850 microns. this produces a list of 1717 galaxies with reliableassociations between planck and iras, from which we select a subset of 468 forsed studies, namely those with strong detections in the three highest frequencyplanck bands and no evidence of cirrus contamination. the seds are fitted usingparametric dust models to determine the range of dust temperatures andemissivities. we find evidence for colder dust than has previously been foundin external galaxies, with t&lt;20k. such cold temperatures are found using boththe standard single temperature dust model with variable emissivity beta, or atwo dust temperature model with beta fixed at 2. we also compare our results tostudies of distant submm galaxies (smgs) which have been claimed to containcooler dust than their local counterparts. we find that including our sample of468 galaxies significantly reduces the distinction between the two populations.fits to seds of selected objects using more sophisticated templates derivedfrom radiative transfer models confirm the presence of the colder dust foundthrough parameteric fitting. we thus conclude that cold (t&lt;20k) dust is asignificant and largely unexplored component of many nearby galaxies.

1101.2046	planck early results: origin of the submm excess dust emission in the  magellanic clouds	the integrated spectral energy distributions of the large and smallmagellanic cloud appear significantly flatter than expected from dust modelsbased on their fir and radio emission. the origin of this millimetre excess isstill unexplained, and is here investigated using the planck data. thebackground cmb contribution is subtracted using an ilc method performed locallyaround the galaxies. the foreground emission from the milky way is subtracted.after subtraction, the emission of both galaxies correlates closely with thegas emission of the lmc and smc. the millimetre excess in the lmc can beexplained by cmb fluctuations, but a significant excess is still present in thesmc sed. the planck and iris data at 100 micron are combined to produce thermaldust temperature and optical depth maps of the two galaxies. the lmctemperature map shows the presence of a warm inner arm already found with thespitzer data, but also shows the existence of a previously unidentified coldouter arm. several cold regions are found along this arm, some of which areassociated with known molecular clouds. the average emissivity spectral indexis found to be consistent with beta=1.5 and beta=1.2 below 500 microns for thelmc and smc respectively, significantly flatter than the values observed in themilky way. furthermore, there is evidence in the smc for a further flatteningof the sed in the sub-mm. the spatial distribution of the millimetre dustexcess in the smc follows the gas and thermal dust distribution. differentmodels are explored in order to fit the dust emission in the smc. it isconcluded that the millimetre excess is unlikely to be caused by very cold dustemission and that it could be due to a combination of spinning dust. emissionand thermal dust emission by more amorphous dust grains than those present inour galaxy.

1106.1376	planck early results xxvi: detection with planck and confirmation by  xmm-newton of plck g266.6-27.3, an exceptionally x-ray luminous and massive  galaxy cluster at z~1	we present first results on plck g266.6-27.3, a galaxy cluster candidatedetected at a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 in the planck all sky survey. anxmm-newton validation observation has allowed us to confirm that the candidateis a bona fide galaxy cluster. with these x-ray data we measure an accurateredshift, z = 0.94 +/- 0.02, and estimate the cluster mass to be m_500 = (7.8+/- 0.8)e+14 solar masses. plck g266.6-27.3 is an exceptional system: itsluminosity of l_x(0.5-2.0 kev)=(1.4 +/- 0.05)e+45 erg/s, equals that of the twomost luminous known clusters in the z &gt; 0.5 universe, and it is one of the mostmassive clusters at z~1. moreover, unlike the majority of high-redshiftclusters, plck g266.6-27.3 appears to be highly relaxed. this observationconfirms planck's capability of detecting high-redshift, high-mass clusters,and opens the way to the systematic study of population evolution in theexponential tail of the mass function.

1106.3804	data acquisition system for the uffo pathfinder	the ultra-fast flash observatory (uffo) pathfinder is a payload on therussian lomonosov satellite, scheduled to be launched in november 2011. theobservatory is designed to detect early uv/optical photons from gamma-raybursts (grbs). there are two telescopes and one main data acquisition system:the uffo burst alert &amp; trigger telescope (ubat), the slewing mirror telescope(smt), and the uffo data acquisition (udaq) system. the udaq controls andmanages the operation and communication of each telescope, and is also incharge of the interface with the satellite. it will write the data taken byeach telescope to the nor flash memory and sends them to the satellite via thebus-interface system (bi). it also receives data from the satellite includingthe coordinates and time of an external trigger from another payload, anddistributes them to two telescopes. these functions are implemented in fieldprogrammable gates arrays (fpga) for low power consumption and fast processingwithout a microprocessor. the udaq architecture, control of the system, anddata flow will be presented.

1106.3929	the uffo (ultra fast flash observatory) pathfinder: science and mission	hundreds of gamma-ray burst (grb) optical light curves have been measuredsince the discovery of optical afterglows. however, even after nearly 7 yearsof operation of the swift observatory, only a handful of measurements have beenmade soon (within a minute) after the gamma ray signal. this lack of earlyobservations fails to address burst physics at short time scales associatedwith prompt emissions and progenitors. because of this lack of sub-minute data,the characteristics of the rise phase of optical light curve of short-hard typegrb and rapid-rising grb, which may account for ~30% of all grb, remainpractically unknown. we have developed methods for reaching sub-minute andsub-second timescales in a small spacecraft observatory. rather than slewingthe entire spacecraft to aim the optical instrument at the grb position, we userapidly moving mirror to redirect our optical beam. as a first step, we employmotorized slewing mirror telescope (smt), which can point to the event within1s, in the uffo pathfinder grb telescope onboard the lomonosov satellite to belaunched in nov. 2011. uffo's sub-minute measurements of the optical emissionof dozens of grb each year will result in a more rigorous test of currentinternal shock models, probe the extremes of bulk lorentz factors, provide thefirst early and detailed measurements of fast-rise grb optical light curves,and help verify the prospect of grb as a new standard candle. we will describethe science and the mission of the current uffo pathfinder project, and ourplan of a full-scale uffo-100 as the next step.

1112.5595	planck intermediate results. i. further validation of new planck  clusters with xmm-newton	we present further results from the ongoing xmm-newton validation follow-upof planck cluster candidates, detailing x-ray observations of eleven candidatesdetected at a signal-to-noise ratio of 4.5&lt;s/n&lt;5.3 in the same 10-month surveymaps used in the construction of the early sz sample. the sample was selectedin order to test internal sz quality flags, and the pertinence of these flagsis discussed in light of the validation results. ten of the candidates arefound to be bona fide clusters lying below the rass flux limit. redshiftestimates are available for all confirmed systems via x-ray fe-linespectroscopy. they lie in the redshift range 0.19&lt;z&lt;0.94, demonstratingplanck's capability to detect clusters up to high z. the x-ray properties ofthe new clusters appear to be similar to previous new detections by planck atlower z and higher sz flux: the majority are x-ray underluminous for theirmass, estimated using y_x as mass proxy, and many have a disturbed morphology.we find tentative indication for malmquist bias in the y_sz-y_x relation, witha turnover at y_sz \sim 4 e-4 arcmin^2. we present additional new opticalredshift determinations with eno and eso telescopes of candidates previouslyconfirmed with xmm-newton. the x-ray and optical redshifts for a total of 20clusters are found to be in excellent agreement. we also show that useful lowerlimits can be put on cluster redshifts using x-ray data only via the use of they_x vs. y_sz and x-ray flux f_x vs. y_sz relations.

1204.1318	planck intermediate results ii: comparison of sunyaev-zeldovich  measurements from planck and from the arcminute microkelvin imager for 11  galaxy clusters	a comparison is presented of sunyaev-zeldovich measurements for 11 galaxyclusters as obtained by planck and by the ground-based interferometer, thearcminute microkelvin imager. assuming a universal spherically-symmetricgeneralised navarro, frenk &amp; white (gnfw) model for the cluster gas pressureprofile, we jointly constrain the integrated compton-y parameter (y_500) andthe scale radius (theta_500) of each cluster. our resulting constraints in they_500-theta_500 2d parameter space derived from the two instruments overlapsignificantly for eight of the clusters, although, overall, there is a tendencyfor ami to find the sunyaev-zeldovich signal to be smaller in angular size andfainter than planck. significant discrepancies exist for the three remainingclusters in the sample, namely a1413, a1914, and the newly-discovered planckcluster plckesz g139.59+24.18. the robustness of the analysis of both theplanck and ami data is demonstrated through the use of detailed simulations,which also discount confusion from residual point (radio) sources and fromdiffuse astrophysical foregrounds as possible explanations for thediscrepancies found. for a subset of our cluster sample, we have investigatedthe dependence of our results on the assumed pressure profile by repeating theanalysis adopting the best-fitting gnfw profile shape which best matches x-rayobservations. adopting the best-fitting profile shape from the x-ray data doesnot, in general, resolve the discrepancies found in this subset of fiveclusters. though based on a small sample, our results suggest that the adoptedgnfw model may not be sufficiently flexible to describe clusters universally.

1207.4009	planck intermediate results. vi: the dynamical structure of  plckg214.6+37.0, a planck discovered triple system of galaxy clusters	the survey of galaxy clusters performed by planck through thesunyaev-zeldovich effect has already discovered many interesting objects,thanks to the whole coverage of the sky. one of the sz candidates detected inthe early months of the mission near to the signal to noise threshold,plckg214.6+37.0, was later revealed by xmm-newton to be a triple system ofgalaxy clusters. we have further investigated this puzzling system with amulti-wavelength approach and we present here the results from a deepxmm-newton re-observation. the characterisation of the physical properties ofthe three components has allowed us to build a template model to extract thetotal sz signal of this system with planck data. we partly reconciled thediscrepancy between the expected sz signal from x-rays and the observed one,which are now consistent at less than 1.2 sigma. we measured the redshift ofthe three components with the iron lines in the x-ray spectrum, and confirmedthat the three clumps are likely part of the same supercluster structure. theanalysis of the dynamical state of the three components, as well as the absenceof detectable excess x-ray emission, suggest that we are witnessing theformation of a massive cluster at an early phase of interaction.

1207.4061	planck intermediate results. v. pressure profiles of galaxy clusters  from the sunyaev-zeldovich effect	taking advantage of the all-sky coverage and broad frequency range of theplanck satellite, we study the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) and pressure profiles of62 nearby massive clusters detected at high significance in the 14-monthnominal survey. careful reconstruction of the sz signal indicates that mostclusters are individually detected at least out to r500. by stacking the radialprofiles, we have statistically detected the radial sz signal out to 3 x r500,i.e., at a density contrast of about 50-100, though the dispersion about themean profile dominates the statistical errors across the whole radial range.our measurement is fully consistent with previous planck results on integratedsz fluxes, further strengthening the agreement between sz and x-raymeasurements inside r500. correcting for the effects of the planck beam, wehave calculated the corresponding pressure profiles. this new constraint fromsz measurements is consistent with the x-ray constraints from xmm-newton in theregion in which the profiles overlap (i.e., [0.1-1]r500), and is in fairly goodagreement with theoretical predictions within the expected dispersion. atlarger radii the average pressure profile is slightly flatter than mostpredictions from numerical simulations. combining the sz and x-ray observedprofiles into a joint fit to a generalised pressure profile gives best-fitparameters [p0, c500, gamma, alpha, beta] = [6.41, 1.81, 0.31, 1.33, 4.13].using a reasonable hypothesis for the gas temperature in the cluster outskirtswe reconstruct from our stacked pressure profile the gas mass fraction profileout to 3 x r500. within the temperature driven uncertainties, our planckconstraints are compatible with the cosmic baryon fraction and expected gasfraction in halos.

1207.4706	planck intermediate results. vii. statistical properties of infrared and  radio extragalactic sources from the planck early release compact source  catalogue at frequencies between 100 and 857 ghz	(abridged for arxiv) we make use of the planck all-sky survey to derivenumber counts and spectral indices of extragalactic sources -- infrared andradio sources -- from the planck early catalogue (ercsc) at 100 to 857ghz. oursample contains, after the 80% completeness cut, between 122 and 452 andsources, with flux densities above 0.3 and 1.9jy at 100 and 857ghz, over about31 to 40% of the sky. using planck hfi, all the sources have been classified aseither dust-dominated or synchrotron-dominated on the basis of their spectralenergy distributions (sed). our sample is thus complete, flux-limited andcolor-selected to differentiate between the two populations. we find anapproximately equal number of synchrotron and dusty sources between 217 and353ghz; at 353ghz or higher (or 217ghz and lower) frequencies, the number isdominated by dusty (synchrotron) sources, as expected. for most of the sources,the spectral indices are also derived. we provide for the first time counts ofbright sources from 353 to 857ghz and the contributions from dusty andsynchrotron sources at all hfi frequencies in the key spectral range wherethese spectra are crossing. the observed counts are in the euclidean regime.the number counts are compared to previously published data (earlier planck,herschel, blast, scuba, laboca, spt, and act) and models taking into accountboth radio or infrared galaxies. we derive the multi-frequency euclidean leveland compare it to wmap, spitzer and iras results. the submillimetre numbercounts are not well reproduced by current evolution models of dusty galaxies,whereas the millimetre part appears reasonably well fitted by the most recentmodel for synchrotron-dominated sources. finally we provide estimates of thelocal luminosity density of dusty galaxies, providing the first suchmeasurements at 545 and 857ghz.

1207.5759	a next generation ultra-fast flash observatory (uffo-100) for ir/optical  observations of the rise phase of gamma-ray bursts	the swift gamma-ray burst (grb) observatory responds to grb triggers withoptical observations in ~ 100 s, but cannot respond faster than ~ 60 s. whilesome ground-based telescopes respond quickly, the number of sub-60 s detectionsremains small. in mid- to late-2013, the ultra-fast flashobservatory-pathfinder is to be launched on the lomonosov spacecraft toinvestigate early optical grb emission. this pathfinder mission is necessarilylimited in sensitivity and event rate; here we discuss a next generationrapid-response space observatory. we list science topics motivating ourinstruments, those that require rapid optical-ir grb response, including: asurvey of grb rise shapes/times, measurements of optical bulk lorentz factors,investigation of magnetic dominated (vs. non-magnetic) jet models, internal vs.external shock origin of prompt optical emission, the use of grbs forcosmology, and dust evaporation in the grb environment. we also address theimpacts of the characteristics of grb observing on our instrument andobservatory design. we describe our instrument designs and choices for a nextgeneration observatory as a second instrument on a low-earth orbit spacecraft,with a 120 kg instrument mass budget. restricted to relatively modest mass andpower, we find that a coded mask x-ray camera with 1024 cm2 of detector areacould rapidly locate about 64 grb triggers/year. responding to the locationsfrom the x-ray camera, a 30 cm aperture telescope with a beam-steering systemfor rapid (~ 1 s) response and a near-ir camera should detect ~ 29 grb, givenswift grb properties. am additional optical camera would give a broadbandoptical-ir slope, allowing dynamic measurement of dust extinction at thesource, for the first time.

1208.3611	planck intermediate results. x. physics of the hot gas in the coma  cluster	we present an analysis of planck satellite data on the coma cluster observedvia the sunyaev-zeldovich effect. planck is able, for the first time, to detectsz emission up to r ~ 3 x r_500. we test previously proposed models for thepressure distribution in clusters against the azimuthally averaged data. wefind that the arnaud et al. universal pressure profile does not fit coma, andthat their pressure profile for merging systems provides a good fit of the dataonly at r&lt;r_500: by r=2xr_500 it underestimates the observed y profile by afactor of ~2. this may indicate that at these larger radii either i) thecluster sz emission is contaminated by unresolved sz sources along the line ofsight or ii) the pressure profile of coma is higher at r&gt;r_500 than the meanpressure profile predicted by the simulations. the planck image showssignificant local steepening of the y profile in two regions about half adegree to the west and to the south-east of the cluster centre. these featuresare consistent with the presence of shock fronts at these radii, and indeed thewestern feature was previously noticed in the rosat pspc mosaic as well as inthe radio. using planck y profiles extracted from corresponding sectors we findpressure jumps of 4.5+0.4-0.2 and 5.0+1.3-0.1 in the west and southeast,respectively. assuming rankine-hugoniot pressure jump conditions, we deducethat the shock waves should propagate with mach number m_w=2.03+0.09-0.04 andm_se=2.05+0.25-0.02 in the west and southeast, respectively. finally, we findthat the y and radio-synchrotron signals are quasi-linearly correlated on mpcscales with small intrinsic scatter. this implies either that the energydensity of cosmic-ray electrons is relatively constant throughout the cluster,or that the magnetic fields fall off much more slowly with radius thanpreviously thought.

1208.5483	planck intermediate results. ix. detection of the galactic haze with  planck	using precise full-sky observations from planck, and applying several methodsof component separation, we identify and characterize the emission from thegalactic "haze" at microwave wavelengths. the haze is a distinct component ofdiffuse galactic emission, roughly centered on the galactic centre, and extendsto |b| ~35 deg in galactic latitude and |l| ~15 deg in longitude. by combiningthe planck data with observations from the wmap we are able to determine thespectrum of this emission to high accuracy, unhindered by the large systematicbiases present in previous analyses. the derived spectrum is consistent withpower-law emission with a spectral index of -2.55 +/- 0.05, thus excludingfree-free emission as the source and instead favouring hard-spectrumsynchrotron radiation from an electron population with a spectrum (numberdensity per energy) dn/de ~ e^-2.1. at galactic latitudes |b|&lt;30 deg, themicrowave haze morphology is consistent with that of the fermi gamma-ray "haze"or "bubbles," indicating that we have a multi-wavelength view of a distinctcomponent of our galaxy. given both the very hard spectrum and the extendednature of the emission, it is highly unlikely that the haze electrons resultfrom supernova shocks in the galactic disk. instead, a new mechanism forcosmic-ray acceleration in the centre of our galaxy is implied.

1208.5911	planck intermediate results. viii. filaments between interacting  clusters	about half of the baryons of the universe are expected to be in the form offilaments of hot and low density intergalactic medium. most of these baryonsremain undetected even by the most advanced x-ray observatories which arelimited in sensitivity to the diffuse low density medium. the planck satellitehas provided hundreds of detections of the hot gas in clusters of galaxies viathe thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich (tsz) effect and is an ideal instrument forstudying extended low density media through the tsz effect. in this paper weuse the planck data to search for signatures of a fraction of these missingbaryons between pairs of galaxy clusters. cluster pairs are good candidates forsearching for the hotter and denser phase of the intergalactic medium (which ismore easily observed through the sz effect). using an x-ray catalogue ofclusters and the planck data, we select physical pairs of clusters ascandidates. using the planck data we construct a local map of the tsz effectcentered on each pair of galaxy clusters. rosat data is used to construct x-raymaps of these pairs. after having modelled and subtracted the tsz effect andx-ray emission for each cluster in the pair we study the residuals on both thesz and x-ray maps. for the merging cluster pair a399-a401 we observe asignificant tsz effect signal in the intercluster region beyond the virialradii of the clusters. a joint x-ray sz analysis allows us to constrain thetemperature and density of this intercluster medium. we obtain a temperature ofkt = 7.1 +- 0.9, kev (consistent with previous estimates) and a baryon densityof (3.7 +- 0.2)x10^-4, cm^-3. the planck satellite mission has provided thefirst sz detection of the hot and diffuse intercluster gas.

0712.3141	the 2.3 ghz continuum survey of the gem project	we present a partial-sky survey of the radio continuum at 2.3 ghz within thescope of the galactic emission mapping (gem) project, an observational programconceived and developed to reveal the large-scale properties of galacticsynchrotron radiation through a set of self-consistent surveys of the radiocontinuum between 408 mhz and 10 ghz. the gem experiment uses a portable anddouble-shielded 5.5-m radiotelescope in altazimuthal configuration to map60-degree-wide declination bands from different observational sites bycircularly scanning the sky at zenithal angles of 30 deg from a constantlyrotating platform. the observations were accomplished with a total powerreceiver, whose front-end high electron mobility transistor (hemt) amplifierwas matched directly to a cylindrical horn at the prime focus of the parabolicreflector. the moon was used to calibrate the antenna temperature scale and thepreparation of the map required direct subtraction and destriping algorithms toremove ground contamination as the most significant source of systematic error.we used 484 hours of total intensity observations from two locations incolombia and brazil to yield 66% sky coverage from dec = -51.73 deg to dec =+34.78 deg. the zero-level uncertainty of the combined survey is 103 mk with atemperature scale error of 5% after direct correlation with the rhodes/hartraosurvey at 2326 mhz on a t-t plot. the sky brightness distribution into regionsof low and high emission in the gem survey is consistent with the appearance ofa transition region as seen in the haslam 408 mhz and wmap k-band surveys.preliminary results also show that the temperature spectral index between 408mhz and the 2.3 ghz band of the gem survey has a weak spatial correlation withthese regions; but it steepens significantly from high to low emission regionswith respect to the wmap k-band survey.

1303.5062	planck 2013 results. i. overview of products and scientific results	the esa's planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early universe and itssubsequent evolution, was launched 14 may 2009 and has been scanning themicrowave and submillimetre sky continuously since 12 august 2009. this papergives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis,and characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science dataproducts and papers in the release. the science products include maps of thecmb and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact galactic andextragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the sz effect.the likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the planck dataand a lensing likelihood are described. scientific results include robustsupport for the standard six-parameter lcdm model of cosmology and improvedmeasurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation fromscale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. the planck values for theseparameters and others derived from them are significantly different from thosepreviously determined. several large-scale anomalies in the temperaturedistribution of the cmb, first detected by wmap, are confirmed with higherconfidence. planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and hasmeasured gravitational lensing of cmb anisotropies at greater than 25 sigma.planck finds no evidence for non-gaussianity in the cmb. planck's results agreewell with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. planckfinds a lower hubble constant than found in some more local measures. sometension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations derivedfrom cmb data and that derived from sz data. the planck and wmap power spectraare offset from each other by an average level of about 2% around the firstacoustic peak.

1303.5074	planck 2013 results. xiv. zodiacal emission	the planck satellite provides a set of all-sky maps at nine frequencies from30 ghz to 857 ghz. planets, minor bodies, and diffuse interplanetary dustemission (ipd) are all observed. the ipd can be separated from galactic andother emissions because planck views a given point on the celestial spheremultiple times, through different columns of ipd. we use the planck data toinvestigate the behaviour of zodiacal emission over the whole sky atsub-millimetre and millimetre wavelengths. we fit the planck data to find theemissivities of the various components of the cobe zodiacal model -- a diffusecloud, three asteroidal dust bands, a circumsolar ring, and an earth-trailingfeature. the emissivity of the diffuse cloud decreases with increasingwavelength, as expected from earlier analyses. the emissivities of the dustbands, however, decrease less rapidly, indicating that the properties of thegrains in the bands are different from those in the diffuse cloud. we fit thesmall amount of galactic emission seen through the telescope's far sidelobes,and place limits on possible contamination of the cmb results from bothzodiacal and far-sidelobe emission. when necessary, the results are used in theplanck pipeline to make maps with zodiacal emission and far sidelobes removed.we show that the zodiacal correction to the cmb maps is small compared to theplanck cmb temperature power spectrum and give a list of flux densities forsmall solar system bodies.

astro-ph;0007066	spillover and diffraction sidelobe contamination in a double-shielded  experiment for mapping galactic synchrotron emission	we have analyzed observations from a radioastronomical experiment to surveythe sky at decimetric wavelengths along with feed pattern measurements in orderto account for the level of ground contamination entering the sidelobes. amajor asset of the experiment is the use of a wire mesh fence around therim-halo shielded antenna with the purpose of levelling out and reducing thissource of stray radiation for zenith-centered 1-rpm circular scans. weinvestigate the shielding performance of the experiment by means of a geometricdiffraction model in order to predict the level of the spillover anddiffraction sidelobes in the direction of the ground. using 408 mhz and 1465mhz feed measurements, the model shows how a weakly-diffracting and unshieldedantenna configuration becomes strongly-diffracting and double-shielded asfar-field diffraction effects give way to near-field ones. due to theasymmetric response of the feeds, the orientation of their radiation fieldswith respect to the secondary must be known a priori before comparing modelpredictions with observational data. by adjusting the attenuation coefficientof the wire mesh the model is able to reproduce the amount of differentialground pick-up observed during test measurements at 1465 mhz.

astro-ph;0011412	a new radio continuum survey of the sky at 1465 mhz between declinations  -52 degrees and +68 degrees	we have mapped the total sky brightness at 1465 mhz in two adjacent 60-degreedeclination bands with the portable 5.5-m parabolic reflector of the galacticemission mapping (gem) project, an on-going international collaboration tosurvey the radio continuum of the sky in decimeter and centimeter wavelengths.the observations were conducted from two locations, one in the usa and theother in brazil, using a novel instrumental approach to overcome the well-knownshortcomings of survey experiments. our strategy consists of a 1-rpm rotatingdish to circularly scan the sky at 30 degrees from zenith. the dish uses arim-halo to re-direct the spillover sidelobes of its backfire helical feedtoward the sky and the entire assembly has been enclosed inside a wire meshground shield in order to minimize and level out the contamination from theground. the diffraction characteristics of this set-up have been succesfullymodelled and undesired systematic striping across the observed bands has beencarefully removed by a baseline propagation method which exploits thetime-forward and time-backward intersections of the circular scans. the mapdisplays nearly 300 hours of our best quality data taken with a hpbw of 5.4degrees at a sensitivity of 20 mk.

astro-ph;0104459	a high spatial resolution analysis of the maxima-1 cosmic microwave  background anisotropy data	we extend the analysis of the maxima-1 cosmic microwave background (cmb) datato smaller angular scales. maxima, a bolometric balloon experiment, mapped a124 deg$^2$ region of the sky with 10\arcmin resolution at frequencies of 150,240 and 410 ghz during its first flight. the original analysis, which coveredthe multipole range $36 \leq \ell \leq 785$, is extended to $\ell = 1235$ usingdata from three 150 ghz photometers in the fully cross-linked central 60deg$^2$ of the map. the main improvement over the original analysis is the useof 3\arcmin square pixels in the calculation of the map. the new analysis isconsistent with the original for $\ell &lt; 785$. for $\ell &gt; 785$, whereinflationary models predict a third acoustic peak, the new analysis shows powerwith an amplitude of $56 \pm 7$ \microk at $\ell \simeq 850$ in excess to theaverage power of $42 \pm 3$ \microk in the range $441 &lt; \ell &lt; 785$.

astro-ph;0105062	cosmological implications of the maxima-i high resolution cosmic  microwave background anisotropy measurement	we discuss the cosmological implications of the new constraints on the powerspectrum of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy derived from a new highresolution analysis of the maxima-1 measurement (lee et al. 2001). the powerspectrum shows excess power at $\ell \sim 860$ over the average level of powerat $411 \le\ell \le 785.$ this excess is statistically significant on the 95%confidence level. such a feature is consistent with the presence of a thirdacoustic peak, which is a generic prediction of inflation-based models. theheight and the position of the excess power match the predictions of a familyof inflationary models with cosmological parameters that are fixed to fit thecmb data previously provided by boomerang-ldb and maxima-1 experiments (e.g.,jaffe et al.2001). our results, therefore, lend support for inflationary modelsand more generally for the dominance of coherent perturbations in the structureformation of the universe. at the same time, they seem to disfavor a largevariety of the non-standard (but still inflation-based) models that have beenproposed to improve the quality of fits to the cmb data and consistency withother cosmological observables.  within standard inflationary models, our results combined with the cobe-dmrdata give best fit values and 95% confidence limits for the baryon density,$\omega_b h^2\simeq 0.033{\pm 0.013}$, and the total density,$\omega=0.9{+0.18\atop -0.16}$. the primordial spectrum slope ($n_s$) and theoptical depth to the last scattering surface ($\tau_c$) are found to bedegenerate and to obey the relation $n_s \simeq 0.46 \tau_c + (0.99 \pm 0.14)$,for $\tau_c \le 0.5$ (all 95% c.l.).

astro-ph;0210226	a radio catalog of galactic hii regions for applications from decimeter  to millimeter wavelengths	by collecting the information from 24 previously published lists andcatalogs, we produce a comprehensive catalog (master catalog) of 1442 galactichii regions. for each object, we quote the original fluxes and diameters aswell as the available information on radio line velocities, line widths andline temperatures and the errors on these quantitities. references to theoriginal works are also reported. by exploiting all these data we produce asynthetic catalog of fluxes and diameters (with corresponding errors) at 2.7ghz. this choice is motivated by the extensive, although not complete,information available at this frequency, widely spread among many differentcatalogs, and by its relevance for both detailed studies on galactic hiiregions and the extrapolation up to millimetric wavelengths. the catalog can beused for detailed studies of galactic hii regions and, by extrapolation, forinvestigations of hii regions up to millimetric wavelengths. in particular, wediscuss the study of the effects of microwave emission from hii regions on thenew generation of cosmic microwave background (cmb) experiments. we presentsimulations of the detection of hii regions in the high resolution cmb survey,and briefly analize some of the typical applications of our catalog to theevaluation of cmb anisotropy experiments such as calibration, beamreconstruction and straylight effects. the master catalog and the syntheticcatalog are available via ftp at: cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr. this work is related toplanck-lfi activities.

astro-ph;0308355	correlations between the wmap and maxima cosmic microwave background  anisotropy maps	we cross-correlate the cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropymaps from the wmap, maxima-i, and maxima-ii experiments. we use thecross-spectrum, which is the spherical harmonic transform of the angulartwo-point correlation function, to quantify the correlation as a function ofangular scale. we find that the three possible pairs of cross-spectra are inclose agreement with each other and with the power spectra of the individualmaps. the probability that there is no correlation between the maps is smallerthan 1 * 10^(-8). we also calculate power spectra for maps made of differencesbetween pairs of maps, and show that they are consistent with no signal. theresults conclusively show that the three experiments not only display the samestatistical properties of the cmb anisotropy, but also detect the same featureswherever the observed sky areas overlap. we conclude that the contribution ofsystematic errors to these maps is negligible and that maxima and wmap haveaccurately mapped the cosmic microwave background anisotropy.
