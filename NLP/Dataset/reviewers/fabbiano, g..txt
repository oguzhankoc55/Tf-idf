0901.0297	imaging the circumnuclear region of ngc 1365 with chandra	we present the first chandra/acis imaging study of the circumnuclear regionof the nearby seyfert galaxy ngc 1365. the x-ray emission is resolved intopoint-like sources and complex, extended emission. the x-ray morphology of theextended emission shows a biconical soft x-ray emission region extending ~5 kpcin projection from the nucleus, coincident with the high excitation outflowcones seen in optical emission lines particularly to the northwest. harderx-ray emission is detected from a kpc-diameter circumnuclear ring, coincidentwith the star-forming ring prominent in the spitzer mid-infrared images; thisx-ray emission is partially obscured by the central dust lane of ngc 1365.spectral fitting of spatially separated components indicates a thermal plasmaorigin for the soft extended x-ray emission (kt=0.57 kev). only a small amountof this emission can be due to photoionization by the nuclear source. detailedcomparison with [oiii]5007 observations shows the hot interstellar medium (ism)is spatially anticorrelated with the [oiii] emitting clouds and has thermalpressures comparable to those of the [oiii] medium, suggesting that the hot ismacts as a confining medium for the cooler photoionized clouds. the abundanceratios of the hot ism are fully consistent with the theoretical values forenrichment from type ii supernovae, suggesting that the hot ism is a wind fromthe starburst circumnuclear ring. x-ray emission from a ~450 pc long nuclearradio jet is also detected to the southeast.

0901.3934	transient low-mass x-ray binary populations in elliptical galaxies ngc  3379 and ngc 4278	we propose a physically motivated and self-consistent prescription for themodeling of transient neutron star (ns) low-mass x-ray binary (lmxb)properties, such as duty cycle (dc), outburst duration and recurrence time. weapply this prescription to the population synthesis (ps) models of field lmxbspresented by fragos et al. (2008), and compare the transient lmxb population tothe chandra x-ray survey of the two elliptical galaxies ngc 3379 and ngc 4278,which revealed several transient sources (brassington et al., 2008, 2009). weare able to exclude models with a constant dc for all transient systems, whilemodels with a variable dc based on the properties of each system are consistentwith the observed transient populations. we predict that the majority of theobserved transient sources in these two galaxies are lmxbs with red giantdonors. our comparison suggests that lmxbs formed through evolution ofprimordial field binaries are dominant in globular cluster (gc) poor ellipticalgalaxies, while they still have a significant contribution in gc rich ones.

0901.4809	variable partial covering and a relativistic iron line in ngc 1365	we present a complete analysis of the hard x-ray (2-10 kev) properties of theseyfert galaxy ngc 1365, based on a 60 ks xmm-newton observation performed injanuary 2004. the two main results are: 1) we detect an obscuring cloud withn_h~3.5x10^23 cm^(-2) crossing the line of sight in ~25 ks. this implies adimension of the x-ray source not larger than a few 10^13 cm and a distance ofthe obscuring cloud of the order of 10^16 cm. adopting the black hole massm(bh) estimated from the m(bh)-velocity dispersion relation, the source size isd_s&lt;20 r_g and the distance and density of the obscuring clouds arer~3000-10000 r_g and n~10^(10) cm^(-3), i.e. typical values for broad lineregion clouds. 2) an iron emission line with a relativistic profile is detectedwith high statistical significance. a time integrated fit of the line+continuumreflection components suggests a high iron abundance (~3 times solar) and anorigin of these components in the inner part (~10 r_g) of the accretion disk,in agreement with the small source size inferred from the analysis of theabsorption variability.

0902.2343	comparing gc and field lmxbs in elliptical galaxies with deep chandra  and hubble data	(abridged) we present a statistical study of the low-mass x-ray binary (lmxb)populations of three nearby, old elliptical galaxies: ngc 3379, ngc 4278, andngc 4697. with a cumulative ~1 ms chandra acis observing time, we detect 90-170lmxbs within the d25 ellipse of each galaxy. cross-correlating chandra x-raysources and hst optical sources, we identify 75 globular cluster (gc) lmxbs and112 field lmxbs. in the low luminosity range allowed by our deeper data (lx &lt; 5x 1037 erg s-1), we find a significant relative lack of gc-lmxbs, when comparedwith field sources. using the co-added sample from the three galaxies, we findthat the incompleteness-corrected x-ray luminosity functions (xlfs) of gc andfield lmxbs differ at ~4# significance at lx &lt; 5 x 1037 erg s-1. as previouslyreported, these xlfs are consistent at higher luminosities. our observationsmay indicate a potential predominance of gc-lmxbs with donors evolved beyondthe main sequence, when compared to current models, but their efficientformation requires relatively high initial binary fractions in clusters. thefield lmxb xlf can be fitted with either a single power-law model plus alocalized excess at a luminosity of 5-6 x 1037 erg s-1, or a broken power-lawwith a similar low-luminosity break. this xlf may be explained withns-red-giant lmxbs, contributing to ~15% of total lmxbs population at ~5x1037erg s-1. the difference in the gc and field xlfs is consistent with differentorigins and/or evolutionary paths between the two lmxb populations, although afraction of the field sources are likely to have originated in gcs.

0902.3709	diffuse baryonic matter beyond 2020	the hot, diffuse gas that fills the largest overdense structures in theuniverse -- clusters of galaxies and a web of giant filaments connecting them-- provides us with tools to address a wide array of fundamental astrophysicaland cosmological questions via observations in the x-ray band. clusters aresensitive cosmological probes. to utilize their full potential for precisioncosmology in the following decades, we must precisely understand their physics-- from their cool cores stirred by jets produced by the central supermassiveblack hole (itself fed by inflow of intracluster gas), to their outskirts,where the infall of intergalactic medium (igm) drives shocks and acceleratescosmic rays. beyond the cluster confines lies the virtually unexplored warmigm, believed to contain most of the baryonic matter in the present-dayuniverse. as a depository of all the matter ever ejected from galaxies, itcarries unique information on the history of energy and metal production in theuniverse. currently planned major observatories, such as astro-h and ixo, willmake deep inroads into these areas, but to see the most interesting parts ofthe picture will require an almost science-fiction-grade facility with tens ofm^2 of effective area, subarcsecond angular resolution, a matching imagingcalorimeter and a super high-dispersion spectrograph, such as generation-x.

0706.3927	the x-ray binary population in m33: ii. x-ray spectra and variability	in this paper we investigate the x-ray spectra and x-ray spectral variabilityof compact x-ray sources for 3 chandra observations of the local group galaxym33. the observations are centered on the nucleus and the star forming regionngc 604. in the observations 261 sources have been detected. for a total of 43sources the number of net counts is above 100, sufficient for a more detailedspectral fitting. of these sources, 25 have been observed in more than oneobservation, allowing the study of spectral variability on ~months timescales.a quarter of the sources are found to be variable between observations.however, except for two foreground sources, no source is variable within anyobservation above the 99% confidence level. only six sources show significantspectral variability between observations. a comparison of n_h values with hiobservations shows that x-ray absorption values are consistent with galacticx-ray binaries and most sources in m33 are intrinsically absorbed. the patternof variability and the spectral parameters of these sources are consistent withthe m33 x-ray source population being dominated by x-ray binaries: two thirdsof the 43 bright sources have spectral and timing properties consistent withx-ray binaries; we also find two candidates for super-soft sources and twocandidates for quasi-soft sources.

0909.5444	the highest resolution chandra view of photoionization and jet-cloud  interaction in the nuclear region of ngc 4151	we report high resolution imaging of the nucleus of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc4151 obtained with a 50 ks chandra hrc observation. the hrc image resolves theemission on spatial scales of 0.5", ~30 pc, showing an extended x-raymorphology overall consistent with the narrow line region (nlr) seen in opticalline emission. removal of the bright point-like nuclear source and imagedeconvolution techniques both reveal x-ray enhancements that closely match thesubstructures seen in the hubble space telescope [oiii] image and prominentknots in the radio jet. we find that most of the nlr clouds in ngc 4151 have[oiii] to soft x-ray ratio ~10, despite the distance of the clouds from thenucleus. this ratio is consistent with the values observed in nlrs of someseyfert 2 galaxies, which indicates a uniform ionization parameter even atlarge radii and a density decreasing as $r^{-2}$ as expected for a nuclear windscenario. the [oiii]/x-ray ratios at the location of radio knots show an excessof x-ray emission, suggesting shock heating in addition to photoionization. weexamine various mechanisms for the x-ray emission and find that, in contrast tojet-related x-ray emission in more powerful agn, the observed jet parameters inngc 4151 are inconsistent with synchrotron emission, synchrotron self-compton,inverse compton of cmb photons or galaxy optical light. instead, our resultsfavor thermal emission from the interaction between radio outflow and nlr gasclouds as the origin for the x-ray emission associated with the jet. thissupports previous claims that frequent jet-ism interaction may explain why jetsin seyfert galaxies appear small, slow, and thermally dominated, distinct fromthose kpc scale jets in the radio galaxies.

1002.4299	ultraluminous x-ray sources out to z~0.3 in the cosmos field	using chandra observations we have identified a sample of seven off-nuclearx-ray sources, in the redshift range z=0.072-0.283, located within opticallybright galaxies in the cosmos survey. using the multi-wavelength coverageavailable in the cosmos field, we study the properties of the host galaxies ofthese ulxs. in detail, we derived their star formation rate from h_alphameasurements and their stellar masses using sed fitting techniques with the aimto compute the probability to have an off-nuclear source based on the hostgalaxy properties. we divide the host galaxies in different morphologicalclasses using the available acs/hst imaging. we find that our ulxs candidatesare located in regions of the sfr versus m$_star$ plane where one or moreoff-nuclear detectable sources are expected. from a morphological analysis ofthe acs imaging and the use of rest-frame colours, we find that our ulxs arehosted both in late and early type galaxies. finally, we find that the fractionof galaxies hosting a ulx ranges from ~0.5% to ~0.2% going from l[0.5-2 kev]=3x 10^39 erg s^-1 to l[0.5-2 kev]= 2 x 10^40 erg s^-1.

1003.3236	the x-ray spectra of the luminous lmxbs in ngc 3379: field and globular  cluster sources	from a deep multi-epoch chandra observation of the elliptical galaxy ngc 3379we report the spectral properties of eight luminous lmxbs (lx&gt;1.2e38 erg/s). wealso present a set of spectral simulations, produced to aid the interpretationof low-count single-component spectral modeling. these simulations demonstratethat it is possible to infer the spectral states of x-ray binaries from thesesimple models and thereby constrain the properties of the source. of the eightlmxbs studied, three reside within globular clusters, and one is a confirmedfield source. due to the nature of the luminosity cut all sources are eitherneutron star binaries emitting at or above the eddington luminosity or blackhole binaries. the spectra from these sources are well described bysingle-component models, with parameters consistent with galactic lmxbobservations, where hard-state sources have a range in photon index of 1.5-1.9and thermally dominated sources have inner disc temperatures between ~0.7-1.55kev. the large variability observed in the brightest globular cluster source(lx&gt;4e38 erg/s) suggests the presence of a black hole binary. at its mostluminous this source is observed in a thermally dominated state with kt=1.5kev, consistent with a black hole mass of ~4 msol. this observation providesfurther evidence that globular clusters are able to retain such massivebinaries. we also observed a source transitioning from a bright state (lx~1e39erg/s), with prominent thermal and non-thermal components, to a less luminoushard state (lx=3.8e38 erg/s, gamma=1.85). in its high flux emission this sourceexhibits a cool-disc component of ~0.14 kev, similar to spectra observed insome ultraluminous x-ray sources. such a similarity indicates a possible linkbetween `normal' stellar mass black holes in a high accretion state and ulxs.

1003.6133	revisit short term x-ray spectral variability of ngc 4151 with chandra	we present new x-ray spectral data for the seyfert 1 nucleus in ngc 4151observed with chandra for 200 ks. a significant acis pileup is present,resulting in a non-linear count rate variation during the observation. withpileup corrected spectral fitting, we are able to recover the spectralparameters and find consistency with those derived from unpiled events in theacis readout streak and outer region from the bright nucleus. the absorptioncorrected 2-10 kev flux of the nucleus varied between 6e-11 and 1e-10 ergs^{-1} cm^{-2}. similar to earlier chandra studies of ngc 4151 at a historicallow state, the photon indices derived from the same absorbed power-law modelare \gamma~0.7-0.9. however, we show that \gamma is highly dependent on theadopted spectral models. fitting the power-law continuum with a comptonreflection component gives \gamma~1.1. by including passage of non-uniformx-ray obscuring clouds, we can reproduce the apparent flat spectral states with\gamma~1.7, typical for seyfert 1 agns. the same model also fits the hardspectra from previous asca "long look" observation of ngc 4151 in the lowestflux state. the spectral variability during our observation can be interpretedas variations in intrinsic soft continuum flux relative to a compton reflectioncomponent that is from distant cold material and constant on short time scale,or variations of partially covering absorber in the line of sight towards thenucleus. an ionized absorber model with ionization parameter \log\xi ~ 0.8-1.1can also fit the low-resolution acis spectra. if the partial covering model iscorrect, adopting a black hole mass m_{bh} ~ 4.6e+7 msun we constrain thedistance of the obscuring cloud from the central black hole to be r&lt;~9light-days, consistent with the size of broad emission line region of ngc 4151from optical reverberation mapping.

1005.3365	"comets" orbiting a black hole	we use a long (300 ksec), continuous suzaku x-ray observation of the activenucleus in ngc1365 to investigate the structure of the circumnuclear blr cloudsthrough their occultation of the x-ray source. the variations of the absorbingcolumn density and of the covering factor indicate that the clouds surroundingthe black hole are far from having a spherical geometry (as sometimes assumed),instead they have a strongly elongated and cometary shape, with a dense head(n=10^11 cm^-3) and an expanding, dissolving tail. we infer that the cometarytails must be longer than a few times 10^13 cm and their opening angle must besmaller than a few degrees. we suggest that the cometary shape may be a commonfeature of blr clouds in general, but which has been difficult to recognizeobservationally so far. the cometary shape may originate from shocks andhydrodynamical instabilities generated by the supersonic motion of the blrclouds into the intracloud medium. as a consequence of the mass loss into theirtail, we infer that the blr clouds probably have a lifetime of only a fewmonths, implying that they must be continuously replenished. we also find alarge, puzzling discrepancy (two orders of magnitude) between the mass of theblr inferred from the properties of the absorbing clouds and the mass of theblr inferred from photoionization models; we discuss the possible solutions tothis discrepancy.

1006.1649	the jet and counterjet of 3c 270 (ngc 4261) viewed in the x-ray with  chandra	the radio source 3c 270, hosted by ngc 4261, is the brightest known exampleof counterjet x-ray emission from a low-power radio galaxy. we report on thex-ray emission of the jet and counterjet from 130 ks of chandra data. we arguethat the x-ray emission is synchrotron radiation and that the internalproperties of the jet and counterjet are remarkably similar. we find a smoothconnection in x-ray hardness and x-ray to radio ratio between the jet and oneof the x-ray components within the core spectrum. we observe wedge-likedepressions in diffuse x-ray surface brightness surrounding the jets, andinterpret them as regions where an aged population of electrons providespressure to balance the interstellar medium of ngc 4261. about 20% of the massof the interstellar medium has been displaced by the radio source. treating 3c270 as a twin-jet system, we find an interesting agreement between the ratio ofjet-to-counterjet length in x-rays and that expected if x-rays are observedover the distance that an outflow from the core would have traveled in ~6x10^4yr. x-ray synchrotron loss times are shorter than this, and we suggest thatmost particle acceleration arises as a result of turbulence and dissipation ina stratified flow. we speculate that an episode of activity in the centralengine beginning ~6x10^4 yr ago has led to an increased velocity shear. thishas enhanced the ability of the jet plasma to accelerate electrons tox-ray-synchrotron-emitting energies, forming the x-ray jet and counterjet thatwe see today.

0710.5126	the dearth of low-luminosity globular cluster lmxbs in ngc 3379	our campaign of deep monitoring observations with {\it chandra} of the nearbyelliptical galaxy ngc 3379 has lead to the detection of nine globular cluster(gc) and 53 field low mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs) in the joint {\ithubble}/{\it chandra} field of view of this galaxy. comparing thesepopulations, we find a highly significant lack of gc lmxbs at the low (0.3-8kev) x-ray luminosities (in the $\sim 10^{36}$ to $\sim 4\times10^{37}$ ergs$^{-1}$ range) probed with our observations. this result conflicts with theproposition that all lmxbs are formed in gcs. this lack of low-luminositysources in gcs is consistent with continuous lmxb formation due to stellarinteractions and with the transition from persistent to transient lmxbs. theobserved cut-off x-ray luminosity favors a predominance of lmxbs withmain-sequence donors instead of ultra-compact binaries with white-dwarf donors;ultra-compacts could contribute significantly only if their disks are notaffected by x-ray irradiation. our results suggest that current theories ofmagnetic stellar wind braking may work rather better for the unevolvedcompanions of gc lmxbs than for field lmxbs and cataclysmic variables in thegalaxy, where these companions may be somewhat evolved.

1206.2919	clasps: a new methodology for knowledge extraction from complex  astronomical dataset	in this paper we present the clustering-labels-score patterns spotter(clasps), a new methodology for the determination of correlations amongastronomical observables in complex datasets, based on the application ofdistinct unsupervised clustering techniques. the novelty in clasps is thecriterion used for the selection of the optimal clusterings, based on aquantitative measure of the degree of correlation between the clustermemberships and the distribution of a set of observables, the labels, notemployed for the clustering. in this paper we discuss the applications ofclasps to two simple astronomical datasets, both composed of extragalacticsources with photometric observations at different wavelengths from large areasurveys. the first dataset, csc+, is composed of optical quasarsspectroscopically selected in the sdss data, observed in the x-rays by chandraand with multi-wavelength observations in the near-infrared, optical andultraviolet spectral intervals. one of the results of the application of claspsto the csc+ is the re-identification of a well-known correlation between thealphaox parameter and the near ultraviolet color, in a subset of csc+ sourceswith relatively small values of the near-ultraviolet colors. the other datasetconsists of a sample of blazars for which photometric observations in theoptical, mid and near infrared are available, complemented for a subset of thesources, by fermi gamma-ray data. the main results of the application of claspsto such datasets have been the discovery of a strong correlation between themulti-wavelength color distribution of blazars and their optical spectralclassification in bl lacs and flat spectrum radio quasars and a peculiarpattern followed by blazars in the wise mid-infrared colors space. this patternand its physical interpretation have been discussed in details in other papersby one of the authors.

(2009), tailored to our new chandrapointings of ngc 4278. we attribute this discrepancy to the ps assumption thatthe transient population is composed of ns xrbs, as well as differences betweenthe statistical analysis and error estimates used in the model and ourobservations.

1208.5952	metallicity effect on lmxb formation in globular clusters	we present comprehensive observational results of the metallicity effect onthe fraction of globular clusters (gc) that contain low-mass x-ray binaries(lmxb), by utilizing all available data obtained with chandra for lmxbs and hstacs for gcs. our primary sample consists of old elliptical galaxies selectedfrom the acs virgo and fornax surveys. to improve statistics at both the lowestand highest x-ray luminosity, we also use previously reported results fromother galaxies. it is well known that the lmxb fraction is considerably higherin red, metal-rich, than in blue, metal-poor gcs. in this paper, we testwhether this metallicity effect is x-ray luminosity-dependent, and find thatthe effect holds uniformly in a wide luminosity range. this result isstatistically significant (at &gt;= 3 sigma) in lmxbs with luminosities in therange lx = 2 x 10^37 - 5 x 10^38 erg s-1, where the ratio of lmxb fractions inmetal-rich to metal-poor gcs is r = 3.4 +- 0.5. a similar ratio is also foundat lower (down to 10^36 erg s-1) and higher luminosities (up to the ulxregime), but with less significance (~2 sigma confidence). because differenttypes of lmxbs dominate in different luminosities, our finding requires a newexplanation for the metallicity effect in dynamically formed lmxbs. we confirmthat the metallicity effect is not affected by other factors such as stellarage, gc mass, stellar encounter rate, and galacto-centric distance.

1208.5972	on the origin of the metallicity dependence in dynamically formed  extragalactic low-mass x-ray binaries	globular clusters (gcs) effectively produce dynamically-formed low-mass x-raybinaries (lmxbs). observers detect ~100 times more lmxbs per stellar mass ingcs compared to stars in the fields of galaxies. it has also beenobservationally established that metal-rich gcs are about 3 times more likelyto contain an x-ray source than their metal-poor counterparts. recentobservations have shown that this ratio holds in extragalactic gcs for allbright x-ray sources with lx between 2x10^{37} and 5x10^{38} erg/s. in thisletter, we propose that the observed metallicity dependence of lmxbs inextragalactic gcs can be explained by the differences in the number densitiesand average masses of red giants in populations of different metallicities. redgiants serve as seeds for the dynamical production of bright lmxbs via twochannels - binary exchanges and physical collisions - and the increase of thenumber densities and masses of red giants boost lmxb production, leading to theobserved difference. we also discuss a possible effect of the age difference instellar populations of different metallicities.

1211.2804	deep chandra monitoring observations of ngc 4649: i. catalog of source  properties	we present the x-ray source catalog for the chandra monitoring observationsof the elliptical galaxy, ngc 4649. the galaxy has been observed with chandraacis-s3 in six separate pointings, reaching a total exposure of 299 ks. thereare 501 x-ray sources detected in the 0.3-8.0 kev band in the mergedobservation or in one of the six individual observations; 399 sources arelocated within the d_25 ellipse. the observed 0.3-8.0 kev luminosities of these501 sources range from 9.3x10^{36} erg/s to 5.4x10^{39} erg/s. the 90%detection completeness limit within the d_25 ellipse is 5.5x10^{37} erg/s.based on the surface density of background active galactic nuclei (agns) anddetection completeness, we expect ~45 background agns among the catalog sources(~15 within the d_25 ellipse). there are nine sources with luminosities greaterthan 10^{39} erg/s, which are candidates for ultraluminous x-ray sources. thenuclear source of ngc 4649 is a low-luminosity agn, with an intrinsic 2.0-8.0kev x-ray luminosity of 1.5x10^{38} erg/s. the x-ray colors suggest that themajority of the catalog sources are low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs). we findthat 164 of the 501 x-ray sources show long-term variability, indicating thatthey are accreting compact objects. we discover four transient candidates andanother four potential transients. we also identify 173 x-ray sources (141within the d_25 ellipse) that are associated with globular clusters (gcs) basedon hubble space telescope and ground-based data; these lmxbs tend to be hostedby red gcs. although ngc 4649 has a much larger population of x-ray sourcesthan the structurally similar early-type galaxies, ngc 3379 and ngc 4278, yetthe x-ray source properties are comparable in all three systems.

0801.1122	models for low-mass x-ray binaries in the elliptical galaxies ngc3379  and ngc4278: comparison with observations	we present theoretical models for the formation and evolution of populationsof low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxb) in the two elliptical galaxies ngc 3379 andngc 4278. the models are calculated with the recently updated startrack code(belczynski et al., 2006), assuming only a primordial galactic field lmxbpopulation. startrack is an advanced population synthesis code that has beentested and calibrated using detailed binary star calculations and incorporatesall the important physical processes of binary evolution. the simulations aretargeted to modeling and understanding the origin of the x-ray luminosityfunctions (xlf) of point sources in these galaxies. for the first time weexplore the population xlf down to luminosities of 3x10^36 erg/s, as probed bythe most recent observational results (kim et al., 2006). we consider modelsfor the formation and evolution of lmxbs in galactic fields with different ceefficiencies, stellar wind prescriptions, magnetic braking laws and initialmass functions. we identify models that produce an xlf in excellent agreementwith the observations both in shape and absolute normalization. we also findthat the treatment of the outburst luminosity of transient systems remains acrucial factor for the determination of the xlf since the modeled populationsare dominated by transient x-ray systems.

1306.4315	the two dimensional projected spatial distribution of globular clusters:  method and application to ngc4261	we present a new method for the determination of the two-dimensional (2d)projected spatial distribution of globular clusters (gcs) in external galaxies.this method is based on the k-nearest neighbor density estimator of dressler(1980), complemented by montecarlo simulations to establish the statisticalsignificance of the results. we apply this method to ngc4261, a "test galaxy"where significant 2d anisotropy in the gc distribution has been reported. weconfirm that the 2d distribution of gc is not azimuthally isotropic. moreover,we demonstrate that the 2d distribution departures from the average gc radialdistribution results in highly significant spiral-like or broken shellfeatures. overall, the same perturbations are found in "red" and "blue" gcs,but with some differences. in particular, we observe a central feature, roughlyaligned with the minor axis of ngc4261, composed of red and most luminous gcs.blue and fainter gcs are more frequent at large radial distances and follow thespiral-like features of the overall density structure. these results suggest acomplex merging history for ngc4261.

1401.2994	the two-dimensional spatial distributions of the globular clusters and  low-mass x-ray binaries of ngc4649	we report significant anisotropies in the projected two-dimensional (2d)spatial distributions of globular clusters (gcs) of the giant virgo ellipticalgalaxy ngc4649 (m60). similar features are found in the 2d distribution oflow-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs), both associated with gcs and in the stellarfield. deviations from azimuthal symmetry suggest an arc-like excess of gcsextending north at 4-15 kpc galactocentric radii in the eastern side of majoraxis of ngc4649. this feature is more prominent for red gcs, but still persistsin the 2d distribution of blue gcs. high and low luminosity gcs also show somesegregation along this arc, with high-luminosity gcs preferentially located inthe southern end and low-luminosity gcs in the northern section of the arc.gc-lmxbs follow the anisotropy of red-gcs, where most of them reside; however,a significant overdensity of (high-luminosity) field lmxbs is present to thesouth of the gc arc. these results suggest that ngc4649 has experienced mergersand/or multiple accretions of less massive satellite galaxies during itsevolution, of which the gcs in the arc may be the fossil remnant. we speculatethat the observed anisotropy in the field lmxb spatial distribution indicatesthat these x-ray binaries may be the remnants of a star formation eventconnected with the merger, or maybe be ejected from the parent red gcs, if thebulk motion of these clusters is significantly affected by dynamical friction.we also detect a luminosity enhancement in the x-ray source population of thecompanion spiral galaxy ngc4647. we suggest that these may be younger high massx-ray binaries formed as a result of the tidal interaction of this galaxy withngc4649.

1403.1071	revealing the nature of the ulx and x-ray population of the spiral  galaxy ngc 4088	we present the first \textit{chandra} and \textit{swift} x-ray study of thespiral galaxy ngc\,4088 and its ultraluminous x-ray source (ulx n4088--x1). wealso report very long baseline interferometry (vlbi) observations at 1.6 and 5ghz performed quasi-simultaneously with the \textit{swift} and \textit{chandra}observations, respectively. fifteen x-ray sources are detected by\textit{chandra} within the d25 ellipse of ngc\,4088, from which we derive thex-ray luminosity function (xlf) of this galaxy. we find the xlf is very similarto those of star-forming galaxies and estimate a star-formation rate of 4.5$m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. the \textit{chandra} detection of the ulx yields itsmost accurate x-ray position, which is spatially coincident with compact radioemission at 1.6 ghz. the ulx \textit{chandra} x-ray luminosity,$l_\mathrm{0.2-10.0 kev} = 3.4\ \times$ 10$^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$, indicates thatn4088--x1 could be located at the high-luminosity end of the high-mass x-raybinary (hmxb) population of ngc\,4088. the estimates of the black hole mass andratio of radio to x-ray luminosity of n4088--x1 rule out a supermassive blackhole nature. the \textit{swift} x-ray spectrum of n4088--x1 is best describedby a thermal comptonization model and presents a statistically significanthigh-energy cut-off. we conclude that n4088--x1 is most likely a stellarremnant black hole in a hmxb, probably fed by roche lobe overflow, residing ina super-eddington ultraluminous state. the 1.6 ghz vlbi source is consistentwith radio emission from possible ballistic jet ejections in this state.

astro-ph;0203176	the x-ray luminosity function of "the antennae" galaxies (ngc4038/39)  and the nature of ultra-luminous x-ray sources	we derive the x-ray luminosity function (xlf) of the x-ray source populationdetected in the chandra observation of ngc4038/39 (the antennae).  we explicitly include photon counting and spectral parameter uncertainties inour calculations. the cumulative xlf is well represented by a flat power law($\alpha=-0.47$), similar to those describing the xlfs of other star-formingsystems (e.g. m82, the disk of m81), but different from those of early typegalaxies. this result associates the x-ray source population in the antennaewith young high mass x-ray binaries. in comparison with less activelystar-forming galaxies, the xlf of the antennae has a highly significant excessof sources with luminosities above 10^{39} erg\s (ultra luminous sources;ulxs). we discuss the nature of these sources, based on the xlf and on theirgeneral spectral properties, as well as their optical counterparts discussed inpaper iii. we conclude that the majority of the ulxs cannot be intermediatemass black-holes (m &gt; 10-1000 \msun) binaries, unless they are linked to theremnants of massive population iii stars (the madau &amp; rees model). instead,their spatial and multiwavelength properties can be well explained by beamedemission as a consequence of supercritical accretion.  binaries with a neutron star or moderate mass black-hole (up to 20\msun), andb2 to a type star companions would be consistent with our data. in the beamingscenario, the xlf should exibit caracteristic breaks that will be visible infuture deeper observations of the antennae.

astro-ph;0211178	x-ray spectroscopic evidence for intermediate mass black holes: cool  accretion disks in two ultra--luminous x-ray sources	we have analyzed an xmm-newton observation of the nearby spiral galaxy ngc1313, which contains two "ultra-luminous" x-ray (ulx) sources. we measureisotropic luminosities of l_x = 2.0 * 10^(40) erg/s and l_x = 6.6 * 10^(39)erg/s for ngc 1313 x-1 and x-2 (0.2-10.0 kev, assuming a distance of 3.7 mpc).the spectra statistically require soft and hard spectral components to describethe continuum emission; some prior studies of ulxs have claimed cool softcomponents with lower statistics. the improvement over several single-componentmodels exceeds the 8 sigma level of confidence for x-1; the improvement for x-2is significant at the 3 sigma level. the soft components in these ulx spectraare well-fit by multi-color disk blackbody models with color temperatures of kt= 150 ev. this temperature differs markedly from those commonly measured in thespectra of stellar-mass (10 m_sun) black holes in their brightest states (kt ~1 kev). it is expected that the temperature of an accretion disk orbiting ablack hole should decrease with increasing black hole mass. if the softcomponents we measure are due to emission from the inner region of an accretiondisk, and disks extend close to the innermost stable circular orbit at theaccretion rates being probed, the low color temperatures may be interpreted asspectroscopic evidence of black holes with intermediate masses: m_bh ~ 10^(3)m_sun. simple eddington scaling arguments suggest a mimum mass of m_bh ~ 10^(2)m_sun. ngc 1313 x-1 and x-2 are found in optical nebulae (pakull and mirioni2002), which may indicate that anisotropic emission geometries are unlikely toaccount for the fluxes observed.

astro-ph;0211322	the nuclear accretion in the fr i radio galaxy ic4296 from chandra and  vlba observations	a high angular resolution study of the nucleus of the fr i galaxy ic4296using chandra acis-s and vlba observations is presented, with the aim ofstudying the nature of the accretion process. pointlike and hard x-ray emissionis found, well described by a moderately absorbed power law ofgamma=1.48^{+0.42}_{-0.34}; no iron fluorescence line from cold material isdetected. the 0.3-10 kev luminosity is 2.4\times 10^{41} erg/s, that is \sim400 times lower than the accretion luminosity resulting from the estimatedbondi mass accretion rate and a radiative efficiency of 10%. on the parsecscale a jet and a counter-jet extend out from a central unresolved ``core'' inthe 8.4 ghz image. their orientation is in good agreement with that of thelarge scale jets and their bulk speed is relativistic. the parsec scalespectrum is convex over 2-22 ghz. the observed nuclear luminosity is not likelyto be reconciled with the accretion luminosity by assuming that compton thickmaterial surrounds the nucleus. low radiative efficiency accretion flow models(adaf and its variants) cannot account for the observed emission and spectralshape of the nucleus in the radio band. the power in the jets accounts for asizable fraction (\ga 10%) of the accretion luminosity; therefore the massaccretion rate needs not to be much different from the estimate obtained usingbondi's theory. a jet dominated origin also for the observed radiative lossesof the nucleus is suggested. this could also explain the finding that a nuclearluminosity orders of magnitude lower than that of ``normal'' radio loud agns isaccompanied by a relatively higher radio emission.

astro-ph;0211438	rosat-hri investigation of the ngc 507 x-ray halo	we present an x-ray investigation of the elliptical galaxy ngc 507. we makeuse of archival rosat hri, pspc and chandra data, to connect the large-scalestructure of the halo to the core morphology. our analysis shows that the halocore (r&lt;2-3 r_e) and the external halo (r&gt;3 r_e) are characterised by differentdynamical properties and suggests a different origin of the two components. thehalo core has a complex morphology with a main x-ray emission peak, coincidentwith the center of the optical galaxy, and several secondary peaks. the spatialand spectral analysis of the central peak shows that this feature is producedby denser hot gas in the galaxy core. our data support the scenario where thegas is kinetically heated by stellar mass losses. comparison with previouslypublished studies suggest that the core of x-ray extended galaxies isassociated to the stellar distribution and has similar properties to the x-rayhalo of compact galaxies. the secondary peaks are due instead to interactionsbetween the radio-emitting plasma and the surrounding ism. we found that theenergy input by the central radio source in the ism may be large enough toprevent gas from cooling. the total mass profile shows the presence of a darkmatter halo extending on cluster scales which is likely to be associated withthe whole cluster rather than with ngc 507. this structure is typical of manyx-ray bright early-type galaxies and may explain the spatial and spectraldifferences with x-ray compact galaxies largely debated in literature. finallywe discuss the nature of the point sources detected in the hri fov.

astro-ph;0302535	xmm-newton spectroscopy of bright ulx sources in the antennae galaxies  (ngc 4038/4039)	we report the results of spectral fits to four bright ultra-luminous x-raysources (ulxs) in the antennae galaxies (ngc 4038/4039) observed for 41 ksecwith xmm-newton. although emission regions are not resolved as well as in priorchandra observations, at least four ulxs (x-11, x-16, x-37, and x-44 in thezezas and fabbiano scheme) are sufficiently bright and well-separated withxmm-newton that reliable extractions and spectral analyses are possible. wefind that the single component multi-color disk blackbody models cannotdescribe any of the spectra. sources x-11 and x-16 are acceptably fit withsimple power-law models. a thermal bremsstrahlung model provides a better fitto the spectrum of x-44. including a disk blackbody component to the spectrumof x-37 improves the fit and reveals an apparently cool disk (kt = 0.13 +/-0.02 kev). this would suggest a parallel to cool disks recently found in othervery luminous ulxs, which may contain intermediate mass black holes; however,the complex diffuse emission of the antennae demands this finding be regardedcautiously.

0705.3977	new flaring of an ultraluminous x-ray source in ngc 1365	we have studied a highly variable ultraluminous x-ray source (ulx) in thefornax galaxy ngc 1365, with a series of 12 chandra and xmm-newton observationsbetween 2002 and 2006. in 2006 april, the source peaked at a luminosity ~ 3 x10^{40} erg/s in the 0.3-10 kev band (similar to the maximum luminosity foundby asca in 1995), and declined on an e-folding timescale ~ 3 days. the x-rayspectrum is always dominated by a broad power-law-like component. when thesource is seen at x-ray luminosities ~ 10^{40} erg/s, an additional softthermal component (which we interpret as emission from the accretion disk)contributes ~ 1/4 of the x-ray flux; when the luminosity is higher, ~ 3 x10^{40} erg/s, the thermal component is not detected and must contribute &lt; 10%of the flux. at the beginning of the decline, ionized absorption is detectedaround 0.5-2 kev; it is a possible signature of a massive outflow. thepower-law is always hard, with a photon index gamma ~ 1.7 (and even flatter attimes), as is generally the case with bright ulxs. we speculate that thissource and perhaps most other bright ulxs are in a high/hard state: as theaccretion rate increases well above the eddington limit, more and more power isextracted from the inner region of the inflow through non-radiative channels,and is used to power a comptonizing corona, jet or wind. the observed thermalcomponent comes from the standard outer disk; the transition radius betweenouter standard disk and comptonizing inner region moves further out and tolower disk temperatures as the accretion rate increases. this produces theobserved appearance of a large, cool disk. based on x-ray luminosity andspectral arguments, we suggest that this accreting black hole has a likely mass~ 50-150 msun (even without accounting for possible beaming).

astro-ph;0304554	a variable ultraluminous supersoft x-ray source in "the antennae":  stellar-mass black hole or white dwarf?	the chandra monitoring observations of the antennae (ngc 4038/39) have led tothe discovery of a variable, luminous, supersoft source (sss). this source isonly detected at energies below 2 kev and, in 2002 may, reached count ratescomparable to those of the nine ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs) detected inthese galaxies. spectral fits of the sss data give acceptable results only fora $\sim$100--90 ev blackbody spectrum with an intrinsic absorption column of$n_{\rm h} \sim 2-3 \times 10^{21} \rm cm^{-2}$. for a distance of 19 mpc, thebest-fit observed luminosity increases from 1.7$\times 10^{38}$\ergs in 1999december to 8.0$\times 10^{38}$\ergs in 2002 may. the intrinsic,absorption-corrected best-fit luminosity reaches 1.4$\times 10^{40}$ \ergs in2002 may. the assumption of unbeamed emission would suggest a black hole of$\ga$100\msun. however, if the emission is blackbody at all times, as suggestedby the steep soft spectrum, the radiating area would have to vary by a factorof $\sim10^3$, inconsistent with gravitational energy release from within a fewschwarzschild radii of a black hole. viable explanations for the observedproperties of the sss are provided by anisotropic emission from either anaccreting nuclear-burning white dwarf or an accreting stellar-mass black hole.

astro-ph;0305345	ultra-luminous x-ray source populations in normal galaxies: a  preliminary survey with chandra	we present results of a chandra survey of the ultra-luminous x-ray sources(ulx) in 13 normal galaxies, in which we combine source detection with x-rayflux measurement. 22 ulx were detected, i.e. with l_x &gt; 1 x 10^{39} erg s^{-1}(l_10), and 39 other sources were detected with l_x &gt; 5 x 10^{38} erg s^{-1}(l_5). we also use radial intensity profiles to remove extended sources fromthe sample. the majority of sources are not extended, which for a typicaldistance constrains the emission region size to less than 50 pc. x-raycolour-colour diagrams and spectral fitting results were examined forindicators of the ulx nature. in the case of the brighter sources, spectralfitting generally requires two-component models. in only a few cases docolour-colour diagrams or spectral fitting provide evidence of black holenature. we find no evidence of a correlation with stellar mass, however thereis a strong correlation with star formation as indicated by the 60 micron fluxas found in previous studies.

astro-ph;0307142	an xmm-newton and chandra investigation of the nuclear accretion in the  sombrero galaxy (ngc4594)	we present an analysis of the xmm-newton and chandra acis-s observations ofthe liner nucleus of the sombrero galaxy and we discuss possible explanationsfor its very sub-eddington luminosity by complementing the x-ray results withhigh angular resolution observations in other bands. the x-ray investigationshows a hard (gamma=1.89) and moderately absorbed (n_h=1.8 10^21 cm^-2) nuclearsource of 1.5 10^40 erg s^-1 in the 2-10 kev band, surrounded by hot gas at atemperature of \sim 0.6 kev. the bolometric nuclear luminosity is at least \sim200 times lower than expected if mass accreted on the supermassive black hole,that hst shows to reside at the center of this galaxy, at the rate predicted bythe spherical and adiabatic bondi accretion theory and with the high radiativeefficiency of a standard accretion disc. the low luminosity, coupled to theobserved absence of fe-k emission in the nuclear spectrum, indicates that sucha disc is not present. this nucleus differs from bright unobscured agns alsofor the lack of high flux variability and of prominent broad halpha emission.however, it is also too faint for the predictions of simple radiativelyinefficient accretion taking place at the bondi rate; it could be too radiobright, instead, for radiatively inefficient accretion that includes strongmass outflows or convection. this discrepancy could be solved by the possiblepresence of nuclear radio jets. an alternative explanation of the lowluminosity, in place of radiative inefficiency, could be unsteady accretion.

astro-ph;0611615	neutron stars and black holes in star clusters	this article was co-authored by all invited speakers at the joint discussionon `neutron stars and black holes in star clusters,' which took place duringthe iau general assembly in prague, czech republic, on august 17 and 18, 2006.each section presents a short summary of recent developments in a key area ofresearch, incorporating the main ideas expressed during the corresponding paneldiscussion at the meeting. our meeting, which had close to 300 registeredparticipants, was broadly aimed at the large community of astronomers aroundthe world working on the formation and evolution of compact objects andinteracting binary systems in dense star clusters, such as globular clustersand galactic nuclei. great advances have occurred in this field during the pastfew years, including the introduction of fundamentally new theoreticalparadigms for the formation and evolution of compact objects in binaries aswell as countless new discoveries by astronomers that have challenged manyaccepted models. some of the highlights include: a nearly complete census ofall the millisecond pulsars in 47 tuc; first detections of many new radiopulsars in other clusters, particularly terzan 5; detailed studies of x-raybinary populations and their luminosity functions in many galaxies andextragalactic globular clusters; increasing evidence for intermediate-massblack holes in clusters and greatly improved theoretical understanding of theirpossible formation processes.

astro-ph;0701639	a deep chandra look at the low l_b elliptical ngc821: x-ray binaries, a  galactic wind and emission at the nucleus	the relatively nearby (distance=24.1 mpc) elliptical galaxy ngc821, hosting acentral massive black hole but inactive at all wavelengths, was observed withchandra for a total exposure of 230 ksec, to search for nuclear emission andgas available for accretion. within its optical image, 41 sources weredetected, with spectral properties typical of low mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs).the fractions of lmxbs in the field and in globular clusters were determined,together with their x-ray luminosity function (xlf) down to l(0.3-8kev)=2\times 10^{37} erg/s. at the galactic center a source of l(0.3-8kev)=6\times 10^{38} erg/s was detected for the first time, slightly extended.its spectral shape is quite hard (\gamma=1.49^{+0.14}_{-0.13}), withoutintrinsic absorption. it is surrounded by three sources with spectral shapetypical of lmxbs and luminosities on the brightest end of the xlf. one isconsistent with being pointlike; the others could be the superposition of fewpoint sources and/or truly diffuse emission, with one resembling a jet-likefeature. diffuse emission was detected out to r\sim 30'', and comes mostly fromunresolved lmxbs, with a minor contribution from other types of stellarsources. different lines of investigation consistently provide no evidence forhot gas. hydrodynamical simulations show that stellar mass losses are drivenout of ngc821 in a wind sustained by type ia supernovae, but also hot accretinggas within a very small inner region. a companion paper presents furtherobservational results from $spitzer$ and the vla, and possible accretionmodalities for this central massive black hole.

astro-ph;0701642	a deep chandra, vla and spitzer irac study of the very low luminosity  nucleus of the elliptical ngc821	the relatively nearby (distance=24.1 mpc) elliptical galaxy ngc821 hosts anextreme example of a quiescent central massive black hole, for which deepchandra observations revealed a nuclear source for the first time (with l(2-10kev)/l_edd ~ 3.6x10^{-8}). we present here a multiwavelength study of thisnucleus, including vla observations that detect a radio counterpart to thechandra nuclear source at 1.4 ghz, with a flux density of 127 $\mu$m andpossibly a flat spectral shape; we also consider new spitzer irac observationsand archival hst images. with these data we discuss possible scenarios for theaccretion modalities of the sole material that is available for fuelling, i.e.,the stellar mass losses steadily replenishing the circumnuclear region. thefinal stages of accretion could be radiatively inefficient and coupled to acompact nuclear jet/outfow. the stellar mass losses could instead end up in astandard disc only if a compton-thick agn is present. two extended sourcesdetected by chandra close to the nucleus could be due to several unresolvedknots in a jet. if a jet is present, though, its kinetic energy would be only avery small fraction of the energy associated with the rest mass of the materialbeing accreted. starformation close to the nucleus is not shown by theavailable data. deeper nicmos, radio and far-ir observations should furtherconstrain the accretion process.

astro-ph;9312046	the very-soft x-ray emission of x-ray faint early-type galaxies	a recent re-analysis of einstein data, and new rosat observations, haverevealed the presence of at least two components in the x-ray spectra of x-rayfaint early-type galaxies: a relatively hard component (kt&gt;1.5 kev), and a verysoft component (kt\sim 0.2-0.3 kev). we address the problem of the nature ofthe very soft component, and whether it can be due to a hot interstellar medium(ism), or is most likely originated by the collective emission of very softstellar sources. to this purpose, hydrodynamical evolutionary sequences for thesecular behavior of gas flows in ellipticals have been performed, and theresults are compared with the observational x-ray data: the very soft componentcould be entirely explained with a hot ism only in galaxies where the depth ofthe potential well is quite shallow, otherwise the softest contribution to thex-ray emission comes certainly from stellar sources. as stellar soft x-rayemitters, we consider late-type stellar corone, supersoft sources such as thosediscovered by rosat in the magellanic clouds and m31, and rscvn systems. wefinally present a model for the x-ray emission of ngc4365, to reproduce indetail the results of the rosat pointed observation (pspc spectrum and radialsurface brightness distribution).
