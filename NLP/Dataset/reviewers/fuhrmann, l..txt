0909.3484	agile detection of a rapid gamma-ray flare from the blazar pks 1510-089  during the gasp-webt monitoring	we report the detection by the agile satellite of a rapid gamma-ray flarefrom the powerful gamma-ray quasar pks 1510-089, during a pointing centered onthe galactic center region from 1 march to 30 march 2008. this source has beencontinuosly monitored in the radio-to-optical bands by the glast-agile supportprogram (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope (webt). moreover, thegamma-ray flaring episode triggered three too observations by the swiftsatellite in three consecutive days, starting from 20 march 2008. in the period1-16 march 2008, agile detected gamma-ray emission from pks 1510-089 at asignificance level of 6.2-sigma with an average flux over the entire period of(84 +/- 17) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} for photon energies above 100 mev.after a predefined satellite re-pointing, between 17 and 21 march 2008, agiledetected the source at a significance level of 7.3-sigma, with an average flux(e &gt; 100 mev) of (134 +/- 29) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} and a peak levelof (281 +/- 68) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} with daily integration. duringthe observing period january-april 2008, the source also showed an intense andvariable optical activity, with several flaring episodes and a significantincrease of the flux was observed at millimetric frequencies. moreover, in thex-ray band the swift/xrt observations seem to show an harder-when-brighterbehaviour of the source spectrum. the spectral energy distribution of mid-march2008 is modelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self compton emissionplus contributions from inverse compton scattering of external photons fromboth the accretion disc and the broad line region. indeed, some features in theoptical-uv spectrum seem to indicate the presence of seyfert-like components,such as the little blue bump and the big blue bump.

0909.4615	very long baseline array observations of the intraday variable source  j1128+592	short time-scale flux density variations of flat spectrum radio sources areoften explained by the scattering of radio waves in the turbulent, ionizedinterstellar matter of the milky way. one of the most convincing observationalarguments in favor of this is the annual modulation of the variabilitytime-scale caused by the earth orbital motion around the sun. j1128+592 is anidv source with a possible annual modulation in its variability time-scale. weobserved the source in 6 epochs with the vlba at 5, 8 and 15 ghz in totalintensity and polarization. the vlba observations revealed an east-westoriented core-jet structure. its position angle agrees with the angle ofanisotropy derived from the annual modulation model. no significant long-termstructural changes were observed with vlbi on mas-scales, however, compared toarchival data, the vlbi core size is expanded. this expansion offers a possibleexplanation to the observed decrease of the strength of idv. vlbi polarimetryrevealed significant changes in the electric vector position angle and rotationmeasure of the core and jet. part of the observed rm variability could beattributed to a scattering screen (37 pc distance), which covers the source(core and jet) and which may be responsible for the idv. superposition ofpolarized sub-components below the angular resolution limit may affect theobserved rm as well.

0912.2040	the spectral energy distribution of fermi bright blazars	(abridged) we have conducted a detailed investigation of the broad-bandspectral properties of the \gamma-ray selected blazars of the fermi lat brightagn sample (lbas). by combining our accurately estimated fermi gamma-rayspectra with swift, radio, infra-red, optical and other hard x-ray/gamma-raydata, collected within three months of the lbas data taking period, we wereable to assemble high-quality and quasi-simultaneous spectral energydistributions (sed) for 48 lbas blazars.the sed of these gamma-ray sources issimilar to that of blazars discovered at other wavelengths, clearly showing, inthe usual log $\nu $ - log $\nu$ f$_\nu$ representation, the typical broad-bandspectral signatures normally attributed to a combination of low-energysynchrotron radiation followed by inverse compton emission of one or morecomponents. we have used these seds to characterize the peak intensity of boththe low and the high-energy components. the results have been used to deriveempirical relationships that estimate the position of the two peaks from thebroad-band colors (i.e. the radio to optical and optical to x-ray spectralslopes) and from the gamma-ray spectral index. our data show that thesynchrotron peak frequency $\nu_p^s$ is positioned between 10$^{12.5}$ and10$^{14.5}$ hz in broad-lined fsrqs and between $10^{13}$ and $10^{17}$ hz infeatureless bl lacertae objects.we find that the gamma-ray spectral slope isstrongly correlated with the synchrotron peak energy and with the x-rayspectral index, as expected at first order in synchrotron - inverse comptonscenarios. however, simple homogeneous, one-zone, synchrotron self compton(ssc) models cannot explain most of our seds, especially in the case of fsrqsand low energy peaked (lbl) bl lacs.

1101.2047	planck early results. xv. spectral energy distributions and radio  continuum spectra of northern extragalactic radio sources	spectral energy distributions (seds) and radio continuum spectra arepresented for a northern sample of 104 extragalactic radio sources, based onthe planck early release compact source catalogue (ercsc) and simultaneousmultifrequency data. the nine planck frequencies, from 30 to 857 ghz, arecomplemented by a set of simultaneous observations ranging from radio togamma-rays. this is the first extensive frequency coverage in the radio andmillimetre domains for an essentially complete sample of extragalactic radiosources, and it shows how the individual shocks, each in their own phase ofdevelopment, shape the radio spectra as they move in the relativistic jet. theseds presented in this paper were fitted with second and third degreepolynomials to estimate the frequencies of the synchrotron and inverse compton(ic) peaks, and the spectral indices of low and high frequency radio data,including the planck ercsc data, were calculated. sed modelling methods arediscussed, with an emphasis on proper, physical modelling of the synchrotronbump using multiplecomponents. planck ercsc data also suggest that the originalaccelerated electron energy spectrum could be much harder than commonlythought, with power-law index around 1.5 instead of the canonical 2.5. theimplications of this are discussed for the acceleration mechanisms effective inblazar shock. furthermore in many cases the planck data indicate that gamma-rayemission must originate in the same shocks that produce the radio emission.

1103.3647	agile detection of extreme gamma-ray activity from the blazar pks  1510-089 during march 2009. multifrequency analysis	we report on the extreme gamma-ray activity from the fsrq pks 1510-089observed by agile in march 2009. in the same period a radio-to-opticalmonitoring of the source was provided by the gasp-webt and rem. moreover,several swift too observations were triggered, adding important information onthe source behaviour from optical/uv to hard x-rays. we paid particularattention to the calibration of the swift/uvot data to make it suitable to theblazars spectra. simultaneous observations from radio to gamma rays allowed usto study in detail the correlation among the emission variability at differentfrequencies and to investigate the mechanisms at work. in the period 9-30 march2009, agile detected an average gamma-ray flux of (311+/-21)x10^-8 ph cm^-2s^-1 for e&gt;100 mev, and a peak level of (702+/-131)x10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 ondaily integration. the gamma-ray activity occurred during a period ofincreasing activity from near-ir to uv, with a flaring episode detected on26-27 march 2009, suggesting that a single mechanism is responsible for theflux enhancement observed from near-ir to uv. by contrast, swift/xrtobservations seem to show no clear correlation of the x-ray fluxes with theoptical and gamma-ray ones. however, the x-ray observations show a harderphoton index (1.3-1.6) with respect to most fsrqs and a hint ofharder-when-brighter behaviour, indicating the possible presence of a secondemission component at soft x-ray energies. moreover, the broad band spectrumfrom radio-to-uv confirmed the evidence of thermal features in the optical/uvspectrum of pks 1510-089 also during high gamma-ray state. on the other hand,during 25-26 march 2009 a flat spectrum in the optical/uv energy band wasobserved, suggesting an important contribution of the synchrotron emission inthis part of the spectrum during the brightest gamma-ray flare, therefore asignificant shift of the synchrotron peak.

1108.1114	simultaneous planck, swift, and fermi observations of x-ray and  gamma-ray selected blazars	we present simultaneous planck, swift, fermi, and ground-based data for 105blazars belonging to three samples with flux limits in the soft x-ray, hardx-ray, and gamma-ray bands. our unique data set has allowed us to demonstratethat the selection method strongly influences the results, producing biasesthat cannot be ignored. almost all the bl lac objects have been detected byfermi-lat, whereas ~40% of the flat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs) in theradio, soft x-ray, and hard x-ray selected samples are still below thegamma-ray detection limit even after integrating 27 months of fermi-lat data.the radio to sub-mm spectral slope of blazars is quite flat up to ~70ghz, abovewhich it steepens to &lt;\alpha&gt;~-0.65. bl lacs have significantly flatter spectrathan fsrqs at higher frequencies. the distribution of the rest-framesynchrotron peak frequency (\nups) in the sed of fsrqs is the same in all theblazar samples with &lt;\nups&gt;=10^13.1 hz, while the mean inverse-compton peakfrequency, &lt;\nupic&gt;, ranges from 10^21 to 10^22 hz. the distributions of \nupsand of \nupic of bl lacs are much broader and are shifted to higher energiesthan those of fsrqs and strongly depend on the selection method. the comptondominance of blazars ranges from ~0.2 to ~100, with only fsrqs reaching values&gt;3. its distribution is broad and depends strongly on the selection method,with gamma-ray selected blazars peaking at ~7 or more, and radio-selectedblazars at values ~1, thus implying that the assumption that the blazar poweris dominated by high-energy emission is a selection effect. simple ssc modelscannot explain the seds of most of the gamma-ray detected blazars in allsamples. the sed of the blazars that were not detected by fermi-lat may insteadbe consistent with ssc emission. our data challenge the correlation betweenbolometric luminosity and \nups predicted by the blazar sequence.

1202.4242	f-gamma: on the phenomenological classification of continuum radio  spectra variability patterns of fermi blazars	the f-gamma program is a coordinated effort to investigate the physics ofactive galactic nuclei (agns) via multi-frequency monitoring of fermi blazars.in the current study we show and discuss the evolution of broad-band radiospectra, which are measured at ten frequencies between 2.64 and 142 ghz usingthe effelsberg 100-m and the iram 30-m telescopes. it is shown that any of the78 sources studied can be classified in terms of their variabilitycharacteristics in merely 5 types of variability. it is argued that these canbe attributed to only two classes of variability mechanisms. the first fourtypes are dominated by spectral evolution and can be described by a simpletwo-component system composed of: (a) a steep quiescent spectral component froma large scale jet and (b) a time evolving flare component following the"shock-in-jet" evolutionary path. the fifth type is characterised by anachromatic change of the broad band spectrum, which could be attributed to adifferent mechanism, likely involving differential doppler boosting caused bygeometrical effects. here we present the classification, the assumed physicalscenario and the results of calculations that have been performed for thespectral evolution of flares.

1204.0790	assessing the significance of apparent correlations between radio and  gamma-ray blazar fluxes	whether a correlation exists between the radio and gamma-ray flux densitiesof blazars is a long-standing question, and one that is difficult to answerconfidently because of various observational biases which may either dilute orapparently enhance any intrinsic correlation between radio and gamma-rayluminosities. we introduce a novel method of data randomization to evaluatequantitatively the effect of these biases and to assess the intrinsicsignificance of an apparent correlation between radio and gamma-ray fluxdensities of blazars. the novelty of the method lies in a combination of datarandomization in luminosity space (to ensure that the randomized data areintrinsically, and not just apparently, uncorrelated) and significanceassessment in flux space (to explicitly avoid malmquist bias and automaticallyaccount for the limited dynamical range in both frequencies). the method isapplicable even to small samples that are not selected with strict statisticalcriteria. for larger samples we describe a variation of the method in which thesample is split in redshift bins, and the randomization is applied in each binindividually; this variation is designed to yield the equivalent toluminosity-function sampling of the underlying population in the limit of verylarge, statistically complete samples. we show that for a smaller number ofredshift bins, the method yields a worse significance, and in this way it isconservative in that it does not assign a stronger, artificially enhancedsignificance. we demonstrate how our test performs as a function of number ofsources, strength of correlation, and number of redshift bins used, and we showthat while our test is robust against common-distance biases and associatedfalse positives for uncorrelated data, it retains the power of other methods inrejecting the null hypothesis of no correlation for correlated data.

1207.2932	multi-wavelength observations of blazar ao 0235+164 in the 2008-2009  flaring state	the blazar ao 0235+164 (z = 0.94) has been one of the most active objectsobserved by fermi large area telescope (lat) since its launch in summer 2008.in addition to the continuous coverage by fermi, contemporaneous observationswere carried out from the radio to {\gamma} -ray bands between 2008 septemberand 2009 february. in this paper, we summarize the rich multi-wavelength datacollected during the campaign (including f-gamma, gasp- webt, kanata, ovro,rxte, smarts, swift, and other instruments), examine the cross-correlationbetween the light curves measured in the different energy bands, and interpretthe resulting spectral energy distributions in the context of well-known blazaremission models. we find that the {\gamma} -ray activity is well correlatedwith a series of near-ir/optical flares, accompanied by an increase in theoptical polarization degree. on the other hand, the x-ray light curve shows adistinct 20 day high state of unusually soft spectrum, which does not match theextrapolation of the optical/uv synchrotron spectrum. we tentatively interpretthis feature as the bulk compton emission by cold electrons contained in thejet, which requires an accretion disk corona with an effective covering factorof 19% at a distance of 100 rg . we model the broadband spectra with a leptonicmodel with external radiation dominated by the infrared emission from the dustytorus.

1207.5942	multiwavelength intraday variability of the bl lac s5 0716+714	we report results from a 1 week multi-wavelength campaign to monitor the bllac object s5 0716+714 (on december 9-16, 2009). in the radio bands the sourceshows rapid (~ (0.5-1.5) day) intra-day variability with peak amplitudes of upto ~ 10 %. the variability at 2.8 cm leads by about 1 day the variability at 6cm and 11 cm. this time lag and more rapid variations suggests an intrinsiccontribution to the source's intraday variability at 2.8 cm, while at 6 cm and11 cm interstellar scintillation (iss) seems to predominate. large andquasi-sinusoidal variations of ~ 0.8 mag were detected in the v, r and i-bands.the x-ray data (0.2-10 kev) do not reveal significant variability on a 4 daytime scale, favoring reprocessed inverse-compton over synchrotron radiation inthis band. the characteristic variability time scales in radio and opticalbands are similar. a quasi-periodic variation (qpo) of 0.9 - 1.1 days in theoptical data may be present, but if so it is marginal and limited to 2.2cycles. cross-correlations between radio and optical are discussed. the lack ofa strong radio-optical correlation indicates different physical causes ofvariability (iss at long radio wavelengths, source intrinsic origin in theoptical), and is consistent with a high jet opacity and a compact synchrotroncomponent peaking at ~= 100 ghz in an ongoing very prominent flux densityoutburst. for the campaign period, we construct a quasi-simultaneous spectralenergy distribution (sed), including gamma-ray data from the fermi satellite.we obtain lower limits for the relativistic doppler-boosting of delta &gt;= 12-26,which for a bl\,lac type object, is remarkably high.

1209.5867	radio-to-gamma-ray monitoring of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy pmn  j0948+0022 from 2008 to 2011	we present more than three years of observations at different frequencies,from radio to high-energy gamma-rays, of the narrow-line seyfert 1 (nls1)galaxy pmn j0948+0022 (z=0.585). this source is the first nls1 detected atenergies above 100 mev and therefore can be considered the prototype of thisemerging new class of gamma-ray emitting active galactic nuclei (agn). theobservations performed from 2008 august 1 to 2011 december 31 confirmed thatpmn j0948+0022 generates a powerful relativistic jet, able to develop anisotropic luminosity at gamma-rays of the order of 10^48 erg s^-1, at the levelof powerful quasars. the evolution of the radiation emission of this source in2009 and 2010 followed the canonical expectations of relativistic jets, withcorrelated multiwavelength variability (gamma-rays followed by radio emissionafter a few months), but it was difficult to retrieve a similar pattern in thelight curves of 2011. the comparison of gamma-ray spectra before and including2011 data suggested that there was a softening of the high-energy spectralslope. we selected five specific epochs to be studied by modelling thebroad-band spectrum, characterised by an outburst at gamma-rays or verylow/high flux at other wavelengths. the observed variability can largely beexplained either by changes in the injected power, the bulk lorentz factor ofthe jet or the electron spectrum. the characteristic time scale ofdoubling/halving flux ranges from a few days to a few months, depending on thefrequency and the sampling rate. the shortest doubling time scale at gamma-raysis 2.3+-0.5 days. these small values underline the need of highly-sampledmultiwavelength campaigns to better understand the physics of these sources.

1211.2608	the simultaneous low state spectral energy distribution of 1es 2344+514  from radio to very high energies	[abridged] context. to construct and interpret the spectral energydistribution (sed) of bl lacertae objects, simultaneous broad-band observationsare mandatory. aims. we present the results of a dedicated multi-wavelengthstudy of the high-frequency peaked bl lacertae (hbl) object and known tevemitter 1es 2344+514 by means of a pre-organised campaign. methods. theobservations were conducted during simultaneous visibility windows of magic andagile in late 2008. the measurements were complemented by mets\"ahovi,ratan-600, kva+tuorla, swift and vlba pointings. additional coverage wasprovided by the ongoing long-term f-gamma and mojave programs, the ovro 40-mand crao telescopes as well as the fermi satellite. the obtained seds aremodelled using a one-zone as well as a self-consistent two-zone synchrotronself-compton model. results. 1es 2344+514 was found at very low flux states inboth x-rays and very high energy gamma rays. variability was detected in thelow frequency radio and x-ray bands only, where for the latter a small flarewas observed. the x-ray flare was possibly caused by shock accelerationcharacterised by similar cooling and acceleration time scales. mojave vlbamonitoring reveals a static jet whose components are stable over time scales ofeleven years, contrary to previous findings. there appears to be no significantcorrelation between the 15 ghz and r-band monitoring light curves. theobservations presented here constitute the first multi-wavelength campaign on1es 2344+514 from radio to vhe energies and one of the few simultaneous sedsduring low activity states. the quasi-simultaneous fermi-lat data poses somechallenges for sed modelling, but in general the seds are described well byboth applied models. the resulting parameters are typical for tev emittinghbls. consequently it remains unclear whether a so-called quiescent state wasfound in this campaign.

1301.7087	radio to gamma-ray variability study of blazar s5 0716+714	we present the results of a series of radio, optical, x-ray and gamma-rayobservations of the bl lac object s50716+714 carried out between april 2007 andjanuary 2011. the multi-frequency observations were obtained using severalground and space based facilities. the intense optical monitoring of the sourcereveals faster repetitive variations superimposed on a long-term variabilitytrend at a time scale of ~350 days. episodes of fast variability recur on timescales of ~ 60-70 days. the intense and simultaneous activity at optical andgamma-ray frequencies favors the ssc mechanism for the production of thehigh-energy emission. two major low-peaking radio flares were observed duringthis high optical/gamma-ray activity period. the radio flares are characterizedby a rising and a decaying stage and are in agreement with the formation of ashock and its evolution. we found that the evolution of the radio flaresrequires a geometrical variation in addition to intrinsic variations of thesource. different estimates yield a robust and self-consistent lower limits of\delta &gt; 20 and equipartition magnetic field b_eq &gt; 0.36 g. causality argumentsconstrain the size of emission region \theta &lt; 0.004 mas. we found asignificant correlation between flux variations at radio frequencies with thoseat optical and gamma-rays. the optical/gev flux variations lead the radiovariability by ~65 days. the longer time delays between low-peaking radiooutbursts and optical flares imply that optical flares are the precursors ofradio ones. an orphan x-ray flare challenges the simple, one-zone emissionmodels, rendering them too simple. here we also describe the spectral energydistribution modeling of the source from simultaneous data taken throughdifferent activity periods.

0705.0298	j1128+592: a highly variable idv source	short time-scale radio variations of compact extragalactic radio quasars andblazars known as intraday variability (idv) can be explained in at least somesources as a propagation effect; the variations are interpreted asscintillation of radio waves in the turbulent interstellar medium of the milkyway. one of the most convincing observational arguments in favor of apropagation-induced variability scenario is the observed annual modulation inthe characteristic time scale of the variation due to the earth's orbitalmotion. so far there are only two sources known with a well-constrainedseasonal cycle. annual modulation has been proposed for a few other lesswell-documented objects. however, for some other idv sources source-intrinsicstructural variations which cause drastic changes in the variability time scalewere also suggested. j1128+592 is a recently discovered, highly variable idvsource. previous, densely time-sampled flux-density measurements with theeffelsberg 100-m radio telescope (germany) and the urumqi 25-m radio telescope(china), strongly indicate an annual modulation of the time scale. the mostrecent 4 observations in 2006/7, however, do not fit well to the annualmodulation model proposed before. in this paper, we investigate a possibleexplanation of this discrepancy.

1305.5612	two-year monitoring of intra-day variability of quasar 1156+295 at 4.8  ghz	the quasar 1156+295 (4c +29.45) is one of the targets in the urumqimonitoring program which aimed to search for evidence of annual modulation inthe timescales of intra-day variable (idv) sources. the idv observations of1156+295 were carried out nearly monthly from october 2007 to october 2009,with the urumqi 25m radio telescope at 4.8 ghz. the source has shown prominentidv of total flux density in most observing sessions with variabilitytimescales of &lt;= 1 day at 4.8 ghz. the estimated idv timescales seem to followan annual cycle that can be fitted with an anisotropic interstellarscintillation (iss) model suggesting that a significant part of the fluxdensity variations is due to iss. the source underwent a dramatic flare in2008. we studied the possible consequences of the flare on the idv of 1156+295by comparing the changes in its idv characteristics with the evolution of the43 ghz very long baseline array (vlba) core size of the source. conclusions:the quasar 1156+295 shows evidence for an annual modulation of its idvtimescales at 4.8 ghz, the iss-induced idv timescales and variability strengthmight be affected by the overall activity state of the source core. morefrequent idv and vlbi measurements are required to confirm the relation betweenthe idv appearance and the core-size evolution of the source.

1307.0854	constraining the location of rapid gamma-ray flares in the fsrq 3c 273	we present a \gamma-ray photon flux and spectral variability study of theflat-spectrum radio quasar 3c 273 over a rapid flaring activity period betweenseptember 2009 to april 2010. five major flares are observed in the sourceduring this period. the most rapid flare observed in the source has a fluxdoubling time of 1.1 hr. the rapid \gamma-ray flares allow us to constrain thelocation and size of the \gamma-ray emission region in the source. the \gamma\gamma-opacity constrains the doppler factor, $\delta_{\gamma} \geq$ 10 for thehighest energy (15 gev) photon observed by the {\it fermi}-large area telescope(lat). causality arguments constrain the size of the emission region to1.6$\times 10^{15}$ cm. the \gamma-ray spectra measured over this period showclear deviations from a simple power law with a break in 1-2 gev energy range.we discuss possible explanations for the origin of the \gamma-ray spectralbreaks. our study suggests that the \gamma-ray emission region in 3c 273 islocated within the broad line region ($&lt;$1.6 pc). the spectral behavior andtemporal characteristics of the individual flares indicate the presence ofmultiple shock scenarios at the base of the jet.

1308.3709	multifrequency studies of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy sbs 0846+513	the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy sbs 0846+513 was first detected by the largearea telescope (lat) on-board fermi in 2011 june-july when it underwent aperiod of flaring activity. since then, as fermi continues to accumulate dataon this source, its flux has been monitored on a daily basis. two furthergamma-ray flaring episodes from sbs 0846+513 were observed in 2012 may andaugust, reaching a daily peak flux integrated above 100 mev of (50+/-12)x10^-8ph/cm^2/s, and (73+/-14)x10^-8 ph/cm^2/s on may 24 and august 7, respectively.three outbursts were detected at 15 ghz by the owens valley radio observatory40-m telescope in 2012 may, 2012 october, and 2013 january, suggesting acomplex connection with the gamma-ray activity. the most likely scenariosuggests that the 2012 may gamma-ray flare may not be directly related to theradio activity observed over the same period, while the two gamma-ray flaringepisodes may be related to the radio activity observed at 15 ghz in 2012october and 2013 january. the gamma-ray flare in 2012 may triggered swiftobservations that confirmed that sbs 0846+513 was also exhibiting high activityin the optical, uv and x-ray bands, thus providing a firm identificationbetween the gamma-ray source and the lower-energy counterpart. we compared thespectral energy distribution (sed) of the flaring state in 2012 may with thatof a quiescent state. the two seds, modelled as an external compton componentof seed photons from a dust torus, could be fitted by changing the electrondistribution parameters as well as the magnetic field. no significant evidenceof thermal emission from the accretion disc has been observed. interestingly,in the 5 ghz radio luminosity vs. synchrotron peak frequency plot sbs 0846+513seems to lie in the flat spectrum radio quasar part of the so-called `blazarsequence'.

1311.3304	the robopol optical polarization survey of gamma-ray - loud blazars	we present first results from robopol, a novel-design optical polarimeteroperating at the skinakas observatory in crete. the data, taken during the may- june 2013 commissioning of the instrument, constitute a single-epoch linearpolarization survey of a sample of gamma-ray - loud blazars, defined accordingto unbiased and objective selection criteria, easily reproducible insimulations, as well as a comparison sample of, otherwise similar, gamma-ray -quiet blazars. as such, the results of this survey are appropriate for bothphenomenological population studies and for tests of theoretical populationmodels. we have measured polarization fractions as low as $0.015$ down to $r$magnitude of 17 and as low as $0.035$ down to 18 magnitude. the hypothesis thatthe polarization fractions of gamma-ray - loud and gamma-ray - quiet blazarsare drawn from the same distribution is rejected at the $10^{-3}$ level. wetherefore conclude that gamma-ray - loud and gamma-ray - quiet sources havedifferent optical polarization properties. this is the first time thisstatistical difference is demonstrated in optical wavelengths. the polarizationfraction distributions of both samples are well-described by exponentialdistributions with averages of $\langle p \rangle =6.4 ^{+0.9}_{-0.8}\times10^{-2}$ for gamma-ray--loud blazars, and $\langle p \rangle =3.2^{+2.0}_{-1.1}\times 10^{-2}$ for gamma-ray--quiet blazars. the most probablevalue for the difference of the means is $3.4^{+1.5}_{-2.0}\times 10^{-2}$. thedistribution of polarization angles is statistically consistent with beinguniform.

1401.2151	two active states of the narrow-line gamma-ray-loud agn gb 1310+487	previously unremarkable, the extragalactic radio source gb 1310+487 showed agamma-ray flare on 2009 november 18, reaching a daily flux of ~10^-6photons/cm^2/s at energies e&gt;100 mev and becoming one of the brightest gevsources for about two weeks. its optical spectrum is not typical for a blazar,instead, it resembles those of narrow emission-line galaxies. we investigatechanges of the object's radio-to-gev spectral energy distribution (sed) duringand after the prominent gev flare with the aim to determine the nature of theobject and constrain the origin of the variable high-energy emission. the datacollected by the fermi and agile satellites at gamma-ray energies, swift atx-ray and ultraviolet, kanata, not, and keck telescopes at optical, oagh andwise at infrared, and iram 30m, ovro 40m, effelsberg 100m, ratan-600, and vlbaat radio, are analysed together to trace the sed evolution on timescales ofmonths. the gamma-ray/radio-loud narrow-line active galactic nucleus (agn) islocated at redshift z=0.638. it is shining through an unrelated foregroundgalaxy at z=0.500. the agn light is likely amplified by a factor of a fewbecause of gravitational lensing. the agn sed shows a two-humped structuretypical of blazars and gamma-ray-loud nlsy1 galaxies, with the high-energy(inverse-compton) emission dominating by more than an order of magnitude overthe low-energy (synchrotron) emission during gamma-ray flares. the differencebetween the two sed humps is smaller during the low-activity state. fermiobservations reveal a strong correlation between the gamma-ray flux andspectral index, with the hardest spectrum observed during the brightestgamma-ray state. if the gamma-ray flux is a mixture of synchrotron self-compton(ssc) and external compton (ec) emission, the observed gev spectral variabilitymay result from varying relative contributions of these two emissioncomponents.

1408.6264	time-correlation between the radio and gamma-ray activity in blazars and  the production site of the gamma-ray emission	in order to determine the location of the gamma-ray emission site in blazars,we investigate the time-domain relationship between their radio and gamma-rayemission. light-curves for the brightest detected blazars from the first 3years of the mission of the fermi gamma-ray space telescope arecross-correlated with 4 years of 15ghz observations from the ovro 40-mmonitoring program. the large sample and long light-curve duration enable us tocarry out a statistically robust analysis of the significance of thecross-correlations, which is investigated using monte carlo simulationsincluding the uneven sampling and noise properties of the light-curves.modeling the light-curves as red noise processes with power-law power spectraldensities, we find that only one of 41 sources with high quality data in bothbands shows correlations with significance larger than 3-sigma (ao 0235+164),with only two more larger than even 2.25-sigma (pks 1502+106 and b2 2308+34).additionally, we find correlated variability in mrk 421 when including a strongflare that occurred in july-september 2012. these results demonstrate veryclearly the difficulty of measuring statistically robust multiwavelengthcorrelations and the care needed when comparing light-curves even when manyyears of data are used. this should be a caution. in all four sources the radiovariations lag the gamma-ray variations, suggesting that the gamma-ray emissionoriginates upstream of the radio emission. continuous simultaneous monitoringover a longer time period is required to obtain high significance levels incross-correlations between gamma-ray and radio variability in most blazars.

1409.3716	properties of flat-spectrum radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies	we have conducted a multiwavelength survey of 42 radio loud narrow-1ineseyfert 1 galaxies (rlnls1s), selected by searching among all the known sourcesof this type and omitting those with steep radio spectra. we analyse data fromradio frequencies to x-rays, and supplement these with information availablefrom online catalogs and the literature in order to cover the fullelectromagnetic spectrum. this is the largest known multiwavelength survey forthis type of source. we detected 90% of the sources in x-rays and found 17% atgamma rays. extreme variability at high energies was also found, down totimescales as short as hours. in some sources, dramatic spectral and fluxchanges suggest interplay between a relativistic jet and the accretion disk.the estimated masses of the central black holes are in the range $\sim10^{6-8}m_{\odot}$, smaller than those of blazars, while the accretionluminosities span a range from $\sim 0.01$ to $\sim 0.49$ times the eddingtonlimit, with an outlier at $0.003$. the distribution of the calculated jet powerspans a range from $\sim 10^{42.6}$ to $\sim 10^{45.6}$ erg s$^{-1}$, generallylower than quasars and bl lac objects, but partially overlapping with thelatter. once normalised by the mass of the central black holes, the jet powerof the three types of active galactic nuclei are consistent with each other,indicating the scalability of the jet. despite the observational differences,the central engine of rlnls1s is apparently quite similar to that of blazars.the historical difficulties in finding radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1galaxies might be due to their low power and to intermittent jet activity.

1409.7396	galaxy evolution across the optical emission-line diagnostic diagrams?	the discovery of the m-sigma relation, the local galaxy bimodality, and thelink between black-hole and host-galaxy properties, have raised the questionwhether agn play a role in galaxy evolution. several theoretical modelsimplement agn feedback to explain the observed galaxy luminosity function, andpossibly the color and morphological transformation of spiral galaxies intopassive ellipticals. to understand the importance of agn feedback, a study ofthe agn populations in the radio-optical domain is crucial. a mass sequencelinking star-forming galaxies and agn has been already noted in previous works,and it is now investigated as possible evolutionary sequence. we observed asample of 119 intermediate-redshift (0.04&lt;z&lt;0.4) sdss-first radio emitters withthe effelsberg 100-m telescope at 4.85 and 10.45 ghz and obtained spectralindices. we find indications of spectral index flattening in high-metallicitystar-forming galaxies, composite galaxies, and seyferts. this "flatteningsequence" along the [nii]-based emission-line diagnostic diagram is consistentwith the hardening of galaxy ionizing field, due to nuclear activity. aftercombining our data with first measurements at 1.4 ghz, we find that thethree-point radio spectra of seyferts and liners show substantial differences,attributable to small radio core components and larger (arcsecond sized)jet/lobe components, respectively. a visual inspection of first images seems toconfirm this hypothesis. galaxies along this sequence are hypothesized to betransitioning from the active star-forming galaxies (blue cloud) to the passiveelliptical galaxies (red sequence). this supports the suggestion that agn playa role in shutting down star-formation, and allow the transition from onegalaxy class to the other.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1412.7194	multi-frequency properties of synthetic blazar radio light curves within  the shock-in-jet scenario	blazars are among the most powerful extragalactic objects, as a sub-class ofactive galactic nuclei. they launch relativistic jets and their emittedradiation shows strong variability across the entire electro-magnetic spectrum.the mechanisms producing the variability are still controversial and differentmodels have been proposed to explain the observed variations in multi-frequencyblazar light curves.we investigate the capabilities of the classicalshock-in-jet model to explain and reconstruct the observed evolution of flaresin the turnover frequency turnover flux density plane and theirfrequency-dependent light curve parameters. with a detailed parameter spacestudy we provide the framework for future, detailed comparisons of observedflare signatures with the shock-in-jet scenario. based on the shock model wecompute synthetic single-dish light curves at different radio frequencies (2.6to 345 ghz) and for different physical conditions in a conical jet (e.g.magnetic field geometry and doppler factor). from those we extract the slopesof the different energy loss stages within the $\nu_\mathrm{m}$-$s_\mathrm{m}$plane and deduce the frequency-dependence of different light curve parameterssuch as flare amplitude, time scale and cross-band delays. the evolution of thedoppler factor along the jet has the largest influence on the evolution of theflare and on the frequency-dependent light curve parameters. the synchrotronstage can be hidden in the compton or in the adiabatic stage, depending mainlyon the evolution of the doppler factor, which makes it difficult to detect itssignature in observations. in addition, we show that the time lags betweendifferent frequencies can be used as an efficient tool to better constrain thephysical properties of these objects.

1501.02158	radio jet emission from gev-emitting narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies	we studied the radio emission from four radio-loud and gamma-ray-loudnarrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies. the goal was to investigate whether arelativistic jet is operating at the source, and quantify its characteristics.we relied on the most systematic monitoring of such system in the cm and mmradio bands which is conducted with the effelsberg 100 m and iram 30 mtelescopes and covers the longest time-baselines and the most radio frequenciesto date. we extract variability parameters and compute variability brightnesstemperatures and doppler factors. the jet powers were computed from the lightcurves to estimate the energy output. the dynamics of radio spectral energydistributions were examined to understand the mechanism causing thevariability. all the sources display intensive variability that occurs at apace faster than what is commonly seen in blazars. the flaring events showintensive spectral evolution indicative of shock evolution. the brightnesstemperatures and doppler factors are moderate, implying a mildly relativisticjet. the computed jet powers show very energetic flows. the radio polarisationin one case clearly implies a quiescent jet underlying the recursive flaringactivity. despite the generally lower flux densities, the sources appear toshow all typical characteristics seen in blazars that are powered byrelativistic jets.

1501.06054	the third catalog of active galactic nuclei detected by the fermi large  area telescope	the third catalog of active galactic nuclei (agns) detected by the fermi-lat(3lac) is presented. it is based on the third fermi-lat catalog (3fgl) ofsources detected between 100 mev and 300 gev with a test statistic (ts) greaterthan 25, between 2008 august 4 and 2012 july 31. the 3lac includes 1591 agnslocated at high galactic latitudes (|b|&gt;10{\deg}), a 71% increase over thesecond catalog based on 2 years of data. there are 28 duplicate associations,thus 1563 of the 2192 high-latitude gamma-ray sources of the 3fgl catalog areagns. most of them (98%) are blazars. about half of the newly detected blazarsare of unknown type, i.e., they lack spectroscopic information of sufficientquality to determine the strength of their emission lines. based on theirgamma-ray spectral properties, these sources are evenly split betweenflat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs) and bl~lacs. the most abundant detectedbl~lacs are of the high-synchrotron-peaked (hsp) type. about 50% of the bl~lacshave no measured redshifts. a few new rare outliers (hsp-fsrqs andhigh-luminosity hsp bl~lacs) are reported. the general properties of the 3lacsample confirm previous findings from earlier catalogs. the fraction of 3lacblazars in the total population of blazars listed in bzcat remainsnon-negligible even at the faint ends of the bzcat-blazar radio, optical andx-ray flux distributions, which is a clue that even the faintest known blazarscould eventually shine in gamma rays at lat-detection levels. the energy-fluxdistributions of the different blazar populations are in good agreement withextrapolation from earlier catalogs.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

1503.04218	connection between inner jet kinematics and broadband flux variability  in the bl lac object s5 0716+714	we present a high-frequency very long baseline interferometry (vlbi)kinematical study of the bl lac object s5 0716+714 over the time period ofseptember 2008 to october 2010. the aim of the study is to investigate therelation of the jet kinematics to the observed broadband flux variability. wefind significant non-radial motions in the jet outflow of the source. in theradial direction, the highest measured apparent speed is \sim37 c, which isexceptionally high, especially for a bl lac object. patterns in the jet flowreveal a roughly stationary feature \sim0.15 mas downstream of the core. thelong-term fits to the component trajectories reveal acceleration in the sub-masregion of the jet. the measured brightness temperature, t_{b}, follows acontinuous trend of decline with distance, t_b \proptor_{jet}^{-(2.36\pm0.41)}, which suggests a gradient in doppler factor along thejet axis. our analysis suggest that a moving disturbance (or a shock wave) fromthe base of the jet produces the high-energy (optical to \gamma-ray) variationsupstream of the 7 mm core, and then later causes an outburst in the core.repetitive optical/\gamma-ray flares and the curved trajectories of theassociated components suggest that the shock front propagates along a benttrajectory or helical path. sharper \gamma-ray flares could be related to thepassage of moving disturbances through the stationary feature. our analysissuggests that the \gamma-ray and radio emission regions have different dopplerfactors.

1504.02314	localizing the $\gamma$ rays from blazar pks 1502+106	blazars are among the most variable objects in the universe. they featureenergetic jets of plasma that launch from the cores of these active galacticnuclei (agn), triggering activity from radio up to gamma-ray energies. spatiallocalization of the region of their mev/gev emission is a key question inunderstanding the blazar phenomenon.  the flat spectrum radio quasar (fsrq) pks 1502+106 has exhibited extreme andcorrelated, radio and high-energy activity that triggered intense monitoring bythe fermi-gst agn multi-frequency monitoring alliance (f-gamma) program and theglobal millimeter vlbi array (gmva) down to $\lambda$3 mm (or 86 ghz), enablingthe sharpest view to date towards this extreme object.  here, we report on preliminary results of our study of the gamma-ray loudblazar pks 1502+106, combining vlbi and single dish data. we deduce thecritical aspect angle towards the source to be $\theta_{\rm c} = 2.6^{\circ}$,calculate the apparent and intrinsic opening angles and constrain the distanceof the 86 ghz core from the base of the conical jet, directly from mm-vlbi butalso through a single dish relative timing analysis.  finally, we conclude that gamma rays from pks 1502+106 originate from aregion between ~1-16 pc away from the base of the hypothesized conical jet,well beyond the bulk of broad-line region (blr) material of the source.

1504.04141	intra-day variability observations and the vlbi structure analysis of  quasar s4 0917+624	the idv observations of s4 0917+624 were carried out monthly, from august2005 to january 2010, with the urumqi 25m radio telescope at 4.8 ghz. thequasar s4 0917+624 exhibits only very weak or no idv during our 4.5 yearobserving interval. prior to the year 2000, the source s4 0917+624 was one ofthe most prominent idv sources. our new data indicate that the previous strongidv has ceased. we analyzed the long-term vlbi structural variability usinggaussian model-fitting. from this we obtained the flux densities and thedeconvolved sizes of core and inner-jet components of the source. we studiedthe properties such as core fraction, angular size, spectral index, andbrightness temperature of vlbi core for s4 0917+624, as well as the time delaybetween 5 and 15 ghz variations, and compared them with the idv properties ofs4 0917+624. the source shows ejection of several jet components that aresuspected to have partially reduced the idv amplitude of s4 0917+624. however,during 2005-2006, the vlbi core size was comparable to the size before the year2000, but no strong idv was detected in the period, suggesting that thequenching effect due to source size changes may not be responsible for the lackof strong idv after the year 2000. the refractive scattering properties for thestrong idv phase of s4 0917+624 before the year 2000 are discussed. thedisappearance of strong idv in s4 0917+624 after the year 2000 is a mystery andcannot be explained via the quenching effect by changes in the observable vlbistructure. however, it may be caused by changes in the interstellar medium,i.e. by interstellar weather, which induces changes in the scintillationpattern on timescales of several years. further coordinated multi-frequencyobservations will be required to distinguish between the effect ofsource-intrinsic variability and changing properties of the interstellarmedium.

0704.0871	the idv source j1128+5925, a new candidate for annual modulation?	short time-scale radio variations of compact extragalactic radio sources,known as intraday variability, can be explained in at least some sources by asource-extrinsic effect, in which the variations are interpreted asscintillation of radio waves caused by the turbulent ism of the milky way. oneof the most convincing observational arguments in favour of propagation-inducedvariability is the so called annual modulation of the characteristicvariability time-scale, which is due to the orbital motion of the earth. datafor the recently discovered and highly variable idv source j1128+5925 arepresented. we study the frequency and time dependence of the idv in thiscompact quasar. we measure the characteristic variability time-scale of the idvthroughout the year, and analyze whether the observed changes in thevariability time-scale are consistent with annual modulation. we monitored theflux density variability of j1128+5925 with dense time sampling between 2.7 and10.45ghz with the 100m effelsberg radio telescope of the mpifr and with the 25murumqi radio telescope. from ten observing sessions, we determine thevariability characteristics and time-scales. the observed pronounced changes ofthe variability time-scale of j1128+5925 are modelled with an anisotropicannual modulation model. the observed frequency dependence of the variation isin good agreement with the prediction from interstellar scintillation. adoptinga simple model for the annual modulation model and using also the frequencydependence of the idv, we derive a lower limit to the distance of thescattering screen and an upper limit to the scintillating source size. thelatter is found to be consistent with the measured core size from vlbi.

astro-ph;0603364	x-ray emission from the blazar ao 0235+16: the xmm-newton and chandra  point of view	in this paper we analyse five observations of the bl lac object ao 0235+16performed with the chandra and xmm-newton satellites during the years2000-2005. in the february 2002 observation the source is found in a brightstate and presents a steep x-ray spectrum, while in all the other epochs it isfaint and the spectrum is hard. the soft x-ray spectrum appears to be stronglyabsorbed, likely by the intervening system at z=0.524, which also absorbs theoptical-uv radiation. we find that models that consider spectral curvature aresuperior to single power law ones in fitting the x-ray spectrum. in particular,we favour a double power law model, which agrees with the assumption of asuperposition of two different components in the x-ray domain. both in thechandra and in one of the xmm-newton observations, a tentative detection of theredshifted fe kalpha emission line may suggest its origin from the inner partof an accretion disc. thermal emission from this accretion disc might explainthe uv-soft-x-ray bump that appears in the spectral energy distributions, whenthe x-ray spectra are complemented with the optical-uv data from the opticalmonitor onboard xmm-newton. more likely, the bump can be interpreted in termsof an additional synchrotron component emitted from an inner region of the jetwith respect to that where the lower-energy emission comes from. an inspectionof the x-ray light curves reveals that intraday variability occurs only whenthe source is in a bright state.

astro-ph;0606049	testing the inverse-compton catastrophe scenario in the intra-day  variable blazar s5 0716+71: ii. a search for intra-day variability at  millimetre wavelengths with the iram 30 m telescope	we report on a densely time sampled polarimetric flux density monitoring ofthe bl lac object s5 0716+71 at 86 ghz and 229 ghz with the iram 30 m telescopewithin a coordinated broad spectral band campaign, centred around an integralobservation during november 10 to 16, 2003. our aim was to search forsignatures of inverse-compton "catastrophes". at 86 ghz, making use of a newcalibration strategy, we reach a relative rms accuracy of the flux densitymeasurements of 1.2%. at this frequency, s5 0716+71 showed no intra-dayvariability, but showed remarkable inter-day variability with a flux densityincrease of 34% during the first four observing days, which can not beexplained by source extrinsic causes. the 86 ghz linear polarization fractionof s5 0716+71 was unusually large 15.0+-1.8%. inter-day variability in linearpolarization at 86 ghz, with significance level &gt;~95%; sigma_p/&lt;p&gt;=15% andsigma_chi=6 deg., was also observed. from the emission variations at thesynchrotron turnover frequency (~86 ghz) we compute an apparent brightnesstemperature t_b,app&gt;1.4x10^14k at a redshift of 0.3, which exceeds by twoorders of magnitude the inverse-compton limit. a relativistic correction fort_b,app with a doppler factor delta &gt; 7.8 brings the observed brightnesstemperature down to the inverse compton limit. a more accurate lower limit ofdelta &gt; 14.0, is obtained from the comparison of the 86 ghz synchrotron fluxdensity and the upper limits for the synchrotron self-compton flux densityobtained from the integral observations. the relativistic beaming of theemission by this high doppler factor explains the non-detection of"catastrophic" inverse-compton avalanches by integral.

astro-ph;0606319	swift and infra-red observations of the blazar 3c~454.3 during the giant  x-ray flare of may 2005	we present the results of a series of swift and quasi simultaneousground-based infra-red observations of the blazar 3c 454.3 carried out inapril-may 2005 when the source was 10 to 30 times brighter than previouslyobserved. we found 3c 454.3 to be very bright and variable at all frequenciescovered by our instrumentation. the broad-band spectral energy distribution(sed) shows the usual two-bump shape (in nu-nu f(nu) space) with the infra-red,optical and uv data sampling the declining part of the synchrotron emissionthat, even during this extremely large outburst, had its maximum in thefar-infrared. the x-ray spectral data from the xrt and bat instruments are flatand due to inverse compton emission. the remarkable sed observed implies thatat the time of the swift pointings 3c 454.3 was one of the brightest objects inthe extragalactic sky with a gamma-ray emission similar or brighter than thatof 3c 279 when observed in a high state by egret. time variability in theoptical-uv flux is very different from that in the x-ray data: while the firstcomponent varied by about a factor two within a single exposure, but remainedapproximately constant between different observations, the inverse comptoncomponent did not vary on short time-scales but changed by more than a factorof 3 between observations separated by a few days. this different dynamicalbehaviour illustrates the need to collect simultaneous multi-frequency dataover a wide range of time-scales to fully constrain physical parameters inblazars.

astro-ph;0610795	kinematic studies of the idv quasar 0917+624	for more than a decade from the late 1980s to the late 1990s, the intradayvariable (idv) quasar 0917+624 was known to be strongly variable with amplitudevariations of 10-20% within 0.8 to 1.6 days. during that period it showedfaster variability in the polarized flux and the polarization angle than intotal intensity. however, since 2000 the idv of this source has almost ceased,attaining a variability index of only less than a few percent. if interstellarscintillation was responsible for the idv in the past, one possible explanationfor the sudden change of the variability mode could be an intrinsic change inthe morphology of the source, such as an increase in the size of the structuralcomponents that are responsible for the scintillation. new jet componentsappearing at the jet base could lead to a temporarily larger size of thescintillating component when compared to the scattering size of theinterstellar medium, causing quenched scintillation. in order to test thisscenario, vlbi observations of 0917+624 from 1999 to 2005 have been analysed.here, we summarize first results and discuss them in the framework of thequenched scintillation model.

astro-ph;0611391	rapid and correlated variability of blazar s5 0716+71 from radio- to  sub-mm bands	the bl lac object s5 0716+71 was target of a coordinated and globalmulti-frequency campaign to search for rapid and correlated variability andsignatures of the inverse-compton catastrophe. here we present first resultsobtained from a combined analysis of the cm- to sub-mm observations over aperiod of seven days aiming at a detailed study of the intra- to inter-dayvariability characteristics and to obtain constraints on the variabilitybrightness temperatures and doppler factors comparing the radio data with thehigh energy emission recorded by integral. a more detailed description of thewhole cm- to sub-mm observations and our analysis/results will be presented ina forthcoming paper. our analysis reveals the source to be in a particularshort-term variability phase when compared to the past with a correlated &gt;~4day time scale amplitude increase of up to 35%, which is systematically morepronounced towards higher frequencies. the obtained frequency dependentvariability amplitudes and time lags contradict expectations from interstellarscintillation and strongly suggest a source intrinsic origin of this inter-dayvariability. a 7-day spectral evolution study indicate time-variablesynchrotron self-absorption and expansion of the emission region, consistentwith standard models. assuming relativistic boosting, our different estimatesof the doppler factor yield robust lower limits of d_var,ic &gt; 5-22 using theinverse-compton limit and d_var,eq &gt; 8-33 using the equipartition argument.although high, these values are in good agreement with doppler factors obtainedfrom recent vlbi studies and from the inverse-compton doppler factors d_ic &gt;14-16 derived with the x-ray emission seen by integral at 3-200 kev.

astro-ph;0612149	multi-frequency monitoring of gamma-ray loud blazars: i. light curves  and spectral energy distributions	context: being dominated by non-thermal emission from aligned relativisticjets, blazars allow us to elucidate the physics of extragalactic jets, and,ltimately, how the energy is extracted from the central black hole inradio-loud active galactic nuclei. aims: crucial information is provided bybroad-band spectral energy distributions (seds), their trends with luminosityand correlated multi-frequency variability. with this study we plan to obtain adatabase of contemporaneous radio-to-optical spectra of a sample of blazars,which are and will be observed by current and future high-energy satellites.methods: since december 2004 we are performing a monthly multi-frequency radiomonitoring of a sample of 35 blazars at the antennas in medicina and noto.contemporaneous near-ir and optical observations for all our observing epochsare organised. results: until june 2006 about 4000 radio measurements and 5500near-ir and optical measurements were obtained. most of the sources showsignificant variability in all observing bands. here we present themulti-frequency data acquired during the first eighteen months of the project,and construct the seds for the best-sampled sources.

0809.2227	testing the inverse-compton catastrophe scenario in the intra-day  variable blazar s5 0716+71, iii. rapid and correlated flux density  variability from radio to sub-mm bands	the bl lac object s5 0716+71 was observed in a global multi-frequencycampaign to search for rapid and correlated flux density variability andsignatures of an inverse-compton (ic) catastrophe during the states of extremeapparent brightness temperatures. the observing campaign involved simultaneousmonitoring at radio to ir/optical wavelengths centered around a 500-ks integralpointing (november 10-17, 2003). we present the combined analysis and resultsof the cm- to sub-mm observations including a detailed study of the inter- tointra-day variability and spectral characteristics of 0716+714. we furtherconstrain the variability brightness temperatures (t_b) and doppler factors(delta) comparing the radio-bands with the hard x-ray emission (3-200 kev).0716+714 was in an exceptionally high state (outburst) and different (slower)phase of short-term variability. the flux density variability in the cm- tomm-bands is dominated by a correlated, ~4 day time scale amplitude increase ofup to ~35% systematically more pronounced towards shorter wavelengths. thiscontradicts expectations from standard interstellar scintillation (iss) andsuggests a source-intrinsic origin of the variability. the derived lower limitsto t_b exceed the 10^12 k ic-limit by up to 3-4 orders of magnitude. assumingrelativistic boosting, we obtain robust and self-consistent lower limits ofdelta &gt;= 5-33, in good agreement with delta_vlbi obtained from vlbi studies andthe ic-doppler factors delta_ic &gt; 14-16 obtained from the integral data. sincea strong contribution from iss can be excluded and a simultaneous iccatastrophe was not observed, we conclude that relativistic doppler boostingnaturally explains the apparent violation of the theoretical limits withinstandard synchrotron-self-compton (ssc) jet models of agn.
