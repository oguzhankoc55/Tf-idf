0904.4498	goals: the great observatories all-sky lirg survey	the great observatories all-sky lirg survey (goals) combines data from nasa'sspitzer, chandra, hubble and galex observatories, together with ground-baseddata into a comprehensive imaging and spectroscopic survey of over 200 lowredshift luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs). the lirgs are a complete subset ofthe iras revised bright galaxy sample (rbgs). the lirgs targeted in goals spanthe full range of nuclear spectral types defined via traditional opticalline-ratio diagrams as well as interaction stages. they provide an unbiasedpicture of the processes responsible for enhanced infrared emission in galaxiesin the local universe. as an example of the analytic power of themulti-wavelength goals dataset, we present data for the interacting system vv340 (iras f14547+2449). between 80-95% of the total far-infrared emission (orabout 5e11 solar luminosities) originates in vv 340 north. while the iraccolors of vv 340 north and south are consistent with star-forming galaxies,both the spitzer irs and chandra acis data indicate the presence of a buriedagn in vv 340 north. the galex far and near-uv fluxes imply a extremely largeinfrared "excess" (irx) for the system (ir/fuv = 81) which is well above thecorrelation seen in starburst galaxies. most of this excess is driven by vv 340n, which alone has an ir excess of nearly 400. the vv 340 system seems to becomprised of two very different galaxies - an infrared luminous edge-on galaxy(vv 340 north) that dominates the long-wavelength emission from the system andwhich hosts a buried agn, and a face-on starburst (vv 340 south) that dominatesthe short-wavelength emission.

0707.0395	warm molecular hydrogen in the spitzer sings galaxy sample	(simplified) results on the properties of warm h2 in 57 normal galaxies arederived from h2 rotational transitions, obtained as part of sings. this studyextends previous extragalactic surveys of h2, the most abundant constituent ofthe molecular ism, to more common systems (l_fir = e7 to 6e10 l_sun) of allmorphological and nuclear types. the s(1) transition is securely detected inthe nuclear regions of 86% of sings galaxies with stellar masses above 10^9.5m_sun. the derived column densities of warm h2 (t &gt; ~100 k), even thoughaveraged over kiloparsec-scale areas, are commensurate with those of resolvedpdrs; the median of the sample is 3e20 cm-2. they amount to between 1% and &gt;30%of the total h2. the power emitted in the sum of the s(0) to s(2) transitionsis on average 30% of the [siii] line power, and ~4e-4 of the total infraredpower (tir) within the same area for star-forming galaxies, which is consistentwith excitation in pdrs. the fact that h2 emission scales tightly with pahemission, even though the average radiation field intensity varies by a factorten, can also be understood if both tracers originate predominantly in pdrs,either dense or diffuse. a large fraction of the 25 liner/sy targets, however,strongly depart from the rest of the sample, in having warmer h2 in the excitedstates, and an excess of h2 emission with respect to pahs, tir and [siii]. wepropose a threshold in h2 to pah power ratios, allowing the identification oflow-luminosity agns by an excess h2 excitation. a dominant contribution fromshock heating is favored in these objects. finally, we detect, in nearly halfthe star-forming targets, non-equilibrium ortho to para ratios, consistent withfuv pumping combined with incomplete ortho-para thermalization by collisions,or possibly non-equilibrium pdr fronts advancing into cold gas.

0707.1303	variations in 24 micron morphologies among galaxies in the spitzer  infrared nearby galaxies survey: new insights into the hubble sequence	to study the distribution of star formation and dust emission within nearbygalaxies, we measured five morphological parameters in the 3.6 and 24 micronwave bands for 65 galaxies in the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey(sings) and 8 galaxies that were serendipitously observed by sings. themorphological parameters demonstrate strong variations along the hubblesequence, including statistically significant differences between s0/a-sab andsc-sd galaxies. early-type galaxies are generally found to be compact,centralized, symmetric sources in the 24 micron band, while late-type galaxiesare generally found to be extended, asymmetric sources. these results suggestthat the processes that increase the real or apparent sizes of galaxies' bulgesalso lead to more centralized 24 micron dust emission. several phenomena, suchas strong nuclear star formation, seyfert activity, or outer ring structures,may cause galaxies to deviate from the general morphological trends observed at24 microns. we also note that the 24 micron morphologies of sdm-im galaxies arequite varied, with some objects appearing very compact and symmetric whileothers appear diffuse and asymmetric. these variations reflect the widevariation in star formation in irregular galaxies as observed at otherwavelengths. the variations in the 24 micron morphological parameters acrossthe hubble sequence mirror many of the morphological trends seen in othertracers of the ism and in stellar emission. however, the 24 micronmorphological parameters for the galaxies in this sample do not match themorphological parameters measured in the stellar wave bands. this implies thatthe distribution of dust emission is related to but not equivalent to thedistribution of stellar emission.

0912.2731	the detection of anomalous dust emission in the nearby galaxy ngc 6946	we report on the ka-band (26-40 ghz) emission properties for 10 star-formingregions in the nearby galaxy ngc 6946. from a radio spectral decomposition, wefind that the 33 ghz flux densities are typically dominated by thermal(free-free) radiation. however, we also detect excess ka-band emission for anouter-disk star-forming region relative to what is expected given existingradio, submillimeter, and infrared data. among the 10 targeted regions,measurable excess emission at 33 ghz is detected for half of them, but in onlyone region is the excess found to be statistically significant($\approx7\sigma$). we interpret this as the first likely detection of socalled `anomalous' dust emission outside of the milky way. we find that modelsexplaining this feature as the result of dipole emission from rapidly rotatingultrasmall grains are able to reproduce the observations for reasonableinterstellar medium conditions. while these results suggest that the use ofka-band data as a measure of star formation activity in external galaxies maybe complicated by the presence of anomalous dust, it is unclear how significanta factor this will be for globally integrated measurements as the excessemission accounts for $\la$10% of the total ka-band flux density from all 10regions.

1003.0961	the calibration of monochromatic far-infrared star formation rate  indicators	(abridged) spitzer data at 24, 70, and 160 micron and ground-based h-alphaimages are analyzed for a sample of 189 nearby star-forming and starburstgalaxies to investigate whether reliable star formation rate (sfr) indicatorscan be defined using the monochromatic infrared dust emission centered at 70and 160 micron. we compare recently published recipes for sfr measures usingcombinations of the 24 micron and observed h-alpha luminosities with thoseusing 24 micron luminosity alone. from these comparisons, we derive a referencesfr indicator for use in our analysis. linear correlations between sfr and the70 and 160 micron luminosity are found for l(70)&gt;=1.4x10^{42} erg/s andl(160)&gt;=2x10^{42} erg/s, corresponding to sfr&gt;=0.1-0.3 m_sun/yr. below thosetwo luminosity limits, the relation between sfr and 70 micron (160 micron)luminosity is non-linear and sfr calibrations become problematic. thedispersion of the data around the mean trend increases for increasingwavelength, becoming about 25% (factor ~2) larger at 70 (160) micron than at 24micron. the increasing dispersion is likely an effect of the increasingcontribution to the infrared emission of dust heated by stellar populations notassociated with the current star formation. the non-linear relation between sfrand the 70 and 160 micron emission at faint galaxy luminosities suggests thatthe increasing transparency of the interstellar medium, decreasing effectivedust temperature, and decreasing filling factor of star forming regions acrossthe galaxy become important factors for decreasing luminosity. the sfrcalibrations are provided for galaxies with oxygen abundance 12+log(o/h)&gt;8.1.at lower metallicity the infrared luminosity no longer reliably traces the sfrbecause galaxies are less dusty and more transparent.

1004.3543	the buried starburst in the interacting galaxy ii zw 096 as revealed by  the spitzer space telescope	an analysis of data from the spitzer space telescope, hubble space telescope,chandra x-ray observatory, and akari infrared astronomy satellite is presentedfor the z=0.036 merging galaxy system ii zw 096 (cgcg 448-020). because ii zw096 has an infrared luminosity of log(l_ir/l_sun) = 11.94, it is classified asa luminous infrared galaxy (lirg), and was observed as part of the greatobservatories all-sky lirg survey (goals). the spitzer data suggest that 80% ofthe total infrared luminosity comes from an extremely compact, red source notassociated with the nuclei of the merging galaxies. the spitzer mid-infraredspectra indicate no high-ionization lines from a buried active galactic nucleusin this source. the strong detection of the 3.3 micron and 6.2 micron pahemission features in the akari and spitzer spectra also implies that the energysource of ii zw 096 is a starburst. based on spitzer infrared imaging and akarinear-infrared spectroscopy, the star formation rate is estimated to be 120m_sun/yr and &gt; 45 m_sun/yr, respectively. finally, the high-resolution b, i,and h-band images show many star clusters in the interacting system. the colorsof these clusters suggest at least two populations - one with an age of 1-5 myrand one with an age of 20-500 myr, reddened by 0-2 magnitudes of visualextinction. the masses of these clusters span a range between 10^6-10^8 m_sun.this starburst source is reminiscent of the extra-nuclear starburst seen in ngc4038/9 (the antennae galaxies) and arp 299 but approximately an order ofmagnitude more luminous than the antennae. the source is remarkable in that theoff-nuclear infrared luminosity dominates the enitre system.

1005.0630	balancing the energy budget: star-formation versus agn in high redshift  infrared luminous galaxies	we present deep {\it spitzer} mid-infrared spectroscopy, along with 16, 24,70, and 850\,$\micron$\ photometry, for 22 galaxies located in the greatobservatories origins deep survey-north (goods-n) field. the sample spans aredshift range of $0.6\la z \la 2.6$, 24~$\mu$m flux densities between$\sim$0.2$-$1.2 mjy, and consists of submillimeter galaxies (smgs), x-ray oroptically selected active galactic nuclei (agn), and optically faint($z_{ab}&gt;25$\,mag) sources. we find that infrared (ir; $8-1000~\micron$)luminosities derived by fitting local spectral energy distributions (seds) with24~$\micron$ photometry alone are well matched to those when additionalmid-infrared spectroscopic and longer wavelength photometric data is used forgalaxies having $z\la1.4$ and 24~$\micron$-derived ir luminosities typically$\la 3\times 10^{12}~l_{\sun}$. however, for galaxies in the redshift rangebetween $1.4\la z \la 2.6$, typically having 24~$\micron$-derived irluminosities $\ga 3\times 10^{12}~l_{\sun}$, ir luminosities are overestimatedby an average factor of $\sim$5 when sed fitting with 24~$\micron$ photometryalone. this result arises partly due to the fact that high redshift galaxiesexhibit aromatic feature equivalent widths that are large compared to localgalaxies of similar luminosities. through a spectral decomposition ofmid-infrared spectroscopic data, we are able to isolate the fraction of irluminosity arising from an agn as opposed to star formation activity. thisfraction is only able to account for $\sim$30\% of the total ir luminosityamong the entire sample.

1005.1611	far-infrared line imaging of the starburst ring in ngc 1097 with the  herschel/pacs spectrometer	ngc 1097 is a nearby sbb galaxy with a seyfert nucleus and a bright starburstring. we study the physical properties of the interstellar medium (ism) in thering using spatially resolved far-infrared spectral maps of the circumnuclearstarburst ring of ngc 1097, obtained with the pacs spectrometer on board theherschel space telescope. in particular, we map the important ism cooling anddiagnostic emission lines of [oi] 63 $\mu$m, [oiii] 88 $\mu$m, [nii] 122$\mu$m, [cii] 158 $\mu$m and [nii] 205 $\mu$m. we observe that in the [oi] 63$\mu$m, [oiii] 88 $\mu$m, and [nii] 122 $\mu$m line maps, the emission isenhanced in clumps along the ne part of the ring. we observe evidence of rapidrotation in the circumnuclear ring, with a rotation velocity of ~220$ kms$^{-1}$ (inclination uncorrected) measured in all lines. the [oi] 63$\mu$m/[cii] 158 $\mu$m ratio varies smoothly throughout the central region,and is enhanced on the northeastern part of the ring, which may indicate astronger radiation field. this enhancement coincides with peaks in the [oi] 63$\mu$m and [oiii] 88 $\mu$m maps. variations of the [nii] 122 $\mu$m/[nii] 205$\mu$m ratio correspond to a range in the ionized gas density between 150 and400 cm$^{-3}$.

1005.1887	enhanced dust heating in the bulges of early-type spiral galaxies	stellar density and bar strength should affect the temperatures of the cool(t ~ 20-30 k) dust component in the inner regions of galaxies, which impliesthat the ratio of temperatures in the circumnuclear regions to the disk shoulddepend on hubble type. we investigate the differences between cool dusttemperatures in the central 3 kpc and disk of 13 nearby galaxies by fittingmodels to measurements between 70 and 500 microns. we attempt to quantifytemperature trends in nearby disk galaxies, with archival data fromspitzer/mips and new observations with herschel/spire, which were acquiredduring the first phases of the herschel observations for the kingfish (keyinsights in nearby galaxies: a far-infrared survey with herschel) sample. wefit single-temperature modified blackbodies to far-infrared and submillimetermeasurements of the central and disk regions of galaxies to determine thetemperature of the component(s) emitting at those wavelengths. we present theratio of central-region-to-disk-temperatures of the cool dust component of 13nearby galaxies as a function of morphological type. we find a significanttemperature gradient in the cool dust component in all galaxies, with a meancenter-to-disk temperature ratio of 1.15 +/- 0.03. the cool dust temperaturesin the central ~3 kpc of nearby galaxies are 23(+/-3)% hotter for morphologicaltypes earlier than sc, and only 9(+/-3)% hotter for later types. thetemperature ratio is also correlated with bar strength, with only stronglybarred galaxies having a ratio over 1.2. the strong radiation field in the highstellar density of a galactic bulge tends to heat the cool dust component tohigher temperatures, at least in early-type spirals with relatively largebulges, especially when paired with a strong bar.

1005.1959	mapping far-ir emission from the central kiloparsec of ngc 1097	using photometry of ngc 1097 from the herschel pacs (photodetector arraycamera and spectrometer) instrument, we study the resolved properties ofthermal dust continuum emission from a circumnuclear starburst ring with aradius ~ 900 pc. these observations are the first to resolve the structure of acircumnuclear ring at wavelengths that probe the peak (i.e. lambda ~ 100micron) of the dust spectral energy distribution. the ring dominates thefar-infrared (far-ir) emission from the galaxy - the high angular resolution ofpacs allows us to isolate the ring's contribution and we find it is responsiblefor 75, 60 and 55% of the total flux of ngc 1097 at 70, 100 and 160 micron,respectively. we compare the far-ir structure of the ring to what is seen atother wavelengths and identify a sequence of far-ir bright knots thatcorrespond to those seen in radio and mid-ir images. the mid- and far-ir bandratios in the ring vary by less than +/- 20% azimuthally, indicating modestvariation in the radiation field heating the dust on ~ 600 pc scales. weexplore various explanations for the azimuthal uniformity in the far-ir colorsof the ring including a lack of well-defined age gradients in the young stellarcluster population, a dominant contribution to the far-ir emission from dustheated by older (&gt; 10 myr) stars and/or a quick smoothing of local enhancementsin dust temperature due to the short orbital period of the ring. finally, weimprove previous limits on the far-ir flux from the inner ~ 600 pc of ngc 1097by an order of magnitude, providing a better estimate of the total bolometricemission arising from the active galactic nucleus and its associated centralstarburst.

1009.0038	the spatial extent of (u)lirgs in the mid-infrared i: the continuum  emission	we present an analysis of the extended mid-infrared (mir) emission of thegreat observatories all-sky lirg survey (goals) sample based on 5-15um lowresolution spectra obtained with the irs on spitzer. we calculate the fractionof extended emission as a function of wavelength for the galaxies in thesample, fee_lambda. we can identify 3 general types of fee_lambda: one where itis constant, one where features due to emission lines and pahs appear moreextended than the continuum, and a third which is characteristic of sourceswith deep silicate absorption at 9.7um. more than 30% of the galaxies have amedian fee_lambda larger than 0.5 implying that at least half of their miremission is extended. luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs) display a wide rangeof fee in their warm dust continuum (0&lt;=fee_13.2um&lt;=0.85). the large values offee_13.2um that we find in many lirgs suggest that their extended mir continuumemission originates in scales up to 10kpc. the mean size of the lirg cores at13.2um is 2.6kpc. however, once the lir of the systems reaches the threshold of~10^11.8lsun, all sources become clearly more compact, with fee_13.2um&lt;=0.2,and their cores are unresolved. our estimated upper limit for the core size ofulirgs is less than 1.5kpc. the analysis indicates that the compactness ofsystems with lir&gt;~10^11.25lsun strongly increases in those classified asmergers in their final stage of interaction. the fee_13.2um is also related tothe contribution of an active galactic nucleus (agn) to the mir. galaxies whichare more agn-dominated are less extended, independently of their lir. wefinally find that the extent of the mir continuum emission is correlated withthe far-ir iras log(f_60um/f_100um) color. this enables us to place a lowerlimit to the area in a galaxy from where the cold dust emission may originate,a prediction which can be tested soon with the herschel space telescope.

1009.1455	detection of an ultra-bright submillimeter galaxy in the  subaru/xmm-newton deep field using aztec/aste	we report the detection of an extremely bright ($\sim$37 mjy at 1100 $\mu$mand $\sim$91 mjy at 880 $\mu$m) submillimeter galaxy (smg),aztec-aste-sxdf1100.001 (hereafter referred to as sxdf1100.001 or orochi),discovered in 1100 $\mu$m observations of the subaru/xmm-newton deep fieldusing aztec on aste. subsequent carma 1300 $\mu$m and sma 880 $\mu$mobservations successfully pinpoint the location of orochi and suggest that ithas two components, one extended (fwhm of $\sim$ 4$^{\prime\prime}$) and onecompact (unresolved). z-spec on cso has also been used to obtain a wide bandspectrum from 190 to 308 ghz, although no significant emission/absorption linesare found. the derived upper limit to the line-to-continuum flux ratio is0.1--0.3 (2 $\sigma$) across the z-spec band.  based on the analysis of the derived spectral energy distribution fromoptical to radio wavelengths of possible counterparts near the sma/carma peakposition, we suggest that orochi is a lensed, optically dark smg lying at $z\sim 3.4$ behind a foreground, optically visible (but red) galaxy at $z \sim1.4$. the deduced apparent (i.e., no correction for magnification) infraredluminosity ($l_{\rm ir}$) and star formation rate (sfr) are $6 \times 10^{13}$$l_{\odot}$ and 11000 $m_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively, assuming that the$l_{\rm ir}$ is dominated by star formation. these values suggest that orochiwill consume its gas reservoir within a short time scale ($3 \times 10^{7}$yr), which is indeed comparable to those in extreme starbursts like the centresof local ulirgs.

1102.3920	an accounting of the dust-obscured star formation and accretion  histories over the last ~11~billion years	(abridged) we report on an accounting of the star formation and accretiondriven energetics of 24um detected sources in goods north. for sources havinginfrared (ir; 8-1000um) luminosities &gt;3x10^12 l_sun when derived by fittinglocal seds to 24um photometry alone, we find these ir luminosity estimates tobe a factor of ~4 times larger than those estimated when the sed fittingincludes additional 16 and 70um data (and in some cases mid-infraredspectroscopy and 850um data). this discrepancy arises from the fact that highluminosity sources at z&gt;&gt;0 appear to have far- to mid-infrared ratios, as wellas aromatic feature equivalent widths, typical of lower luminosity galaxies inthe local universe. using our improved estimates for ir luminosity and agncontributions, we investigate the evolution of the ir luminosity density versusredshift arising from star formation and agn processes alone. we find that,within the uncertainties, the total star formation driven ir luminosity densityis constant between 1.15 &lt; z &lt; 2.35, although our results suggest a slightlylarger value at z&gt;2. agn appear to account for &lt;18% of the total ir luminositydensity integrated between 0&lt; z &lt; 2.35, contributing &lt;25% at each epoch. lirgappear to dominate the star formation rate (sfr) density along with normalstar-forming galaxies (l_ir &lt; 10^11 l_sun) between 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.15. once beyondz &gt;2, the contribution from ultraluminous infrared galaxies ulirgs becomescomparable with that of lirgs. using our improved ir luminosity estimates, wefind existing calibrations for uv extinction corrections based on measurementsof the uv spectral slope typically overcorrect uv luminosities by a factor of~2, on average, for our sample of 24um-selected sources; accordingly we havederived a new uv extinction correction more appropriate for our sample.

1105.4877	calibrating extinction-free star formation rate diagnostics with 33ghz  free-free emission in ngc6946	abridged: using free-free emission measured in the ka-band (26-40ghz) for 10star-forming regions in the nearby galaxy ngc6946, including its starburstingnucleus, we compare a number of sfr diagnostics that are typically consideredto be unaffected by interstellar extinction: i.e., non-thermal radio (i.e.,1.4ghz), total infrared (ir; 8-1000um), and warm dust (i.e., 24um) emission,along with the hybrid (obscured + unobscured) indicators of h\alpha+24um anduv+ir. the 33ghz free-free emission is assumed to provide the most accuratemeasure of the current sfr. among the extranuclear star-forming regions, the24um, h\alpha+24um and uv+ir sfr calibrations are in good agreement with the33ghz free-free sfrs. however, each of the sfr calibrations relying on someform of dust emission overestimate the nuclear sfr by a factor of ~2. this ismore likely the result of excess dust heating through an accumulation ofnon-ionizing stars associated with an extended episode of star formation in thenucleus rather than increased competition for ionizing photons by dust. sfrcalibrations using the non-thermal radio continuum yield values which onlyagree with the free-free sfrs for the nucleus, and underestimate the sfrs fromthe extranuclear star-forming regions by a factor of ~2. this result likelyarises from the cr electrons decaying within the starburst region withnegligible escape compared to the young extranuclear star-forming regions.finally, we find that the sfrs estimated using the total 33ghz emission agreewell with the free-free sfrs due to the large thermal fractions present atthese frequencies even when local diffuse backgrounds are not removed. thus,rest-frame 33ghz observations may act as a reliable method to measure the sfrsof galaxies at increasingly high redshift without the need of ancillary radiodata to account for the non-thermal emission.

1106.4301	the water vapor spectrum of apm 08279+5255: x-ray heating and infrared  pumping over hundreds of parsecs	we present the rest-frame 200--320 \mm\ spectrum of the z=3.91 quasar \apm,obtained with z-spec at the caltech submillimeter observatory. in addition tothe \jeight\ to \jthirteen\ co rotational transitions which dominate the cocooling, we find six transitions of water originating at energy levels rangingup to 643 k. most are first detections at high redshift, and we have confirmedone transition with carma. the co cooling is well-described by our xdr model,assuming l$_{\rm 1-100\,kev}\sim1\times10^{46}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$, and that thegas is distributed over a 550-pc sizescale, per the now-favored $\mu$=4 lensingmodel. the total observed cooling in water corresponds to 6.5$\times10^{9}$\ls, comparable to that of co. we compare the water spectrum with that of mrk231, finding that the intensity ratios among the high-lying lines are similar,but with a total luminosity scaled up by a factor of $\sim$50. using thisscaling, we estimate an average water abundance relative to \hh\ of1.4$\times10^{-7}$, a good match to the prediction of the chemical network inthe xdr model. as with mrk 231, the high-lying water transitions are excitedradiatively via absorption in the rest-frame far-infrared, and we show that thepowerful dust continuum in \apm\ is more than sufficient to pump this massivereservoir of warm water vapor.

1108.4802	similarity analysis of macroecology	we perform a full similarity analysis of an idealized ecosystem usingbuckingham's $\pi$ theorem to obtain dimensionless similarity parameters giventhat some (non- unique) method exists that can differentiate differentfunctional groups of individuals within an ecosystem. we then obtain therelationship between the similarity parameters under the assumptions of (i)that the ecosystem is in a dynamically balanced steady state and (ii) thatthese functional groups are connected to each other by the flow of resource.the expression that we obtain relates the level of complexity that theecosystem can support to intrinsic macroscopic variables such as density,diversity and characteristic length scales for foraging or dispersal, andextrinsic macroscopic variables such as habitat size and the rate of supply ofresource. this expression relates these macroscopic variables to each other,generating commonly observed macroecological patterns; these broad trendssimply reflect the similarity property of ecosystems. we thus find that detailsof the ecosystem function are not required to obtain these broadmacroecological patterns this may explain why they are ubiquitous. departuresfrom our relationship may indicate that the ecosystem is in a state of rapidchange, i.e., abundance or diversity explosion or collapse. our result providesnormalised variables that can be used to isolate the trend in one ecosystemvariable from another, providing a new method for isolating macroecologicalpatterns in data. a dimensionless control parameter for ecosystem complexityemerges from our analysis and this will be a control parameter in dynamicalmodels for ecosystems based on energy flow and conservation and will order theemergent behaviour of these models.

1110.3046	spitzer irs spectral mapping of the toomre sequence: spatial variations  of pah, gas, and dust properties in nearby major mergers	we have mapped the key mid-ir diagnostics in eight major merger systems ofthe toomre sequence (ngc4676, ngc7592, ngc6621, ngc2623, ngc6240, ngc520,ngc3921, and ngc7252) using the spitzer infrared spectrograph (irs). with thesemaps, we explore the variation of the ionized-gas, pah, and warm-gas (h_2)properties across the sequence and within the galaxies. while the global pahinterband strength and ionized gas flux ratios ([ne iii]/[ne ii]) are similarto those of normal star forming galaxies, the distribution of the spatiallyresolved pah and fine structure line flux ratios is significant different fromone system to the other. rather than a constant h_2/pah flux ratio, we findthat the relation between the h_2 and pah fluxes is characterized by a powerlaw with a roughly constant exponent (0.61+/-0.05) over all merger componentsand spatial scales. while following the same power law on local scales, threegalaxies have a factor of ten larger integrated (i.e. global) h_2/pah fluxratio than the rest of the sample, even larger than what it is in most nearbyagns. these findings suggest a common dominant excitation mechanism for h_2emission over a large range of global h_2/pah flux ratios in major mergers.early merger systems show a different distribution between the cold (co j=1-0)and warm (h_2) molecular gas component, which is likely due to the mergerinteraction. strong evidence for buried star formation in the overlap region ofthe merging galaxies is found in two merger systems (ngc6621 and ngc7592) asseen in the pah, [ne ii], [ne iii], and warm gas line emission, but with noapparent corresponding co (j=1-0) emission. our findings also demonstrate thatthe variations of the physical conditions within a merger are much larger thanany systematic trends along the toomre sequence.

1205.5694	continuum halos in nearby galaxies -- an evla survey (chang-es) -- i:  introduction to the survey	we introduce a new survey to map the radio continuum halos of a sample of 35edge-on spiral galaxies at 1.5 ghz and 6 ghz in all polarization products. thesurvey is exploiting the new wide bandwidth capabilities of the karl g. janskyvery large array (i.e. the expanded very large array, or evla) in a variety ofarray configurations (b, c, and d) in order to compile the most comprehensivedata set yet obtained for the study of radio halo properties. this is the firstsurvey of radio halos to include all polarization products.  in this first paper, we outline the scientific motivation of the survey, thespecific science goals, and the expected improvements in noise levels andspatial coverage from the survey. our goals include investigating the physicalconditions and origin of halos, characterizing cosmic ray transport and windspeed, measuring faraday rotation and mapping the magnetic field, probing thein-disk and extraplanar far-infrared - radio continuum relation, andreconciling non-thermal radio emission with high-energy gamma-ray models. thesample size allows us to search for correlations between radio halos and otherproperties, including environment, star formation rate, and the presence ofagns. in a companion paper (paper ii) we outline the data reduction steps andpresent the first results of the survey for the galaxy, ngc 4631.

1207.7129	goods-herschel: ultra-deep xmm-newton observations reveal  agn/star-formation connection	models of galaxy evolution assume some connection between the agn and starformation activity in galaxies. we use the multi-wavelength information of thecdfs to assess this issue. we select the agns from the 3ms xmm-newton surveyand measure the star-formation rates of their hosts using data that proberest-frame wavelengths longward of 20 um. star-formation rates are obtainedfrom spectral energy distribution fits, identifying and subtracting an agncomponent. we divide the star-formation rates by the stellar masses of thehosts to derive specific star-formation rates (ssfr) and find evidence for apositive correlation between the agn activity (proxied by the x-ray luminosity)and the ssfr for the most active systems with x-ray luminosities exceedinglx=10^43 erg/s and redshifts z~1. we do not find evidence for such acorrelation for lower luminosity systems or those at lower redshifts. we do notfind any correlation between the sfr (or the ssfr) and the x-ray absorptionderived from high-quality xmm-newton spectra either, showing that theabsorption is likely to be linked to the nuclear region rather than the host,while the star-formation is not nuclear. comparing the ssfr of the hosts to thecharacteristic ssfr of star-forming galaxies at the same redshift we find thatthe agns reside mostly in main-sequence and starburst hosts, reflecting the agn- ssfr connection. limiting our analysis to the highest x-ray luminosity agns(x-ray qsos with lx&gt;10^44 erg/s), we find that the highest-redshift qsos (withz&gt;2) reside predominantly in starburst hosts, with an average ssfr more thandouble that of the "main sequence", and we find a few cases of qsos at z~1.5with specific star-formation rates compatible with the main-sequence, or evenin the "quiescent" region.

1301.6884	a detailed study of the radio--fir correlation in ngc6946 with  herschel-pacs/spire from kingfish	we derive the distribution of the synchrotron spectral index across ngc6946and investigate the correlation between the radio continuum (synchrotron) andfar-infrared (fir) emission using the kingfish herschel pacs and spire data.the radio--fir correlation is studied as a function of star formation rate,magnetic field strength, radiation field strength, and the total gas surfacebrightness. the synchrotron emission follows both star-forming regions and theso-called magnetic arms present in the inter-arm regions. the synchrotronspectral index is steepest along the magnetic arms ($\alpha_n \sim 1$), whileit is flat in places of giant h{\sc ii} regions and in the center of the galaxy($\alpha_n \sim 0.6-0.7$). the map of $\alpha_n$ provides an observationalevidence for aging and energy loss of cosmic ray electrons propagating in thedisk of the galaxy. variations in the synchrotron--fir correlation across thegalaxy are shown to be a function of both star formation and magnetic fields.we find that the synchrotron emission correlates better with cold rather thanwith warm dust emission, when the interstellar radiation field is the mainheating source of dust. the synchrotron--fir correlation suggests a couplingbetween the magnetic field and the gas density. ngc6946 shows a power-lawbehavior between the total (turbulent) magnetic field strength b and the starformation rate surface density $\sigma_{\rm sfr}$ with an index of0.14\,(0.16)$\pm$0.01. this indicates an efficient production of the turbulentmagnetic field with the increasing gas turbulence expected in actively starforming regions. the scale-by-scale analysis of the synchrotron--fircorrelation indicates that the ism affects the propagation of old/diffusedcosmic ray electrons, resulting in a diffusion coefficient of $d_0=4.6\times10^{28}$\,cm$^2$\,s$^{-1}$ for 2.2\,gev cres.

1302.5704	radio and mid-infrared properties of compact starbursts: distancing  themselves from the main sequence	we investigate the relationship between 8.44\,ghz brightness temperatures and1.4 to 8.44\,ghz radio spectral indices with 6.2\,$\mu$m polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon (pah) emission and 9.7\,$\mu$m silicate absorption features for asample of 36 local luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies. we find thatgalaxies having small 6.2\,$\mu$m pah equivalent widths (eqws), which signalthe presence of weak pah emission and/or an excess of very hot dust, also haveflat spectral indices. the three active galactic nuclei (agn) identifiedthrough their excessively large 8.44\,ghz brightness temperatures are alsoidentified as agn via their small 6.2\,$\mu$m pah eqws. we also find that theflattening of the radio spectrum increases with increasing silicate opticaldepth, 8.44\,ghz brightness temperature, and decreasing size of the radiosource even after removing potential agn, supporting the idea that compactstarbursts show spectral flattening as the result of increased free-freeabsorption. these correlations additionally suggest that the dust obscurationin these galaxies must largely be coming from the vicinity of the compactstarburst itself, and is not distributed throughout the (foreground) disk ofthe galaxy. finally, we investigate the location of these infrared-brightsystems relative to the main sequence (star formation rate vs. stellar mass) ofstar-forming galaxies in the local universe. we find that the radio spectralindices of galaxies flattens with increasing distance above the main sequence,or in other words, with increasing specific star formation rate. this indicatesthat galaxies located above the main sequence, having high specific starformation rates, are typically compact starbursts hosting deeply embedded starformation that becomes more optically thick in the radio and infrared withincreased distance above the main sequence.

1303.2723	dusty starburst galaxies in the early universe as revealed by  gravitational lensing	in the past decade, our understanding of galaxy evolution has beenrevolutionized by the discovery that luminous, dusty, starburst galaxies were1,000 times more abundant in the early universe than at present. it has,however, been difficult to measure the complete redshift 2 distribution ofthese objects, especially at the highest redshifts (z &gt; 4). here we report aredshift survey at a wavelength of three millimeters, targeting carbon monoxideline emission from the star-forming molecular gas in the direction ofextraordinarily bright millimetrewave-selected sources. high-resolution imagingdemonstrates that these sources are strongly gravitationally lensed byforeground galaxies. we detect spectral lines in 23 out of 26 sources andmultiple lines in 12 of those 23 sources, from which we obtain robust,unambiguous redshifts. at least 10 of the sources are found to lie at z &gt; 4,indicating that the fraction of dusty starburst galaxies at high redshifts isgreater than previously thought. models of lens geometries in the sampleindicate that the background objects are ultra-luminous infrared galaxies,powered by extreme bursts of star formation.

1306.4337	the build-up of nuclear stellar cusps in extreme starburst galaxies and  major mergers	nuclear stellar cusps are defined as central excess light component in thestellar light profiles of galaxies and are suggested to be stellar relics ofintense compact starbursts in the central ~100-500 pc region of gas-rich majormergers. here we probe the build-up of nuclear cusps during the actualstarburst phase for a complete sample of luminous infrared galaxy systems (85lirgs, with 11.4&lt;log[lir/l_sun]&lt;12.5) in the goals sample. cusp properties arederived via 2-dimensional fitting of the nuclear stellar light imaged in thenear-infrared by the hubble space telescope and have been combined with mid-irdiagnostics for agn/starburst characterization. we find that nuclear stellarcusps are resolved in 76% of lirgs (merger and non-interacting galaxies). thecusp strength and luminosity increases with far-ir luminosity (excluding agn)and merger stage, confirming theoretical models that starburst activity isassociated with the build-up of nuclear stellar cusps. evidence for ultracompact nuclear starbursts is found in ~13% of lirgs, which have a strongunresolved central nir light component but no significant contribution of anagn. the nuclear near-ir surface density (measured within 1 kpc radius)increases by a factor of ~5 towards late merger stages. a careful comparison tolocal early-type galaxies with comparable masses reveals (a) that local(u)lirgs have a significantly larger cusp fraction and (b) that the majority ofthe cusp lirgs have host galaxy luminosities (h-band) similar to coreellipticals which is roughly one order in magnitude larger than for cuspellipticals.

1511.06673	chang-es vi: probing supernova energy deposition in spiral galaxies  through multi-wavelength relationships	how a galaxy regulates its sne energy into differentinterstellar/circumgalactic medium components strongly affects galaxyevolution. based on the jvla d-configuration c- (6 ghz) and l-band (1.6 ghz)continuum observations, we perform statistical analysis comparingmulti-wavelength properties of the chang-es galaxies. the high-quality jvladata and edge-on orientation enable us for the first time to include the halointo the energy budget for a complete radio-flux-limited sample. we find tightcorrelations of $l_{\rm radio}$ with the mid-ir-based sfr. the normalization ofour $i_{\rm 1.6ghz}/{\rm w~hz^{-1}}-{\rm sfr}$ relation is $\sim$2-3 times ofthose obtained for face-on galaxies, probably a result of enhanced irextinction at high inclination. we also find tight correlations between $l_{\rmradio}$ and the sne energy injection rate $\dot{e}_{\rm sn(ia+cc)}$, indicatingthe energy loss via synchrotron radio continuum accounts for $\sim0.1\%$ of$\dot{e}_{\rm sn}$, comparable to the energy contained in cr electrons. theintegrated c-to-l-band spectral index is $\alpha\sim0.5-1.1$ for non-agngalaxies, indicating a dominance by the diffuse synchrotron component. thelow-scatter $l_{\rm radio}-{\rm sfr}$/$l_{\rm radio}-\dot{e}_{\rm sn (ia+cc)}$relationships have super-linear logarithmic slopes at $\sim2~\sigma$ in l-band($1.132\pm0.067$/$1.175\pm0.102$) while consistent with linear in c-band($1.057\pm0.075$/$1.100\pm0.123$). the super-linearity could be naturallyreproduced with non-calorimeter models for galaxy disks. using chandra halox-ray measurements, we find sub-linear $l_{\rm x}-l_{\rm radio}$ relations.these results indicate that the observed radio halo of a starburst galaxy isclose to electron calorimeter, and a galaxy with higher sfr tends to distributean increased fraction of sne energy into radio emission (than x-ray).

0705.3377	the calibration of mid-infrared star formation rate indicators	with the goal of investigating the degree to which the mid-infrared emissiontraces the star formation rate (sfr), we analyze spitzer 8 um and 24 um data ofstar-forming regions in a sample of 33 nearby galaxies with availablehst/nicmos images in the paschen-alpha (1.8756 um) emission line. the galaxiesare drawn from the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings) sample, andcover a range of morphologies and a factor ~10 in oxygen abundance. publisheddata on local low-metallicity starburst galaxies and luminous infrared galaxiesare also included in the analysis. both the stellar-continuum-subtracted 8 umemission and the 24 um emission correlate with the extinction-correctedpa-alpha line emission, although neither relationship is linear. simple modelsof stellar populations and dust extinction and emission are able to reproducethe observed non-linear trend of the 24 um emission versus number of ionizingphotons, including the modest deficiency of 24 um emission in the lowmetallicity regions, which results from a combination of decreasing dustopacity and dust temperature at low luminosities. conversely, the trend of the8 um emission as a function of the number of ionizing photons is not wellreproduced by the same models. the 8 um emission is contributed, in largermeasure than the 24 um emission, by dust heated by non-ionizing stellarpopulations, in agreement with previous findings. two sfr calibrations, oneusing the 24 um emission and the other using a combination of the 24 um andh-alpha luminosities (kennicutt et al. 2007), are presented. no calibration ispresented for the 8 um emission, because of its significant dependence on bothmetallicity and environment. the calibrations presented here should be directlyapplicable to systems dominated by on-going star formation.

astro-ph;0507645	infrared spectral energy distributions of nearby galaxies	the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings) is carrying out acomprehensive multi-wavelength survey on a sample of 75 nearby galaxies. the1-850um spectral energy distributions are presented using broadband imagingdata from spitzer, 2mass, iso, iras, and scuba. the infrared colors derivedfrom the globally-integrated spitzer data are generally consistent with theprevious generation of models that were developed based on global data fornormal star-forming galaxies, though significant deviations are observed.spitzer's excellent sensitivity and resolution also allow a detailedinvestigation of the infrared spectral energy distributions for variouslocations within the three large, nearby galaxies ngc3031 (m81), ngc5194 (m51),and ngc7331. strong correlations exist between the local star formation rateand the infrared colors f_nu(70um)/f_nu(160um) and f_nu(24um)/f_nu(160um),suggesting that the 24 and 70um emission are useful tracers of the local starformation activity level. preliminary evidence indicates that variations in the24um emission, and not variations in the emission from polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons at 8um, drive the variations in the f_nu(8.0um)/f_nu(24um) colorswithin ngc3031, ngc5194, and ngc7331. if the galaxy-to-galaxy variations inspectral energy distributions seen in our sample are representative of therange present at high redshift then extrapolations of total infraredluminosities and star formation rates from the observed 24um flux will beuncertain at the factor-of-five level (total range). the correspondinguncertainties using the redshifted 8.0um flux (e.g. observed 24um flux for az=2 source) are factors of 10-20. considerable caution should be used wheninterpreting such extrapolated infrared luminosities.

astro-ph;0610688	an ultraviolet-to-radio broadband spectral atlas of nearby galaxies	the ultraviolet-to-radio continuum spectral energy distributions arepresented for all 75 galaxies in the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey(sings). a principal component analysis of the sample shows that most of thesample's spectral variations stem from two underlying components, onerepresentative of a galaxy with a low infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio and onerepresentative of a galaxy with a high infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio. theinfluence of several parameters on the infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio is studied(e.g., optical morphology, disk inclination, far-infrared color, ultravioletspectral slope, and star formation history). consistent with our understandingof normal star-forming galaxies, the sings sample of galaxies in comparison tomore actively star-forming galaxies exhibits a larger dispersion in theinfrared-to-ultraviolet versus ultraviolet spectral slope correlation. earlytype galaxies, exhibiting low star formation rates and high optical surfacebrightnesses, have the most discrepant infrared-to-ultraviolet correlation.these results suggest that the star formation history may be the dominantregulator of the broadband spectral variations between galaxies. finally, a newdiscovery shows that the 24 micron morphology can be a useful tool forparametrizing the global dust temperature and ultraviolet extinction in nearbygalaxies. the dust emission in dwarf/irregular galaxies is clumpy and warmaccompanied by low ultraviolet extinction, while in spiral galaxies there istypically a much larger diffuse component of cooler dust and averageultraviolet extinction. for galaxies with nuclear 24 micron emission, the dusttemperature and ultraviolet extinction are relatively high compared to diskgalaxies.

0811.4190	the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey: a high-resolution  spectroscopy anthology	high resolution mid-infrared spectra are presented for 155 nuclear andextranuclear regions from the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings).the fluxes for nine atomic forbidden and three molecular hydrogen mid-infraredemission lines are also provided, along with upper limits in key lines forinfrared-faint targets. the sings sample shows a wide range in the ratio of[siii]18.71um/[siii]33.48um, but the average ratio of the ensemble indicates atypical interstellar electron density of 300-400 cm^{-3} on ~23"x15" scales and500-600 cm^{-3} using ~11"x9" apertures, independent of whether the regionprobed is a star-forming nuclear, a star-forming extranuclear, or an agnenvironment. evidence is provided that variations in gas-phase metallicity playan important role in driving variations in radiation field hardness, asindicated by [neiii]15.56um/[neii]12.81um, for regions powered by starformation. conversely, the radiation hardness for galaxy nuclei powered byaccretion around a massive black hole is independent of metal abundance.furthermore, for metal-rich environments agn are distinguishable fromstar-forming regions by significantly larger [neiii]15.56um/[neii]12.81umratios. finally, [feii]25.99um/[neii]12.81um versus [siii]34.82um/[siii]33.48umalso provides an empirical method for discerning agn from normal star-formingsources. however, similar to [neiii]15.56um/[neii]12.81um, these mid-infraredline ratios lose their agn/star-formation diagnostic powers for very lowmetallicity star-forming systems with hard radiation fields.

0812.2922	environmental effects in clusters: modified far-infrared--radio  relations within virgo cluster galaxies	(abridged) we present a study on the effects of the intracluster medium (icm)on the interstellar medium (ism) of 10 virgo cluster spiral galaxies using {\itspitzer} far-infrared (fir) and vla radio continuum imaging. relying on thefir-radio correlation within normal galaxies, we use our infrared data tocreate model radio maps which we compare to the observed radio images. for 6 ofour sample galaxies we find regions along their outer edges that are highlydeficient in the radio compared with our models. we believe these observationsare the signatures of icm ram pressure. for ngc 4522 we find the radio deficitregion to lie just exterior to a region of high radio polarization and flatradio spectral index, although the total 20 cm radio continuum in this regiondoes not appear strongly enhanced. these characteristics seem consistent forother galaxies with radio polarization data in the literature. the strength ofthe radio deficit is inversely correlated with the time since peak pressure asinferred from stellar population studies and gas stripping simulations,suggesting the strength of the radio deficit is good indicator of the strengthof the current ram pressure. we also find that galaxies having {\it local}radio {\it deficits} appear to have {\it enhanced global} radio fluxes. ourpreferred physical picture is that the observed radio deficit regions arisefrom the icm wind sweeping away cosmic-ray (cr) electrons and the associatedmagnetic field, thereby creating synchrotron tails as observed for some of ourgalaxies. we propose that cr particles are also re-accelerated by icm-drivenshocklets behind the observed radio deficit regions which in turn enhances theremaining radio disk brightness.

0812.2927	balancing the energy budget between star-formation and agn in high  redshift infrared luminous galaxies	(abridged) we present deep spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopy, along with 16,24, 70, and 850um photometry, for 22 galaxies located in goods-n. the samplespans a redshift range of 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 2.6, 24um flux densities between ~0.2-1.2mjy, and consists of smgs, agn, and optically faint (z_ab &gt; 25) sources. wefind that ir luminosities derived by fitting local seds with 24um photometryalone are well matched to those when additional mid-infrared spectroscopic andlonger wavelength photometric data is used for galaxies having z &lt; 1.4 and24um-derived ir luminosities typically &gt; 3x10^12 l_sun. however, for galaxiesin the redshift range between 1.4 &lt; z &lt; 2.6, typically having 24um-derived irluminosities &gt; 3x10^12 l_sun, ir luminosities are overestimated by an averagefactor of ~5 when sed fitting with 24um photometry alone. this result arisespartly due to the fact that high redshift galaxies exhibit pah eqws that arelarge compared to local galaxies of similar luminosities. using improvedestimates for the ir luminosities of these sources, we investigate whethertheir ir emission is found to be in excess relative to that expected based onextinction corrected uv sfrs, possibly suggesting the presence of an obscuredagn. through a spectral decomposition of irs spectroscopic data, we are able toisolate the fraction of ir luminosity arising from an agn as opposed to starformation activity. this fraction is only ~30% of the total ir luminosity amongthe entire sample, on average. of the sources identified as having mid-infraredexcesses, half are accounted for by using proper bolometric corrections whilehalf show the presence of obscured agn. we do not find evidence for evolutionin the fir-radio correlation over this redshift range, although the smgs haveir/radio ratios which are, on average, ~3 times lower than the nominal value.
