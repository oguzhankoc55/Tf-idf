0907.3196	collisions of white dwarfs as a new progenitor channel for type ia  supernovae	we present the results of a systematic numerical study of an alternativeprogenitor scenario to produce type ia supernova explosions, which is notrestricted to the ignition of a co white dwarf near the chandrasekhar mass. inthis scenario, a shock-triggered thermonuclear explosion ensues from thecollision of two white dwarfs. consistent modeling of the gas dynamics togetherwith nuclear reactions using both a smoothed particle and a grid-basedhydrodynamics code are performed to study the viability of this alternativeprogenitor channel. we find that shock-triggered ignition and the synthesis ofni are in fact a natural outcome for moderately massive white dwarf pairscolliding close to head-on. we use a multi-dimensional radiative transfer codeto calculate the emergent broadband light curves and spectral time-series ofthese events. the synthetic spectra and lightcurves compare well with those ofnormal type ia supernovae over a similar b-band decline rate and are broadlyconsistent with the phillips relation, although a mild dependence on viewingangle is observed due to the asymmetry of the ejected debris. while event rateswithin galactic centers and globular clusters are found to be much too low toexplain the bulk of the type ia supernovae population, they may be frequentenough to make as much as a one percent contribution to the overall rate.although these rate estimates are still subject to substantial uncertainties,they do suggest that dense stellar systems should provide upcoming supernovasurveys with hundreds of such collision-induced thermonuclear explosions peryear.

0911.5544	discovery of a new soft gamma repeater: sgr j0418+5729	on 2009 june 5, the gamma-ray burst monitor (gbm) onboard the fermi gamma-rayspace telescope triggered on two short, and relatively dim bursts with spectralproperties similar to soft gamma repeater (sgr) bursts. independentlocalizations of the bursts by triangulation with the konus-rf and with theswift satellite, confirmed their origin from the same, previously unknown,source. the subsequent discovery of x-ray pulsations with the rossi x-raytiming explorer (rxte), confirmed the magnetar nature of the new source, sgrj0418+5729. we describe here the fermi/gbm observations, the discovery and thelocalization of this new sgr, and our infrared and chandra x-ray observations.we also present a detailed temporal and spectral study of the two gbm bursts.sgr j0418+5729 is the second source discovered in the same region of the sky inthe last year, the other one being sgr j0501+4516. both sources lie in thedirection of the galactic anti-center and presumably at the nearby distance of~2 kpc (assuming they reside in the perseus arm of our galaxy). thenear-threshold gbm detection of bursts from sgr j0418+5729 suggests that theremay be more such dim sgrs throughout our galaxy, possibly exceeding thepopulation of bright sgrs. finally, using sample statistics, we conclude thatthe implications of the new sgr discovery on the number of observable activemagnetars in our galaxy at any given time is &lt;10, in agreement with our earlierestimates.

1001.5060	a mildly relativistic radio jet from the otherwise normal type ic  supernova 2007gr	the class of type ic supernovae have drawn increasing attention since 1998owing to their sparse association (only four so far) with long durationgamma-ray bursts. although both phenomena originate from the core collapse of amassive star, supernovae emit mostly at optical wavelengths, whereas grbs emitmostly in soft gamma-rays or hard x-rays. though the grb central enginegenerates ultra-relativistic jets, which beam the early emission into a narrowcone, no relativistic outflows have hitherto been found in type ib/c supernovaeexplosions, despite theoretical expectations and searches. here we report radio(interferometric) observations that reveal a mildly relativistic expansion in anearby type ic supernova, sn 2007gr. using two observational epochs 60 daysapart, we detect expansion of the source and establish a conservative lowerlimit for the average apparent expansion velocity of 0.6c. independently, asecond mildly relativistic supernova has been reported. contrary to the radiodata, optical observations of sn 2007gr indicate a typical type ic supernovawith ejecta velocities ~6000 km/s, much lower than in grb-associatedsupernovae. we conclude that in sn 2007gr a small fraction of the ejectaproduced a low-energy mildly relativistic bipolar radio jet, while the bulk ofthe ejecta were slower and, as shown by optical spectro-polarimetry, mildlyaspherical.

1202.3157	sgr j1550-5418 bursts detected with the fermi gamma-ray burst monitor  during its most prolific activity	we have performed detailed temporal and time-integrated spectral analysis of286 bursts from sgr j1550-5418 detected with the fermi gamma-ray burst monitor(gbm) in january 2009, resulting in the largest uniform sample of temporal andspectral properties of sgr j1550-5418 bursts. we have used the combination ofbroadband and high time-resolution data provided with gbm to performstatistical studies for the source properties. we determine the durations,emission times, duty cycles and rise times for all bursts, and find that theyare typical of sgr bursts. we explore various models in our spectral analysis,and conclude that the spectra of sgr j1550-5418 bursts in the 8-200 kev bandare equally well described by optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung (ottb), apower law with an exponential cutoff (comptonized model), and two black-bodyfunctions (bb+bb). in the spectral fits with the comptonized model we find amean power-law index of -0.92, close to the ottb index of -1. we show thatthere is an anti-correlation between the comptonized epeak and the burstfluence and average flux. for the bb+bb fits we find that the fluences andemission areas of the two blackbody functions are correlated. thelow-temperature bb has an emission area comparable to the neutron star surfacearea, independent of the temperature, while the high-temperature blackbody hasa much smaller area and shows an anti-correlation between emission area andtemperature. we compare the properties of these bursts with bursts observedfrom other sgr sources during extreme activations, and discuss the implicationsof our results in the context of magnetar burst models.

1206.5002	stellar wind mass retention in star clusters: implications for  subsequent episodes of star formation	the discovery of multiple evolutionary sequences has challenged the paradigmthat globular clusters (gcs) host simple stellar populations. in addition,spectroscopic studies of gcs show a spread in light-element abundances,suggesting that multiple sequences can be formed from gaseous ejecta processedin evolved cluster stars. if multiple sequences originate from within gcs, thenit should be determined how such stellar systems retain gas, form new starswithin them and subsequently evolve. here we expand upon previous studies andcarry out hydrodynamical simulations that explore a wide range of clustermasses, compactness, metallicities and stellar age combinations in order todetermine the ideal conditions for gas retention. we find that up to 6.4% ofthe mass of the star cluster can be made up of retained stellar wind gas at thetime star formation is triggered. however, we show that multiple episodes ofstar formation can take place during the lifetime of a star cluster inparticular for times $\gtrsim 1$ gyr, thus leading to a sizable enhancement inthe total number of new stars. the fact that this favorable star formation timeinterval coincides with the asymptotic giant branch (agb) phase seems to givefurther credence to the idea that, at least in some gcs, there are stars whichhave formed from material processed by a previous generation of stars. theability of extended heating sources, such as pulsar outflows or accretion ontocompact objects, to hamper gas retention is illustrated via a simple numericaltreatment.

0712.2513	atypical thermonuclear supernovae from tidally crushed white dwarfs	suggestive evidence has accumulated that intermediate mass black holes (imbh)exist in some globular clusters. as stars diffuse in the cluster, some willinevitable wander sufficiently close to the hole that they suffer tidaldisruption. an attractive feature of the imbh hypothesis is its potential todisrupt not only solar-type stars but also compact white dwarf stars. attentionis given to the fate of white dwarfs that approach the hole close enough to bedisrupted and compressed to such extent that explosive nuclear burning may betriggered. precise modeling of the dynamics of the encounter coupled with anuclear network allow for a realistic determination of the explosive energyrelease, and it is argued that ignition is a natural outcome for white dwarfsof all varieties passing well within the tidal radius. although event rates areestimated to be significantly less than the rate of normal type ia supernovae,such encounters may be frequent enough in globular clusters harboring an imbhto warrant a search for this new class of supernova.

0801.1582	simulating black hole white dwarf encounters	the existence of supermassive black holes lurking in the centers of galaxiesand of stellar binary systems containing a black hole with a few solar masseshas been established beyond reasonable doubt. the idea that black holes ofintermediate masses ($\sim 1000$ \msun) may exist in globular star clusters hasgained credence over recent years but no conclusive evidence has beenestablished yet. an attractive feature of this hypothesis is the potential tonot only disrupt solar-type stars but also compact white dwarf stars. in closeencounters the white dwarfs can be sufficiently compressed to thermonuclearlyexplode. the detection of an underluminous thermonuclear explosion accompaniedby a soft, transient x-ray signal would be compelling evidence for the presenceof intermediate mass black holes in stellar clusters. in this paper we focus onthe numerical techniques used to simulate the entire disruption process fromthe initial parabolic orbit, over the nuclear energy release during tidalcompression, the subsequent ejection of freshly synthesized material and theformation process of an accretion disk around the black hole.

1410.7381	the role of nuclear star clusters in enhancing supermassive black hole  feeding rates during galaxy mergers	during galaxy mergers the gas falls to the center, triggers star formation,and feeds the rapid growth of supermassive black holes (smbhs). smbhs respondto this fueling by supplying energy back to the ambient gas. numerical studiessuggest that this feedback is necessary to explain why the properties of smbhsand the formation of bulges are closely related. this intimate link between thesmbh's mass and the large scale dynamics and luminosity of the host has provento be a difficult issue to tackle with simulations due to the inability toresolve all the relevant length scales simultaneously. in this paper wesimulate smbh growth at high-resolution with {\it flash}, accounting for thegravitational focusing effects of nuclear star clusters (nscs), which appear tobe ubiquitous in galactic nuclei. in the simulations, the nsc core is resolvedby a minimum cell size of about 0.001 pc or approximately $10^{-3}$ of thecluster's radius. we discuss the conditions required for effective gasfunneling to occur, which are mainly dominated by a relationship between nscvelocity dispersion and the local sound speed, and provide a sub-gridprescription for the augmentation of central smbh accretion rates in thepresence of nscs. for the conditions expected to persist in the centers ofmerging galaxies, the resultant large central gas densities in nscs shouldproduce drastically enhanced embedded smbh accretion rates - up to an order ofmagnitude increase can be achieved for gas properties resembling those inlarge-scale galaxy merger simulations. this will naturally result in fasterblack hole growth rates and higher luminosities than predicted by the commonlyused bondi-hoyle-lyttleton accretion formalism.

0805.1557	grb 080319b: a naked-eye stellar blast from the distant universe	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) release copious amounts of energyacross the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and so provide a window into theprocess of black hole formation from the collapse of a massive star. over thelast forty years, our understanding of the grb phenomenon has progresseddramatically; nevertheless, fortuitous circumstances occasionally arise thatprovide access to a regime not yet probed. grb 080319b presented such anopportunity, with extraordinarily bright prompt optical emission that peaked ata visual magnitude of 5.3, making it briefly visible with the naked eye. it wascaptured in exquisite detail by wide-field telescopes, imaging the burstlocation from before the time of the explosion. the combination of these uniqueoptical data with simultaneous gamma-ray observations provides powerfuldiagnostics of the detailed physics of this explosion within seconds of itsformation. here we show that the prompt optical and gamma-ray emissions fromthis event likely arise from different spectral components within the samephysical region located at a large distance from the source, implying anextremely relativistic outflow. the chromatic behaviour of the broadbandafterglow is consistent with viewing the grb down the very narrow inner core ofa two-component jet that is expanding into a wind-like environment consistentwith the massive star origin of long grbs. these circumstances can explain theextreme properties of this grb.

astro-ph;0004176	redshifts for 220 batse gamma-ray bursts determined by variability and  the cosmological consequences	we show that the time variability of a gamma-ray burst (grb) appears to becorrelated with the absolute luminosity of the burst: smooth bursts areintrinsically less luminous. this cepheid-like relationship can be used todetermine the redshift of a grb from parameters measured solely at gamma-rayenergies. the relationship is based on only seven events at present and needsto be further confirmed with more events. we present the details of convertinggrb observables to luminosities and redshifts for 220 bright, long grbs fromthe burst and transient source experiment (batse) and explore the cosmologicalconsequences. in particular, we derive the grb rate as a function of $z$without assuming either a luminosity function or that the grb rate follows thestar formation rate (sfr). we find that the grb formation rate scales as(1+z)^{3.3 \pm 0.3}. the observations used to derive the sfr can be stronglyaffected by dust for z &gt; 2 whereas grb observations are not. if grbs trace starformation, then our results indicate that the sfr does not peak at z\sim 2 butinstead continues to increase until z \sim 10. we have used the burst formationrate to correct the observed grb luminosity function for the incompleteness dueto the detection threshold, resulting in a luminosity function with a power lawindex of \sim -2.3 that slightly rolls over at low luminosities. the reality ofour variability--luminosity relationship requires confirmation but, if valid,will provide a powerful tool for studying both grbs and the early universe.

0808.2143	tidal disruption and ignition of white dwarfs by moderately massive  black holes	we present a numerical investigation of the tidal disruption of white dwarfsby moderately massive black holes, with particular reference to the centers ofdwarf galaxies and globular clusters. special attention is given to the fate ofwhite dwarfs of all masses that approach the black hole close enough to bedisrupted and severely compressed to such extent that explosive nuclear burningcan be triggered. consistent modeling of the gas dynamics together with thenuclear reactions allows for a realistic determination of the explosive energyrelease. in the most favorable cases, the nuclear energy release may becomparable to that of typical type ia supernovae. although the explosion willincrease the mass fraction escaping on hyperbolic orbits, a good fraction ofthe debris remains to be swallowed by the hole, causing a bright soft x-rayflare lasting for about a year. such transient signatures, if detected, wouldbe a compelling testimony for the presence of a moderately mass black hole(below $10^5 m_\odot$).

astro-ph;0205241	on the progenitor of the type ic supernova 2002ap	this letter presents wide-field optical and and nir ubvri,halpha,k' images ofthe galaxy m74 which were taken between 0.6-8.3 years before the discovery ofthe type ic sn2002ap. we have located the position of the sn on these imageswith an accuracy of 0.3''. we find no sign of a progenitor object on any of theimages. the deepest of these images is the b-band exposure which has asensitivity limit corresponding to an absolute magnitude of m_b &lt;= -6.3. fromour observed limits, we rule out as the progenitor all evolved states of singlestars with initial masses greater than 20msol unless the wr phase has beenentered. two popular theories for the origin of type ic sne are the corecollapse of massive stars when they are in the wr phase, or the core collapseof a massive star in an interacting binary which has had its envelope strippedthrough mass transfer. our prediscovery images are sensitive only to the mostluminous ~30% of wr stars, leaving a substantial fraction of typical wr starsas viable progenitors. the energetics measured from modelling the spectralevolution of sn 2002ap suggest an explosion of a 5msol c+o core. while wr starsgenerally have measured final masses greater than this, the uncertaintiesassociated with the explosion model, stellar evolutionary calculations and massmeasurements suggest we cannot definitively rule out a wr star progenitor. thealternative scenario is that the progenitor was a star of initial mass20-25msol which was part of an interacting binary. we discuss futureobservations which will provide further constraints on the nature of theprogenitor.

astro-ph;0210524	flaring up: radio diagnostics of the kinematic, hydrodynamic and  environmental properties of grbs	the specific incidence of radio flares appears to be significantly largerthan that of the prompt optical emission. this abundance, coupled with thereverse shock interpretation suggests that radio flares add a unique probe onthe physics of grb shocks. motivated thus, we estimate the strength of thereverse shock expected for bursts in which multi-wavelength observations haveallowed the physical parameters of the forward shock to be determined. we useall 6 bursts (980519, 990123, 990510, 991208, 991216, 000418) which are foundto be adiabatic and thus predicted to have a strong reverse shock. we aim toconstrain the hydrodynamic evolution of the reverse shock and the initial bulklorentz factor -- which we found to be between $10^{2}$ and $10^{3}$ and wellabove the lower limits derived from the requirement that gamma-ray bursts beoptically thin to high-energy photons. in half of the cases we improve thedescription of the early afterglow lightcurves by adding a contribution fromthe reverse shock. modelling of this early emission provides the opportunity toinvestigate the immediate surroundings of the burst. for 991216 and 991208, theexpected $1/r^2$ density structure for a stellar wind is not compatible withthe early afterglow lightcurves. considering the radial range relevant to thesegrbs, we discuss the conditions under which the inclusion of a wind terminationshock may resolve the absence of a $1/r^2$ density profile.

astro-ph;0401184	chandra observations of the x-ray environs of sn 1998bw/grb 980425	(abrigded) we report x-ray studies of the environs of sn 1998bw and grb980425 using the chandra x-ray observatory 1281 days after the grb. combiningour observation of the supernova with others of the grb afterglow, a smoothx-ray light curve, spanning ~1300 days, is obtained by assuming the burst andsupernova were coincident at 35.6 mpc. when this x-ray light curve is comparedwith those of the x-ray ``afterglows'' of ordinary grbs, x-ray flashes, andordinary supernovae, evidence emerges for at least two classes of lightcurves,perhaps bounding a continuum. by three to ten years, all these phenomena seemto converge on a common x-ray luminosity, possibly indicative of the supernovaunderlying them all. this convergence strengthens the conclusion that sn 1998bwand grb 980425 took place in the same object. one possible explanation for thetwo classes is a (nearly) standard grb observed at different angles, in whichcase x-ray afterglows with intermediate luminosities should eventually bediscovered. finally, we comment on the contribution of grb afterglows to theulx source population.

astro-ph;0402240	on the afterglow of the x-ray flash of july 23 2003: photometric  evidence for an off-axis gamma-ray burst with an associated supernova?	we present optical and near-infrared follow-up observations of the x-rayflash (xrf) of july 23 2003. our observations in the r-band cover the temporalrange from 4.2 h to 64 days after the high energy event. we also present theresults of multicolor imaging extending to the k-band on three epochs. thelightcurve of the r-band afterglow the first week after the burst is similar tothe lightcurve for long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs), i.e., a brokenpower-law with a late time slope of alpha=-2.0 (f_nu propto t^alpha).furthermore, the spectral energy distribution (sed) has a power-law (f_nupropto nu^beta) shape with slope beta=-1.0. however, the decay slope at t&lt;1 dayis shallow, consistent with zero. this is in qualitative agreement with theprediction that xrfs are off-axis classical grbs. after the first week there isa strong bump in the lightcurve, which peaks at around 16 days. the sed afterthe peak becomes significantly redder. we discuss the possible interpretationsof this bump, and conclude that an underlying supernova is the most likelyexplanation since no other model appears consistent with the evolution of thesed. finally, we present deep spectroscopy of the burst both in the afterglowand in the bump phase. a firm upper limit of z=2.3 is placed on the redshift ofxrf030723 from the lack of ly-alpha forest lines in the spectrum of theafterglow. the lack of significant absorption and emission lines in either ofthe two spectra excludes a spectroscopic redshift determination.

astro-ph;0406233	the submm properties of grb host galaxies	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) accompany the deaths of some massivestars and hence, since massive stars are short lived, are a tracer of starformation activity. given that grbs are bright enough to be seen to very highredshifts, and detected even in dusty environments, they should thereforeprovide a powerful probe of the global star formation history of the universe.the potential of this approach can be investigated via submm photometry of grbhost galaxies. submm luminosity also correlates with star formation rate, sothe distribution of host galaxy submm fluxes should allow us to test the twomethods for consistency. here, we report new jcmt/scuba 850 micron measurementsfor 15 grb hosts. combining these data with results from previous studies weconstruct a sample of 21 hosts with &lt;1.4 mjy errors. we show that thedistribution of apparent 850 micron flux densities of this sample is reasonablyconsistent with model predictions, but there is tentative evidence of a dearthof submm bright (&gt;4 mjy) galaxies. furthermore, the optical/infrared propertiesof the submm brightest grb hosts are not typical of the galaxy populationselected in submm surveys, although the sample size is still small. possibleselection effects and physical mechanisms which may explain these discrepanciesare discussed.

astro-ph;0503030	gamma-ray observations of a giant flare from the magnetar sgr 1806-20	magnetars comprise two classes of rotating neutron stars (soft gammarepeaters (sgrs) and anomalous x-ray pulsars), whose x-ray emission is poweredby an ultrastrong magnetic field, b ~ 10^15 g. occasionally sgrs enter intoactive episodes producing many short x-ray bursts; extremely rarely (about onceper 50 years per source), sgrs emit a giant flare, an event with total energyat least 1000 times higher than their typical bursts. here we report that, on2004 december 27, sgr 1806-20 emitted the brightest extra-solar transient eventever recorded, even surpassing the full moon brightness for 0.2 seconds. thetotal (isotropic) flare energy is 2x10^46 erg, 100 times higher than the onlytwo previous events, making this flare a once in a century event. this colossalenergy release likely occurred during a catastrophic reconfiguration of themagnetar's magnetic field. such an event would have resembled a short, hardgamma ray burst (grb) if it had occurred within 40 mpc, suggesting thatextragalactic sgr flares may indeed form a subclass of grbs.

astro-ph;0503251	diagnosing the outflow from the sgr 1806-20 giant flare with radio  observations	on 2004 dec. 27, the soft gamma repeater (sgr) 1806-20 emitted the brightestgiant flare (gf) ever detected from an sgr, with an (isotropic) energy release$\sim 100$ times greater than the only two other known sgr gfs. it was followedby a very bright, fading radio afterglow. extensive follow-up radioobservations provided a wealth of information with unprecedented astrometricprecision, revealing the temporal evolution of the source size, along withdensely sampled light curves and spectra. here we expand on our previous workon this source, by explaining these observations within one self-consistentdynamical model. in this scenario, the early radio emission is due to theoutflow ejected during the gf energizing a thin shell surrounding apre-existing cavity, where the observed steep temporal decay of the radioemission seen beginning on day 9 is attributed to the adiabatic cooling of theshocked shell. the shocked ejecta and external shell move outward together,driving a forward shock into the ambient medium, and are eventually deceleratedby a reverse shock. as we show in gelfand et al. (2005), the radio emissionfrom the shocked external medium naturally peaks when significant decelerationoccurs, and then decays relatively slowly. the dynamical modeling of thecollision between the ejecta and the external shell together with the observedevolution of the source size (which is nicely reproduced in our model) suggestthat most of the energy in the outflow was in mildly relativistic material,with an initial expansion velocity $v/c \lesssim 0.7d_{15}$, for a distance of$15d_{15}$ kpc to sgr 1806-20. an initially highly relativistic outflow wouldnot have produced a long coasting phase at a mildly relativistic expansionvelocity, as was observed.

astro-ph;0505480	closing in on a short-hard burst progenitor: constraints from early-time  optical imaging and spectroscopy of a possible host galaxy of grb 050509b	the localization of the short-duration, hard-spectrum grb 050509b was awatershed event. thanks to the nearly immediate relay of the grb position byswift, we began imaging the grb field 8 minutes after the burst and continuedfor the following 8 days. no convincing optical/infrared candidate afterglow orsupernova was found for the object. we present a re-analysis of the xrtafterglow and find an absolute position that is ~4" to the west of the xrtposition reported previously. close to this position is a bright ellipticalgalaxy with redshift z=0.2248, about 1' from the center of a rich cluster ofgalaxies. based on positional coincidences, the grb and the bright ellipticalare likely to be physically related. we thus have discovered evidence that atleast some short-duration, hard-spectra grbs arise at cosmological distances.however, while grb 050509b was underluminous compared to long-duration grbs, wedemonstrate that the ratio of the blast-wave energy to the gamma-ray energy isconsistent with that of long-duration grbs. based on this analysis, on thelocation of the grb (40 +- 13 kpc from a bright galaxy), on the galaxy type(elliptical), and the lack of a coincident supernova, we suggest that there isnow observational consistency with the hypothesis that short-hard bursts ariseduring the merger of a compact binary. we limit the properties of ali-paczynski ''mini-supernova.'' other progenitor models are still viable, andadditional rapidly localized bursts from the swift mission will undoubtedlyhelp to further clarify the progenitor picture.

astro-ph;0508332	evidence for a canonical grb afterglow light curve in the swift/xrt data	we present new observations of the early x-ray afterglows of the first 27gamma-ray bursts (grbs) detected with the swift x-ray telescope (xrt). theearly x-ray afterglows show a canonical behavior, where the light curve broadlyconsists of three distinct power law segments: (i) an initial very steep decay(t^{-alpha} with 3&lt;alpha_1&lt;5), followed by (ii) a very shallow decay(0.2&lt;alpha_2&lt;0.8), and finally (iii) a somewhat steeper decay (1&lt;alpha_3&lt;1.5).these power law segments are separated by two corresponding break times,300s&lt;t_{break,1}&lt;500s and 10^3s&lt;t_{break,2}&lt;10^4s. on top of this canonicalbehavior of the early x-ray light curve, many events have superimposed x-rayflares, which are most likely caused by internal shocks due to long lastingsporadic activity of the central engine, up to several hours after the grb. wefind that the initial steep decay is consistent with it being the tail of theprompt emission, from photons that are radiated at large angles relative to ourline of sight. the first break in the light curve (t_{break,1}) takes placewhen the forward shock emission becomes dominant, with the intermediate shallowflux decay (alpha_2) likely caused by the continuous energy injection into theexternal shock. when this energy injection stops, a second break is thenobserved in the light curve (t_{break,2}). this energy injection increases theenergy of the afterglow shock by at least a factor of f&gt;4, and augments thealready severe requirements for the efficiency of the prompt gamma-rayemission.

astro-ph;0510022	the galaxy hosts and large-scale environments of short-hard gamma-ray  bursts	the rapid succession of discovery of short--duration hard--spectrum grbs hasled to unprecedented insights into the energetics of the explosion and natureof the progenitors. yet short of the detection of a smoking gun, like a burstof coincident gravitational radiation or a li-paczynski mini-supernova, it isunlikely that a definitive claim can be made for the progenitors. as was thecase with long--duration soft--spectrum grbs, however, the expectation is thata systematic study of the hosts and the locations of short grbs could begin toyield fundamental clues about their nature. we present the first aggregatestudy of the host galaxies of short--duration hard--spectrum grbs. inparticular, we present the gemini--north and keck discovery spectra of thegalaxies that hosted three short grbs and a moderate--resolution (r~6000)spectrum of a fourth host. we find that these short--hard grbs originate in avariety of low-redshift (z&lt;1) environments that differ substantially from thoseof long--soft grbs, both on individual galaxy scales and on galaxy--clusterscales. specifically, three of the bursts are found to be associated with oldand massive galaxies with no current (&lt; 0.1 msol/hr) or recent star formation.two of these galaxies are located within a cluster environment. theseobservations support an origin from the merger of compact stellar remnants,such as double neutron stars of a neutron star--black hole binary. the fourthevent, in contrast, occurred within a dwarf galaxy with a star formation rateexceeding 0.5 msol/yr. therefore, it appears that like supernovae of type ia,the progenitors of short--hard bursts are created in all galaxy types,suggesting a corresponding class with a wide distribution of delay timesbetween formation and explosion.

astro-ph;0603530	an optical supernova associated with the x-ray flash xrf 060218	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are associated with type ic supernovaethat are more luminous than average and that eject material at very highvelocities. less-luminous supernovae were not hitherto known to be associatedwith grbs, and therefore grb-supernovae were thought to be rare events. whetherx-ray flashes - analogues of grbs, but with lower luminosities and fewergamma-rays - can also be associated with supernovae, and whether they areintrinsically 'weak' events or typical grbs viewed off the axis of the burst,is unclear. here we report the optical discovery and follow-up observations ofthe type ic supernova sn 2006aj associated with x-ray flash xrf 060218.supernova 2006aj is intrinsically less luminous than the grb-supernovae, butmore luminous than many supernovae not accompanied by a grb. the ejectavelocities derived from our spectra are intermediate between these two groups,which is consistent with the weakness of both the grb output and the supernovaradio flux. our data, combined with radio and x-ray observations, suggest thatxrf 060218 is an intrinsically weak and soft event, rather than a classical grbobserved off-axis. this extends the grb-supernova connection to x-ray flashesand fainter supernovae, implying a common origin. events such as xrf 060218 areprobably more numerous than grb-supernovae.

astro-ph;0607110	prompt and afterglow emission properties of gamma-ray bursts with  spectroscopically identified supernovae	we present a detailed spectral analysis of the prompt and afterglow emissionof four nearby long-soft gamma-ray bursts (grbs 980425, 030329, 031203, and060218) that were spectroscopically found to be associated with type icsupernovae, and compare them to the general grb population. for each event, weinvestigate the spectral and luminosity evolution, and estimate the totalenergy budget based upon broadband observations. the observational inventoryfor these events has become rich enough to allow estimates of their energycontent in relativistic and sub-relativistic form. the result is a globalportrait of the effects of the physical processes responsible for producinglong-soft grbs. in particular, we find that the values of the energy releasedin mildly relativistic outflows appears to have a significantly smaller scatterthan those found in highly relativistic ejecta. this is consistent with apicture in which the energy released inside the progenitor star is roughlystandard, while the fraction of that energy that ends up in highly relativisticejecta outside the star can vary dramatically between different events.

astro-ph;9802200	gamma-ray burst and relativistic shells: the surface filling factor	the variability observed in many complex gamma-ray bursts (grbs) isinconsistent with causally connected variations in a single, symmetric,relativistic shell interacting with the ambient material ("external shocks").rather, the symmetry of the shell must be broken on an angular scale muchsmaller than gamma^{-1} where gamma is the bulk lorentz factor for the shell.the observed variability in the external shock models arises from the number ofcausally connected regions that (randomly) become active. we define the"surface filling factor" to be the ratio of the area of causally connectedregions that become active to the observable area of the shell. from theobserved variability in 52 batse bursts, we estimate the surface filling factorto be typically 0.005 although some values are near unity. we find that thesurface filling factor is about 0.1 delta t/t in both the constant gamma phase(which probably produces the grb) and the deaccelerating phase (which probablyproduces the x-ray afterglows). here, \delta t is a typical time scale ofvariability and t is the time since the initial signal. we analyze the 2 hrflare seen by asca 36 hr after the grb and conclude that the surface fillingfactor must be small (0.001) in the x-ray afterglow phase as well. explanationsfor low surface filling factor can either require more or less energy (by afactor of about 1000) compared to that expected for a symmetric shell.

astro-ph;9812426	temporal evolution of the pulse width in grbs	many cosmological models of grbs envision the energy source to be acataclysmic stellar event leading to a relativistically expanding fireball.particles are thought to be accelerated at shocks and produce nonthermalradiation. the highly variable temporal structure observed in most grbs hassignificantly constrained models. by using different methods of statisticalanalysis in the time domain we show that the width of the pulses in grbs timehistories remain remarkably constant throughout the classic grb phase. peaks atthe end of a burst have the same average duration to within a few percent asthe peaks at the start of the burst. for emission sites that lie on arelativistically expanding shell, peaks should grow in duration because ofdeceleration. we find no deceleration over at least 2/3 of the burst duration.for emission sites that occupy a spread of angles on a shell, the curvatureshould cause the later peaks to grow in duration. since we see no such growth,we can limit the total angular size of the shell to be substantially smallerthan \gamma^{-1} where \gamma is the bulk lorentz factor. this lack of temporalevolution of the pulse width should be explained by any fireball shockscenario.

astro-ph;9902007	grb990123: evidence that the gamma rays come from a central engine	grb990123 was a long complex gamma-ray burst with an optical transient thatstarted early within the gamma-ray phase. the peak and power law decay of theearly optical emission strongly indicates the presence of a deceleratingrelativistic shell during that phase. prior to this burst, it was not known ifthe shell decelerated during the burst, so an external shock origin for thegamma rays was still possible. if the gamma-rays are produced in the externalshock, then the pulse widths should reflect the observed deceleration of theshell and increase by about 2.3. we analyze the fine time structure observed inthe gamma-ray data from batse and determine that the width of the peaks do notincrease as expected for a decelerating shell; the later pulses are, at most, afactor of 1.15 longer than the earlier pulses. we also analyze the variabilityto determine what fraction of the shell's surface could be involved in theproduction of the gamma rays, the so-called surface filling factor. forgrb990123 we find a filling factor of 0.008. the lack of pulse width evolutioneliminates the only remaining kinematically acceptable external shockexplanation for the gamma-ray phase and, thus, the gamma rays must originate ata central engine.

astro-ph;9906125	the observational basis for central engines in gamma ray bursts	we review the observational differences between gamma-ray bursts occurring ona single shell (such as in the external shock model) and multiple shells (suchas in the internal shock model). we do not argue against external shocks or forinternal shocks, as such, but rather against a single shell and for a centralengine that is small enough to produce the typical grb time history withoutviolating causality or other kinematic limits. the expected profile and averagespectral evolution from a single shell is compared to the average of manybursts and found to be different. the presence of gaps in many gamma-ray burstsis a strong argument against a single shell because an observer should see manycausally disconnected regions at any one time.the rapid variability is alsodifficult to explain from a single shell because of the large number ofcausally disconnected regions. the pulse width as a function of time in a burstshould increase because there is a one-to-one relationship between arrival timeand the off-axis angle of emission. the observations show that the pulse widthdoes not increase with time. finally, in grb990123 there is evidence fordeceleration from the simultaneous optical observations, yet the gamma-raypulses show no lengthening of their pulse structure. we conclude that gamma-raybursts are caused by a relatively small central engine.

astro-ph;9909299	gamma-ray bursts as internal shocks caused by deceleration	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been thought to originate from internal shocksthat occur about 10^{15} cm from a central site. the shells responsible forthese shocks merge together and undergo an external shock at about 10^{17} cm,producing the afterglows. we include deceleration in our model of internalshocks and find that, for values of the lorentz factor greater than 10^3,deceleration is an effective catalyst for converting the bulk motion energyinto radiation during the grb phase. substantial internal energy occurs becauseother shells run into the back of the first shell which has decelerated andbecause the first shell must energize the interstellar medium. whereas internalshocks without deceleration are about 25% efficient, we can convert up to 85%of the bulk motion energy during the grb phase. we demonstrate that theresulting time history can have three components. the first is due to internalshocks, excluding those that involve the first shell. this component producesnarrow peaks throughout the time history. the second is due to internal shocksinvolving the first shell, and it produces progressively wider and wider peaksbut they tend to be hidden in a slowly varying background in the event. thethird component is from energizing the interstellar medium. it is very smoothand may contribute mostly to a lower energy bandpass than the batse experiment.there have been claims of upper limits on the possible lorentz factor becausethe deceleration must occur at greater radii than the internal shocks to avoidmaking progressively wider peaks. we do not find this to be the case, and thelorentz factor (and efficiency) can be much larger.

astro-ph;9910273	pulse width evolution in grbs: evidence for internal shocks	many cosmological models of grbs envision the energy source to be acataclysmic stellar event leading to a relativistically expanding fireball.particles are thought to be accelerated at shocks and produce nonthermalradiation. the highly variable temporal structure observed in most grbs hassignificantly constrained models. by using different methods of statisticalanalysis in the time domain we find that the width of the large amplitudepulses in grb time histories remain remarkably constant throughout the classicgrb phase. this is also true for small amplitude pulses. however, small andlarge pulses do not have the same pulse width within a single time history. wefind a quantitative relationship between pulse amplitude and pulse width: thesmaller amplitude peaks tend to be wider, with amplitude following a power lawwith an index of about -2.8. internal shocks simulated by randomly selectingthe lorentz factor and energy per shell are consistent with a power lawrelationship. this is strong quantitative evidence that grbs are, indeed,caused by internal shocks. the dependency of the width-vs.-intensityrelationship on the maximum lorentz factor provides a way to estimate thatelusive parameter. our observed power law index indicates that \gamma_{max} isless or equal than 10^3. we also interpret the narrowness of the pulse widthdistribution as indicating that the emission, that occurs when one shell overtakes another, is produced over a small range of distances from the centralsite.

0810.1478	sn 2001em: not so fast	sn 2001em is a peculiar supernova, originally classified as type ib/c. abouttwo years after the sn it was detected in the radio, showing a rising radioflux with an optically thin spectral slope, and it also displayed a large x-rayluminosity (~10^{41} erg/s). thus it was suspected to harbor a decelerating (bythen, mildly) relativistic jet pointing away from us. about 3 years after itsdiscovery the optical spectrum of sn 2001em showed a broad h-alpha line, and itwas therefore reclassified as type iin. here we constrain its proper motion andexpansion velocity by analyzing four epochs of vlbi observations, extending outto 5.4 years after the sn. the supernova is still unresolved 5.4 years afterthe explosion. for the proper motion we obtain (23,000 +/- 30,000) km/s whileour 2-sigma upper limit on the expansion velocity is 6000 km/s. these limitsare somewhat tighter than those derived by bietenholz &amp; bartel, and confirmtheir conclusion that late time emission from sn 2001em, a few years after theexplosion, is not driven by a relativistic jet. vla observations of the radioflux density, at 8.46 ghz, show a decay as t^{-1.23 +/- 0.40} starting ~2.7years after the sn. collectively, the observations suggest interaction of thesn ejecta with a very dense circumstellar medium, though the implied opacityconstraints still present a challenge.

0811.1044	grb 080503: implications of a naked short gamma-ray burst dominated by  extended emission	we report on observations of grb 080503, a short gamma-ray burst with verybright extended emission (about 30 times the gamma-ray fluence of the initialspike) in conjunction with a thorough comparison to other short swift events.in spite of the prompt-emission brightness, however, the optical counterpart isextraordinarily faint, never exceeding 25 mag in deep observations starting at~1 hr after the bat trigger. the optical brightness peaks at ~1 day and thenfalls sharply in a manner similar to the predictions of li &amp; paczynski (1998)for supernova-like emission following compact-binary mergers. however, ashallow spectral index and similar evolution in x-rays inferred from chandraobservations are more consistent with an afterglow interpretation. the extremefaintness of this probable afterglow relative to the bright gamma-ray emissionargues for a very low-density medium surrounding the burst (a "naked" grb),consistent with the lack of a coincident host galaxy down to 28.5 mag in deephst imaging. our observations reinforce the notion that short grbs generallyoccur outside regions of active star formation, but demonstrate that in somecases the luminosity of the extended prompt emission can greatly exceed that ofthe short spike, which may constrain theoretical interpretation of this classof events. because most previous bat short bursts without observed extendedemission are too faint for this signature to have been detectable even if itwere present at typical level, conclusions based solely on the observedpresence or absence of extended emission in the existing swift sample arepremature.

0811.2129	tidally-induced thermonuclear supernovae	we discuss the results of 3d simulations of tidal disruptions of white dwarfsby moderate-mass black holes as they may exist in the cores of globularclusters or dwarf galaxies. our simulations follow self-consistently thehydrodynamic and nuclear evolution from the initial parabolic orbit over thedisruption to the build-up of an accretion disk around the black hole. forstrong enough encounters (pericentre distances smaller than about 1/3 of thetidal radius) the tidal compression is reversed by a shock and finally resultsin a thermonuclear explosion. these explosions are not restricted to progenitormasses close to the chandrasekhar limit, we find exploding examples throughoutthe whole white dwarf mass range. there is, however, a restriction on themasses of the involved black holes: black holes more massive than $2\times10^5$ m$_\odot$ swallow a typical 0.6 m$_\odot$ dwarf before their tidal forcescan overwhelm the star's self-gravity. therefore, this mechanism ischaracteristic for black holes of moderate masses. the material that remainsbound to the black hole settles into an accretion disk and produces an x-rayflare close to the eddington limit of $l_{\rm edd} \simeq 10^{41} {\rm erg/s}m_{\rm bh}/1000 m$_\odot$), typically lasting for a few months. the combinationof a peculiar thermonuclear supernova together with an x-ray flare thuswhistle-blows the existence of such moderate-mass black holes. the nextgeneration of wide field space-based instruments should be able to detect suchevents.
