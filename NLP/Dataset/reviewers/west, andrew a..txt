0901.1698	the hd 40307 planetary system: super-earths or mini-neptunes?	three planets with minimum masses less than 10 earth masses orbit the star hd40307, suggesting these planets may be rocky. however, with only radialvelocity data, it is impossible to determine if these planets are rocky orgaseous. here we exploit various dynamical features of the system in order toassess the physical properties of the planets. observations allow for circularorbits, but a numerical integration shows that the eccentricities must be atleast 0.0001. also, planets b and c are so close to the star that tidal effectsare significant. if planet b has tidal parameters similar to the terrestrialplanets in the solar system and a remnant eccentricity larger than 0.001, then,going back in time, the system would have been unstable within the lifetime ofthe star (which we estimate to be 6.1 +/- 1.6 gyr). moreover, if theeccentricities are that large and the inner planet is rocky, then its tidalheating may be an order of magnitude greater than extremely volcanic io, on aper unit surface area basis. if planet b is not terrestrial, e.g. neptune-like,these physical constraints would not apply. this analysis suggests the planetsare not terrestrial-like, and are more like our giant planets. in either case,we find that the planets probably formed at larger radii and migrated early-on(via disk interactions) into their current orbits. this study demonstrates howthe orbital and dynamical properties of exoplanet systems may be used toconstrain the planets' physical properties.

0905.1953	modeling the grb host galaxy mass distribution: are grbs unbiased  tracers of star formation?	we model the mass distribution of long gamma-ray burst (grb) host galaxiesgiven recent results suggesting that grbs occur in low metallicityenvironments. by utilizing measurements of the redshift evolution of themass-metallicity (m-z) relationship for galaxies, along with a sharp hostmetallicity cut-off suggested by modjaz and collaborators, we estimate an upperlimit on the stellar mass of a galaxy that can efficiently produce a grb as afunction of redshift. by employing consistent abundance indicators, we findthat sub-solar metallicity cut-offs effectively limit grbs to low stellar massspirals and dwarf galaxies at low redshift. at higher redshifts, as the averagemetallicity of galaxies in the universe falls, the mass range of galaxiescapable of hosting a grb broadens, with an upper bound approaching the mass ofeven the largest spiral galaxies. we compare these predicted limits to thegrowing number of published grb host masses and find that extremely lowmetallicity cut-offs of 0.1 to 0.5 solar are effectively ruled out by a largenumber of intermediate mass galaxies at low redshift. a mass function thatincludes a smooth decrease in the efficiency of producing grbs in galaxies ofmetallicity above 12+log(o/h)_(kk04) ~ 8.7 can, however, accommodate a majorityof the measured host galaxy masses. we find that at z ~ 1, the peak in theobserved grb host mass distribution is inconsistent with the expected peak inthe mass of galaxies harboring most of the star formation. this suggests thatgrbs are metallicity biased tracers of star formation at low and intermediateredshifts, although our model predicts that this bias should disappear athigher redshifts due to the evolving metallicity content of the universe.

0906.3030	a sample of candidate radio stars in first and sdss	we conduct a search for radio stars by combining radio and optical data fromthe faint images of the radio sky at twenty cm survey (first) and the sloandigital sky survey (sdss). the faint limit of sdss makes possible a homogeneoussearch for radio emission from stars of low optical luminosity. we select asample of 112 candidate radio stars in the magnitude range $15&lt;i\lesssim19.1$and with radio flux $s_{20}\geq1.25$mjy, from about 7000 deg$^2$ of sky. theselection criteria are positional coincidence within $1\arcsec$, radio andoptical point source morphology, and an sdss spectrum classified as stellar.the sample contamination is estimated by random matching to be $108\pm13$,suggesting that at most a small fraction of the selected candidates are genuineradio stars. therefore, we rule out a very rare population of extremelyradio-loud stars: no more than 1.2 of every million stars in the magnituderange $15&lt;i&lt;19.1$ stars has radio flux $s_{20}\geq1.25$ mjy. we investigate theoptical and radio colors of the sample to find candidates that show the largestlikelihood of being real radio stars. the significant outliers from the stellarlocus, as well as the magnetically active stars, are the best candidates forfollow-up radio observations. we conclude that, while the present wide-arearadio surveys are not sensitive enough to provide homogeneous samples of theextremely rare radio stars, upcoming surveys which exploit the greatsensitivity of current and planned telescopes do have sufficient sensitivityand will allow the properties of this class of object to be investigated indetail.

0910.4965	hi selected galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey i: optical data	we present the optical data for 195 hi-selected galaxies that fall withinboth the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and the parkes equatorial survey (es).the photometric quantities have been independently recomputed for our sampleusing a new photometric pipeline optimized for large galaxies, thus correctingfor sdss's limited reliability for automatic photometry of angularly large orlow surface brightness (lsb) galaxies. we outline the magnitude of theuncertainty in the sdss catalog-level photometry and derive a quantitativemethod for correcting the over-sky subtraction in the sdss photometricpipeline. the main thrust of this paper is to present the es/sdss sample anddiscuss the methods behind the improved photometry, which will be used infuture scientific analysis. we present the overall optical properties of thesample and briefly compare to a volume-limited, optically-selected sample.compared to the optically-selected sdss sample (in the similar volume),hi-selected galaxies are bluer and more luminous (fewer dwarf ellipticals andmore star formation). however, compared to typical sdss galaxy studies, whichhave their own selection effects, our sample is bluer, fainter and lessmassive.

0910.4966	hi selected galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ii: the colors of  gas-rich galaxies	we utilize color information for an hi-selected sample of 195 galaxies toexplore the star formation histories and physical conditions that produce theobserved colors. we show that the hi selection creates a significant offsettowards bluer colors that can be explained by enhanced recent bursts of starformation. there is also no obvious color bimodality, because the hi selectionrestricts the sample to bluer, actively star forming systems, diminishing theimportance of the red sequence. rising star formation rates are still requiredto explain the colors of galaxies bluer than g-r &lt; 0.3. we also demonstratethat the colors of the bluest galaxies in our sample are dominated by emissionlines and that stellar population synthesis models alone (without emissionlines) are not adequate for reproducing many of the galaxy colors. theseemission lines produce large changes in the r-i colors but leave the g-r colorlargely unchanged. in addition, we find an increase in the dispersion of galaxycolors at low masses that may be the result of a change in the star formationprocess in low-mass galaxies.

0911.1363	the brown dwarf kinematics project (bdkp). ii. details on nine wide  common proper motion very low-mass companions to nearby stars	we report on nine wide common proper motion systems containing late-type m,l, or t companions. we confirm six previously reported companions, and identifythree new systems. the ages of these systems are determined using diagnosticsfor both stellar primaries and low--mass secondaries and masses for thesecondaries are inferred using evolutionary models. of our three newdiscoveries, the m3+t6.5 pair g 204-39 and sdss j1758+4633 has an ageconstrained to 0.5-1.5 gyr making the secondary a potentially useful browndwarf benchmark. the g5+l4 pair g 200-28 and sdss j1416+5006 has a projectedseparation of ~25,000 au making it one of the widest and lowest binding energysystems known to date. the system containing nltt 2274 and sdss j0041+1341 isan older m4+l0 (&gt;4.5 gyr) pair which shows halpha activity in the secondary butnot the primary making it a useful tracer of age/mass/activity trends. we finda resolved binary frequency for widely-separated (&gt; 100 au) low--masscompanions (i.e. at least a triple system) which is at least twice thefrequency found for the field ultracool dwarf population. the ratio of triplesto binaries and quadruples to binaries is also high for this sample: 3:5 and1:4, respectively, compared to 8-parsec sample values of 1:4 and 1:26. theadditional components in these wide companion systems indicates a formationmechanism that requires a third or fourth component to maintain gravitationalstability or facilitate the exchange of angular momentum. the binding energiesfor the nine multiples discussed in this text are among the lowest known forwide low-mass systems, suggesting that weakly bound, low--to--intermediate mass(0.2m_sun &lt; m_tot &lt;1.0m_sun) multiples can form and survive to exist in thefield (1-8 gyr).

1001.3402	colors and kinematics of l dwarfs from the sloan digital sky survey	we present a sample of 484 l dwarfs, 210 of which are newly discovered fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 7 spectroscopic database. wecombine this sample with known l dwarfs to investigate their $izjhk_s$ colors.our spectroscopically selected sample has $\sim$0.1 magnitude bluer median$j-k_s$ colors at a given spectral type (for l0 to l4) than previously known ldwarfs, which reflects a bias towards redder l dwarfs in past selectioncriteria. we present photometric distance relations based on $i-z$ and $i-j$colors and derive distances to our l dwarf sample. we combine the distanceswith sdss/2mass proper motions in order to examine the tangential velocities.for the majority of our spectroscopic sample, we measured radial velocities andpresent three dimensional kinematics. we also provide h$\alpha$ detections forthe fraction of our sample with sufficient quality spectra. comparison of thevelocities of our l dwarf sample to a kinematic model shows evidence for bothcold and hot dynamical populations, consistent with young and old diskcomponents. the dispersions of these components are similar to those found form dwarfs. we also show that $j-k_s$ color is correlated with velocitydispersion, confirming a relationship between $j-k_s$ color and age.

0707.3813	testing cold dark matter with the low mass tully-fisher relation	the galaxy circular velocity function at small masses is related to thematter power spectrum on small scales. although this function is well-studiedfor local group dwarfs, theoretical predictions and observational measurementsare difficult for satellite galaxies, because of ram pressure and tidalstripping. by contrast, isolated dwarf galaxies are less affected by theseprocesses, and almost always have enough 21cm emission to trace their dynamicsrobustly. here, we test cold dark matter cosmology using isolated low massdwarf galaxies from the sdss with measured 21cm widths. we find consistencybetween the predicted and observed number density of isolated galaxies down tocircular velocities of 50 km/s. our technique yields a direct test ofsmall-scale cosmology independent of the lyman-alpha forest power spectrum, butour sample is currently statistically less powerful: warm dark matter particlesheavier than 0.5 kev cannot be ruled out. our major systematic uncertainty isthe surface brightness limit of the sdss. blind hi surveys, such as the alfalfasurvey on arecibo, will uncover a larger number of isolated low mass galaxiesand increase the power of our constraints. with our sample, we also find thatthe tully-fisher relation for dwarf galaxies is a strong function ofenvironment, and that the baryonic fraction is only a weak function of mass.these results suggest that for dwarf galaxies, gas loss is dominated byexternal, not internal, processes.

1003.3447	the enigmatic young low-mass variable twa 30	twa 30 is a remarkable young (7+/-3 myr), low-mass (0.12+/-0.04 msun),late-type star (m5+/-1) residing 42+/-2 pc away from the sun in the tw hydraeassociation. it shows strong outflow spectral signatures such as [s ii], [o i],[o ii], [o iii], and mg i], while exhibiting weak halpha emission (-6.8+/-1.2angstroms). emission lines of [s ii] and [o i] are common to t tauri starsstill residing in their natal molecular clouds, while [o iii] and mg i]emission lines are incredibly rare in this same population; in the case of twa30, these latter lines may arise from new outflow material colliding into olderoutflow fronts. the weak halpha emission and small radial velocity shifts ofline emission relative to the stellar frame of rest (generally &lt;=10 km/s)suggest that the disk is viewed close to edge-on and that the stellar axis maybe inclined to the disk, similar to the aa tau system, based on its temporalchanges in emission/absorption line strengths/profiles and variable reddening(a_v=1.5-9.0). the strong li absorption (0.61+/-0.13 angstroms) and commonkinematics with members of the twa confirm its age and membership to theassociation. given the properties of this system such as its proximity, lowmass, remarkable outflow signatures, variability, and edge-on configuration,this system is a unique case study at a critical time in disk evolution andplanet-building processes.

1007.3735	the high-order-multiplicity of unusually wide m-dwarf binaries: eleven  new triple and quadruple systems	m-dwarfs in extremely wide binary systems are very rare, and may thus havedifferent formation processes from those found as single stars or closebinaries in the field. in this paper we search for close companions to a newsample of 36 extremely wide m-dwarf binaries, covering a spectral type range ofm1 to m5 and a separation range of 600 - 6500 au. we discover 10 new triplesystems and one new quadruple system. we carefully account for selectioneffects including proper motion, magnitude limits, the detection of closebinaries in the sdss, and other sample biases. the bias-corrected totalhigh-order-multiple fraction is 45% (+18%/-16%) and the bias-correctedincidence of quadruple systems is &lt; 5%, both statistically compatible with thatfound for the more common close m-dwarf multiple systems. almost all thedetected companions have similar masses to their primaries, although two verylow mass companions, including a candidate brown dwarf, are found at relativelylarge separations. we find that the close-binary separation distribution isstrongly peaked towards &lt; 30au separations. there is marginally significantevidence for a change in high-order m-dwarf multiplicity with binding energyand total mass. we also find 2-sigma evidence of an unexpected increasedhigh-order-multiple fraction for the widest targets in our survey, with ahigh-order-multiple fraction of 21% (+17%/-7%) for systems with separations upto 2000au, compared to 77% (+9%/-22%) for systems with separations &gt; 4000au.these results suggest that the very widest m-dwarf binary systems need highermasses to form or to survive.

1009.1158	m dwarf flares from time-resolved sdss spectra	we have identified 63 flares on m dwarfs from the individual componentspectra in the sloan digital sky survey using a novel measurement of emissionline strength called the flare line index. each of the ~38,000 m dwarfs in thesdss low mass star spectroscopic sample of west et al. was observed severaltimes (usually 3-5) in exposures that were typically 9-25 minutes in duration.our criteria allowed us to identify flares that exhibit very strong h-alpha andh-beta emission line strength and/or significant variability in those linesthroughout the course of the exposures. the flares we identified havecharacteristics consistent with flares observed by classical spectroscopicmonitoring. the flare duty cycle for the objects in our sample is found toincrease from 0.02% for early m dwarfs to 3% for late m dwarfs. we find thatthe flare duty cycle is larger in the population near the galactic plane andthat the flare stars are more spatially restricted than the magnetically activebut non-flaring stars. this suggests that flare frequency may be related tostellar age (younger stars are more likely to flare) and that the flare starsare younger than the mean active population.

1009.3272	carma survey toward infrared-bright nearby galaxies (sting): molecular  gas star formation law in ngc4254	this study explores the effects of different assumptions and systematics onthe determination of the local, spatially resolved star formation law. usingfour star formation rate (sfr) tracers (h\alpha with azimuthally averagedextinction correction, mid-infrared 24 micron, combined h\alpha andmid-infrared 24 micron, and combined far-ultraviolet and mid-infrared 24micron), several fitting procedures, and different sampling strategies we probethe relation between sfr and molecular gas at various spatial resolutions andsurface densities within the central 6.5 kpc in the disk of ngc4254. we findthat in the high surface brightness regions of ngc4254 the form of themolecular gas star formation law is robustly determined and approximatelylinear and independent of the assumed fraction of diffuse emission and the sfrtracer employed. when the low surface brightness regions are included, theslope of the star formation law depends primarily on the assumed fraction ofdiffuse emission. in such case, results range from linear when the fraction ofdiffuse emission in the sfr tracer is ~30% or less (or when diffuse emission isremoved in both the star formation and the molecular gas tracer), tosuper-linear when the diffuse fraction is ~50% and above. we find that thetightness of the correlation between gas and star formation varies with thechoice of star formation tracer. the 24 micron sfr tracer by itself shows thetightest correlation with the molecular gas surface density, whereas theh\alpha corrected for extinction using an azimuthally-averaged correction showsthe highest dispersion. we find that for r&lt;0.5r_25 the local star formationefficiency is constant and similar to that observed in other large spirals,with a molecular gas depletion time ~2 gyr.

1011.4060	on the origin of the mass-metallicity relation for grb host galaxies	we investigate the nature of the mass-metallicity (m-z) relation for longgamma-ray burst (lgrb) host galaxies. recent studies suggest that the m-zrelation for local lgrb host galaxies may be systematically offset towardslower metallicities relative to the m-z relation defined by the general starforming galaxy (sdss) population. the nature of this offset is consistent withsuggestions that low metallicity environments may be required to produce highmass progenitors, although the detection of several grbs in high-mass,high-metallicity galaxies challenges the notion of a strict metallicity cut-offfor host galaxies that are capable of producing grbs. we show that the natureof this reported offset may be explained by a recently proposedanti-correlation between the star formation rate (sfr) and the metallicity ofstar forming galaxies. if low metallicity galaxies produce more stars thantheir equally massive, high-metallicity counterparts, then transient eventsthat closely trace the sfr in a galaxy would be more likely to be found inthese low metallicity, low mass galaxies. therefore, the offset between the grband sdss defined m-z relations may be the result of the different methods usedto select their respective galaxy populations, with grbs being biased towardslow metallicity, high sfr, galaxies. we predict that such an offset should notbe expected of transient events that do not closely follow the star formationhistory of their host galaxies, such as short duration grbs and sn ia, butshould be evident in core collapse sne found through upcoming untargetedsurveys.

1011.4909	on the angular momentum evolution of fully-convective stars: rotation  periods for field m-dwarfs from the mearth transit survey	we present rotation period measurements for 41 field m-dwarfs, all of whichhave masses inferred (from their parallaxes and 2mass k-band magnitudes) to bebetween the hydrogen burning limit and 0.35 msol, and thus should remainfully-convective throughout their lifetimes. we measure a wide range ofrotation periods, from 0.28 days to 154 days, with the latter commensurate withthe typical sensitivity limit of our observations. using kinematics as a proxyfor age, we find that the majority of objects likely to be thick disk or halomembers (and hence, on average, older) rotate very slowly, with a median periodof 92 days, compared to 0.7 days for those likely to be thin disk members (onaverage, younger), although there are still some rapid rotators in the thickdisk sample. when combined with literature measurements for m-dwarfs, theseresults indicate an increase in spin-down times with decreasing stellar mass,in agreement with previous work, and that the spin-down time becomes comparableto the age of the thick disk sample below the fully-convective boundary. weadditionally infer that the spin-down must remove a substantial amount ofangular momentum once it begins in order to produce the slow rotators weobserve in the thick disk candidates, suggesting that fully-convective m-dwarfsmay still experience strong winds.

1012.2580	the m4 transition: toward a comprehensive understanding of the  transition into the fully convective regime	the difference in stellar structure above and below spectral type ~m4 isexpected to be a very important one, connected directly or indirectly to avariety of observational phenomena in cool stars---such as rotation, activity,magnetic field generation and topology, timescales for evolution of these, andeven the basic mass-radius relationship. in this cool stars xvi splintersession, we aimed to use the m4 transition as an opportunity for discussionabout the interiors of low-mass stars and the mechanisms which determine theirfundamental properties. by the conclusion of the session, several key pointswere elucidated. although m dwarfs exhibit significant changes across the fullyconvective boundary, this "m4 transition" is not observationally sharp ordiscrete. instead, the properties of m dwarfs (i.e. radius, effectivetemperature, rotation, activity lifetime, magnetic field strength and topology)show smooth changes across m3--m6 spectral types. in addition, a wide range ofstellar masses share similar spectral types around the fully convectivetransition. there appears to be a second transition at m6--m8 spectral types,below which there exists a clear dichotomy of magnetic field topologies.finally, we used the information and ideas presented in the session toconstruct a framework for how the structure of an m dwarf star, born withspecific mass and chemical composition, responds to the presence of itsmagnetic field, itself driven by a feedback process that links the star'srotation, interior structure, and field topology.

1101.3549	the sloan digital sky survey dr7 spectroscopic m dwarf catalog ii:  statistical parallax analysis	we present a statistical parallax analysis of low-mass dwarfs from the sloandigital sky survey (sdss). we calculate absolute r-band magnitudes (m_r) as afunction of color and spectral type, and investigate changes in m_r withlocation in the milky way. we find that magnetically active m dwarfs areintrinsically brighter in m_r than their inactive counterparts at the samecolor or spectral type. metallicity, as traced by the proxy zeta, also affectsm_r, with metal poor stars having fainter absolute magnitudes than highermetallicity m dwarfs at the same color or spectral type. additionally, wemeasure the velocity ellipsoid and solar reflex motion for each subsample of mdwarfs. we find good agreement between our measured solar peculiar motion andprevious results for similar populations, as well as some evidence fordiffering motions of early and late m type populations in u and w velocitiesthat cannot be attributed to asymmetric drift. the reflex solar motion and thevelocity dispersions both show that younger populations, as traced by magneticactivity and location near the galactic plane, have experienced less dynamicalheating. we introduce a new parameter, the independent position altitude (ipa),to investigate populations as a function of vertical height from the galacticplane. m dwarfs at all types exhibit an increase in velocity dispersion whenanalyzed in comparable ipa subgroups.

1102.0280	using m dwarf spectra to map extinction in the local galaxy	we use spectra of more than 56,000 m dwarfs from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) to create a high-latitude extinction map of the local galaxy. ourtechnique compares spectra from the stars in the sdss data release 7 m dwarfsample in low-extinction lines of sight, as determined by schlegel, finkbeiner,&amp; davis, to other sdss m dwarf spectra in order to derive improved distanceestimates and accurate line-of-sight extinctions. unlike most previous studies,which have used a two-color method to determine extinction, we fit extinctioncurves to fluxes across the entire spectral range from 5700 to 9200 {\aa} forevery star in our sample. our result is an extinction map that extends from afew tens of pc to approximately 2 kpc away from the sun. we also use a similartechnique to create a map of r_v values within approximately 1 kpc of the sun,and find they are consistent with the widely accepted diffuse interstellarmedium value of 3.1. using our extinction data, we derive a dust scale heightfor the local galaxy of 119\pm15 parsecs and find evidence for a local dustcavity.

1104.0007	debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation	circumstantial evidence suggests that most known extra-solar planetarysystems are survivors of violent dynamical instabilities. here we explore howgiant planet instabilities affect the formation and survival of terrestrialplanets. we simulate planetary system evolution around sun-like stars frominitial conditions that comprise: an inner disk of planetesimals and planetaryembryos, three giant planets at jupiter-saturn distances, and a massive outerplanetesimal disk. we then calculate dust production rates and debris disk sedsassuming that each planetesimal particle represents an ensemble of smallerbodies in collisional equilibrium. we predict a strong correlation between thepresence of terrestrial planets and debris disks, mediated by the giantplanets. strong giant planet instabilities destroy all rocky material -including fully-formed terrestrial planets if the instabilities occur late -along with the icy planetesimals. stable or weakly unstable systems allowterrestrial planets to accrete and significant dust to be produced in theirouter regions. stars older than ~100 myr with bright cold dust emission (at ~70microns) signpost the dynamically calm environments conducive to efficientterrestrial accretion. we predict that while the typical eccentricities ofterrestrial planets are small, there should exist a novel class of terrestrialplanet system whose single planet undergoes large amplitude oscillations ineccentricity and inclination. by scaling to the observed semimajor axisdistribution of giant exoplanets, we estimate that terrestrial exoplanets inthe same systems should be a few times more abundant at 0.5 au than giant orterrestrial exoplanets at 1 au. finally, we discuss the solar system, whichappears to be unusual in combining a rich terrestrial planet system with a lowdust content.

1105.4117	the formation of kiloparsec-scale hi holes in dwarf galaxies	the origin of kpc-scale holes in the atomic hydrogen (h i) distributions ofsome nearby dwarf irregular galaxies presents an intriguing problem. starformation histories (sfhs) derived from resolved stars give us the uniqueopportunity to study past star forming events that may have helped shape thecurrently visible h i distribution. our sample of five nearby dwarf irregulargalaxies spans over an order of magnitude in both total h i mass and absoluteb-band magnitude and is at the low mass end of previously studied systems. weuse very large array h i line data to estimate the energy required to createthe centrally dominant hole in each galaxy. we compare this energy estimate tothe past energy released by the underlying stellar populations computed fromsfhs derived from data taken with the hubble space telescope. the inferredintegrated stellar energy released within the characteristic ages exceeds ourenergy estimates for creating the holes in all cases, assuming expectedefficiencies. therefore, it appears that stellar feedback provides sufficientenergy to produce the observed holes. however, we find no obvious signature ofsingle star forming events responsible for the observed structures whencomparing the global sfhs of each galaxy in our sample to each other or tothose of dwarf irregular galaxies reported in the literature. we also fail tofind evidence of a central star cluster in fuv or halpha imaging. we concludethat large h i holes are likely formed from multiple generations of starformation and only under suitable interstellar medium conditions.

1110.1630	carma survey toward infrared-bright nearby galaxies (sting) ii:  molecular gas star formation law and depletion time across the blue sequence	we present an analysis of the relationship between molecular gas and currentstar formation rate surface density at sub-kpc and kpc scales in a sample of 14nearby star-forming galaxies. measuring the relationship in the bright, highmolecular gas surface density ($\shtwo\gtrsim$20 \msunpc) regions of the disksto minimize the contribution from diffuse extended emission, we find anapproximately linear relation between molecular gas and star formation ratesurface density, $\nmol\sim0.96\pm0.16$, with a molecular gas depletion time$\tdep\sim2.30\pm1.32$ gyr. we show that, in the molecular regions of ourgalaxies there are no clear correlations between \tdep\ and the free-fall andeffective jeans dynamical times throughout the sample. we do not find strongtrends in the power-law index of the spatially resolved molecular gas starformation law or the molecular gas depletion time across the range of galacticstellar masses sampled (\mstar $\sim$$10^{9.7}-10^{11.5}$ \msun). there is atrend, however, in global measurements that is particularly marked for low massgalaxies. we suggest this trend is probably due to the low surface brightnessco, and it is likely associated with changes in co-to-h2 conversion factor.

1112.1411	h\alpha\ emission variability in active m dwarfs	we use ~12,000 spectra of ~3,500 magnetically active m0-m9 dwarfs from thesloan digital sky survey taken at 10-15 minute intervals, together with ~300spectra of ~60 m0-m8 stars obtained hourly with the hydra multi-objectspectrometer, to probe h\alpha\ variability on timescales of minutes to weeks.with multiple observations for every star examined, we are able to characterizefluctuations in h\alpha emission as a function of activity strength andspectral type. stars with greater magnetic activity (as quantified byl_h\alpha/l_bol) are found to be less variable at all spectral types. weattribute this result to the stronger level of persistent emission in the highactivity stars, requiring a larger heating event in order to produce measurablevariability. we also construct h\alpha\ structure functions to constrain thetimescale of variability. the more active objects with lower variabilityexhibit a characteristic timescale longer than an hour, likely due to larger,longer lasting heating events, while the less active objects with highervariability have a characteristic timescale shorter than 15 minutes.

1112.2670	refined metallicity indices for m dwarfs using the slowpokes catalog of  wide, low-mass binaries	we report the results from spectroscopic observations of 113 ultra-wide,low-mass binary systems, composed largely of m0--m3 dwarfs, from the slowpokescatalog of common proper motion pairs identified in the sloan digital skysurvey. radial velocities of each binary member were used to confirm that theyare co-moving and, consequently, to further validate the high fidelity of theslowpokes catalog. ten stars appear to be spectroscopic binaries based on broador split spectral features, supporting previous findings that wide binaries arelikely to be hierarchical systems. we measured the h{\alpha} equivalent widthof the stars in our sample and found that components of 81% of the observedpairs has similar h{\alpha} levels. the difference in h{\alpha} equivalentwidth amongst components with similar masses was smaller than the range ofh{\alpha} variability for individual objects. we confirm that the lepine et al.{\zeta}(cah2+cah3, tio5) index traces iso-metallicity loci for most of oursample of m dwarfs. however, we find a small systematic bias in {\zeta},especially in the early-type m dwarfs. we use our sample to recalibrate thedefinition of {\zeta}. while representing a small change in the definition, thenew {\zeta} is a significantly better predictor of iso-metallicity for thehigher mass m dwarfs.

0710.4552	evolution of the bar fraction in cosmos: quantifying the assembly of the  hubble sequence	we have analyzed the redshift-dependent fraction of galactic bars over0.2&lt;z&lt;0.84 in 2,157 luminous face-on spiral galaxies from the cosmos 2-squaredegree field. our sample is an order of magnitude larger than that used in anyprevious investigation, and is based on substantially deeper imaging data thanthat available from earlier wide-area studies of high-redshift galaxymorphology. we find that the fraction of barred spirals declines rapidly withredshift. whereas in the local universe about 65% of luminous spiral galaxiescontain bars (sb+sab), at z ~0.84 this fraction drops to about 20%. over thisredshift range the fraction of strong (sb) bars drops from about 30% to under10%. it is clear that when the universe was half its present age, the census ofgalaxies on the hubble sequence was fundamentally different from that of thepresent day. a major clue to understanding this phenomenon has also emergedfrom our analysis, which shows that the bar fraction in spiral galaxies is astrong function of stellar mass, integrated color and bulge prominence. the barfraction in very massive, luminous spirals is about constant out to z ~ 0.84whereas for the low mass, blue spirals it declines significantly with redshiftbeyond z=0.3. there is also a slight preference for bars in bulge dominatedsystems at high redshifts which may be an important clue towards theco-evolution of bars, bulges and black holes. our results thus have importantramifications for the processes responsible for galactic downsizing, suggestingthat massive galaxies matured early in a dynamical sense, and not just as aresult of the regulation of their star formation rate.

1201.3622	debris disks as signposts of terrestrial planet formation. ii dependence  of exoplanet architectures on giant planet and disk properties	we present models for the formation of terrestrial planets, and thecollisional evolution of debris disks, in planetary systems that containmultiple unstable gas giants. we previously showed that the dynamics of thegiant planets introduces a correlation between the presence of terrestrialplanets and debris disks. here we present new simulations that show that thisconnection is qualitatively robust to changes in: the mass distribution of thegiant planets, the width and mass distribution of the outer planetesimal disk,and the presence of gas in the disk. we discuss how variations in theseparameters affect the evolution. systems with equal-mass giant planets undergothe most violent instabilities, and these destroy both terrestrial planets andthe outer planetesimal disks that produce debris disks. in contrast, systemswith low-mass giant planets efficiently produce both terrestrial planets anddebris disks. a large fraction of systems with low-mass outermost giant planetshave stable gaps between these planets that are frequently populated byplanetesimals. planetesimal belts between outer giant planets may affect debrisdisk seds. if earth-mass seeds are present in outer planetesimal disks, thedisks radially spread to colder temperatures. we argue that this may explainthe very low frequency of &gt; 1 gyr-old solar-type stars with observed 24 micronexcesses. among the (limited) set of configurations explored, the bestcandidates for hosting terrestrial planets at ~1 au are stars older than 0.1-1gyr with bright debris disks at 70 micron but with no currently-known giantplanets. these systems combine evidence for rocky building blocks, with giantplanet properties least likely to undergo destructive dynamical evolution. wepredict an anti-correlation between debris disks and eccentric giant planets,and a positive correlation between debris disks and terrestrial planets.

1202.3078	the m dwarf problem in the galaxy	we present evidence that there is an m dwarf problem similar to thepreviously identified g dwarf and k dwarf problems: the number oflow-metallicity m dwarfs is not sufficient to match simple closed-box models oflocal galactic chemical evolution. we estimated the metallicity of 4141 m dwarfstars with spectra from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) using a molecularband strength versus metallicity calibration developed using high resolutionspectra of nearby m dwarfs. using a sample of m dwarfs with measuredmagnitudes, parallaxes, and metallicities, we derived a relation that describesthe absolute magnitude variation as a function of metallicity. when we examinedthe metallicity distribution of sdss stars, after correcting for the differentvolumes sampled by the magnitude-limited survey, we found that there is an mdwarf problem, with the number of m dwarfs at [fe/h] ~ -0.5 less than 1% thenumber at [fe/h] = 0, where a simple model of galactic chemical evolutionpredicts a more gradual drop in star numbers with decreasing metallicity.

1203.5543	the brown dwarf kinematics project (bdkp). iii. parallaxes for 70  ultracool dwarfs	we report parallax measurements for 70 ultracool dwarfs (ucds). using bothliterature values and our sample, we report new polynomial relations betweenspectral type and m$_{jhk}$. including resolved l/t transition binaries in therelations, we find no reason to differentiate between a "bright" (unresolvedbinary) and "faint" (single source) sample across the l/t boundary. isolatingearly t dwarfs, we find that the brightening of t0-t4 sources is prominent inm$_{j}$ where there is a [1.2 - 1.4] magnitude difference. a similar yetdampened brightening of [0.3 - 0.5] magnitude happens at m$_{h}$ and a plateauor dimming of [-0.2 - -0.3] magnitude is seen in m$_{k}$. comparing withevolutionary models that vary gravity, metallicity, and cloud thickness we findthat a near constant temperature of 1200 $\pm$100 k along a narrow spectralsubtype of t0-t4 is required to account for the brightening and color magnitudediagram of the l-dwarf/t-dwarf transition. furthermore, there is a significantpopulation of both l and t dwarfs which are red or potentially "ultra-cloudy"compared to the models, many of which are known to be young indicating acorrelation between enhanced photospheric dust and youth. for the lowsurface-gravity or young companion l dwarfs we find that 8 out of 10 are atleast [0.2-1.0] magnitude underluminous in m$_{jh}$ and/or m$_{k}$ compared toequivalent spectral type objects. we speculate that this is a consequence ofincreased dust opacity and conclude that low-surface gravity l dwarfs require acompletely new spectral-type/absolute magnitude polynomial for analysis.

0711.1358	the acs fornax cluster survey. ii. the central brightness profiles of  early-type galaxies: a characteristic radius on nuclear scales and the  transition from central luminosity deficit to excess	we analyse hst surface brightness profiles for 143 early-type galaxies in thevirgo and fornax clusters. sersic models provide accurate descriptions of theglobal profiles with a notable exception: the observed profiles deviatesystematically inside a characteristic "break" radius of r_b ~ 0.02r_e wherer_e is the effective radius of the galaxy. the sense of the deviation is suchthat bright galaxies (m_b &lt; -20) typically show central light deficits withrespect to the inward extrapolation of the sersic model, while the greatmajority of low- and intermediate-luminosity galaxies (-19.5 &lt; m_b &lt; -15) showcentral light excesses; galaxies occupying a narrow range of intermediateluminosities (-20 &lt; m_b &lt; -19.5) are usually well fitted by sersic models overall radii. the slopes of the central surface brightness profiles, when measuredat fixed fractions of r_e, vary smoothly as a function of galaxy luminosity ina manner that depends sensitively on the choice of measurement radius. we showthat a recent claim of strong bimodality in slope is likely an artifact of thegalaxy selection function used in that study. to provide a more robustcharacterization of the inner regions of galaxies, we introduce a parameterthat describes the central luminosity deficit or excess relative to the inwardextrapolation of the outer sersic model. we find that this parameter variessmoothly over the range of ~ 720 in blue luminosity spanned by the virgo andfornax sample galaxies, with no evidence for a dichotomy. we argue that thecentral light excesses (nuclei) in m_b &gt; -19 galaxies may be the analogs of thedense central cores that are predicted by some numerical simulations to formvia gas inflows.

1205.6806	the effects of close companions (and rotation) on the magnetic activity  of m dwarfs	we present a study of close white dwarf and m dwarf (wd+dm) binary systemsand examine the effect that a close companion has on the magnetic fieldgeneration in m dwarfs. we use a base sample of 1602 white dwarf -- mainsequence binaries from rebassa et al. to develop a set of color cuts in galex,sdss, ukidss, and 2mass color space to construct a sample of 1756 wd+dmhigh-quality pairs from the sdss dr8 spectroscopic database. we separate theindividual wd and dm from each spectrum using an iterative technique thatcompares the wd and dm components to best-fit templates. using the absoluteheight above the galactic plane as a proxy for age, and the h{\alpha} emissionline as an indicator for magnetic activity, we investigate the age-activityrelation for our sample for spectral types \leqm7. our results show thatearly-type m dwarfs (\leqm4) in close binary systems are more likely to beactive and have longer activity lifetimes compared to their field counterparts.however, at a spectral type of m5 (just past the onset of full convection in mdwarfs), the activity fraction and lifetimes of wd+dm binary systems becomesmore comparable to that of the field m dwarfs. one of the implications ofhaving a close binary companion is presumed to be increased stellar rotationthrough disk-disruption, tidal effects, or angular momentum exchange. thus, weinterpret the similarity in activity behavior between late-type dms in wd+dmpairs and late-type field dms to be due to a decrease in sensitivity in closebinary companions (or stellar rotation), which has implications for the natureof magnetic activity in fully-convective stars.

1211.6104	mapping the local halo: statistical parallax analysis of sdss low-mass  subdwarfs	we present a statistical parallax study of nearly 2,000 m subdwarfs withphotometry and spectroscopy from the sloan digital sky survey. statisticalparallax analysis yields the mean absolute magnitudes, mean velocities andvelocity ellipsoids for homogenous samples of stars. we selected homogeneousgroups of subdwarfs based on their photometric colors and spectral appearance.we examined the color-magnitude relations of low-mass subdwarfs and quantifiedtheir dependence on the newly-refined metallicity parameter, zeta. we alsodeveloped a photometric metallicity parameter, delta(g-r), based on the g-r andr-z colors of low-mass stars and used it to select stars with similarmetallicities. the kinematics of low-mass subdwarfs as a function of color andmetallicity were also examined and compared to main sequence m dwarfs. we findthat the sdss subdwarfs share similar kinematics to the inner halo and thickdisk. the color-magnitude relations derived in this analysis will be a powerfultool for identifying and characterizing low-mass metal-poor subdwarfs in futuresurveys such as gaia and lsst, making them important and plentiful tracers ofthe stellar halo.

0712.1590	constraining the age-activity relation for cool stars: the sdss dr5  low-mass star spectroscopic sample	we present a spectroscopic analysis of over 38,000 low-mass stars from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 5 (dr5). analysis of thisunprecedentedly large sample confirms the previously detected decrease in thefraction of magnetically active stars (as traced by h-alpha emission) as afunction of vertical distance from the galactic plane. the magnitude and slopeof this effect varies as a function of spectral type. using simple 1-ddynamical models, we demonstrate that the drop in activity fraction can beexplained by thin disk dynamical heating and a rapid decrease in magneticactivity. the timescale for this rapid activity decrease changes according tothe spectral type. by comparing our data to the simulations, we calibrate theage-activity relation at each m dwarf spectral type. we also present evidencefor a possible decrease in the metallicity as a function of height above thegalactic plane. in addition to our activity analysis, we provide linemeasurements, molecular band indices, colors, radial velocities, 3-d spacemotions and mean properties as a function of spectral type for the sdss dr5low-mass star sample.

1309.1172	a gyrochronology and microvariability survey of the milky way's older  stars using kepler's two-wheels program	even with the diminished precision possible with only two reaction wheels,the kepler spacecraft can obtain mmag level, time-resolved photometry of tensof thousands of sources. the presence of such a rich, large data set could betransformative for stellar astronomy. in this white paper, we discuss howrotation periods for a large ensemble of single and binary main- sequencedwarfs can yield a quantitative understanding of the evolution of stellarspin-down over time. this will allow us to calibrate rotation-based ages beyond~1 gyr, which is the oldest benchmark that exists today apart from the sun.measurement of rotation periods of m dwarfs past the fully-convective boundarywill enable extension of gyrochronology to the end of the stellarmain-sequence, yielding precise ages ({\sigma} ~10%) for the vast majority ofnearby stars. it will also help set constraints on the angular momentumevolution and magnetic field generation in these stars. our kepler-based studywould be supported by a suite of ongoing and future ground-based observations.finally, we briefly discuss two ancillary science cases, detection oflong-period low-mass eclipsing binaries and microvariability in white dwarfsand hot subdwarf b stars that the kepler two-wheels program would facilitate.

1310.7565	hunting the most distant stars in the milky way: methods and initial  results	we present a new catalog of 404 m giant candidates found in the ukirtinfrared deep sky survey (ukidss). the 2,400 deg$^2$ available in the ukidsslarge area survey data release 8 resolve m giants through a volume four timeslarger than that of the entire two micron all sky survey. combiningnear-infrared photometry with optical photometry and proper motions from thesloan digital sky survey yields an m giant candidate catalog with less m dwarfand quasar contamination than previous searches for similarly distant m giants.extensive follow-up spectroscopy of this sample will yield the first map of ourgalaxy's outermost reaches over a large area of sky. our initial spectroscopicfollow-up of $\sim$ 30 bright candidates yielded the positive identification offive m giants at distances $\sim 20-90$ kpc. each of these confirmed m giantshave positions and velocities consistent with the sagittarius stream. thefainter m giant candidates in our sample have estimated photometric distances$\sim 200$ kpc (assuming $[fe/h]$ = 0.0), but require further spectroscopicverification. the photometric distance estimates extend beyond the milky way'svirial radius, and increase by $\sim 50\%$ for each 0.5 dex decrease in assumed$[fe/h]$. given the number of m giant candidates, initial selection efficiency,and volume surveyed, we loosely estimate that at least one additionalsagittarius-like accretion event could have contributed to the hierarchicalbuild-up of the milky way's outer halo.

1406.1228	calibrating ultracool dwarfs: optical template spectra, bolometric  corrections, and $\chi$ values	we present optical template spectra, bolometric corrections, and $\chi$values for ultracool dwarfs. the templates are based on spectra from the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) and the astrophysical research consortium 3.5-mtelescope. the spectral features and overall shape of the l dwarf templates areconsistent with previous spectroscopic standards and the templates have aradial velocity precision of $\sim$10--20 km s$^{-1}$. we calculate bolometricfluxes (accurate to 10--20\%) for 101 late-m and l dwarfs from sdss, 2mass, andwise photometry, sdss spectra, and bt-settl model spectra. we find that the$z$- and $j$-band bolometric corrections for late-m and l dwarfs have a strongcorrelation with $z-j$ and $j-k_s$ colors respectively. the new $\chi$ values,which can be used to convert h$\alpha$ equivalent widths to activity strength,are based on spectrophotometrically calibrated sdss spectra and the newbolometric fluxes. while the measured $\chi$ values have typical uncertaintiesof $\sim$20\%, ultracool dwarf models show the continuum surrounding h$\alpha$can vary by up to an order of magnitude with changing surface gravity. oursemi-empirical $\chi$ values are one to two orders of magnitude larger thanprevious $\chi$ values for mid- to late-l dwarfs, indicating that the upperlimits for h$\alpha$ activity strength on the coolest l dwarfs have beenunderestimated.

1408.3089	spex spectroscopy of unresolved very low mass binaries. ii.  identification of fourteen candidate binaries with late-m/early-l and t dwarf  components	multiplicity is a key statistic for understanding the formation of very lowmass (vlm) stars and brown dwarfs. currently, the separation distribution ofvlm binaries remains poorly constrained at small separations ($\leq$ 1 au),leading to uncertainty in the overall binary fraction. we approach this problemby searching for late-m/early-l plus t dwarf spectral binaries whose combinedlight spectra exhibit distinct peculiarities, allowing forseparation-independent identification. we define a set of spectral indicesdesigned to identify these systems, and use a spectral template fitting methodto confirm and characterize spectral binary (sb) candidates from a library of815 spectra from the spex prism spectral libraries. we present eleven newbinary candidates, confirm three previously reported candidates and rule outtwo previously identified candidates, all with primary and secondary spectraltypes between m7-l7 and t1-t8, respectively. we find that subdwarfs and blue ldwarfs are the primary contaminants in our sample and propose a method forsegregating these sources. if confirmed by follow-up observations, thesesystems may add to the growing list of tight separation binaries, whose orbitalproperties may yield further insight into brown dwarf formation scenarios.

1409.0016	warm dust around cool stars: field m dwarfs with wise 12 or 22 micron  excess emission	using the sdss dr7 spectroscopic catalog, we searched the wise allwisecatalog to investigate the occurrence of warm dust, as inferred from irexcesses, around field m dwarfs (dms). we developed sdss/wise color selectioncriteria to identify 175 dms (from 70,841) that show ir flux greater thantypical dm photosphere levels at 12 and/or 22 $\mu$m, including seven new starswithin the orion ob1 footprint. we characterize the dust populations inferredfrom each ir excess, and investigate the possibility that these excesses couldarise from ultracool binary companions by modeling combined seds. our observedir fluxes are greater than levels expected from ultracool companions($&gt;3\sigma$). we also estimate that the probability the observed ir excessesare due to chance alignments with extragalactic sources is $&lt;$ 0.1%. using sdssspectra we measure surface gravity dependent features (k, na, and cah 3), andfind $&lt;$ 15% of our sample indicate low surface gravities. examining tracers ofyouth (h$\alpha$, uv fluxes, and li absorption), we find $&lt;$ 3% of our sampleappear young, indicating we are observing a population of field stars $\gtrsim$1 gyr, likely harboring circumstellar material. we investigate age-dependentproperties probed by this sample, studying the disk fraction as a function ofgalactic height. the fraction remains small and constant to $|z| \sim 700$ pc,and then drops, indicating little to no trend with age. possible explanationsfor disks around field dms include: 1) collisions of planetary bodies, 2) tidaldisruption of planetary bodies, or 3) failed planet formation.

1409.1229	a new sample of cool subdwarfs from sdss: properties and kinematics	we present a new sample of m subdwarfs compiled from the 7th data release ofthe sloan digital sky survey. with 3517 new subdwarfs, this new samplesignificantly increases the number of spectroscopically confirmed low-masssubdwarfs. this catalog also includes 905 extreme and 534 ultra sudwarfs. wepresent the entire catalog including observed and derived quantities, andtemplate spectra created from co-added subdwarf spectra. we show color-colorand reduced proper motion diagrams of the three metallicity classes, which areshown to separate from the disk dwarf population. the extreme and ultrasubdwarfs are seen at larger values of reduced proper motion as expected formore dynamically heated populations. we determine 3d kinematics for all of thestars with proper motions. the color-magnitude diagrams show a clear separationof the three metallicity classes with the ultra and extreme subdwarfs beingsignificantly closer to the main sequence than the ordinary subdwarfs. allsubdwarfs lie below (fainter) and to the left (bluer) of the main sequence.based on the average $(u,v,w)$ velocities and their dispersions, the extremeand ultra subdwarfs likely belong to the galactic halo, while the ordinarysubdwarfs are likely part of the old galactic (or thick) disk. an extensiveactivity analysis of subdwarfs is performed using h$\alpha$ emission and 208active subdwarfs are found. we show that while the activity fraction ofsubdwarfs rises with spectral class and levels off at the latest spectralclasses, consistent with the behavior of m dwarfs, the extreme and ultrasubdwarfs are basically flat.

1410.0014	boss ultracool dwarfs i: colors and magnetic activity of m and l dwarfs	we present the colors and activity of ultracool (m7-l8) dwarfs from the tenthdata release of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we combine previoussamples of sdss m and l dwarfs with new data obtained from the baryonoscillation sky survey (boss) to produce the boss ultracool dwarf (bud) sampleof 11820 m7-l8 dwarfs. by combining sdss data with photometry from the twomicron all sky survey and the wide-field infrared sky explorer mission, wepresent ultracool dwarf colors from $i-z$ to $w2-w3$ as a function of spectraltype, and extend the sdss-2mass-wise color locus to include ultracool dwarfs.the $i-z$, $i-j$, and $z-j$ colors provide the best indication of spectral typefor m7-l3 dwarfs. we also examine ultracool dwarf chromospheric activitythrough the presence and strength of h$\alpha$ emission. the fraction of activedwarfs rises through the m spectral sequence until it reaches $\sim$90% atspectral type l0. the fraction of active dwarfs then declines to 50% atspectral type l5; no h$\alpha$ emission is observed in the late-l dwarfs in thebud sample. the fraction of active l0-l5 dwarfs is much higher than previouslyobserved. the strength of activity declines with spectral type from m7 throughl3, after which the data do not show a clear trend. using one-dimensionalchromosphere models, we explore the range of filling factors and chromospherictemperature structures that are consistent with h$\alpha$ observations of m0-l7dwarfs. m dwarf chromospheres have a similar, smoothly varying range oftemperature and surface coverage while l dwarf chromospheres are cooler andhave smaller filling factors.

1410.1514	h$\alpha$ emission from active equal-mass, wide m dwarf binaries	we identify a sample of near-equal mass wide binary m dwarf systems from theslowpokes catalog of common proper-motion binaries and obtain follow-upobservations of their chromospheric activity as measured by the h$\alpha$emission line. we present optical spectra for both components of 48 candidate mdwarf binaries, confirming their mid-m spectral types. of those 48 coevalpairs, we find eight with h$\alpha$ emission from both components, three withweak emission in one component and no emission in the other, and 37 with twoinactive components. we find that of the eleven pairs with at least one activecomponent, only three follow the net trend of decreasing activity strength$l_{\rm h\alpha}/l_{\rm bol}$ with later spectral type. the difference inquiescent activity strength between the a and b components is larger than whatwould be expected based on the small differences in color (mass). for fivebinaries with two active components, we present 47 hours of time-resolvedspectroscopy, observed on the arc 3.5-m over twelve different nights. for fourof the five pairs, the slightly redder (b) component exhibits a higher level ofh$\alpha$ emission during the majority of the observations and the redderobjects are the only components to flare. the full range of h$\alpha$ emissionobserved on these variable mid-m dwarfs is comparable to the scatter inh$\alpha$ emission found in single-epoch surveys of mid-m dwarfs, indicatingthat variability could be a major factor in the spread of observed activitystrengths. we also find that variability is independent of both activitystrength and spectral type.

1507.00057	the brown dwarf kinematics project (bdkp). iv. radial velocities of 85  late-m and l dwarfs with mage	radial velocity measurements are presented for 85 late m- and l-type very lowmass stars and brown dwarfs obtained with the magellan echellette (mage)spectrograph. targets primarily have distances within 20 pc of the sun, withmore distant sources selected for their unusual spectral energy distributions.we achieved precisions of 2--3 km/s, and combined these with astrometric andspectrophotometric data to calculate $uvw$ velocities. most are members of thethin disk of the galaxy, and velocity dispersions indicate a mean age of5.2$\pm$0.2 gyr for sources within 20 pc. we find significantly differentkinematic ages between late-m dwarfs (4.0$\pm$0.2 gyr) and l dwarfs(6.5$\pm$0.4 gyr) in our sample that are contrary to predictions from priorsimulations. this difference appears to be driven by a dispersed population ofunusually blue l dwarfs which may be more prevalent in our local volume-limitedsample than in deeper magnitude-limited surveys. the l dwarfs exhibit anasymmetric $u$ velocity distribution with a net inward flow, similar togradients recently detected in local stellar samples. simulations incorporatingbrown dwarf evolution and galactic orbital dynamics are unable to reproduce thevelocity asymmetry, suggesting non-axisymmetric perturbations or two distinct ldwarf populations. we also find the l dwarfs to have a kinematic age-activitycorrelation similar to more massive stars. we identify several sources with lowsurface gravities, and two new substellar candidate members of nearby youngmoving groups: the astrometric binary denis j08230313$-$4912012ab, alow-probability member of the $\beta$ pictoris moving group; and 2massj15104786-2818174, a moderate-probability member of the 30-50 myr argusassociation.

1507.02333	linking stellar coronal activity and rotation at 500 myr: a deep chandra  observation of m37	empirical calibrations of the stellar age-rotation-activity relation (arar)rely on observations of the co-eval populations of stars in open clusters. weused the chandra x-ray observatory to study m37, a 500-myr-old open clusterthat has been extensively surveyed for rotation periods ($p_{\rm rot}$). m37was observed almost continuously for five days, for a total of 440.5 ksec, tomeasure stellar x-ray luminosities ($l_{\mathrm{x}}$), a proxy for coronalactivity, across a wide range of masses. the cluster's membership catalog wasrevisited to calculate updated membership probabilities from photometric dataand each star's distance to the cluster center. the result is a comprehensivesample of 1699 m37 members: 426 with $p_{\rm rot}$, 278 with x-ray detections,and 76 with both. we calculate rossby numbers, $r_o = p_{\rm rot}/\tau$, where$\tau$ is the convective turnover time, and ratios of the x-ray-to-bolometricluminosity, $l_{\rm x}/l_{\rm bol}$, to minimize mass dependencies in ourcharacterization of the rotation-coronal activity relation at 500 myr. we findthat fast rotators, for which $r_o&lt;0.09\pm0.01$, show saturated levels ofactivity, with log($l_{\rm x}/l_{\rm bol}$)$=-3.06\pm0.04$. for$r_o\geq0.09\pm0.01$, activity is unsaturated and follows a power law of theform $r_o^\beta$, where $\beta$=$-2.03_{-0.14}^{+0.17}$. this is the largestsample available for analyzing the dependence of coronal emission on rotationfor a single-aged population, covering stellar masses in the range 0.4$-$1.3$m_{\odot}$, $p_{\rm rot}$ in the range 0.4$-$12.8 d, and $l_{\rm x}$ in therange 10$^{28.4-30.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$. our results make m37 a new benchmark opencluster for calibrating the arar at ages of $\approx$500 myr.

1509.01590	an activity-rotation relationship and kinematic analysis of nearby  mid-to-late-type m dwarfs	using spectroscopic observations and photometric light curves of 238 nearby mdwarfs from the mearth exoplanet transit survey, we examine the relationshipsbetween magnetic activity (quantified by h-alpha emission), rotation period,and stellar age. previous attempts to investigate the relationship betweenmagnetic activity and rotation in these stars were hampered by the limitednumber of m dwarfs with measured rotation periods (and the fact that vsinimeasurements probe only rapid rotation). however, the photometric data frommearth allows us to probe a wide range of rotation periods for hundreds of mdwarf stars (from shorter than than one to longer than 100 days). over all mspectral types that we probe, we find that the presence of magnetic activity istied to rotation, including for late-type, fully convective m dwarfs. we alsofind evidence that the fraction of late-type m dwarfs that are active may behigher at longer rotation periods compared to their early-type counterparts,with several active, late-type, slowly rotating stars present in our sample.additionally, we find that all m dwarfs with rotation periods shorter than 26days (early-type; m1-m4) and 86 days (late-type; m5-m8) are magneticallyactive. this potential mismatch suggests that the physical mechanisms thatconnect stellar rotation to chromospheric heating may be different in fullyconvective stars. a kinematic analysis suggests that the magnetically active,rapidly rotating stars are consistent with a kinematically young population,while slow-rotators are less active or inactive and appear to belong to anolder, dynamically heated stellar population.

astro-ph;0410416	a new milky way companion: unusual globular cluster or extreme dwarf  satellite?	we report the discovery of sdssj1049+5103, an overdensity of resolved bluestars at (\alpha_{2000}, \delta_{2000}) = (162.343, 51.051). this objectappears to be an old, metal-poor stellar system at a distance of 45 +/- 10 kpc,with a half-light radius of 23$\pm 10$ pc and an absolute magnitude of m_v =-3.0^{+2.0}_{-0.7}. one star that is likely associated with this companion hasan sdss spectrum confirming it as a blue horizontal branch star at 48 kpc. thecolor-magnitude diagram of sdssj1049+5103 contains few, if any, horizontal orred giant branch stars, similar to the anomalously faint globular cluster am 4.the size and luminosity of sdssj1049+5103 places it at the intersection of thesize-luminosity relationships followed by known globular clusters and by milkyway dwarf spheroidals. if sdssj1049+5103 is a globular cluster, then itsproperties are consistent with the established trend that the largest radiusgalactic globular clusters are all in the outer halo. however, the five knownglobular clusters with similarly faint absolute magnitudes all have half-massradii that are smaller than sdssj1049+5103 by a factor of $\gtrsim$ 5. if it isa dwarf spheroidal, then it is the faintest yet known by two orders ofmagnitude, and is the first example of the ultra-faint dwarfs predicted by sometheories. the uncertain nature of this new system underscores the sometimesambiguous distinction between globular clusters and dwarf spheroidals. a simplefriends-of-friends search for similar blue, small scalesize star clustersdetected all known globulars and dwarfs closer than 50 kpc in the sdss area,but yielded no other candidates as robust as sdssj1049+5103.

astro-ph;0505334	the uv, optical, and ir properties of sdss sources detected by galex	we discuss the uv, optical, and ir properties of the sdss sources detected bygalex as part of its all-sky imaging survey early release observations.virtually all of the galex sources in the overlap region are detected by sdss.galex sources represent ~2.5% of all sdss sources within these fields and abouthalf are optically unresolved. most unresolved galex/sdss sources are brightblue turn-off thick disk stars and are typically detected only in the galexnear-uv band. the remaining unresolved sources include low-redshift quasars,white dwarfs, and white dwarf/m dwarf pairs, and these dominate the opticallyunresolved sources detected in both galex bands.  almost all the resolved sdss sources detected by galex are fainter than thesdss 'main' spectroscopic limit. these sources have colors consistent withthose of blue (spiral) galaxies (u-r&lt;2.2), and most are detected in both galexbands. measurements of their uv colors allow much more accurate and robustestimates of star-formation history than are possible using only sdss data.indeed, galaxies with the most recent (&lt;20 myr) star formation can be robustlyselected from the galex data by requiring that they be brighter in the far-uvthan in the near-uv band. however, older starburst galaxies have uv colorssimilar to agn, and thus cannot be selected unambiguously on the basis of galexfluxes alone.  with the aid of 2mass data, we construct and discuss median 10 banduv-optical-ir spectral energy distributions for turn-off stars, hot whitedwarfs, low-redshift quasars, and spiral and elliptical galaxies. we point outthe high degree of correlation between the uv color and the contribution of theuv flux to the uv-optical-ir flux of galaxies detected by galex.

astro-ph;0506675	photometric accretion signatures near the substellar boundary	multi-epoch imaging of the orion equatorial region by the sloan digital skysurvey has revealed that significant variability in the blue continuum persistsinto the late-m spectral types, indicating that magnetospheric accretionprocesses occur below the substellar boundary in the orion ob1 association. weinvestigate the strength of the accretion-related continuum veiling bycomparing the reddening-invariant colors of the most highly variable starsagainst those of main sequence m dwarfs and evolutionary models. a gradualdecrease in the g band veiling is seen for the cooler and less massive members,as expected for a declining accretion rate with decreasing mass. we also seeevidence that the temperature of the accretion shock decreases in the very lowmass regime, reflecting a reduction in the energy flux carried by the accretioncolumns. we find that the near-ir excess attributed to circumstellar diskthermal emission drops rapidly for spectral types later than m4. this is likelydue to the decrease in color contrast between the disk and the cooler stellarphotosphere. since accretion, which requires a substantial stellar magneticfield and the presence of a circumstellar disk, is inferred for masses down to0.05 msol we surmise that brown dwarfs and low mass stars share a common modeof formation.

astro-ph;0603486	willman 1 - a galactic satellite at 40 kpc with multiple stellar tails	sdssj1049+5103, commonly known as willman 1, is an extremely low-luminositymilky way companion whose properties are intermediate between those of globularclusters and dwarf spheroidals. in this paper, we use deep photometry to showthat this object is old and moderately metal-poor, has a distance of 38 +/- 7kpc, has an m_v of -2.5 mag, and has a half-light radius of 21 +/- 7 pc,consistent with previous estimates. the spatial distribution of willman 1'smain sequence stars shows 1) its total spatial extent exceeds its tidal radiusfor a range of assumptions about its total mass and its orbit and 2) thepresence of prominent multi-directional stellar tails. the tidal interactionscausing these tail features may explain the large physical size of willman 1relative to low-luminosity globular clusters. it is the most distant galacticobject yet known to display prominent tails, and is the only distant satelliteto display multi-directional tails. although we cannot at present determine thecause of this unusual morphology, preliminary comparisons between themorphology of willman 1 and published simulations suggest that it may be nearthe apocenter of its orbit, or that it may have interacted with another haloobject. we find a significant difference between the luminosity functions ofstars in the center and in the tails of willman 1, strongly suggesting masssegregation much like that seen in palomar 5. although willman 1 has morepronounced tidal tails than most confirmed milky way dwarf galaxies, because ofits very low stellar mass we cannot at present rule out the possibility that ithas a dark matter halo.

astro-ph;0605328	the detection of m-dwarf uv flare events in the galex data archives	we present the preliminary results from implementing a new software tool thatenables inspection of time-tagged photon data for the astronomical sourcescontained within individual galex ultraviolet images of the sky. we haveinspected the photon data contained within 1802 galex images to reveal rapid,short-term (&lt;500 sec) uv source variability in the form of stellar flares. themean associated change in nuv magnitude due to this flaring activity is2.7+/-0.3 mag. a list of 49 new uv variable-star candidates is presented,together with their associated sloan digital sky survey (sdss) photometricmagnitudes. from these data we can associate the main source of these uv flareevents with magnetic activity on m-dwarf stars. photometric parallaxes havebeen determined for 32 of these sources, placing them at distances ranging fromapproximately 25 to 1000pc. the average uv flare energy for these flare eventsis 2.5e30 ergs, which is of a similar energy to that of u-band, x-ray and euvflares observed on many local m-dwarf stars. we have found that stars ofclasses m0 to m5 flare with energies spanning a far larger range and with anenergy approximately 5 times greater than those of later (m6 to m8) spectraltype.

astro-ph;0608474	luminosity dependence in the fundamental plane projections of elliptical  galaxies	we analyze the fundamental plane projections of elliptical galaxies as afunction of luminosity, using a sample of approximately 80,000 galaxies drawnfrom data release 4 (dr4) of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we separatebrightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) from our main sample and reanalyze theirphotometry due to a problem with the default pipeline sky subtraction for bcgs.the observables we consider are effective radius (r_e), velocity dispersion(sigma), dynamical mass (m_dyn ~ r_e sigma2), effective density (sigma2/r_e2),and effective surface brightness (mu_e). with the exception of the l-m_dyncorrelation, we find evidence of variations in the slope (i.e. the power-lawindex) of the fundamental plane projections with luminosity for our normalelliptical galaxy population. in particular, the radius-luminosity andfaber-jackson relations are steeper at high luminosity relative to lowluminosity, and the more luminous ellipticals become progressively less denseand have lower surface brightnesses than lower luminosity ellipticals. thesevariations can be understood as arising from differing formation histories,with more luminous galaxies having less dissipation. data from the literatureand our reanalysis of bcgs show that bcgs have radius-luminosity andfaber-jackson relations steeper than the brightest non-bcg ellipticals in oursample, consistent with significant growth of bcgs via dissipationless mergers.the variations in slope we find in the faber-jackson relation of non-bcgs arequalitatively similar to that reported in the black hole mass-velocitydispersion (m_bh-sigma) correlation. this similarity is consistent with aroughly constant value of m_bh/m_star over a wide range of early type galaxies,where m_star is the stellar mass.

astro-ph;0609462	characterizing three candidate magnetic cvs from sdss: xmm-newton and  optical follow-up observations	in the latest in our series of papers on xmm-newton and ground-based opticalfollow-up of new candidate magnetic cataclysmic variables (mcvs) found in thesloan digital sky survey, we report classifications of three systems: sdssj144659.95+025330.3, sdss j205017.84-053626.8, and sdss j210131.26+105251.5.both the x-ray and optical fluxes of sdss j1446+02 are modulated on a period of48.7+/-0.5 min, with the x-ray modulation showing the characteristic energydependence of photo-electric absorption seen in many intermediate polars (ip).a longer period modulation and radial velocity variation is also seen at aperiod around 4 hrs, though neither dataset set is long enough to constrainthis longer, likely orbital, period well. sdss j2050-05 appears to be anexample of the most highly magnetized class of mcv, a disk-less, stream-fedpolar. its 1.57 hr orbital period is well-constrained via optical eclipsetimings; in the x-ray it shows both eclipses and an underlying strong, smoothmodulation. in this case, broadly phase-resolved spectral fits indicate thatthis change in flux is the result of a varying normalization of the dominantcomponent (a 41 kev mekal), plus the addition of a partial covering absorberduring the lower flux interval. sdss j2101+10 is a more perplexing system tocategorize: its x-ray and optical fluxes exhibit no large periodic modulations;there are only barely detectable changes in the velocity structure of itsoptical emission lines; the x-ray spectra require only absorption by theinterstellar medium; and the temperatures of the mekal fits are low, withmaximum temperature components of either 10 or 25 kev. we conclude that sdssj2101+10 can not be an ip, nor likely a polar, but is rather most likely a discaccretor-- a low inclination sw sex star.

0810.3571	the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey vii: a neutral hydrogen cloud  complex in the virgo cluster	we present observations of an hi cloud complex most likely located in thevirgo galaxy cluster, first reported by kent et al. (2007). the complexconsists of five clouds, detected in the data set of the alfalfa extragalactichi survey at arecibo. the clouds have radial velocities between cz~480 and 610km/s. at the virgo cluster distance, they are spread over a projected span of170 kpc and have hi masses ranging from 0.48 to 1.7 x 10^8 msun. the overall himass of the complex is 5.1 x 10^8 msun. the clouds' velocity widths varybetween 50 and 250 km/s. new results of follow-up aperture synthesisobservations conducted with the very large array are also presented, whichyield a higher resolution view of two of the clouds in the complex. these tworesolved clouds show no evidence of symmetry in the gas distribution or of anyordered motions. the possibility that the complex is a group of primordialobjects, embedded in their own dark matter halo is thought to be unlikely.scenarios in which the clouds have been removed from the disk of a galaxytraveling at high speed through the intracluster medium are considered. themost likely among those is thought to be one where the clouds were separatedfrom ngc 4445 at a time &gt;0.5 gyr ago. the orbital velocity of the clouds andthe putative parent galaxy would now be seen at a relatively large angle withrespect to the line of sight.

0812.1223	using magnetic activity and galactic dynamics to constrain the ages of m  dwarfs	we present a study of the dynamics and magnetic activity of m dwarfs usingthe largest spectroscopic sample of low-mass stars ever assembled. the age atwhich strong surface magnetic activity (as traced by h-alpha) ceases in mdwarfs has been inferred to have a strong dependence on mass (spectral type,surface temperature) and explains previous results showing a large increase inthe fraction of active stars at later spectral types. using spectralobservations of more than 40000 m dwarfs from the sloan digital sky survey, weshow that the fraction of active stars decreases as a function of verticaldistance from the galactic plane (a statistical proxy for age), and that themagnitude of this decrease changes significantly for different m spectraltypes. adopting a simple dynamical model for thin disk vertical heating, weassign an age for the activity decline at each spectral type, and thusdetermine the activity lifetimes for m dwarfs. in addition, we derive astatistical age-activity relation for each spectral type using the dynamicalmodel, the vertical distance from the plane and the h-alpha emission lineluminosity of each star (the latter of which also decreases with verticalheight above the galactic plane).
