0903.2771	detection of structure in infrared-dark clouds with spitzer:  characterizing star formation in the molecular ring	we have conducted a survey of a sample of infrared-dark clouds (irdcs) withthe spitzer space telescope in order to explore their mass distribution. wepresent a method for tracing mass using dust absorption against the brightgalactic background at 8 microns. the irdcs in this sample are comprised oftens of clumps, ranging in sizes from 0.02 to 0.3 pc in diameter and massesfrom 0.5 to a few 10 msun, the broadest dynamic range in any clump massspectrum study to date. structure with this range in scales confirms that irdcsare the the precursors to stellar clusters in an early phase of fragmentation.young stars are distributed in the vicinity of the irdcs, but the clumps aretypically not associated with stars and appear pre-stellar in nature. we findan irdc clump mass spectrum with a slope of 1.76 +/- 0.05 for masses from 30 to3000 msun. this slope is consistent with numerous studies, culled from avariety of observational techniques, of massive star formation regions and isclose to the mass function of galactic stellar clusters and star clusters inother galaxies. we assert that the shape of the mass function is an intrinsicand universal feature of massive star formation regions, that are the birthsites of stellar clusters. as these clouds evolve and their constituent clumpsfragment, the mass spectrum will steepen and eventually assume the form of thecore mass function that is observed locally.

0904.0603	spitzer mapping of molecular hydrogen pure rotational lines in ngc 1333:  a detailed study of feedback in star formation	we present mid-infrared spectral maps of the ngc 1333 star forming region,obtained with the the infrared spectrometer on board the spitzer spacetelescope. eight pure h2 rotational lines, from s (0) to s (7), are detectedand mapped. the h2 emission appears to be associated with the warm gas shockedby the multiple outflows present in the region. a comparison between theobserved intensities and the predictions of detailed shock models indicatesthat the emission arises in both slow (12 - 24 km/s) and fast (36 - 53 km/s)c-type shocks with an initial ortho-to-para ratio of ~ 1. the present h2ortho-to-para ratio exhibits a large degree of spatial variations. in thepost-shocked gas, it is usually about 2, i.e. close to the equilibrium value (~3). however, around at least two outflows, we observe a region with a muchlower (~ 0.5) ortho-to-para ratio. this region probably corresponds to gaswhich has been heated-up recently by the passage of a shock front, but whoseortho-to-para has not reached equilibrium yet. this, together with the lowinitial ortho-to-para ratio needed to reproduce the observed emission, providestrong evidence that h2 is mostly in para form in cold molecular clouds. the h2lines are found to contribute to 25 - 50% of the total outflow luminosity, andthus can be used to ascertain the importance of star formation feedback on thenatal cloud. from these lines, we determine the outflow mass loss rate and,indirectly, the stellar infall rate, the outflow momentum and the kineticenergy injected into the cloud over the embedded phase. the latter is found toexceed the binding energy of individual cores, suggesting that outflows couldbe the main mechanism for core disruption.

1011.0446	chemistry of a protoplanetary disk with grain settling and lyman alpha  radiation	we present results from a model of the chemical evolution of protoplanetarydisks. in our models we directly calculate the changing propagation andpenetration of a high energy radiation field with lyman alpha radiationincluded. we also explore the effect on our models of including dust grainsettling. we find that, in agreement with earlier studies, the evolution ofdust grains plays a large role in determining how deep the uv radiationpenetrates into the disk. significant grain settling at the midplane leads tomuch smaller freeze-out regions and a correspondingly larger molecular layer,which leads to an increase in column density for molecular species such as co,cn and so. the inclusion of lyman alpha radiation impacts the disk chemistrythrough specific species that have large photodissociation cross sections at1216 a. these include hcn, nh3 and ch4, for which the column densities aredecreased by an order of magnitude or more due to the presence of lyman alpharadiation in the uv spectrum. a few species, such as co2 and so, are enhancedby the presence of lyman alpha radiation, but rarely by more than a factor of afew.

1011.3260	distribution of water vapor in molecular clouds	we report the results of a large-area study of water vapor along the orionmolecular cloud ridge, the purpose of which was to determine thedepth-dependent distribution of gas-phase water in dense molecular clouds. wefind that the water vapor measured toward 77 spatial positions along theface-on orion ridge, excluding positions surrounding the outflow associatedwith bn/kl and irc2, display integrated intensities that correlate stronglywith known cloud surface tracers such as cn, c2h, 13co j =5-4, and hcn, andless well with the volume tracer n2h+. moreover, at total column densitiescorresponding to av &lt; 15 mag., the ratio of h2o to c18o integrated intensitiesshows a clear rise approaching the cloud surface. we show that this behaviorcannot be accounted for by either optical depth or excitation effects, butsuggests that gas-phase water abundances fall at large av. these results areimportant as they affect measures of the true water-vapor abundance inmolecular clouds by highlighting the limitations of comparing measured watervapor column densities with such traditional cloud tracers as 13co or c18o.these results also support cloud models that incorporate freeze-out ofmolecules as a critical component in determining the depth-dependent abundanceof water vapor.

1104.1236	disk imaging survey of chemistry with sma: ii. southern sky  protoplanetary disk data and full sample statistics	this is the second in a series of papers based on data from discs, asubmillimeter array observing program aimed at spatially and spectrallyresolving the chemical composition of 12 protoplanetary disks. we present dataon six southern sky sources - im lup, sao 206462 (hd 135344b), hd 142527, as209, as 205 and v4046 sgr - which complement the six sources in the taurus starforming region reported previously. co 2-1 and hco+ 3-2 emission are detectedand resolved in all disks and show velocity patterns consistent with keplerianrotation. where detected, the emission from dco+ 3-2, n2h+ 3-2, h2co 3-2 and4-3,hcn 3-2 and cn 2-1 are also generally spatially resolved. the detectionrates are highest toward the m and k stars, while the f star sao 206462 hasonly weak cn and hcn emission, and h2co alone is detected toward hd 142527.these findings together with the statistics from the previous taurus disks,support the hypothesis that high detection rates of many small molecules dependon the presence of a cold and protected disk midplane, which is less commonaround f and a stars compared to m and k stars. disk-averaged variations in theproposed radiation tracer cn/hcn are found to be small, despite two orders ofmagnitude range of spectral types and accretion rates. in contrast, theresolved images suggest that the cn/hcn emission ratio varies with disk radiusin at least two of the systems. there are no clear observational differences inthe disk chemistry between the classical/full t tauri disks and transitionaldisks. furthermore, the observed line emission does not depend on measuredaccretion luminosities or the number of infrared lines detected, which suggeststhat the chemistry outside of 100 au is not coupled to the physical processesthat drive the chemistry in the innermost few au.

1107.4361	complex structure in class 0 protostellar envelopes ii: kinematic  structure from single-dish and interferometric molecular line mapping	we present a study of dense molecular gas kinematics in seventeen nearbyprotostellar systems using single-dish and interferometric molecular lineobservations. the non-axisymmetric envelopes around a sample of class 0/iprotostars were mapped in the n2h+ (j=1-0) tracer with the iram 30m, carma andpdbi as well as nh3 (1,1) with the vla. the molecular line emission is used toconstruct line-center velocity and linewidth maps for all sources to examinethe kinematic structure in the envelopes on spatial scales from 0.1 pc to ~1000au. the direction of the large-scale velocity gradients from single-dishmapping is within 45 degrees of normal to the outflow axis in more than halfthe sample. furthermore, the velocity gradients are often quite substantial,the average being ~2.3 km\s\pc. the interferometric data often revealsmall-scale velocity structure, departing from the more gradual large-scalevelocity gradients. in some cases, this likely indicates accelerating infalland/or rotational spin-up in the inner envelope; the median velocity gradientfrom the interferometric data is ~10.7 km/s/pc. in two systems, we detecthigh-velocity hco+ (j=1-0) emission inside the highest-velocity \nthp\emission. this enables us to study the infall and rotation close to the diskand estimate the central object masses. the velocity fields observed on largeand small-scales are more complex than would be expected from rotation alone,suggesting that complex envelope structure enables other dynamical processes(i.e. infall) to affect the velocity field.

1110.4152	water in star and planet forming regions	in this paper we discuss the astronomical search for water vapor in order tounderstand the disposition of water in all its phases throughout the process ofstar and planet formation. our ability to detect and study water vapor hasrecently received a tremendous boost with the successful launch and operationsof the herschel space observatory. herschel spectroscopic detections ofnumerous transitions in a variety of astronomical objects, along with previouswork by other space-based observatories, will be threaded throughout thiscontribution. in particular, we present observations of water tracing theearliest stage of star birth where it is predominantly frozen as ice. when astar is born the local energy release by radiation liberates ices in itssurrounding envelope and powers energetic outflows that appear to be waterfactories. in these regions water plays an important role in the gas physics.finally, we end with an exploration of water in planet forming diskssurrounding young stars. the availability of accurate molecular data(frequencies, collisional rate coefficients, and chemical reaction rates) arecrucial to analyze the observations at each of these steps.

1110.5567	the effects of snowlines on c/o in planetary atmospheres	the c/o ratio is predicted to regulate the atmospheric chemistry in hotjupiters. recent observations suggest that some exo-planets, e.g. wasp 12- b,have atmospheric c/o ratios substantially different from the solar value of0.54. in this paper we present a mechanism that can produce such atmosphericdeviations from the stellar c/o ratio. in protoplanetary disks, differentsnowlines of oxygen- and carbon-rich ices, especially water and carbonmonoxide, will result in systematic variations in the c/o ratio both in the gasand in the condensed phase. in particular, between the h2o and co snowlinesmost oxygen is present in icy grains - the building blocks of planetary coresin the core accretion model - while most carbon remains in the gas-phase. thisregion is coincidental with the giant-planet forming zone for a range ofobserved protoplanetary disks. based on standard core accretion models ofplanet formation, gas giants that sweep up most of their atmospheres from diskgas outside of the water snowline will have c/o?1, while atmospheressignificantly contaminated by evaporating planetesimals will have stellar orsub-stellar c/o when formed at the same disk radius. the overall metallicitywill also depend on the atmosphere formation mechanism, and exoplanetaryatmospheric compositions may therefore provide constraints on where and how aspecific planet formed.

1111.0010	transition disk chemistry and future prospects with alma	we explore the chemical structure of a disk that contains a large central gapof r ~ 45 au, as is commonly seen in transitional disk systems. in our chemicalmodel of a disk with a cleared inner void, the midplane becomes revealed to thecentral star so that it is directly irradiated. the midplane material at thetruncation radius is permissive to reprocessed optical heating radiation, butopaque to the photo-dissociating ultraviolet, creating an environment abundantin gas-phase molecules. thus the disk midplane, which would otherwise for afull disk be dominated by near complete heavy element freeze-out, should becomeobservable in molecular emission. if this prediction is correct this hasexciting prospects for observations with the atacama largemillimeter/submillimeter array (alma), as the inner transition region shouldthus be readily detected and resolved, especially using high-j rotationaltransitions excited in the high density midplane gas. therefore suchobservations will potentially provide us with a direct probe of the physics andchemistry at this actively evolving interface.

1201.1402	very large array observations of ammonia in infrared-dark clouds ii:  internal kinematics	infrared-dark clouds (irdcs) are believed to be the birthplaces of richclusters and thus contain the earliest phases of high-mass star formation. weuse the green bank telescope (gbt) and very large array (vla) maps of ammonia(nh3) in six irdcs to measure their column density and temperature structure(paper 1), and here, we investigate the kinematic structure and energy content.we find that irdcs overall display organized velocity fields, with onlylocalized disruptions due to embedded star formation. the local effects seen innh3 emission are not high velocity outflows but rather moderate (few km/s)increases in the line width that exhibit maxima near or coincident with themid-infrared emission tracing protostars. these line width enhancements couldbe the result of infall or (hidden in nh3 emission) outflow. not only is thekinetic energy content insufficient to support the irdcs against collapse, butalso the spatial energy distribution is inconsistent with a scenario ofturbulent cloud support. we conclude that the velocity signatures of the irdcsin our sample are due to active collapse and fragmentation, in some casesaugmented by local feedback from stars.

1201.2174	complex structure in class 0 protostellar envelopes iii: velocity  gradients in non-axisymmetric envelopes, infall or rotation?	we present an interferometric kinematic study of morphologically complexprotostellar envelopes based on observations of the dense gas tracers n2h+ andnh3. the strong asymmetric nature of most envelopes in our sample leads us toquestion the common interpretation of velocity gradients as rotation, given thepossibility of projection effects in the observed velocities. several"idealized" sources with well-ordered velocity fields and envelope structuresare now analyzed in more detail. we compare the interferometric data toposition-velocity diagrams of kinematic models for spherical rotating collapseand filamentary rotating collapse. for this purpose, we developed a filamentaryparametrization of the rotating collapse model to explore the effects ofgeometric projection on the observed velocity structures. we find that mostenvelopes in our sample have pv structures that can be reproduced by aninfalling filamentary envelope projected at different angles within the planeof the sky. the infalling filament produces velocity shifts across the envelopethat can mimic rotation, especially when viewed at single-dish resolutions andthe axisymmetric rotating collapse model does not uniquely describe anydataset. furthermore, if the velocities are assumed to reflect rotation, thenthe inferred centrifugal radii are quite large in most cases, indicatingsignificant fragmentation potential or more likely another component to theline-center velocity. we conclude that ordered velocity gradients cannot beinterpreted as rotation alone when envelopes are non-axisymmetric and thatprojected infall velocities likely dominate the velocity field on scales largerthan 1000 au.

1206.5749	fundamental aspects of episodic accretion chemistry explored with  single-point models	we explore a set of single-point chemical models to study the fundamentalchemical aspects of episodic accretion in low-mass embedded protostars. ourgoal is twofold: (1) to understand how the repeated heating and cooling of theenvelope affects the abundances of co and related species; and (2) to identifychemical tracers that can be used as a novel probe of the timescales and otherphysical aspects of episodic accretion. we develop a set of single-point modelsthat serve as a general prescription for how the chemical composition of aprotostellar envelope is altered by episodic accretion. the main effect of eachaccretion burst is to drive co ice off the grains in part of the envelope. theduration of the subsequent quiescent stage (before the next burst hits) issimilar to or shorter than the freeze-out timescale of co, allowing thechemical effects of a burst to linger long after the burst has ended. wepredict that the resulting excess of gas-phase co can be observed withsingle-dish or interferometer facilities as evidence of an accretion burst inthe past 10^3 - 10^4 yr.

1208.5998	first detection of water vapor in a pre-stellar core	water is a crucial molecule in molecular astrophysics as it controls much ofthe gas/grain chemistry, including the formation and evolution of more complexorganic molecules in ices. pre-stellar cores provide the original reservoir ofmaterial from which future planetary systems are built, but few observationalconstraints exist on the formation of water and its partitioning between gasand ice in the densest cores. thanks to the high sensitivity of the herschelspace observatory, we report on the first detection of water vapor at highspectral resolution toward a dense cloud on the verge of star formation, thepre-stellar core l1544. the line shows an inverse p-cygni profile,characteristic of gravitational contraction. to reproduce the observations,water vapor has to be present in the cold and dense central few thousand au ofl1544, where species heavier than helium are expected to freeze-out onto dustgrains, and the ortho:para h2 ratio has to be around 1:1 or larger. theobserved amount of water vapor within the core (about 1.5x10^{-6} msun) can bemaintained by far-uv photons locally produced by the impact of galactic cosmicrays with h2 molecules. such fuv photons irradiate the icy mantles, liberatingwater wapor in the core center. our herschel data, combined with radiativetransfer and chemical/dynamical models, shed light on the interplay between gasand solids in dense interstellar clouds and provide the first measurement ofthe water vapor abundance profile across the parent cloud of a futuresolar-type star and its potential planetary system.

1304.7389	embedded protostars in the dust, ice, and gas in time (digit) key  program: continuum seds, and an inventory of characteristic far-infrared  lines from pacs spectroscopy	we present 50-210 um spectral scans of 30 class 0/i protostellar sources,obtained with herschel-pacs, and 0.5-1000 um seds, as part of the dust, ice,and gas in time (digit) key program. some sources exhibit up to 75 h2o linesranging in excitation energy from 100-2000 k, 12 transitions of oh, and corotational lines ranging from j=14-13 up to j=40-39. [o i] is detected in allbut one source in the entire sample; among the sources with detectable [o i]are two very low luminosity objects (vellos). the mean 63/145 um [o i] fluxratio is 17.2 +/- 9.2. the [o i] 63 um line correlates with lbol, but not withthe time-averaged outflow rate derived from low-j co maps. [c ii] emission isin general not local to the source. the sample lbol increased by 1.25 (1.06)and tbol decreased to 0.96 (0.96) of mean (median) values with the inclusion ofthe herschel data. most co rotational diagrams are characterized by twooptically thin components (&lt;n&gt; = (0.70 +/- 1.12) x 10^49 total particles). n_cocorrelates strongly with lbol, but neither trot nor n_co(warm)/n_co(hot)correlates with lbol, suggesting that the total excited gas is related to thecurrent source luminosity, but that the excitation is primarily determined bythe physics of the interaction (e.g., uv- heating/shocks). rotationaltemperatures for h2o (&lt;trot&gt; = 194 +/- 85 k) and oh (&lt;trot&gt; = 183 +/- 117 k)are generally lower than for co, and much of the scatter in the observationsabout the best fit is attributed to differences in excitation conditions andoptical depths amongst the detected lines.

1305.2247	the abundance of h2o and hdo in orion kl from herschel/hifi	using a broadband, high spectral resolution survey toward orion kl acquiredwith herschel/hifi as part of the hexos key program, we derive the abundancesof h$_2$o and hdo in the different spatial/velocity components associated withthis massive star-forming region: the hot core, compact ridge, and plateau. atotal of 20 transitions of h$_2$$^{18}$o, 14 of h$_2$$^{17}$o, 37 ofhd$^{16}$o, 6 of hd$^{18}$o, and 6 of d$_2$o are used in the analysis, spanningfrom ground state transitions to over 1200 k in upper-state energy.low-excitation lines are detected in multiple components, but thehighest-excitation lines ($e_u &gt;$ 500 k) are well modeled as emitting from asmall ($\sim 2"$) clump with a high abundance of h$_2$o ($\chi = 6.5 \times10^{-4}$ relative to h$_2$) and a hdo/h$_2$o ratio of 0.003. using high spatialresolution ($1.5" \times 1.1"$) images of two transitions of hdo measured byalma as part of its science verification phase, we identify this component aslocated near, but not directly coincident with, known continuum sources in thehot core region. significant hdo/h$_2$o fractionation is also seen in thecompact ridge and plateau components. the outflowing gas, observed with bothemission and absorption components, has a lower hdo/h$_2$o ratio than thecompact components in orion kl, which we propose could be due to modificationby gas-phase shock chemistry.

1306.0902	exclusion of cosmic rays in protoplanetary disks: stellar and magnetic  effects	(abridged) cosmic rays (crs) are thought to provide an important source ofionization in the outermost and densest regions of protoplanetary disks;however, it is unknown to what degree they are physically present. as isobserved in the solar system, stellar winds can inhibit the propagation ofcosmic rays within the circumstellar environment and subsequently into thedisk. in this work, we explore the hitherto neglected effects of cosmic raymodulation by both stellar winds and magnetic field structures and study howthese processes act to reduce disk ionization rates. we construct atwo-dimensional protoplanetary disk model of a t-tauri star system, focusing onionization from stellar and interstellar fuv, stellar x-ray photons, and cosmicrays. we show that stellar winds can power a heliosphere-like analogue, i.e., a"t-tauriosphere," diminishing cosmic ray ionization rates by several orders ofmagnitude at low to moderate cr energies (e_cr&lt;1 gev). we explore models ofboth the observed solar wind cosmic ray modulation and a highly simplifiedestimate for "elevated" cosmic ray modulation as would be expected from a youngt-tauri star. in the former (solar analogue) case, we estimate the ionizationrate from galactic cosmic rays to be zeta_cr~(0.23-1.4) x 1e-18 s^-1. thisrange of values, which we consider to be the maximum cr ionization rate for thedisk, is more than an order of magnitude lower than what is generally assumedin current models for disk chemistry and physics. in the latter case, i.e., fora "t-tauriosphere," the ionization rate by cosmic rays is zeta_cr&lt;1e-20 s^-1,which is 1000 times smaller than the interstellar value. indeed, if winds areas efficient at cosmic ray modulation as predicted here, short-livedradionuclides (now extinct) would have provided the major source of ionization(zeta_rn~7.3e-19 s^-1) in the planet-forming zone of the young solar nebula.

1308.5203	deuterated molecules in orion kl from herschel/hifi	we present a comprehensive study of the deuterated molecules detected in thefullband hifi survey of the orion kl region. ammonia, formaldehyde, andmethanol and their singly deuterated isotopologues are each detected throughnumerous transitions in this survey with a wide range in optical depths andexcitation conditions. in conjunction with a recent study of the abundance ofhdo and h$_2$o in orion kl, this study yields the best constraints on deuteriumfractionation in an interstellar molecular cloud to date. as previous studieshave found, both the hot core and compact ridge regions within orion kl containsignificant abundances of deuterated molecules, suggesting an origin in coldgrain mantles. in the hot core, we find that ammonia is roughly a factor of 2more fractionated than water. in the compact ridge, meanwhile, we find similardeuterium fractionation in water, formaldehyde, and methanol, with d/h ratiosof (2---8) $\times$ $10^{-3}$. the [ch$_2$doh]/[ch$_3$od] ratio in the compactridge is found to be $1.2 \pm 0.3$. the hot core generally has lower deuteriumfractionation than the compact ridge, suggesting a slightly warmer origin, or agreater contribution from warm gas phase chemistry.

1309.0018	radionuclide ionization in protoplanetary disks: calculations of decay  product radiative transfer	we present simple analytic solutions for the ionization rate$\zeta_{\rm{slr}}$ arising from the decay of short-lived radionuclides (slrs)within protoplanetary disks. we solve the radiative transfer problem for thedecay products within the disk, and thereby allow for the loss of radiation atlow disk surface densities; energy loss becomes important outside $r\gtrsim30$for typical disk masses $m_g=0.04$ m$_\odot$. previous studies ofchemistry/physics in these disks have neglected the impact of ionization byslrs, and often consider only cosmic rays (crs), because of the high cr-ratepresent in the ism. however, recent work suggests that the flux of crs presentin the circumstellar environment could be substantially reduced by relativelymodest stellar winds, resulting in severely modulated cr ionization rates,$\zeta_{\rm{cr}}$, equal to or substantially below that of slrs($\zeta_{\rm{slr}}\lesssim10^{-18}$ s$^{-1}$). we compute the net ionizingparticle fluxes and corresponding ionization rates as a function of positionwithin the disk for a variety of disk models. the resulting expressions areespecially simple for the case of vertically gaussian disks (frequently assumedin the literature). finally, we provide a power-law fit to the ionization ratein the midplane as a function of gas disk surface density and time. dependingon location in the disk, the ionization rates by slrs are typically in therange $\zeta_{\rm{slr}}\sim(1-10)\times10^{-19}$ s$^{-1}$.

1309.5370	a significantly low co abundance toward the tw hya protoplanetary disk:  a path to active carbon chemistry?	in this letter we report the co abundance relative to h2 derived toward thecircumstellar disk of the t-tauri star tw hya from the hd (1-0) and c18o (2-1)emission lines. the hd (1-0) line was observed by the herschel spaceobservatory photodetector array camera and spectrometer whereas c18o (2-1)observations were carried out with the submillimeter array at a spatialresolution of 2.8" x 1.9" (corresponding to 142 x 97 au). in the disk's warmmolecular layer (t&gt;20 k) we measure a disk-averaged gas-phase co abundancerelative to h2 of $\chi{\rm(co)}=(0.1-3)x10^{-5}$, substantially lower than thecanonical value of $\chi{\rm(co)}=10^{-4}$. we infer that the best explanationof this low $\chi$(co) is the chemical destruction of co followed by rapidformation of carbon chains, or perhaps co2, that can subsequently freeze-out,resulting in the bulk mass of carbon locked up in ice grain mantles and oxygenin water. as a consequence of this likely time-dependent carbon sink mechanism,co may be an unreliable tracer of h2 gas mass.

1312.0724	a recent accretion burst in the low-mass protostar iras 15398-3359: alma  imaging of its related chemistry	low-mass protostars have been suggested to show highly variable accretionrates through-out their evolution. such changes in accretion, and relatedheating of their ambient envelopes, may trigger significant chemical variationson different spatial scales and from source-to-source. we present images ofemission from c17o, h13co+, ch3oh, c34s and c2h toward the low-mass protostariras 15398-3359 on 0.5" (75 au diameter) scales with the atacama largemillimeter/submillimeter array (alma) at 340 ghz. the resolved images show thatthe emission from h13co+ is only present in a ring-like structure with a radiusof about 1-1.5" (150-200 au) whereas the co and other high dipole momentmolecules are centrally condensed toward the location of the central protostar.we propose that hco+ is destroyed by water vapor present on small scales. theorigin of this water vapor is likely an accretion burst during the last100-1000 years increasing the luminosity of iras 15398-3359 by a factor of 100above its current luminosity. such a burst in luminosity can also explain thecentrally condensed ch3oh and extended warm carbon-chain chemistry observed inthis source and furthermore be reflected in the relative faintness of itscompact continuum emission compared to other protostars.

1401.2423	volatiles in protoplanetary disks	volatiles are compounds with low sublimation temperatures, and they make upmost of the condensible mass in typical planet-forming environments. theyconsist of relatively small, often hydrogenated, molecules based on theabundant elements carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. volatiles are central to theprocess of planet formation, forming the backbone of a rich chemistry that setsthe initial conditions for the formation of planetary atmospheres, and act as asolid mass reservoir catalyzing the formation of planets and planetesimals.this growth has been driven by rapid advances in observations and models ofprotoplanetary disks, and by a deepening understanding of the cosmochemistry ofthe solar system. indeed, it is only in the past few years that representativesamples of molecules have been discovered in great abundance throughoutprotoplanetary disks - enough to begin building a complete budget for the mostabundant elements after hydrogen and helium. the spatial distributions of keyvolatiles are being mapped, snow lines are directly seen and quantified, anddistinct chemical regions within protoplanetary disks are being identified,characterized and modeled. theoretical processes invoked to explain the solarsystem record are now being observationally constrained in protoplanetarydisks, including transport of icy bodies and concentration of bulkcondensibles. the balance between chemical reset - processing of inner diskmaterial strong enough to destroy its memory of past chemistry, and inheritance- the chemically gentle accretion of pristine material from the interstellarmedium in the outer disk, ultimately determines the final composition ofpre-planetary matter. this chapter focuses on making the first steps towardunderstanding whether the planet formation processes that led to our solarsystem are universal.

1405.7394	exploring the origins of carbon in terrestrial worlds	given the central role of carbon in the chemistry of life, it is afundamental question as to how carbon is supplied to the earth, in what formand when. we provide an accounting of carbon found in solar system bodies, inparticular a comparison between the organic content of meteorites and that inidentified organics in the dense interstellar medium (ism). based on thisaccounting identified organics created by the chemistry of star formation couldcontain at most ~15% of the organic carbon content in primitive meteorites andsignificantly less for cometary organics, which represent the putativecontributors to starting materials for the earth. in the ism ~30% of theelemental carbon is found in co, either in the gas or ices, with a typicalabundance of ~10^-4 (relative to h2). recent observations of the tw hya diskfind that the gas phase abundance of co is reduced by an order of magnitudecompared to this value. we explore a solution where the volatile co isdestroyed via a gas phase processes, providing an additional source of carbonfor organic material to be incorporated into planetesimals and cometesimals.this chemical processing mechanism requires warm grains (&gt; 20 k), partiallyionized gas, and sufficiently small &lt;10 micron grains, i.e. a larger totalgrain surface area, such that freeze-out is efficient. under these conditionsstatic (non-turbulent) chemical models predict that a large fraction of thecarbon nominally sequestered in co can be the source of carbon for a widevariety of organics that are present as ice coatings on the surfaces of warmpre-planetesimal dust grains.

1408.2026	water vapor distribution in protoplanetary disks	water vapor has been detected in protoplanetary disks. in this work we modelthe distribution of water vapor in protoplanetary disks with a thermo-chemicalcode. for a set of parameterized disk models, we calculate the distribution ofdust temperature and radiation field of the disk with a monte carlo method, andthen solve the gas temperature distribution and chemical composition. theradiative transfer includes detailed treatment of scattering by atomic hydrogenand absorption by water of lyman alpha photons, since the lyman alpha linedominates the uv spectrum of accreting young stars. in a fiducial model, wefind that warm water vapor with temperature around 300 k is mainly distributedin a small and well-confined region in the inner disk. the inner boundary ofthe warm water region is where the shielding of uv field due to dust and wateritself become significant. the outer boundary is where the dust temperaturedrops below the water condensation temperature. a more luminous central starleads to a more extended distribution of warm water vapor, while dust growthand settling tends to reduce the amount of warm water vapor. based on typicalassumptions regarding the elemental oxygen abundance and the water chemistry,the column density of warm water vapor can be as high as 1e22 cm^{-2}. a smallamount of hot water vapor with temperature higher than ~300 k exists in a moreextended region in the upper atmosphere of the disk. cold water vapor withtemperature lower than 100 k is distributed over the entire disk, produced byphotodesorption of the water ice.

1408.2835	exclusion of cosmic rays in protoplanetary disks. ii. chemical gradients  and observational signatures	the chemical properties of protoplanetary disks are especially sensitive totheir ionization environment. sources of molecular gas ionization includecosmic rays, stellar x-rays and short-lived radionuclides, each of which varieswith location in the disk. this behavior leads to a significant amount ofchemical structure, especially in molecular ion abundances, which is imprintedin their submillimeter rotational line emission. using an observationallymotivated disk model, we make predictions for the dependence of chemicalabundances on the assumed properties of the ionizing field. we calculate theemergent line intensity for abundant molecular ions and simulate sensitiveobservations with the atacama large millimeter/sub-millimeter array (alma) fora disk at d=100 pc. the models readily distinguish between high ionizationrates ($\zeta\gtrsim10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$ per h$_2$) and below, but it becomesdifficult to distinguish between low ionization models when$\zeta\lesssim10^{-19}$ s$^{-1}$. we find that \htdp\ emission is notdetectable for sub-interstellar cr rates with alma (6h integration), and that\ntdp\ emission may be a more sensitive tracer of midplane ionization. hco$^+$traces x-rays and high cr rates ($\zeta_{\rm{cr}}\gtrsim10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$),and provides a handle on the warm molecular ionization properties where co ispresent in the gas. furthermore, species like hco$^+$, which emits from a wideradial region and samples a large gradient in temperature, can exhibitring-like emission as a consequence of low-lying rotational level de-excitationnear the star. this finding highlights a scenario where rings are notnecessarily structural or chemical in nature, but simply a result of theunderlying line excitation properties.

1411.1403	the effects of initial abundances on nitrogen in protoplanetary disks	the dominant form of nitrogen provided to most solar system bodies iscurrently unknown, though available measurements show that the detectednitrogen in solar system rocks and ices is depleted with respect to solarabundances and the interstellar medium. we use a detailed chemical/physicalmodel of the chemical evolution of a protoplanetary disk to explore theevolution and abundance of nitrogen-bearing molecules. based on this model weanalyze how initial chemical abundances, provided as either gas or ice duringthe early stages of disk formation, influence which species become the dominantnitrogen bearers at later stages. we find that a disk with the majority of itsinitial nitrogen in either atomic or molecular nitrogen is later dominated byatomic and molecular nitrogen as well as nh$_{3}$ and hcn ices, where thedominant species varies with disk radius.  when nitrogen is initially in gaseous ammonia, it later becomes trapped inammonia ice except in the outer disk where atomic nitrogen dominates. for adisk with the initial nitrogen in the form of ammonia ice the nitrogen remainstrapped in the ice as nh$_{3}$ at later stages. the model in which most of theinitial nitrogen is placed in atomic n best matches the ammonia abundancesobserved in comets. furthermore the initial state of nitrogen influences theabundance of n$_{2}$h$^{+}$, which has been detected in protoplanetary disks.strong n$_{2}$h$^{+}$ emission is found to be indicative of an n$_{2}$abundance greater than $n_{\mathrm{n_{2}}}/n_{\mathrm{h_{2}}}&gt;10^{-6}$, inaddition to tracing the co snow line. our models also indicate that no ispotentially detectable, with lower n gas abundances leading to higher noabundances.

1411.4231	the d/h ratio of water ice at low temperatures	we present the modeling results of deuterium fractionation of water ice, h2,and the primary deuterium isotopologues of h3+ adopting physical conditionsassociated with the star and planet formation process. we calculated thedeuterium chemistry for a range of gas temperatures (t_gas ~ 10 - 30 k),molecular hydrogen density (n(h2)~ 10^4 - 10^7), and ortho/para ratio (opr) ofh2 based on state-to-state reaction rates and explore the resultingfractionation including the formation of a water ice mantle coating grainsurfaces. we find that the deuterium fractionation exhibits the expectedtemperature dependence of large enrichments at low gas temperature. moresignificantly the inclusion of water ice formation leads to large d/h ratios inwater ice (&gt;= 10^-2 at 10 k) but also alters the overall deuterium chemistry.for t &lt; 20 k the implantation of deuterium into ices lowers the overallabundance of hd which reduces the efficiency of deuterium fractionation at highdensity. in agreement with an earlier study, under these conditions hd may notbe the primary deuterium reservoir in the cold dense interstellar medium andh3+ will be the main charge carrier in the dense centers of pre-stellar coresand the protoplanetary disk midplane.

1412.1491	constraining the x-ray and cosmic ray ionization chemistry of the tw hya  protoplanetary disk: evidence for a sub-interstellar cosmic ray rate	we present an observational and theoretical study of the primary ionizingagents (cosmic rays and x-rays) in the tw hya protoplanetary disk. we use a setof resolved and unresolved observations of molecular ions and other molecularspecies, encompassing eleven lines total, in concert with a grid of diskchemistry models. the molecular ion constraints comprise new data from thesubmillimeter array on hco$^+$, acquired at unprecedented spatial resolution,and data from the literature, including alma observations of n$_2$h$^+$. wevary the model incident cr flux and stellar x-ray spectra and find that twhya's hco$^+$ and n$_2$h$^+$ emission are best fit by a moderately hard x-rayspectra, as would be expected during the "flaring" state of the star, and a lowcr ionization rate, $\zeta_{\rm cr}\lesssim10^{-19}$ s$^{-1}$. this low cr rateis the first indication of the presence of cr exclusion by winds and/ormagnetic fields in an actively accreting t tauri disk system. with this newconstraint, our best fit ionization structure predicts a low turbulence"dead-zone" extending from the inner edge of the disk out to $50-65$ au. thisregion coincides with an observed concentration of millimeter grains, and wepropose that the inner region of tw hya is a dust (and possibly planet) growthfactory as predicted by previous theoretical work.

1412.3172	wind-driven exclusion of cosmic rays in the protoplanetary disk  environment	the recent (apparent) passage of the voyager 1 spacecraft into interstellarspace provides us with front-row seats to the complex interplay between thesolar wind and the protective surrounding bubble known as heliosphere. theheliosphere extends radially out to $\sim100$ au from the sun, and within thissphere of influence, the solar wind modulates the incoming flux of galacticcosmic rays (crs), especially those at low energies. newly formed stars, whichsupport both strong magnetic fields and winds, are expected to produceanalogous regions of cr exclusion, perhaps at elevated levels. such young starsare encircled by molecular gas-rich disks, and the net removal of crs from thecircumstellar environment significantly reduces the expected cr ionization ratein the disk gas, most likely by many orders-of-magnitude. the loss ofionization reduces disk turbulence, and thereby affects both planet-formationand active chemical processes in the disk. we present models of cr exclusionand explore the implications for turbulence and for predicted chemicalabundances. we also discuss means by which alma can be used to search forextrasolar heliosphere-analogs around young stars.

1501.02460	evolution of complex organic molecules in hot molecular cores: synthetic  spectra at (sub-)mm wavebands	hot molecular cores (hmcs) are intermediate stages of high-mass starformation and are also known for their rich emission line spectra at (sub-)mmwavebands. the observed spectral feature of hmcs such as total number ofemission lines and associated line intensities are also found to vary withevolutionary stages. we developed various 3d models for hmcs guided by theevolutionary scenarios proposed by recent empirical and modeling studies. wethen investigated the spatio-temporal variation of temperature and molecularabundances in hmcs by consistently coupling gas-grain chemical evolution withradiative transfer calculations. we explored the effects of varying physicalconditions on molecular abundances including density distribution andluminosity evolution of the central protostar(s). the time-dependenttemperature structure of the hot core models provides a realistic framework forinvestigating the spatial variation of ice mantle evaporation as a function ofevolutionary timescales. with increasing protostellar luminosity, the water iceevaporation font ($\sim$100k) expands and the spatial distribution of gas phaseabundances of these coms also spreads out. we simulated the synthetic spectrafor these models at different evolutionary timescales to compare withobservations. a qualitative comparison of the simulated and observed spectrasuggests that these self-consistent hot core models can reproduce the notabletrends in hot core spectral variation within the typical hot core timescales of10$^{5}$ year. these models predict that the spatial distribution of variousemission line maps will also expand with evolutionary time. the modelpredictions can be compared with high resolution observation that can probescales of a few thousand au in high-mass star forming regions such as fromalma.[abridged]

1503.01225	the warm co gas along the uv-heated outflow cavity walls: a possible  interpretation for the herschel/pacs co spectra of embedded ysos	a fraction of the mid-$j$ ($j$= 14--13 to $j$= 24--23) co emission detectedby the \textit{herschel}/pacs observations of embedded young stellar objects(ysos) has been attributed to the uv-heated outflow cavity walls. we haveapplied our newly developed self-consistent models of photon-dominated region(pdr) and non-local thermal equilibrium line radiative transfer in general grid(rig) to the \textit{herschel} fir observations of 27 low mass ysos and oneintermediate mass yso, ngc7129-firs2. when the contribution of the hotcomponent (traced by transitions of $j&gt; 24$) is removed, the rotationaltemperature of the warm component is nearly constant with $\sim250$ k. this canbe reproduced by the outflow cavity wall ($n \geq 10^6\, \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$,$\log g_{0}/n \geq-4.5$, $\mathrm{log} g_0\ge 3$, $t_{\rm gas} \ge 300 $k, andx(co)$ \ge 10^{-5}$) heated by a uv radiation field with a black bodytemperature of 15,000 k or 10,000 k. however, a shock model combined with aninternal pdr will be required to determine the quantitative contribution of apdr relative to a shock to the mid-$j$ co emission.

1503.04951	chemical tracers of episodic accretion in low-mass protostars	aims: accretion rates in low-mass protostars can be highly variable in time.each accretion burst is accompanied by a temporary increase in luminosity,heating up the circumstellar envelope and altering the chemical composition ofthe gas and dust. this paper aims to study such chemical effects and discussesthe feasibility of using molecular spectroscopy as a tracer of episodicaccretion rates and timescales.  methods: we simulate a strong accretion burst in a diverse sample of 25spherical envelope models by increasing the luminosity to 100 times theobserved value. using a comprehensive gas-grain network, we follow the chemicalevolution during the burst and for up to 10^5 yr after the system returns toquiescence. the resulting abundance profiles are fed into a line radiativetransfer code to simulate rotational spectra of c18o, hco+, h13co+, and n2h+ ata series of time steps. we compare these spectra to observations taken from theliterature and to previously unpublished data of hco+ and n2h+ 6-5 from theherschel space observatory.  results: the bursts are strong enough to evaporate co throughout theenvelope, which in turn enhances the abundance of hco+ and reduces that ofn2h+. after the burst, it takes 10^3-10^4 yr for co to refreeze and for hco+and n2h+ to return to normal. the chemical effects of the burst remain visiblein the rotational spectra for as long as 10^5 yr after the burst has ended,highlighting the importance of considering luminosity variations when analyzingmolecular line observations in protostars. the spherical models are currentlynot accurate enough to derive robust timescales from single-dish observations.as follow-up work, we suggest that the models be calibrated against spatiallyresolved observations in order to identify the best tracers to be used forstatistically significant source samples.

1504.02974	molecule sublimation as a tracer of protostellar accretion: evidence for  accretion bursts from high angular resolution c18o images	the accretion histories of embedded protostars are an integral part ofdescriptions of their physical and chemical evolution. in particular, are theaccretion rates smoothly declining from the earlier toward later stages or infact characterized by variations such as intermittent bursts? we aim tocharacterize the impact of possible accretion variations in a sample ofembedded protostars by measuring the size of the inner regions of theirenvelopes where co is sublimated and relate those to their temperature profilesdictated by their current luminosities. using observations from thesubmillimeter array we measure the extents of the emission from the c18oisotopologue toward 16 deeply embedded protostars. we compare thesemeasurements to the predicted extent of the emission given the currentluminosities of the sources through dust and line radiative transfercalculations. eight out of sixteen sources show more extended c18o emissionthan predicted by the models. the modeling shows that the likely culprit forthese signatures is sublimation due to increases in luminosities of the sourcesby about a factor five or more during the recent 10,000 years - the time ittakes for co to freeze-out again on dust grains. for four of those sources theincrease would have had to have been a factor 10 or more. the compact emissionseen toward the other half of the sample suggests that c18o only sublimateswhen the temperature exceeds 30 k - as one would expect if co is mixed with h2oin the grain ice-mantles. the small-number statistics from this survey suggestthat protostars undergo significant bursts about once every 20,000 years. thisalso illustrates the importance of taking the physical evolutionary historiesinto account for descriptions of the chemical structures of embeddedprotostars.

0805.0573	detection of extended hot water in the outflow from ngc 2071	we report the results of spectroscopic mapping observations carried outtoward a ~1 min x 1 min region within the northern lobe of the outflow from ngc2071 using the infrared spectrograph (irs) of the spitzer space telescope.these observations covered the 5.2-37 um spectral region and have led to thedetection of a number of ionic, atomic, and molecular lines, includingfine-structure emission of si+, fe+, s++, s, the s(0)-s(7) pure rotationallines of h2, the r(3) and r(4) transitions of hd, and at least 11 transitionsof h2o. in addition, the 6.2, 7.4, 7.6, 7.9, 8.6 and 11.3 um pah emission bandswere also observed and several transitions of oh were tentatively detected.most of the detected line transitions were strong enough to map including, forthe first time, three transitions of hot h2o. we find that: (1) the wateremission is extended; (2) the extended emission is aligned with the outflow;and, (3) the spatial distribution of the water emission generally follows thatobserved for h2. based on the measured line intensities, we derive an hdabundance relative to h2 of 1.1-1.8 10^-5 and an h2o number density of 12-2cm^3. the h2 density in the water-emitting region is not well constrained byour observations, but is likely between 3 10^4 and 10^6 cm^3, yielding an h2oabundance relative to h2 of between 2 10^-5 and 6 10^-4. future observationsplanned for the herschel space observatory should greatly improve the densityestimate, and thus our knowledge of the h2o abundance, for the water-emittingregions reported here. finally, we note a possible departure from the h2oortho-to-para ratio of 3:1 expected for water formed in hot post-shocked gas,suggesting that a significant fraction of the water vapor we detect may arisefrom h2o sputtered from cold dust grains.

1505.00882	evidence of fast pebble growth near condensation fronts in the hl tau  protoplanetary disk	water and simple organic molecular ices dominate the mass of solid materialsavailable for planetesimal and planet formation beyond the water snow line.here we analyze alma long baseline 2.9, 1.3 and 0.87 mm continuum images of theyoung star hl tau, and suggest that the emission dips observed are due to rapidpebble growth around the condensation fronts of abundant volatile species.specifically, we show that the prominent innermost dip at 13 au is spatiallyresolved in the 0.87 mm image, and its center radius is coincident with theexpected mid-plane condensation front of water ice. in addition, two otherprominent dips, at distances of 32 and 63 au, cover the mid-plane condensationfronts of pure ammonia or ammonia hydrates and clathrate hydrates (especiallywith co and n$_2$) formed from amorphous water ice. the spectral index map ofhl tau between 1.3 and 0.87 mm shows that the flux ratios inside the dips arestatistically larger than those of nearby regions in the disk. this variationcan be explained by a model with two dust populations, where most of solid massresides in a component that has grown into decimeter size scales inside thedips. such growth is in accord with recent numerical simulations of volatilecondensation, dust coagulation and settling.

1505.07470	indirect detection of forming protoplanets via chemical asymmetries in  disks	we examine changes in the molecular abundances resulting from increasedheating due to a self-luminous planetary companion embedded within a narrowcircumstellar disk gap. using 3d models that include stellar and planetaryirradiation, we find that luminous young planets locally heat up the parentcircumstellar disk by many tens of kelvin, resulting in efficient thermaldesorption of molecular species that are otherwise locally frozen out.furthermore, the heating is deposited over large regions of the disk, $\pm5$ auradially and spanning $\lesssim60^\circ$ azimuthally. from the 3d chemicalmodels, we compute rotational line emission models and full alma simulations,and find that the chemical signatures of the young planet are detectable aschemical asymmetries in $\sim10h$ observations. hcn and its isotopologues areparticularly clear tracers of planetary heating for the models considered here,and emission from multiple transitions of the same species is detectable, whichencodes temperature information in addition to possible velocity informationfrom the spectra itself. we find submillimeter molecular emission will be auseful tool to study gas giant planet formation in situ, especially beyond$r\gtrsim10$ au.

1506.03510	volatile depletion in the tw hydrae disk atmosphere	an abundance decrease in carbon- and oxygen-bearing species relative to dusthas been frequently found in planet-forming disks, which can be attributed toan overall reduction of gas mass. however, in the case of tw hya, the only diskwith gas mass measured directly with hd rotational lines, the inferred gas mass($\lesssim$0.005 solar mass) is significantly below the directly measured value($\gtrsim$0.05 solar mass). we show that this apparent conflict can be resolvedif the elemental abundances of carbon and oxygen are reduced in the upperlayers of the outer disk but are normal elsewhere (except for a possibleenhancement of their abundances in the inner disk). the implication is that inthe outer disk, the main reservoir of the volatiles (co, water, ...) residesclose to the midplane, locked up inside solid bodies that are too heavy to betransported back to the atmosphere by turbulence. an enhancement in the carbonand oxygen abundances in the inner disk can be caused by inward migration ofthese solid bodies. this is consistent with estimates based on previous modelsof dust grain dynamics. indirect measurements of the disk gas mass and diskstructure from species such as co will thus be intertwined with the evolutionof dust grains, and possibly also with the formation of planetesimals.

1507.03580	tentative detection of ethylene glycol toward w51/e2 and g34.3+0.2	how complex organic - and potentially prebiotic - molecules are formed inregions of low- and high-mass star-formation remains a central question inastrochemistry. in particular, with just a few sources studied in detail, it isunclear what role environment plays in complex molecule formation. in thislight, a comparison of relative abundances of related species between sourcesmight be useful to explain observed differences. we seek to measure therelative abundance between three important complex organic molecules, ethyleneglycol ((ch$_2$oh)$_2$), glycolaldehyde (ch$_2$ohcho) and methyl formate(hcooch$_3$), toward high-mass protostars and thereby provide additionalconstraints on their formation pathways. we use iram 30-m single dishobservations of the three species toward two high-mass star-forming regions -w51/e2 and g34.3+0.2 - and report a tentative detection of (ch2oh)2 toward bothsources. assuming that (ch$_2$oh)$_2$, ch$_2$ohcho and hcooch$_3$ spatiallycoexist, relative abundance ratios, hcooch$_3$/(ch$_2$oh)$_2$, of 31 and 35 arederived for g34.3+0.2 and w51/e2, respectively. ch$_2$ohcho is not detected,but the data provide lower limits to the hcooch$_3$/ch$_2$ohcho abundanceratios of $\ge$193 for g34.3+0.2 and $\ge$550 for w51/e2. a comparison of theseresults to measurements from various sources in the literature indicates thatthe source luminosities may be correlated with the hcooch$_3$/(ch$_2$oh)$_2$and hcooch$_3$/ch$_2$ohcho ratios. this apparent correlation may be aconsequence of the relative timescales each source spend at differenttemperatures-ranges in their evolution. furthermore, we obtain lower limits tothe ratio of (ch$_2$oh)$_2$/ch2ohcho for g34.3+0.2 ($\ge$6) and w51/e2($\ge$16). this result confirms that a high (ch$_2$oh)$_2$/ch$_2$ohchoabundance ratio is not a specific property of comets, as previously speculated.

1507.04756	tracing the ingredients for a habitable earth from interstellar space  through planet formation	we use the c/n ratio as a monitor of the delivery of key ingredients of lifeto nascent terrestrial worlds. total elemental c and n contents, and theirratio, are examined for the interstellar medium, comets, chondritic meteoritesand terrestrial planets; we include an updated estimate for the bulk silicateearth (c/n = 49.0 +/- 9.3). using a kinetic model of disk chemistry, and thesublimation/condensation temperatures of primitive molecules, we suggest thatorganic ices and macro-molecular (refractory or carbonaceous dust) organicmaterial are the likely initial c and n carriers. chemical reactions in thedisk can produce nebular c/n ratios of ~1-12, comparable to those of comets andthe low end estimated for planetesimals. an increase of the c/n ratio is tracedbetween volatile-rich pristine bodies and larger volatile-depleted objectssubjected to thermal/accretional metamorphism. the c/n ratios of the dominantmaterials accreted to terrestrial planets should therefore be higher than thoseseen in carbonaceous chondrites or comets. during planetary formation, weexplore scenarios leading to further volatile loss and associated c/nvariations owing to core formation and atmospheric escape. key processesinclude relative enrichment of nitrogen in the atmosphere and preferentialsequestration of carbon by the core. the high c/n bse ratio therefore is bestsatisfied by accretion of thermally processed objects followed by large-scaleatmospheric loss. these two effects must be more profound if volatilesequestration in the core is effective. the stochastic nature of theseprocesses hints that the surface/atmospheric abundances of biosphere-essentialmaterials will likely be variable.

astro-ph;0108023	rapid formation of molecular clouds and stars in the solar neighborhood	observations of both star-forming regions and young, gas-free stellarassociations indicate that most nearby molecular clouds form stars only over ashort time span before dispersal; large-scale flows in the diffuse interstellarmedium have the potential for forming clouds sufficiently rapidly, and forproducing stellar populations with ages much less than the lateral crossingtimes of their host molecular clouds. we identify four important factors forunderstanding rapid star formation and short cloud lifetimes. first, much ofthe accumulation and dispersal of clouds near the solar circle might occur inthe atomic phase; only the high-density portion of a cloud's lifecycle is spentin the molecular phase, thus helping to limit molecular cloud ``lifetimes''.second, once a cloud achieves a high enough column density to form $\h2$ andco, gravitational forces become larger than typical interstellar pressureforces; thus star formation can follow rapidly upon molecular gas formation andturbulent dissipation in limited areas of each cloud complex. third, typicalmagnetic fields are not strong enough to prevent rapid cloud formation andgravitational collapse. fourth, rapid dispersal of gas by newly-formed stars,and reduction of shielding by a small expansion of the cloud after the firstevents of star formation, might limit the length of the star formation epochand the lifetime of a cloud in its molecular state. this picture emphasizes theimportance of large-scale boundary conditions for understanding molecular cloudformation, and implies that star formation is a highly dynamic, rather thanquasi-static, process.

astro-ph;0211505	sensitive limits on the water abundance in cold low mass molecular cores	we present swas observations of water vapor in two cold star-less clouds, b68and core d in rho ophiuchus. sensitive non-detections of the 1(10)-1(01)transition of o-h2o are reported for each source. both molecular cores havebeen previously examined by detailed observations that have characterized thephysical structure. using these rather well defined physical properties and amonte-carlo radiation transfer model we have removed one of the largestuncertainties from the abundance calculation and set the lowest water abundancelimit to date in cold low-mass molecular cores. these limits are &lt; 3 x 10^{-8}(relative to h2) and &lt; 8 x 10^{-9} in b68 and rho oph d, respectively. such lowabundances confirm the general lack of ortho-water vapor in cold (t &lt; 20 k)cores. provided that the ortho/para ratio of water is not near zero, theselimits are well below theoretical predictions and appear to support thesuggestion that most of the water in dense low-mass cores is frozen onto thesurfaces of cold dust grains.

astro-ph;0211507	the dynamical state of barnard 68: a thermally supported, pulsating dark  cloud	we report sensitive, high resolution molecular-line observations of the darkcloud barnard 68 obtained with the iram 30-m telescope. we analyzespectral-line observations of c18o, cs(2--1), c34s(2--1), and n2h+(1--0) inorder to investigate the kinematics and dynamical state of the cloud. we findextremely narrow linewidths in the central regions of the cloud. these narrowlines are consistent with thermally broadened profiles for the measured gastemperature of 10.5 k. we determine the thermal pressure to be a factor 4 -- 5times greater than the non-thermal (turbulent) pressure in the central regionsof the cloud, indicating that thermal pressure is the primary source of supportagainst gravity in this cloud. this confirms the inference of a thermallysupported cloud drawn previously from deep infrared extinction measurements.the rotational kinetic energy is found to be only a few percent of thegravitational potential energy, indicating that the contribution of rotation tothe overall stability of the cloud is insignificant. finally, our observationsshow that cs line is optically thick and self-reversed across nearly the entireprojected surface of the cloud. the shapes of the self-reversed profiles areasymmetric and are found to vary across the cloud in such a manner that thepresence of both inward and outward motions are observed within the cloud.moreover, these motions appear to be globally organized in a clear andsystematic alternating spatial pattern which is suggestive of a smallamplitude, non-radial oscillation or pulsation of the outer layers of the cloudabout an equilibrium configuration.

astro-ph;0303044	submillimeter wave astronomy satellite mapping observations of water  vapor around sagittarius b2	observations of the 1(10)-1(01) 556.936 ghz transition of ortho-water withthe submillimeter wave astronomy satellite (swas) have revealed the presence ofwidespread emission and absorption by water vapor around the strongsubmillimeter continuum source sagittarius b2. an incompletely-sampled spectralline map of a region of size 26 x 19 arcmin around sgr b2 reveals threenoteworthy features. first, absorption by foreground water vapor is detectableat local standard-of-rest (lsr) velocities in the range -100 to 0 km/s atalmost every observed position. second, spatially-extended emission by water isdetectable at lsr velocities in the range 80 to 120 km/s at almost everyobserved position. this emission is attributable to the 180-pc molecular ringidentified from previous observations of co. the typical peak antennatemperature of 0.075 k for this component implies a typical water abundance of1.2e-6 to 8e-6 relative to h2. third, strong absorption by water is observedwithin 5 arcmin of sgr b2 at lsr velocities in the range 60 to 82 km/s. ananalysis of this absorption yields a h2o abundance ~ 2e-7 to 4e-7 relative toh2 if the absorbing water vapor is located within the core of sgr b2 itself;or, alternatively, a water column density ~ 2.5e+16 to 4e+16 per cm2 if thewater absorption originates in the warm, foreground layer of gas proposedpreviously as the origin of ammonia absorption observed toward sgr b2.

astro-ph;0311216	astrochemistry and observations	a major limitation and a continuing source of confusion in the interpretationof molecular line observations has been the large degree of chemical complexitythat is observed in star-forming molecular cores. the past decade has seendramatic improvements in our ability to extract chemical information frommolecular line observations. these advances have been driven by newobservational platforms and techniques that use combined studies of molecularemission and dust emission/absorption to derive chemical abundances. i willoutline the various methods and uncertainties in computing chemical informationfrom observations and discuss these new techniques that allow for theestimation of line of sight structure in molecular abundance in both quiescentand active star forming regions. i will show how improved chemical knowledgecan be used to place stronger constraints on theoretical astrochemical models,but also open new avenues in the use of molecular emission to examine thephysics of molecular clouds and star formation. thus, we can begin the processof unraveling the chemical complexities and more fully realize thelong-standing promise of molecular line observations.

astro-ph;0401482	water absorption from line-of-sight clouds toward w49a	we have observed 6 clouds along the line-of-sight toward w49a using thesubmillimeter wave astronomy satellite (swas) and several ground-basedobservatories. the ortho-h2o 1-0 and oh (1665 and 1667 mhz) transitions areobserved in absorption, whereas the low-j co, 13co, and c18o lines, as well asthe [ci] 1-0 transition, are seen in emission. by using both the o-h218o ando-h2o absorption lines, we are able to constrain the column-averaged o-h_2oabundances in each line-of-sight cloud to within about an order of magnitude.assuming the standard n(h2)/n(co) ratio of 10^4, we find n(o-h2o)/n(h2) = 8.1 x10^-8 - 4 x 10^-7 for three clouds with optically thin water lines. in threeadditional clouds, the h$_2$o lines are saturated so we have used observationsof the h218o ground-state transition to find upper limits to the waterabundance of 8.2x 10^-8 - 1.5x10^-6. we measure the oh abundance from theaverage of the 1665 and 1667 mhz observations and find n(oh)/n(h2) = 2.3x10^-7- 1.1x10^-6. the o-h2o and oh abundances are similar to those determined forline-of-sight water absorption features towards w51 and sgr b2 but are higherthan those seen from water emission lines in molecular clouds. however, theclouds towards w49 have lower ratios of oh relative to h2o column densitiesthan are predicted by simple models which assume that dissociativerecombination is the primary formation pathway for oh and h2o. building on thework of neufeld et al. (2002), we present photo-chemistry models includingadditional chemical effects, which can also explain the observed oh and h2ocolumn densities as well as the observed h2o/co abundance ratios.

astro-ph;0405329	molecular cloud formation behind shock waves	we examine the formation of molecular gas behind shocks in atomic gas using achemical/dynamical model, particular emphasis is given to constraints thechemistry places on the dynamical evolution. the most important result of thisstudy is to stress the importance of shielding the molecular gas from thedestructive effects of uv radiation. for shock ram pressures comparable to orexceeding typical local ism pressures, self-shielding controls the formationtime of h2 but co formation requires shielding of the interstellar radiationfield by dust grains. we find that the molecular hydrogen fractional abundancecan become significant well before co forms. the timescale for (co) molecularcloud formation is not set by h2 formation, but rather by the timescale foraccumulating a sufficient column density or extinction, a_v &gt; 0.7. the localratio of atomic to molecular gas (4:1), coupled with short estimates for cloudlifetimes (3-5 myr), suggests that the timescales for accumulating molecularclouds from atomic material typically must be no longer than about 12-20 myr.based on the shielding requirement, this implies that the typical product ofpre-shock density and velocity must be n*v &gt; 20 cm^-3 km s^-1. based on theseresults we find that flow-driven formation of molecular clouds in the localinterstellar medium can occur sufficiently rapidly to account for observations.we also provide detailed predictions of atomic and molecular emission andabsorption that track molecular cloud formation, with a view toward helping toverify cloud formation by shock waves. finally, we provide an analytic solutionfor time-dependent h2 formation which may be of use in numerical hydrodynamiccalculations.

astro-ph;0408091	evolution of chemistry and molecular line profile during protostellar  collapse	understanding the chemical evolution in star-forming cores is a necessarypre-condition to correctly assess physical conditions when using molecularemission. we follow the evolution of chemistry and molecular line profilesthrough the entire star formation process, including a self-consistenttreatment of dynamics, dust continuum radiative transfer, gas energetics,chemistry, molecular excitation, and line radiative transfer. in particular,the chemical code follows a gas parcel as it falls toward the center, passingthrough regimes of density, dust temperature, and gas temperature that arechanging both because of the motion of the parcel and the evolving luminosityof the central source. we combine a sequence of bonnor-ebert spheres and theinside-out collapse model to describe dynamics from the pre-protostellar stageto later stages. the overall structures of abundance profiles show complexbehavior that can be understood as interactions between freeze-out andevaporation of molecules. we find that the presence or absence of gas-phase cohas a tremendous effect on the less abundant species. in addition, the ambientradiation field and the grain properties have important effects on the chemicalevolution, and the variations in abundance have strong effects on the predictedemission line profiles. multi-transition and multi-position ob servations arenecessary to constrain the parameters and interpret observations correctly interms of physical conditions. good spatial and spectral resolution is alsoimportant in distinguishing evolutionary stages.

astro-ph;0409308	a new probe of the planet-forming region in t tauri disks	we present new observations of the fuv (1100-2200 angstrom) radiation fieldand the near- to mid-ir (3--13.5 micron) spectral energy distribution (sed) ofa sample of t tauri stars selected on the basis of bright molecular disks (gmaur, dm tau, lkca15). in each source we find evidence for ly alpha induced h2fluorescence and an additional source of fuv continuum emission below 1700angstroms. comparison of the fuv spectra to a model of h2 excitation suggeststhat the strong continuum emission is due to electron impact excitation of h2.the ultimate source of this excitation is likely x-ray irradiation whichcreates hot photo-electrons mixed in the molecular layer. analysis of the sedof each object finds the presence of inner disk gaps with sizes of a few au ineach of these young (~1 myr) stellar systems. we propose that the presence ofstrong h2 continuum emission and inner disk clearing are related by theincreased penetration power of high energy photons in gas rich regions with lowgrain opacity.

astro-ph;0505345	spitzer observations of co2 ice towards field stars in the taurus  molecular cloud	we present the first spitzer infrared spectrograph observations of the 15.2micron bending mode of co2 ice towards field stars behind a quiescent darkcloud. co2 ice is detected towards 2 field stars (elias 16, elias 3) and asingle protostar (hl tau) with anabundance of ~15-20% relative to water ice.co2 ice is not detected towards the source with lowest extinction in oursample, tamura 17 (a_v = 3.9m). a comparison of the elias 16 spectrum withlaboratory data demonstrates that the majority of co2 ice is embedded in apolar h2o-rich ice component, with ~15% of co2 residing in an apolar h2o-poormantle. this is the first detection of apolar co2 towards a field star. we findthat the co2 extinction threshold is a_v = 4m +/- 1m, comparable to thethreshold for water ice, but significantly less than the threshold for co ice,the likely precursor of co2. our results confirm co2 ice forms in tandem withh2o ice along quiescent lines of sight. this argues for co2 ice formation via amechanism similar to that responsible for h2o ice formation, viz. simplecatalytic reactions on grain surfaces.

astro-ph;0606232	spitzer observations of hh54 and hh7-11: mapping the h2 ortho-to-para  ratio in shocked molecular gas	we report the results of spectroscopic mapping observations carried outtoward the herbig-haro objects hh7-11 and hh54 over the 5.2 - 37 micron regionusing the infrared spectrograph of the spitzer space telescope. theseobservations have led to the detection and mapping of the s(0) - s(7) purerotational lines of molecular hydrogen, together with emissions in finestructure transitions of ne+, si+, s, and fe+. the h2 rotational emissionsindicate the presence of warm gas with a mixture of temperatures in the range400 - 1200 k, consistent with the expected temperature behind nondissociativeshocks of velocity ~ 10 - 20 km/s, while the fine structure emissions originatein faster shocks of velocity 35 - 90 km/s that are dissociative and ionizing.maps of the h2 line ratios reveal little spatial variation in the typicaladmixture of gas temperatures in the mapped regions, but show that the h2ortho-to-para ratio is quite variable, typically falling substantially belowthe equilibrium value of 3 attained at the measured gas temperatures. thenon-equilibrium ortho-to-para ratios are characteristic of temperatures as lowas ~ 50 k, and are a remnant of an earlier epoch, before the gas temperaturewas elevated by the passage of a shock. correlations between the gastemperature and h2 ortho-to-para ratio show that ortho-to-para ratios &lt; 0.8 areattained only at gas temperatures below ~ 900 k; this behavior is consistentwith theoretical models in which the conversion of para- to ortho-h2 behind theshock is driven by reactive collisions with atomic hydrogen, a process whichpossesses a substantial activation energy barrier (e_a/k ~ 4000 k) and istherefore very inefficient at low temperature.

astro-ph;0606284	molecular line observations of infrared dark clouds: seeking the  precursors to intermediate and massive star formation	we have identified 41 infrared dark clouds from the 8 micron maps of themidcourse space experiment (msx), selected to be found within one square degreeareas centered on known ultracompact hii regions. we have mapped these infrareddark clouds in n2h+(1-0), cs(2-1) and c18o(1-0) emission using the five collegeradio astronomy observatory. the maps of the different species often showstriking differences in morphologies, indicating differences in evolutionarystate and/or the presence of undetected, deeply embedded protostars. we derivean average mass for these clouds using n2h+ column densities of ~2500 solarmasses, a value comparable to that found in previous studies of high mass starforming cores using other mass tracers. the linewidths of these clouds aretypically ~2.0 - 2.9 km/s. based on the fact that they are dark at 8 micron,compact, massive, and have large velocity dispersions, we suggest that theseclouds may be the precursor sites of intermediate and high mass star formation.

0809.1642	water, o2 and ice in molecular clouds	we model the temperature and chemical structure of molecular clouds as afunction of depth into the cloud, assuming a cloud of constant density nilluminated by an external fuv (6 ev &lt; e &lt; 13.6 ev) flux g_0 (scaling factor inmultiples of the local interstellar field). extending previousphotodissociation region models, we include the freezing of species, simplegrain surface chemistry, and desorption (including fuv photodesorption) ofices. we also treat the opaque cloud interior with time-dependent chemistry.here, under certain conditions, gas phase elemental oxygen freezes out as waterice and the elemental c/o abundance ratio can exceed unity, leading to complexcarbon chemistry. gas phase h2o and o2 peak in abundance at intermediate depthinto the cloud, roughly a_v~3-8 from the surface, the depth proportional toln(g_0/n). closer to the surface, molecules are photodissociated. deeper intothe cloud, molecules freeze to grain surfaces. at intermediate depthsphotodissociation rates are attenuated by dust extinction, but photodesorptionprevents total freezeout. for g_0 &lt; 500, abundances of h2o and o2 peak atvalues ~10^(-7), producing columns ~10^(15) per cm^2, independent of g_0 and n.the peak abundances depend primarily on the product of the photodesorptionyield of water ice and the grain surface area per h nucleus. at higher valuesof g_0, thermal desorption of o atoms from grains enhances the gas phase h2opeak abundance and column slightly, whereas the gas phase o2 peak abundancerises to ~10^(-5) and the column to ~2x10^(16) per cm^2. we present simpleanalytic equations for the abundances as a function of depth which clarify thedependence on parameters. the models are applied to observations of h2o, o2,and water ice in a number of sources, including b68, ngc 2024, and rho oph.

astro-ph;9803330	the post-shock chemical lifetimes of outflow tracers and a possible new  mechanism to produce water ice mantles	we have used a coupled time-dependent chemical and dynamical model toinvestigate the lifetime of the chemical legacy left in the wake of c-typeshocks. we concentrate this study on the chemistry of h2o and o2, two moleculeswhich are predicted to have abundances that are significantly affected inshock-heated gas. two models are presented: (1) a three-stage model ofpre-shock, shocked, and post-shock gas; and (2) a monte-carlo cloud simulationwhere we explore the effects of stochastic shock activity on molecular gas overa cloud lifetime. in agreement with previous studies, we find that shockvelocities in excess of 10 km s^-1 are required to convert all of the oxygennot locked in co into h2o before the gas has an opportunity to cool. for puregas-phase models the lifetime of the high water abundances, or ``h2o legacy'',in the post-shock gas is 4 - 7 x 10^5 years. through the monte carlo cloudsimulation we demonstrate that the time-average abundance of h2o is a sensitivefunction of the frequency of shocks. thus we predict that the abundance of h2oand other known outflow tracers can be used to trace the history of shockactivity in molecular gas. for gas-grain models we find that the abundance ofwater-ice on grain surfaces can be quite large and is comparable to thatobserved in molecular clouds. this offers a possible alternative method tocreate water mantles without resorting to grain surface chemistry: gas heatingand chemical modification due to a c-type shock and subsequent depletion of thegas-phase species onto grain mantles.

astro-ph;9809246	the ionization fraction in dense molecular gas ii: massive cores	we present an observational and theoretical study of the ionization fractionin several massive cores located in regions that are currently forming stellarclusters. maps of the emission from the j = 1-&gt; o transitions of c18o, dco+,n2h+, and h13co+, as well as the j = 2 -&gt; 1 and j = 3 -&gt; 2 transitions of cs,were obtained for each core. core densities are determined via a large velocitygradient analysis with values typically 10^5 cm^-3. with the use ofobservations to constrain variables in the chemical calculations we deriveelectron fractions for our overall sample of 5 cores directly associated withstar formation and 2 apparently starless cores. the electron abundances arefound to lie within a small range, -6.9 &lt; log10(x_e) &lt; -7.3, and are consistentwith previous work. we find no difference in the amount of ionization fractionbetween cores with and without associated star formation activity, nor is anydifference found in electron abundances between the edge and center of theemission region. thus our models are in agreement with the standard picture ofcosmic rays as the primary source of ionization for molecular ions. with theaddition of previously determined electron abundances for low mass cores, andeven more massive cores associated with o and b clusters, we systematicallyexamine the ionization fraction as a function of star formation activity. thisanalysis demonstrates that the most massive sources stand out as having thelowest electron abundances (x_e &lt; 10^-8).
