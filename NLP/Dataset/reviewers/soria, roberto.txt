0901.3750	the xmm-newton long look of ngc 1365: lack of a high/soft state in its  ultraluminous x-ray sources	based on our long (~ 300 ks) 2007 xmm-newton observation of the seyfertgalaxy ngc 1365, we report here on the spectral and timing behaviour of twoultraluminous x-ray sources, which had previously reached isotropic x-rayluminosities l_x ~ 4 x 10^{40} erg/s (0.3-10 kev band). in 2007, they were in alower state (l_x ~ 5 x 10^{39} erg/s, and l_x ~ 1.5 x 10^{39} erg/s for x1 andx2, respectively). their x-ray spectra were dominated by power-laws with photonindices gamma ~ 1.8 and gamma ~ 1.2, respectively. thus, their spectra weresimilar to those at their outburst peaks. both sources have been seen to varyby a factor of 20 in luminosity over the years, but their spectra are alwaysdominated by a hard power-law; unlike most stellar-mass bhs, they have neverbeen found in a canonical high/soft state dominated by a standard disk. thelack of a canonical high/soft state seems to be a common feature of ulxs. wespeculate that the different kind of donor star and/or a persistentlysuper-eddington accretion rate during their outbursts may prevent accretionflows in ulxs from settling into steady standard disks.

0901.4302	different types of ultraluminous x-ray sources in ngc 4631	we have re-examined the most luminous x-ray sources in the starburst galaxyngc 4631, using xmm-newton, chandra and rosat data. the most interesting sourceis a highly variable supersoft ulx. we suggest that its bolometric luminosity ~a few 10^{39} erg/s in the high/supersoft state: this is an order of magnitudelower than estimated in previous studies, thus reducing the need for extreme orexotic scenarios. moreover, we find that this source was in a non-canonicallow/soft (kt ~ 0.1-0.3 kev) state during the chandra observation. by comparingthe high and low state, we argue that the spectral properties may not beconsistent with the expected behaviour of an accreting intermediate-mass blackhole. we suggest that recurrent super-eddington outbursts with photosphericexpansion from a massive white dwarf (m_{wd} &gt;~ 1.3 m_{sun}), powered bynon-steady nuclear burning, may be a viable possibility, in alternative to thepreviously proposed scenario of a super-eddington outflow from an accretingstellar-mass black hole. the long-term average accretion rate required fornuclear burning to power such white-dwarf outbursts in this source and perhapsin other supersoft ulxs is ~ 5-10 x 10^{-6} m_{sun}/yr: this is comparable tothe thermal-timescale mass transfer rate invoked to explain the most luminoushard-spectrum ulxs (powered by black hole accretion). the other four mostluminous x-ray sources in ngc 4631 (three of which can be classified as ulxs)appear to be typical accreting black holes, in four different spectral states:high/soft, convex-spectrum, power-law with soft excess, and simple power-law.none of them requires masses &gt;~ 50 m_{sun}.

0904.1091	a census of x-ray nuclear activity in nearby galaxies	we have studied the x-ray nuclear activity of 187 nearby (distance &lt; 15 mpc)galaxies observed with chandra/acis. we found that 86 of them have a point-likex-ray core, consistent with an accreting black hole (bh). we argue that themajority of them are nuclear bhs, rather than x-ray binaries. the fraction ofgalaxies with an x-ray detected nuclear bh is higher (~60 per cent) forellipticals and early-type spirals (e to sb), and lower (~30 per cent) forlate-type spirals (sc to sm). there is no preferential association of x-raycores with a large-scale bar; in fact, strongly barred galaxies appear to haveslightly lower detection fraction and luminosity for their nuclear x-raysources, compared with non-barred or weakly barred galaxies of similar hubbletypes. the cumulative luminosity distribution of the nuclear sources in the0.3-8 kev band is a power-law with slope ~-0.5, from ~2 x 10^{38} erg/s to~10^{42} erg/s. the eddington ratio is lower for ellipticals (l_{x}/l_{edd} ~10^{-8}) and higher for late-type spirals (up to l_{x}/l_{edd} ~ 10^{-4}), butin all cases, the accretion rate is low enough to be in theradiatively-inefficient regime. the intrinsic nh is generally low, especiallyfor the less luminous sources: there appear to be no type-2 nuclear bhs atluminosities &lt;~ 10^{39} erg/s. the lack of a dusty torus or of other sources ofintrinsic absorption (e.g., an optically-thick disk wind) may be directlyrelated to the lack of a standard accretion disk around those faint nuclearbhs. the fraction of obscured sources increases with the nuclear bh luminosity:2/3 of the sources with l_{x} &gt; 10^{40} erg/s have a fitted nh &gt; 10^{22}cm^{-2}. this is contrary to the declining trend of the obscured fraction withincreasing luminosities, observed in more luminous agn and quasars.

0907.4718	ultraluminous x-ray source correlations with star-forming regions	maps of low-inclination nearby galaxies in sloan digitized sky survey u-g,g-r and r-i colors are used to determine whether ultraluminous x-ray sources(ulxs) are predominantly associated with star-forming regions of their hostgalaxies. an empirical selection criterion is derived from colors of hiiregions in m81 and m101 that differentiates between the young, blue stellarcomponent and the older disk and bulge population. this criterion is applied toa sample of 58 galaxies of hubble type s0 and later and verified through anapplication of fisher's linear discriminant analysis. it is found that 60%(49%) of ulxs in optically-bright environments are within regions blueward oftheir host galaxy's hii regions compared to only 27% (0%) of a control sampleaccording to the empirical (fisher) criterion. this is an excess of 3-sigmaabove the 32% (27%) expected if the ulxs were randomly distributed within theirgalactic hosts. this indicates a ulx preference for young, approximately &lt;10myr, ob associations. however, none of the ulx environments have the morphologyand optical brightness suggestive of a massive young super star cluster thoughseveral are in extended or crowded star-forming (blue) environments that maycontain clusters unresolved by sloan imaging. ten of the 12 ulx candidates withestimated x-ray luminosities in excess of 3e39 erg/s are equally divided amongthe group of ulx environments redward of hii regions and the group of opticallyfaint regions. this likely indicates that the brightest ulxs turn on at a timesomewhat later than typical of hii regions; say 10-20 myr after star formationhas ended. this would be consistent with the onset of an accretion phase as thedonor star ascends the giant branch if the donor is a &lt;20 solar-mass star.

0910.1356	discovery of an optical counterpart to the hyperluminous x-ray source in  eso 243-49	the existence of black holes of masses ~ 10^2-10^5 msun has importantimplications for the formation and evolution of star clusters and supermassiveblack holes. one of the strongest candidates to date is the hyperluminous x-raysource hlx1, possibly located in the s0-a galaxy eso243-49, but the lack of anidentifiable optical counterpart had hampered its interpretation. using themagellan telescope, we have discovered an unresolved optical source with r =(23.80 +/- 0.25) mag and v = (24.5 +/- 0.3) mag within hlx1's positional errorcircle. this implies an average x-ray/optical flux ratio ~ 500. taking the samedistance as eso243-49, we obtain an intrinsic brightness m_r = (-11.0 +/- 0.3)mag, comparable to that of a massive globular cluster. alternatively, theoptical source is consistent with a main-sequence m star in the galactic halo(for example an m4.4 star at ~ 2.5 kpc). we also examined the properties ofeso243-49 by combining swift/uvot observations with stellar populationmodelling. we found that the overall emission is dominated by a ~5 gyr oldstellar population, but the uv emission at ~2000 ang is mostly due to ongoingstar-formation at a rate of ~ 0.03 msun/yr. the uv emission is more intense (atleast a 9-sigma enhancement above the mean) north east of the nucleus, in thesame quadrant as hlx1. with the combined optical and x-ray measurements, we putconstraints on the nature of hlx1. we rule out a foreground star and abackground agn. two alternative scenarios are still viable. hlx1 could be anaccreting intermediate-mass black hole in a star cluster, which may itself bethe stripped nucleus of a dwarf galaxy that passed through eso243-49, an eventwhich might have caused the current episode of star formation. or, it could bea neutron star in the galactic halo, accreting from an m4-m5 donor star.

0912.2732	radio lobes and x-ray hot spots of the extraordinary microquasar in ngc  7793	we have studied the newly-discovered microquasar in ngc 7793 in radio,optical and x-ray bands. this system comprises a large (250 x 120 pc)line-emitting optical nebula, detected in h-alpha and heii 4686. the opticalnebula coincides with a synchrotron-emitting radio cocoon, with a radioluminosity about 4 times that of cas a. the central black hole appears as ahard x-ray source with a point-like, blue optical counterpart. two prominentradio lobes are located at the extremities of the cocoon. just ahead of theradio lobes, we found two x-ray hot spots, which we interpret as a signature ofthe bow shock into the interstellar medium. the x-ray hot spots, radio lobes,x-ray core and major axis of the cocoon are well aligned, proving that thesystem is powered by a jet. from the x-ray data, we estimate a jet power ~ afew times 10^{40} erg/s, active over a timescale ~10^{5} yrs. thisextraordinary system is a long-sought analog of the galactic microquasar ss433.

1008.0394	radio lobes and x-ray hot spots in the microquasar s26	we have studied the structure and energetics of the powerfulmicroquasar/shock-ionized nebula s26 in ngc 7793, with particular focus on itsradio and x-ray properties. using the australia telescope compact array, wehave resolved for the first time the radio lobe structure and mapped thespectral index of the radio cocoon. the steep spectral index of the radio lobesis consistent with optically-thin synchrotron emission; outside the lobes, thespectral index is flatter, suggesting an additional contribution from free-freeemission, and perhaps ongoing ejections near the core. the radio core is notdetected, while the x-ray core has a 0.3-8 kev luminosity ~6 x 10^{36} erg/s.the size of the radio cocoon matches that seen in the optical emission linesand diffuse soft x-ray emission. the total 5.5-ghz flux of cocoon and lobes is~2.1 mjy, which at the assumed distance of 3.9 mpc corresponds to about 3 timesthe luminosity of cas a. the total 9.0-ghz flux is ~1.6 mjy. the x-ray hotspots (combined 0.3-8 kev luminosity ~2 x 10^{37} erg/s) are located ~20 pcoutwards of the radio hot spots (ie, downstream along the jet direction),consistent with a different physical origin of x-ray and radio emission(thermal-plasma and synchrotron, respectively). the total particle energy inthe bubble is ~10^{53} erg: from the observed radio flux, we estimate that onlyabout a few 10^{50} erg are stored in the relativistic electrons; the rest isin protons, nuclei and non-relativistic electrons. the x-ray-emitting componentof the gas in the hot spots contains ~10^{51} erg, and ~10^{52} erg over thewhole cocoon. we suggest that s26 provides a clue to understand how the ambientmedium is heated by the mechanical power of a black hole near its eddingtonaccretion rate.

1009.5986	hard and soft spectral states of ulxs	i discuss some differences between the observed spectral states ofultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs) and the canonical scheme of spectral statesdefined in galactic black holes. the standard interpretation of ulxs with acurved spectrum, or a moderately steep power-law with soft excess andhigh-energy downturn, is that they are an extension of the very high state, upto luminosities ~ 1 to 3 l_{edd}. two competing models are comptonization in awarm corona, and slim disk; i suggest bulk motion comptonization in theradiatively-driven outflow as another possibility. the interpretation of ulxswith a hard power-law spectrum is more problematic. some of them remain in thatstate over a large range of luminosities; others switch directly to a curvedstate without going through a canonical high/soft state. i suggest that thoseulxs are in a high/hard state not seen in galactic black holes; that state mayoverlap with the low/hard state at lower accretion rates, and extend all theway to eddington accretion rates. if some black holes can reach eddingtonaccretion rates without switching to a standard-disk-dominated state, it isalso possible that they never quench their steady jets.

1103.3009	accretion states of the galactic microquasar grs 1758-258	we present the results of a radio and x-ray study of the galactic microquasargrs 1758-258, using unpublished archival data and new observations. we focus inparticular on the 2000-2002 state transitions, and on its more quiet behaviourin 2008-2009. our spectral and timing analysis of the xmm-newton data showsthat the source was in the canonical intermediate, soft and hard states in 2000september 19, 2001 march 22 and 2002 september 28, respectively. we estimatethe disk size, luminosity and temperature, which are consistent with a blackhole mass ~10 m_{sun}. there is much overlap between the range of total x-rayluminosities (on average ~0.02 l_{edd}) in the hard and soft states, andprobably between the corresponding mass accretion rates; in fact, the hardstate is often more luminous. the extended radio lobes seen in 1992 and 1997are still present in 2008-2009. the 5-ghz radio core flux density has shownvariability between ~0.1-0.5 mjy over the last two decades. this firmly placesgrs 1758-258 in the radio-quiet sequence of galactic black holes, in theradio/x-ray plane. we note that this dichotomy is similar to the dichotomybetween the radio/x-ray sequences of seyfert and radio galaxies. we proposethat the different radio efficiency of the two sequences is due to relativisticelectron/positron jets in radio-loud black holes, and sub-relativistic,thermally dominated outflows in radio-quiet sources.

1108.1372	a complete sample of ulx host galaxies	one hundred seven ultraluminous x-ray (ulx) sources with 0.3-10.0 kevluminosities in excess of 1e39 erg/s are identified in a complete sample of 127nearby galaxies. the sample includes all galaxies within 14.5 mpc above thecompleteness limits of both the uppsala galaxy catalog and the infraredastronomical satellite survey. the galaxy sample spans all hubble types, a fourdecade range in mass and in star-formation rate. ulxs are detected in thissample at rates of one per 3.2e10 solar mass, one per 0.5 solar mass/yearstar-formation rate, and one per 57 cubic mpc corresponding to a luminositydensity of ~2e37 erg/s/mpc3. at these rates we estimate as many as 19additional ulxs remain undetected in fainter dwarf galaxies within the surveyvolume. an estimated 14 or 13%, of the 107 ulx candidates are expected to bebackground sources. the differential ulx luminosity function shows a power lawslope of -1.2 to -2.0 with an exponential cutoff at 2e40 erg/s with precisevalues depending on the model and on whether the ulx luminosities are estimatedfrom their observed numbers of counts or, for a subset of candidates, fromtheir spectral shapes. extrapolating the observed luminosity function predictsat most one very luminous ulx, l~1e41 erg/s, within a distance as small as 100mpc. the luminosity distribution of ulxs within the local universe cannotaccount for the recent claims of luminosities in excess of 2e41 erg/s requiringa new population class to explain these extreme objects.

1111.6783	optical counterpart of hlx-1 during the 2010 outburst	we studied the optical counterpart of the intermediate-mass black holecandidate hlx-1 in eso 243-49. we used a set of very large telescope imagingobservations from 2010 november, integrated by swift x-ray data from the sameepoch. we measured standard vega brightnesses u = 23.89 +/- 0.18 mag, b = 25.19+/- 0.30 mag, v = 24.79 +/- 0.34 mag and r = 24.71 +/- 0.40 mag. therefore, thesource was ~1 mag fainter in each band than in a set of hubble space telescopeimages taken a couple of months earlier, when the x-ray flux was a factor of 2higher. we conclude that during the 2010 september observations, the opticalcounterpart was dominated by emission from an irradiated disk (which respondsto the varying x-ray luminosity), rather than by a star cluster around theblack hole (which would not change). we modelled the comptonized, irradiatedx-ray spectrum of the disk, and found that the optical luminosity and coloursin the 2010 november data are still consistent with emission from theirradiated disk, with a characteristic outer radius r_{out} ~ 2800 r_{in} ~10^{13} cm and a reprocessing fraction ~ 2 x 10^{-3}. the optical colours arealso consistent with a stellar population with age &lt;~ 6 myr (at solarmetallicity) and mass ~ 10^4 m_{sun}; this is only an upper limit to the mass,if there is also a significant contribution from an irradiated disk. westrongly rule out the presence of a young super-star-cluster, which would betoo bright. an old globular cluster might be associated with hlx-1, as long asits mass &lt;~ 2 x 10^6 m_{sun} for an age of 10 gyr, but it cannot significantlycontribute to the observed very blue and variable optical/uv emission.

1201.5210	long-term x-ray variability of swift j1644+57	we studied the x-ray timing and spectral variability of the x-ray source swj1644+57, a candidate for a tidal disruption event. we have separated thelong-term trend (an initial decline followed by a plateau) from the short-termdips in the swift light-curve. power spectra and lomb-scargle periodograms hintat possible periodic modulation. by using structure function analysis, we haveshown that the dips were not random but occurred preferentially at timeintervals ~ [2.3, 4.5, 9] x 10^5 s and their higher-order multiples. after theplateau epoch, dipping resumed at ~ [0.7, 1.4] x 10^6 s and their multiples. wehave also found that the x-ray spectrum became much softer during each of theearly dip, while the spectrum outside the dips became mildly harder in itslong-term evolution. we propose that the jet in the system undergoes precessionand nutation, which causes the collimated core of the jet briefly to go out ofour line of sight. the combined effects of precession and nutation provide anatural explanation for the peculiar patterns of the dips. we interpret theslow hardening of the baseline flux as a transition from an extended, opticallythin emission region to a compact, more opaque emission core at the base of thejet.

1203.2335	the birth of an ultra-luminous x-ray source in m83	a previously undetected x-ray source (l_x&lt;10**36 erg/s) in the stronglystar-forming galaxy m83 entered an ultraluminous state between august 2009 anddecember 2010. it was first seen with chandra on 23 december 2010 at l_x ~ 410**39 ergs/s, and has remained ultraluminous through our most recentobservations in december 2011, with typical flux variation of a factor of two.the spectrum is well fitted by a combination of absorbed power-law and diskblack-body models. while the relative contributions of the models varies withtime, we have seen no evidence for a canonical state transition. the luminosityand spectral properties are consistent with accretion powered by a black holewith m_bh ~ 40-100 solar masses. in july 2011 we found a luminous, blue opticalcounterpart which had not been seen in deep hst observations obtained in august2009. these optical observations suggest that the donor star is a low-mass starundergoing roche-lobe overflow, and that the blue optical emission seen duringthe outburst is coming from an irradiated accretion disk. this source showsthat ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs) with low-mass companions are animportant component of the ulx population in star-forming galaxies, andprovides further evidence that the blue optical counterparts of some ulxs neednot indicate a young, high-mass companion, but rather that they may indicatex-ray reprocessing.

1205.3259	the influence of fallback discs on the spectral and timing properties of  neutron stars	fallback discs around neutron stars (nss) are believed to be an expectedoutcome of supernova explosions. here we investigate the consequences of such acommon outcome for the timing and spectral properties of the associated nspopulation, using monte carlo population synthesis models. we find that thelong-term torque exerted by the fallback disc can substantially influence thelate-time period distribution, but with quantitative differences which dependon whether the initial spin distribution is dominated by slow or fast pulsars.for the latter, a single-peaked initial spin distribution becomes bimodal atlater times. timing ages tend to underestimate the real age of older pulsars,and overestimate the age of younger ones. braking indices cluster in the range1.5 &lt;~ n &lt;~ 3 for slow-born pulsars, and -0.5 &lt;~ n &lt;~ 5 for fast-born pulsars,with the younger objects found predominantly below n &lt;~ 3. large values of n,while not common, are possible, and associated with torque transitions in thens+disc system. the 0.1-10 kev thermal luminosity of the ns+disc system isfound to be generally dominated by the disc emission at early times, t &lt;~ 10^3yr, but this declines faster than the thermal surface emission of the ns.depending on the initial parameters, there can be occasional periods in whichsome nss switch from the propeller to the accretion phase, increasing theirluminosity up to the eddington limit for ~ 10^3-10^4 years.

1207.1555	recovery of the historical sn1957d in x-rays with chandra	sn1957d, located in one of the spiral arms of m83, is one of the small numberof extragalactic supernovae that has remained detectable at radio and opticalwavelengths during the decades after its explosion. here we report the firstdetection of sn1957d in x-rays, as part of a 729 ks observation of m83 with\chandra. the x-ray luminosity (0.3 - 8 kev) is 1.7 (+2.4,-0.3) 10**37 ergs/s.the spectrum is hard and highly self-absorbed compared to most sources in m83and to other young supernova remnants, suggesting that the system is dominatedat x-ray wavelengths by an energetic pulsar and its pulsar wind nebula. thehigh column density may be due to absorption within the sn ejecta. hst wfc3images resolve the supernova remnant from the surrounding emission and thelocal star field. photometry of stars around sn1957d, using wfc3 images,indicates an age of less than 10**7 years and a main sequence turnoff mass morethan 17 solar masses. new spectra obtained with gemini-south show that theoptical spectrum continues to be dominated by broad [o iii] emission lines, thesignature of fast-moving sn ejecta. the width of the broad lines has remainedabout 2700 km/s (fwhm). the [o iii] flux dropped precipitously between 1989 and1991, but continued monitoring shows the flux has been almost constant since.in contrast, radio observations over the period 1990-2011 show a decline rateinf the flux proportional to t**-4, far steeper than the rate observed earlier,suggesting that the primary shock has overrun the edge of a pre-sn wind.

1209.5443	hot diffuse emission in the nuclear starburst region of ngc 2903	(abridged) we present a deep chandra observation of the late-type barredspiral galaxy ngc 2903. the chandra data reveal soft (kt_e ~ 0.2-0.5kev)diffuse emission in the nuclear starburst region and extending ~5kpc to thenorth and west of the nucleus. much of this soft hot gas is likely to be fromlocal active star-forming regions; however, besides the nuclear region, themorphology of hot gas does not strongly correlate with sites of active starformation. the central ~650 pc radius starburst zone exhibits much highersurface brightness diffuse emission than the surrounding regions and a harderspectral component in addition to its soft component. we interpret the hardcomponent as being of thermal origin with kt_e~3.6kev and to be directlyassociated with a wind fluid produced by supernovae and massive star winds. theinferred terminal velocity for this hard component, ~1100 km/s, exceeds thelocal galaxy escape velocity suggesting a potential outflow. the softerextended emission does not display an obvious outflow geometry. however, thecolumn density through which the x-rays are transmitted is lower to the west ofthe nucleus compared to the east and the surface brightness is higher theresuggesting some soft hot gas originates from above the disk; viewed directlyfrom the western zone but through the intervening galaxy disk from the easternzone. there are several point-like sources in the nuclear region with x-rayspectra typical of compact binaries. none of these are coincident with the masscenter of the galaxy and we place an upper limit luminosity from any point-likenuclear source to be &lt; 2x10^38 ergs/s in the 0.5-8.0kev band which indicatesthat ngc 2903 lacks an active galactic nucleus. heating from the nuclearstarburst and a galactic wind may be responsible for preventing cold gas fromaccreting onto the galactic center.

1307.8157	the fading of two transient ulxs to below the stellar mass eddington  limit	we report new detections of the two transient ultraluminous x-ray sources(ulxs) in ngc 5128 from an ongoing series of chandra observations. both sourceshave previously been observed lx (2-3)e39 erg/s, at the lower end of the ulxluminosity range. the new observations allow us to study these sources in theluminosity regime frequented by the galactic black hole x-ray binaries (bhxbs). we present the recent lightcurves of both ulxs. 1rxh j132519.8-430312(ulx1) was observed at lx ~ 1e38 erg/s, while cxou j132518.2-430304 (ulx2)declined to lx ~ 2e37 erg/s and then lingered at this luminosity for hundredsof days. we show that a reasonable upper limit for both duty cycles is 0.2,with a lower limit of 0.12 for ulx2. this duty cycle is larger than anticipatedfor transient ulxs in old stellar populations. by fitting simple spectralmodels in an observation with ~50 counts we recover properties consistent withgalactic bh xbs, but inconclusive as to the spectral state. we utilise quantileanalyses to demonstrate that the spectra are generally soft, and that in oneobservation the spectrum of ulx2 is inconsistent with a canonical hard state at&gt;95% confidence. this is contrary to what would be expected of an accretingimbh primary, which we would expect to be in the hard state at theseluminosities. we discuss the paucity of transient ulxs discovered in early-typegalaxies and excogitate explanations. we suggest that the number of transientulxs scales with the giant and sub-giant populations, rather than the totalnumber of xbs.

1310.2604	combined analysis of hubble and vlt photometry of the intermediate mass  black hole eso 243-49 hlx-1	in this paper we present a combined analysis of data obtained with the hubblespace telescope (hst), very large telescope (vlt), and swift x-ray telescope(xrt) of the intermediate mass black hole eso 243-49 hlx-1 that were taken 2months apart between september and november 2010. previous separate analyses ofthese data found that they were consistent with an irradiated accretion discwith contribution from either a very young or very old stellar population, andalso indicated that the optical flux of the hlx-1 counterpart could bevariable. such variability could only be attributed to a varying accretiondisc, so simultaneous analysis of all data sets should break the degeneraciesin the model fits. we thus simultaneously fit the broad-band spectral energydistribution (sed) from near-infrared through to x-ray wavelengths of the twoepochs of data with a model consisting of an irradiated accretion disc and astellar population. we show that this combined analysis rules out an oldstellar population, finding that the sed is dominated by emission from anaccretion disc with moderate reprocessing in the outer disc around anintermediate mass black hole imbedded in a young (20 myr) stellar cluster witha mass of 1e5 msun. we also place an upper limit on the mass of an additionalhidden old stellar population of 1e6 msun. however, optical r-band observationsof hlx-1 obtained with the gemini-south telescope covering part of the decayfrom a later x-ray outburst are consistent with constant optical flux,indicating that the observed variability between the hst and vlt observationscould be spurious caused by differences in the background subtraction appliedto the two optical data sets. in this scenario the contribution of the stellarpopulation, and thus the stellar mass of the cluster, may be higher (abridged).

1401.0338	extra-nuclear starbursts: young luminous hinge clumps in interacting  galaxies	hinge clumps are luminous knots of star formation near the base of tidalfeatures in some interacting galaxies. we use archival hubble space telescopeuv/optical/ir images and chandra x-ray maps along with galex uv, spitzer ir,and ground-based optical/near-ir images to investigate the star formingproperties in a sample of 12 hinge clumps in five interacting galaxies. themost extreme of these hinge clumps have star formation rates of 1 - 9m(sun)/yr, comparable to or larger than the `overlap' region of intense starformation between the two disks of the colliding galaxy system the antennae. inthe hst images, we have found remarkably large (~70 pc) and luminous (m(i) ~12.2 to -16.5) sources at the centers of these hinge clumps, sometimes embeddedin a linear ridge of fainter star clusters. we have found strong x-ray emissionfrom several of these hinge clumps. in most cases, this emission iswell-resolved with chandra and has a thermal x-ray spectrum, thus it is likelydue to hot gas associated with the star formation. the ratio of theextinction-corrected diffuse x-ray luminosity to the mechanical energy rate(the x-ray production efficiency) for the hinge clumps is similar to that inthe antennae galaxies, but higher than those for regions in the normal spiralgalaxy ngc 2403. two of the hinge clumps have point-like x-ray emission muchbrighter than expected for hot gas; these sources are likely `ultra-luminousx-ray sources' (ulxs) due to accretion disks around black holes. the mostextreme of these sources, in arp 240, has a hard x-ray spectrum and an absorbedx-ray luminosity of ~2 x 10^41 erg/s; more than expected by single high massx-ray binaries (hmxbs), thus it may be either a collection of hmxbs or anintermediate-mass black hole (&gt;=80 m(sun)).

1404.3218	a deep chandra acis survey of m83	we have obtained a series of deep x-ray images of the nearby galaxy m83 usingchandra, with a total exposure of 729 ks. combining the new data with earlierarchival observations totaling 61 ks, we find 378 point sources within the d25contour of the galaxy. we find 80 more sources, mostly background agn, outsideof the d25 contour. of the x-ray sources, 47 have been detected in a new radiosurvey of m83 obtained using the australia telescope compact array. of thex-ray sources, at least 87 seem likely to be supernova remnants (snrs), basedon a combination of their properties in x-rays and at other wavelengths. weattempt to classify the point source population of m83 through a combination ofspectral and temporal analysis. as part of this effort, we carry out an initialspectral analysis of the 29 brightest x-ray sources. the soft x-ray sources inthe disk, many of which are snrs, are associated with the spiral arms, whilethe harder x-ray sources, mostly x-ray binaries (xrbs), do not appear to be.after eliminating agn, foreground stars and identified snrs from the sample, weconstruct the cumulative luminosity function (clf) of xrbs brighter than 810$^{35}$ ergs/s. despite m83's relatively high star formation rate, the clfindicates that most of the xrbs in the disk are low mass xrbs.

1409.6725	dark halo microphysics and massive black hole scaling relations in  galaxies	we investigate the black hole (bh) scaling relation in galaxies using a modelin which the galaxy halo and central bh are a self-gravitating sphere of darkmatter (dm) with an isotropic, adiabatic equation of state. the equipotentialwhere the escape velocity approaches the speed of light defines the horizon ofthe bh. we find that the bh mass ($m_\bullet$) depends on the dm entropy, whenthe effective thermal degrees of freedom ($f$) are specified. relations betweenbh and galaxy properties arise naturally, with the bh mass and dm velocitydispersion following $m_\bullet\propto\sigma^{f/2}$ (for global mean densityset by external cosmogony). imposing observationally derived constraints on $f$provides insight into the microphysics of dm. given that dm velocities andstellar velocities are comparable, the empirical correlation between$m_\bullet$ and stellar velocity dispersions $\sigma_\star$ implies that$7&lt;f&lt;10$. a link between $m_\bullet$ and globular cluster properties alsoarises because the halo potential binds the globular cluster swarm at largeradii. interestingly, for $f&gt;6$ the dense dark envelope surrounding the bhapproaches the mean density of the bh itself, while the outer halo can show anearly uniform kpc-scale core resembling those observed in galaxies.

1501.00030	a newly recognized very young supernova remnant in m83	as part of a spectroscopic survey of supernova remnant candidates in m83using the gemini-south telescope and gmos, we have discovered one object whosespectrum shows very broad lines at h$\alpha$, [o~i] 6300,6363, and [o~iii]4959,5007, similar to those from other objects classified as `late timesupernovae.' although six historical supernovae have been observed in m83 since1923, none were seen at the location of this object. hubble space telescopewide field camera 3 images show a nearly unresolved emission source, whilechandra and atca data reveal a bright x-ray source and nonthermal radio sourceat the position. objects in other galaxies showing similar spectra are onlydecades post-supernova, which raises the possibility that the supernova thatcreated this object occurred during the last century but was missed. usingphotometry of nearby stars from the hst data, we suggest the precursor was atleast 17 $\rm m_{sun}$, and the presence of broad h$\alpha$ in the spectrummakes a type ii supernova likely. the supernova must predate the 1983 vla radiodetection of the object. we suggest examination of archival images of m83 tosearch for evidence of the supernova event that gave rise to this object, andthus provide a precise age.

0805.0265	the oldest x-ray supernovae: x-ray emission from 1941c, 1959d, 1968d	we have studied the x-ray emission from four historical type-ii supernovae(the newly-discovered 1941c in ngc 4631 and 1959d in ngc 7331; and 1968d, 1980kin ngc 6946), using chandra acis-s imaging. in particular, the first three arethe oldest ever found in the x-ray band, and provide constraints on theproperties of the stellar wind and circumstellar matter encountered by theexpanding shock at more advanced stages in the transition towards the remnantphase. we estimate emitted luminosities ~ 5 x 10^{37} erg/s for sn 1941c, ~ afew x 10^{37} erg/s for sn 1959d, ~ 2 x 10^{38} erg/s for sn 1968d, and ~ 4 x10^{37} erg/s for sn 1980k, in the 0.3-8 kev band. x-ray spectral fits to sn1968d suggest the presence of a harder component, possibly a power law withphoton index ~ 2, contributing ~ 10^{37} erg/s in the 2-10 kev band. wespeculate that it may be evidence of non-thermal emission from a crab-likeyoung pulsar.

1506.01870	a high resolution wide-field radio survey of m51	we present the highest resolution, wide-field radio survey of a nearbyface-on star-forming galaxy to date. the multi-phase centre technique is usedto survey the entire disk of m51 (77 square arc minutes) at a maximumresolution of 5 milli-arcseconds on a single 8 hr pointing with the europeanvlbi network at 18 cm. in total, 7 billion pixels were imaged using 192 phasecentres that resulted in the detection of six sources: the seyfert nucleus, thesupernova sn 2011dh, and four background agns. using the wealth of archivaldata available in the radio (merlin and the vla), optical (hubble spacetelescope) and x-rays (chandra) the properties of the individual sources wereinvestigated in detail. the combined multi-wavelength observations reveal avery complex and puzzling core region that includes a low-luminosity parsecscale core-jet structure typical of agns, with evidence for a lateral shiftcorresponding to 0.27c. furthermore, there is evidence for a fossil radiohotspot located 1.44 kpc from the seyfert nucleus that may have resulted from aprevious ejection cycle. our study provides measures of the supernova andstar-formation rates that are comparable to independent studies at otherwavelengths, and places further limits on the radio and x-ray luminosityevolution of the supernovae sn 1994i, sn 2005cs and sn 2011dh. the radio imagesof background agn reveal complex morphologies that are indicative of powerfulradio galaxies, and confirmed via the x-ray and optical properties.

1508.03155	x-ray outbursts of eso 243-49 hlx-1: comparison with galactic low-mass  x-ray binary transients	we studied the outburst properties of the hyper-luminous x-ray source eso243-49 hlx-1, using the full set of swift monitoring observations. wequantified the increase in the waiting time, recurrence time, and e-foldingrise timescale along the outburst sequence, and the corresponding decrease inoutburst duration, total radiated energy, and e-folding decay timescale, whichconfirms previous findings. hlx-1 spends less and less time in outburst andmore and more time in quiescence, but its peak luminosity remains approximatelyconstant. we compared the hlx-1 outburst properties with those of brightgalactic low-mass x-ray binary transients (lmxbts). our spectral analysisstrengthens the similarity between state transitions in hlx-1 and those ingalactic lmxbts. we also found that hlx-1 follows the nearly linearcorrelations between the hard-to-soft state transition luminosity and the peakluminosity, and between the rate of change of x-ray luminosity during the risephase and the peak luminosity, which indicates that the occurrence of thehard-to-soft state transition of hlx-1 is similar to those of galactic lmxbtsduring outbursts. we found that hlx-1 does not follow the correlations betweentotal radiated energy and peak luminosity, and between total radiated energyand e-folding rise/decay timescales we had previously identified in galacticlmxbts. hlx-1 would follow those correlations if the distance were severalhundreds of kiloparsecs. however, invoking a much closer distance for hlx-1 isnot a viable solution to this problem, as it introduces other, more seriousinconsistencies with the observations.

1511.03701	the nature of the companion star in circinus x-1	we present optical spectra and images of the x-ray binary circinus x-1. theoptical light curve of cir x-1 is strongly variable, changing in brightness by1.2 magnitudes in the space of four days. the shape of the light curve isconsistent with that seen in the 1980s, when the x-ray and radio counterpartsof the source were at least ten times as bright as they are currently. wedetect strong, variable h-alpha emission lines, consisting of multiplecomponents which vary with orbital phase. we estimate the extinction to thesource from the strength of the diffuse interstellar bands and the balmerdecrement; the two methods give a_v = 7.6 +/- 0.6 mag and a_v &gt; 9.1 magrespectively. the optical light curve can be modelled as arising fromirradiation of the companion star by the central x-ray source, where alow-temperature star fills its roche lobe in an orbit of moderate eccentricity(e ~ 0.4). we suggest that the companion star is over-luminous and under-dense,due to the impact of the supernova which occurred less than 5000 yr ago.

1511.04797	revisiting the ultraluminous supersoft source in m101: an optically  thick outflow model	the m101 galaxy contains the best-known example of an ultraluminous supersoftsource (uls), dominated by a thermal component at kt ~ 0.1 kev. the origin ofthe thermal component and the relation between ulss and standard (broad-bandspectrum) ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs) are still controversial. were-examined the x-ray spectral and timing properties of the m101 uls usingarchival chandra and xmm-newton observations. we show that the x-raytime-variability and spectral properties are inconsistent with standard diskemission. the characteristic radius r_{bb} of the thermal emitter varies fromepoch to epoch between ~10,000 km and ~100,000 km; the colour temperaturekt_{bb} varies between ~50 ev and ~140 ev; and the two quantities scaleapproximately as r_{bb} ~ t_{bb}^{-2}. in addition to the smooth continuum, wealso find (at some epochs) spectral residuals well fitted with thermal plasmamodels and absorption edges: we interpret this as evidence that we are lookingat a clumpy, multi-temperature outflow. we suggest that at sufficiently highaccretion rates and inclination angles, the super-critical, radiatively drivenoutflow becomes effectively optically thick and completely thermalizes theharder x-ray photons from the inner part of the inflow, removing the hardspectral tail. we develop a simple, spherically symmetric outflow model andshow that it is consistent with the observed temperatures, radii andluminosities. a larger, cooler photosphere shifts the emission peak into thefar-uv and makes the source dimmer in x-rays but possibly ultraluminous in theuv. we compare our results and interpretation with those of liu et al. (2013).

1511.05275	optically thick outflows in ultraluminous supersoft sources	ultraluminous supersoft sources (ulss) are defined by a thermal spectrum withcolour temperatures ~0.1 kev, bolometric luminosities ~ a few 10^39 erg/s, andalmost no emission above 1 kev. it has never been clear how they fit into thegeneral scheme of accreting compact objects. to address this problem, westudied a sample of seven ulss with extensive chandra and xmm-newton coverage.we find an anticorrelation between fitted temperatures and radii of the thermalemitter, and no correlation between bolometric luminosity and radius ortemperature. we compare the physical parameters of ulss with those of classicalsupersoft sources, thought to be surface-nuclear-burning white dwarfs, and ofultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs), thought to be super-eddington stellar-massblack holes. we argue that ulss are the sub-class of ulxs seen through thedensest wind, perhaps an extension of the soft-ultraluminous regime. we suggestthat in ulss, the massive disk outflow becomes effectively optically thick andforms a large photosphere, shrouding the inner regions from our view. our modelpredicts that when the photosphere expands to &gt;10,000 km and the temperaturedecreases below approximately 50 ev, ulss become brighter in the far-uv butundetectable in x-rays. conversely, we find that harder emission componentsbegin to appear in ulss when the fitted size of the thermal emitter is smallest(interpreted as a shrinking of the photosphere). the observed short-termvariability and absorption edges are also consistent with clumpy outflows. wesuggest that the transition between ulxs (with a harder tail) and ulss (withonly a soft thermal component) occurs at blackbody temperatures ofapproximately 150 ev.

0807.0016	black hole masses and accretion states in ulxs	we summarize indirect empirical arguments used for estimating black hole (bh)masses in ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs). the interpretation of the x-raydata is still too model-dependent to provide tight constraints, but masses &lt;~100 msun seem the most likely. it is getting clearer that ulxs do not show thesame evolutionary sequence between canonical spectral states as stellar-massbhs, nor the same timescale for state transitions. most ulx spectra areconsistent either with a power-law-dominated state (apparently identical to thecanonical low/hard state), or with a very high state (or slim-disk state).despite often showing luminosity variability, there is little evidence of ulxssettling into a canonical high/soft state, dominated by a standard disk(disk-blackbody spectrum). it is possible that the mass accretion rate (but notnecessarily the luminosity) is always higher than eddington; but there may beadditional physical differences between stellar-mass bhs and ulxs, whichdisfavour transitions to the standard-disk, radio-quiet state in the latterclass. we speculate that the hard state in ulxs is associated with jet ormagnetic processes rather than an adaf, can persist up to accretion rates ~eddington, and can lead directly to the very high state.

astro-ph;0008016	optical spectroscopy of gx339-4 during the high-soft and low-hard states  ii: line ionisation and emission region	we have carried out observations of the x-ray transient gx339-4 during itshigh-soft and low-hard x-ray spectral states. our high-resolution spectroscopicobservation in 1999 april suggests that the h-alpha line has a single-peakedprofile in the low-hard state as speculated in our previous paper. the heii4686 line, however, has a double-peaked profile in both the high-soft andlow-hard states. this suggests that the line-emission mechanism is different inthe two states. our interpretation is that double-peaked lines are emitted froma temperature-inversion layer on the accretion-disk surface when it isirradiatively heated by soft x-rays. single-peaked lines may be emitted fromoutflow/wind matter driven by hard x-ray heating. we have constructed a simpleplane-parallel model and we use it to illustrate that a temperature-inversionlayer can be formed at the disk surface under x-ray illumination. we alsodiscuss the conditions required for the formation of temperature inversion andline emission. based on the velocity separations measured for the double-peakedlines in the high-soft state, we propose that gx339-4 is a low-inclinationbinary system. the orbital inclination is about 15 deg if the orbital period is14.8 hours.

astro-ph;0108084	low and high angular momentum accretion flows in bhcs: case study of xte  j1550-564	the 1998 outburst of xte j1550-564 started with a hard x-ray spike, rising inless than a day and declining after 3-4 days; at the same time, the soft x-rayflux was rising with a longer timescale (~ 10 days). we suggest that the softand the initial hard x-ray emission are produced by two different components ofthe accretion flow: a higher angular momentum flow, which forms the disk, and alower angular momentum flow feeding the hot inner region. thus, we argue thatthe onset of the outburst is determined by an increased mass transfer rate fromthe companion star, but the outburst morphology is also determined by thedistribution of specific angular momentum in the accreting matter. in xtej1550-564, we attribute the initial, impulsive low angular momentum accretionto the breaking down of magnetic confinement by the magnetically activesecondary star. we show that a hard x-ray spike is seen at the onset of anoutburst in other bhcs.

astro-ph;0201059	x-ray sources in the starburst spiral galaxy m83: nuclear region and  discrete source population	chandra has resolved the starburst nuclear region of the face-on grand-designspiral m83. eighty-one point sources are detected above 3.5 sigma in the aciss3 image, and 15 of them are within the inner 16-arcsec region of the galaxy. apoint source with l_x ~ 3 x 10^(38) erg/s in the 0.3--8.0 kev band is found tocoincide with the infra-red nuclear photometric peak, one of the two dynamicalnuclei of the galaxy. no point-like sources are resolved (at a 2.5-sigma level)at the centre of symmetry of the outer optical isophote ellipses, suspected tobe another dynamical nucleus. about 50% of the total emission in the nuclearregion is unresolved; of this, about 70% can be attributed to hot thermalplasma, and the rest is probably due to unresolved point sources (eg, faintx-ray binaries). the azimuthally-averaged radial distribution of the unresolvedemission has a king-like profile, with no central cusp. strong emission linesare seen in the spectrum of the optically thin plasma component. the highabundances of c, ne, mg, si and s with respect to fe suggest that theinterstellar medium in the nucleus is enriched and heated by type-ii supernovaexplosions and winds from massive stars. the cumulative luminosity distributionof the discrete x-ray sources is neither a single nor a broken power law.separating the sources in the nuclear region (within a distance of 60 arcsecfrom the x-ray centre) from the rest reveals that the two groups have differentluminosity distributions. the log[n(&gt;s)]--log s curve of the sources in theinner region (nucleus and stellar bar) is a single power law, which weinterpret as due to continuous, ongoing star formation. outside the centralregion, there is a smaller fraction of sources brighter than the eddingtonlimit for an accreting neutron star.

astro-ph;0304526	a second glance at sn 2002ap and the m74 field with xmm-newton	we have re-observed the field of m74 in january 2003 with xmm-newton, 11months after the x-ray detection of sn 2002ap. from a comparison of the twoxmm-newton observations we obtain more accurate values for the x-ray luminosityand colours of the source five days after the event, and a limit on its declinerate. we compare its x-ray behaviour (prompt soft x-ray emission, relativelylow luminosity) with that of other type ic sne, and speculate that sn 2002apmay share some physical properties (low mass-loss rate and high-velocitystellar wind from the progenitor star) with the candidate hypernova/grbprogenitor sn 1998bw, but with a lower (non-relativistic) speed of the ejecta.we suggest that the x-ray emission observed in 2002 is likely to come from theradiatively-cooling reverse shock, at a temperature kt ~ 0.8 kev, and that thissoft component was already detected 5 d after the event because the absorbingcolumn density of the cool shell between the forward and reverse shocks wasonly ~ 10^{20} cm^{-2}, ie, the shell was optically thin in the soft x-rayband. the new xmm-newton data also allowed us to continue monitoring two brightvariable sources in m74 that had reached peak luminosities &gt; 10^{39} erg s^{-1}in previous xmm-newton and chandra observations. finally, we used two chandraobservations from 2001 to investigate the luminosity and colour distribution ofthe x-ray source population of m74, typical of moderately-active late-typespirals.

astro-ph;0311302	probable intermediate mass black holes in ngc4559: xmm-newton spectral  and timing constraints	we have examined x-ray and optical observations of two ultra-luminous x-raysources, x7 and x10 in ngc4559, using xmm-newton, chandra and hst. the uv/x-rayluminosity of x7 exceeds 2.1e40 erg/s in the xmm-newton observation, and thatof x10 is &gt;1.3e40 erg/s. x7 has both thermal and power-law spectral components.the characteristic temperature of the thermal component is 0.12 kev. thepower-law components in the two sources both have slopes with photon index\~2.1. a timing analysis of x7 indicates a break frequency at 28 mhz in thepower spectrum, while that for x10 is consistent with an unbroken power law.the luminosity of the blackbody component in the x-ray spectrum of x7 and thenature of its time variability provides evidence that this object is anintermediate mass black hole accreting at sub-eddington rates, but otherscenarios which require high advection efficiencies from a hollowed-out diskmight be possible. the emission from x10 can be characterised by a singlepower-law. this source can be interpreted either as an intermediate mass blackhole, or as a stellar-mass black hole with relativistically-beamed comptonisedemission. there are four optical counterparts in the error circle of x7. nocounterparts are evident in the error circle for x10.

astro-ph;0402332	a variable ultra-luminous x-ray source in the colliding galaxy ngc 7714	we studied the colliding galaxy ngc 7714 with two xmm-newton observations,six months apart. the galaxy contains two bright x-ray sources: we show thatthey have different physical nature. the off-nuclear source is an accretingcompact object, one of the brightest ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs) foundto date. it showed spectral and luminosity changes between the twoobservations, from a low/soft to a high/hard state; in the high state, itreached l_x ~ 6 x 10^{40} erg/s. its lightcurve in the high state suggestsvariability on a ~ 2-hr timescale. its peculiar location, where the tidalbridge between ngc 7714 and ngc 7715 joins the outer stellar ring of ngc 7714,makes it an interesting example of the connection between gas flows incolliding galaxies and ulx formation. the nuclear source (l_x ~ 10^{41} erg/s)coincides with a starburst region, and is the combination of thin thermalplasma emission and a point-source contribution (with a power-law spectrum).variability in the power-law component between the two observations hints atthe presence of a single, bright point source (l_x &gt;~ 3 x 10^{40} erg/s):either a hidden agn or another ulx.

astro-ph;0409568	the star-forming environment of a ulx in ngc 4559: an optical study	we have studied the candidate optical counterparts and the stellar populationin the star-forming complex around a bright ulx in ngc4559, using hst/wfpc2,xmm-newton/om, and ground-based data. we find that the ulx is located near asmall group of ob stars. the brightest point source in the chandra error circleis consistent with a single blue supergiant of mass ~ 20 m_sun and age ~ 10myr. a few other stars are resolved inside the error circle: mostly blue andred supergiants with masses ~ 10-15 m_sun and ages ~ 20 myr. this is consistentwith the interpretation of this ulx as a black hole (bh) accreting from ahigh-mass donor star in its supergiant phase, via roche-lobe overflow. theobserved optical colors and the blue-to-red supergiant ratio suggest a lowmetal abundance: 0.2 &lt;~ z/z_sun &lt;~ 0.4 (padua tracks), or 0.05 &lt;~ z/z_sun &lt;~0.2 (geneva tracks). the age of the star-forming complex is &lt;~ 30 myr. h-alphaimages show that this region has a ring-like appearance. we propose that it isan expanding wave of star formation, triggered by an initial densityperturbation, in a region where the gas was only marginally stable togravitational collapse. a possible trigger was the collision with a satellitedwarf galaxy, visible a few arcsec north-west of the complex, going through thegas-rich outer disk of ngc4559. the x-ray data favour a bh more massive (m &gt; 50m_sun) than typical milky way bh candidates. the optical data favour a``young'' bh originating in the recent episode of massive star formation;however, they also rule out an association with young massive star clusters. wespeculate that other mechanisms may lead to the formation of relatively massivebhs (~ 50-100 m_sun) from stellar evolution processes in low-metallicityenvironments, or when star formation is triggered by galactic collisions.

astro-ph;0503340	runaway core collapse and cluster survival: where are the parent  clusters of ulxs?	accreting intermediate-mass black holes (imbhs) have been proposed as anexplanation for ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs). runaway core collapseinside a massive cluster is a possible mechanism for imbh formation. but if so,why are ulxs only rarely found associated with a cluster? we use a simpleanalytical approximation to show that rapid core collapse can occur in twophysical regimes. for cluster masses ~ 10^6 m_sun, an imbh may be formed if thecollapse timescale is &lt;~ 3 myr, as already well known; the parent cluster isexpected to survive. for cluster masses ~ 10^5 m_sun, an imbh may result from acore collapse on even shorter timescales (~ 0.5 myr), when the protocluster isstill embedded in optically thick gas. most clusters in this latter regime aredisrupted ``explosively'' as soon as the gas is ionized by the ob stars. wespeculate that this process may produce isolated ulxs with masses up to a few10^2 m_sun, surrounded by a loose ob association, and perhaps by a nebula,remnant of the expanding gas from the disrupted protocluster.

astro-ph;0506085	optical and infrared signatures of ulx's	we have constructed a model to describe the optical emission fromultra-luminous x-ray sources (ulxs). we assume a binary model with a black holeaccreting matter from a roche lobe filling companion star. we consider theeffects of radiative transport and radiative equilibrium in the irradiatedsurfaces of both the star and a thin accretion disk. we have developed thismodel as a tool with which to positively identify the optical counterparts ofulxs, and subsequently derive parameters such as the black hole mass and theluminosity class and spectral type of the counterpart. we examine thedependence of the optical emission on these and other variables. we extend ourmodel to examine the magnitude variation at infrared wavelengths, and we findthat observations at these wavelengths may have more diagnostic power than inthe optical. we apply our model to existing hst observations of the candidatesfor the optical counterpart of ulx x-7 in ngc 4559. all candidates could beconsistent with an irradiated star alone, but we find that a number of them aretoo faint to fit with an irradiated star and disk together. were one of thesethe optical counterpart to x-7, it would display a significant temporalvariation.

astro-ph;0511293	accretion and nuclear activity of quiescent supermassive black holes. i:  x-ray study	we have studied the nuclear activity in a sample of six quiescent early-typegalaxies, with new chandra data and archival hst optical images. their nuclearsources have x-ray luminosities ~ 10^{38} - 10^{39} erg/s (l_x/l_edd ~ 10^{-8}- 10^{-7}), and colors or spectra consistent with accreting supermassive blackholes (smbhs)--except for the nucleus of ngc 4486b, which is softer thantypical agn spectra. in a few cases, the x-ray morphology of the nuclearsources shows hints of marginally extended structures, in addition to thesurrounding diffuse thermal emission from hot gas, which is detectable onscales &gt;~ 1 kpc. in one case (ngc 5845), a dusty disk may partially obstructour direct view of the smbh. we have estimated the temperature and density ofthe hot interstellar medium, which is one major source of fuel for theaccreting smbh; typical central densities are n_e ~ (0.02 +/- 0.01) cm^{-3}.assuming that the hot gas is captured by the smbh at the bondi rate, we showthat the observed x-ray luminosities are too faint to be consistent withstandard disk accretion, but brighter than predicted by radiatively-inefficientsolutions (eg, adaf). in total, there are ~ 20 galaxies for which smbh mass,hot gas density, and nuclear x-ray luminosity are simultaneously known. in somecases, the nuclear sources are brighter than predicted by the adaf model; inother cases, they are consistent or fainter. we discuss the apparent lack ofcorrelations between bondi rate and x-ray luminosity, and suggest that, inorder to understand the observed distribution, we need to know two additionalparameters: the amount of gas supplied by the stellar population inside theaccretion radius, and the fraction (possibly &lt;&lt; 1) of the total gas availablethat is accreted by the smbh. we shall discuss these issues in our paper ii.

astro-ph;0603029	a ulx microquasar in ngc 5408?	we studied the radio source associated with the ultraluminous x-ray source inngc 5408 (l_x ~ 10^{40} erg/s). the radio spectrum is steep (index ~ -1),consistent with optically-thin synchrotron emission, not with flat-spectrumcore emission. its flux density (~ 0.28 mjy at 4.8 ghz, at a distance of 4.8mpc) was the same in the march 2000 and december 2004 observations, suggestingsteady emission rather than a transient outburst. however, it is orders ofmagnitude higher than expected from steady jets in stellar-mass microquasar.based on its radio flux and spectral index, we suggest that the radio source iseither an unusually bright supernova remnant, or, more likely, a radio lobepowered by a jet from the black hole. moreover, there is speculative evidencethat the source is marginally resolved with a radius ~ 30 pc. a faint hiiregion of similar size appears to coincide with the radio and x-ray sources,but its ionization mechanism remains unclear. using a self-similar solution forthe expansion of a jet-powered electron-positron plasma bubble, in theminimum-energy approximation, we show that the observed flux and (speculative)size are consistent with an average jet power ~ 7 x 10^{38} erg/s ~ 0.1 l_x ~0.1 l_{edd}, an age ~ 10^5 yr, a current velocity of expansion ~ 80 km/s. webriefly discuss the importance of this source as a key to understand thebalance between luminosity and jet power in accreting black holes.

astro-ph;0606273	on the weakness of disc models in bright ulxs	it is sometimes suggested that phenomenological power-law plus cooldisc-blackbody models represent the simplest, most robust interpretation of thex-ray spectra of bright ultraluminous x-ray sources (ulxs); this has been takenas evidence for the presence of intermediate-mass black holes (bhs) (m ~ 10^3msun) in those sources. here, we assess this claim by comparing the cooldisc-blackbody model with a range of other models. for example, we show thatthe same ulx spectra can be fitted equally well by subtracting a disc-blackbodycomponent from a dominant power-law component, thus turning a soft excess intoa soft deficit. then, we propose a more complex physical model, based on apower-law component slightly modified at various energies by smeared emissionand absorption lines from highly-ionized, fast-moving gas. we use thexmm-newton/epic spectra of two ulxs in holmberg ii and ngc 4559 as examples.our main conclusion is that the presence of a soft excess or a soft deficitdepends on the energy range over which we choose to fit the ``true'' power-lawcontinuum; those small deviations from the power-law spectrum are well modelledby disc-blackbody components (either in emission or absorption) simply becausethey are a versatile fitting tool for most kinds of smooth, broad bumps. hence,we argue that those components should not be taken as evidence for accretiondisc emission, nor used to infer bh masses. finally, we speculate that brightulxs could be in a spectral state similar to (or an extension of) thesteep-power-law state of galactic bh candidates, in which the disc is nowcompletely comptonized and not directly detectable, and the power-law emissionmay be modified by the surrounding, fast-moving, ionized gas.

astro-ph;0608648	a ulx associated with a cloud collision in m99	the sc galaxy m99 in the virgo cluster has been strongly affected by tidalinteractions and recent close encounters, responsible for an asymmetric spiralpattern and a high star formation rate. our xmm-newton study shows that theinner disk is dominated by hot plasma at kt ~ 0.30 kev, with a total x-rayluminosity ~ 10^{41} erg/s in the 0.3--12 kev band. at the outskirts of thegalaxy, away from the main star-forming regions, there is an ultraluminousx-ray source (ulx) with an x-ray luminosity ~ 2 x 10^{40} erg/s and a hardspectrum well fitted by a power law of photon index gamma ~ 1.7. this source isclose to the location where a massive hi cloud appears to be falling onto them99 disk at a relative speed &gt; 100 km/s. we suggest that there may be a directphysical link between fast cloud collisions and the formation of bright ulxs,which may be powered by accreting black holes with masses ~ 100 msun. externalcollisions may trigger large-scale dynamical collapses of protoclusters,leading to the formation of very massive (&gt;~ 200 msun) stellar progenitors; weargue that such stars may later collapse into massive black holes if theirmetal abundance is sufficiently low.

astro-ph;0701390	quasi-periodic variability in ngc 5408 x-1	we report the discovery with xmm-newton of quasiperiodic variability in the0.2 - 10 kev x-ray flux from the ultraluminous x-ray source ngc 5408 x-1. theaverage power spectrum of all epic-pn data reveals a strong 20 mhz qpo with anaverage amplitude (rms) of 9%, and a coherence of q~6. in a 33 ksec timeinterval when the 20 mhz qpo is strongest we also find evidence for a 2nd qpopeak at 15 mhz. this is the first indication for a close pair of qpos in a ulxsource. interestingly, the frequency ratio of this qpo pair is inconsistentwith 3:2 at the 3sigma level, but is consistent with a 4:3 ratio. a powerlawnoise component with slope near 1.5 is also present below 0.1 hz with evidencefor a break to a flatter slope at about 3 mhz. the source shows substantialbroadband variability, with a total amplitude (rms) of about 30% in the 0.1 -100 mhz frequency band, and there is strong energy dependence to thevariability. we discuss the implications of these findings in the context ofmodels for ulxs, and their implications for the object's mass.

astro-ph;0702744	discovery of a transient x-ray source in the compact stellar nucleus of  ngc 2403	we report the discovery of an x-ray source coincident with the nuclear starcluster at the dynamical center of the nearby late-type spiral galaxy ngc 2403.the x-ray luminosity of this source varies from below detection levels, ~1e35erg/s in the 0.5-8.0 kev band, to 7e38 erg/s on timescales between observationsof less than 2 months. the x-ray spectrum is well-fit by an accretion diskmodel consisting of multiple blackbody components and corresponding physicallyto a compact object mass of greater than approximately 5 solar masses. nopulsations nor aperiodic behavior is evident in its x-ray light curve on theshort timescales of the individual observations. the x-ray properties of thesource are more similar to those of the nuclear source x-8 in m33, believed tobe a low-mass x-ray binary, then to those of the low-luminosity active galacticnucleus in ngc 4395. the brightness of the nuclear star cluster, m_i ~ -11.8mag, is typical of clusters in late-type spirals but its effective radius, r_e\~ 12 pc, is several times larger than average indicating a relatively relaxedcluster and a low probability of a central massive object. the cluster has amass 3e6 solar masses and an age of 1.4 gyr estimating from its observed colorsand brightness.

astro-ph;9911318	optical spectroscopy of gro j1655-40	we have obtained optical spectra of the soft x-ray transient gro j1655-40during different x-ray spectral states (quiescence, high-soft and hardoutburst) between 1994 aug and 1997 jun. characteristic features observedduring the 1996-97 high-soft state were: a) broad absorption lines at halphaand hbeta, probably formed in the inner disk; b) double-peaked heii 4686emission lines, formed in a temperature-inversion layer on the disk surface,created by the soft x-ray irradiation; c) double-peaked halpha emission, with astrength associated with the hard x-ray flux, suggesting that it was probablyemitted from deeper layers than he ii 4686. the observed rotational velocitiesof all the double-peaked lines suggest that the disk was extended slightlybeyond its tidal radius. three classes of lines were identified in the spectrataken in 1994 aug-sep, during a period of low x-ray activity between two strongx-ray flares: broad absorption, broad (flat-topped) emission and narrowemission. we have found that the narrow emission lines (single-peaked ordouble-peaked) cannot be explained by a thin-disk model. we propose that thesystem was in a transient state, in which the accretion disk might have had anextended optically thin cocoon and significant matter outflow. after the onsetof a hard x-ray flare the disk signatures disappeared, and strong single-peakedhalpha and paschen emission was detected, suggesting that the cocoon becameopaque to optical radiation. high-ionisation lines disappeared or weakened. twoweeks after the end of the flare, the cocoon appeared to be once againoptically thin.
