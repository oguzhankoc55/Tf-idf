0903.3406	the solar photospheric nitrogen abundance. analysis of atomic  transitions with 3d and 1d model atmospheres	context: in recent years, the solar chemical abundances have been studied inconsiderable detail because of discrepant values of solar metallicity inferredfrom different indicators, i.e., on the one hand, the "sub-solar" photosphericabundances resulting from spectroscopic chemical composition analyses with theaid of 3d hydrodynamical models of the solar atmosphere, and, on the otherhand, the high metallicity inferred by helioseismology. aims: afterinvestigating the solar oxygen abundance using a co5bold 3d hydrodynamicalsolar model in previous work, we undertake a similar approach studying thesolar abundance of nitrogen, since this element accounts for a significantfraction of the overall solar metallicity, z. method: we used a selection ofatomic spectral lines to determine the solar nitrogen abundance, relying mainlyon equivalent width measurements in the literature. we investigate theinfluence on the abundance analysis, of both deviations from localthermodynamic equilibrium ("nlte effects") and photospheric inhomogeneities("granulation effects"). results: we recommend use of a solar nitrogenabundance of a(n)=7.86+-0.12 whose error bar reflects the line-to-line scatter.conclusion: the solar metallicity implied by the co5bold-based nitrogen andoxygen abundances is in the range 0.0145&lt;= z &lt;= 0.0167. this result is a steptowards reconciling photospheric abundances with helioseismic constraints on z.our most suitable estimates are z=0.0156 and z/x=0.0213.

0906.4697	impact of granulation effects on the use of balmer lines as temperature  indicators	balmer lines serve as important indicators of stellar effective temperaturesin late-type stellar spectra. one of their modelling uncertainties is theinfluence of convective flows on their shape. we aim to characterize theinfluence of convection on the wings of balmer lines. we perform a differentialcomparison of synthetic balmer line profiles obtained from 3d hydrodynamicalmodel atmospheres and 1d hydrostatic standard ones. the model parameters areappropriate for f,g,k dwarf and subgiant stars of metallicity ranging fromsolar to 1/1000 solar. the shape of the balmer lines predicted by 3d models cannever be exactly reproduced by a 1d model, irrespective of its effectivetemperature. we introduce the concept of a 3d temperature correction, as theeffective temperature difference between a 3d model and a 1d model whichprovides the closest match to the 3d profile. the temperature correction isdifferent for the different members of the balmer series and depends on theadopted mixing-length parameter in the 1d model. among the investigated models,the 3d correction ranges from -300k to +300k. horizontal temperaturefluctuations tend to reduce the 3d correction. accurate effective temperaturescannot be derived from the wings of balmer lines, unless the effects ofconvection are properly accounted for. the 3d models offer a physically welljustified way of doing so. the use of 1d models treating convection with themixing-length theory do not appear to be suitable for this purpose. inparticular, there are indications that it is not possible to determine a singlevalue of the mixing-length parameter which will optimally reproduce the balmerlines for any choice of atmospheric parameters.

0909.1010	3d molecular line formation in dwarf carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars	we present a detailed analysis of the carbon and nitrogen abundances of twodwarf carbon-enhanced metal-poor (cemp) stars: sdss j1349-0229 and sdssj0912+0216. we also report the oxygen abundance of sdss j1349-0229. these starsare metal-poor, with [fe/h] &lt; -2.5, and were selected from our ongoing surveyof extremely metal-poor dwarf candidates from the sloan digital skysurvey(sdss). the carbon, nitrogen and oxygen abundances rely on molecular lineswhich form in the outer layers of the stellar atmosphere. it is known thatconvection in metal-poor stars induces very low temperatures which are notpredicted by `classical' 1d stellar atmospheres. to obtain the correcttemperature structure, one needs full 3d hydrodynamical models. using co5bold3d hydrodynamical model atmospheres and the linfor3d line formation code,molecular lines of ch, nh, oh and c2 were computed, and 3d carbon, nitrogen andoxygen abundances were determined. the resulting carbon abundances werecompared to abundances derived using atomic ci lines in 1d lte and nlte. thereis not a good agreement between the carbon abundances determined from c2 bandsand from the ch band, and molecular lines do not agree with the atomic cilines. although this may be partly due to uncertainties in the transitionprobabilities of the molecular bands it certainly has to do with thetemperature structure of the outer layers of the adopted model atmosphere. weexplore the influence of the 3d model properties on the molecular abundancedetermination. in particular, the choice of the number of opacity bins used inthe model calculations and its subsequent effects on the temperature structureand molecular line formation is discussed.

0910.3493	3d simulations of m star atmosphere velocities and their influence on  molecular feh lines	we present an investigation of the velocity fields in early to late m-typestar hydrodynamic models, and we simulate their influence on feh molecular lineshapes. the m star model parameters range between log g of 3.0 - 5.0 and teffof 2500 k and 4000 k. our aim is to characterize the teff- and log g-dependence of the velocity fields and express them in terms of micro- andmacro-turbulent velocities in the one dimensional sense. we present also adirect comparison between 3d hydrodynamical velocity fields and 1d turbulentvelocities. the velocity fields strongly affect the line shapes of feh, and itis our goal to give a rough estimate for the log g and teff parameter range inwhich 3d spectral synthesis is necessary and where 1d synthesis suffices. inorder to calculate m-star structure models we employ the 3dradiative-hydrodynamics (rhd) code co5bold. the spectral synthesis on thesemodels is performed with the line synthesis code linfor3d. we describe the 3dvelocity fields in terms of a gaussian standard deviation and project them ontothe line of sight to include geometrical and limb-darkening effects. the micro-and macro-turbulent velocities are determined with the "curve of growth" methodand convolution with a gaussian velocity profile, respectively. to characterizethe log g and teff dependence of feh lines, the equivalent width, line width,and line depth are regarded. the velocity fields in m-stars strongly depend onlog g and teff. they become stronger with decreasing log g and increasing teff.

0910.4027	the corot target hd 49933: 1- role of the metal abundance	solar-like oscillations are stochastically excited by turbulent convection atthe surface layers of the stars. we study the role of the surface metalabundance on the efficiency of the stochastic driving in the case of the corottarget hd 49933. we compute two 3d hydrodynamical simulations representative --in effective temperature and gravity -- of the surface layers of the corottarget hd 49933, a star that is rather metal poor and significantly hottercompared to the sun. one 3d simulation has a solar metal abundance and theother has a surface iron-to-hydrogen, [fe/h], abundance ten times smaller. foreach 3d simulation we match an associated global 1d model and we compute theassociated acoustic modes using a theoretical model of stochastic excitationvalidated in the case of the sun and alpha cen a. the rate at which energy issupplied per unit time into the acoustic modes associated with the 3dsimulation with [fe/h]=-1 are found about three times smaller than thoseassociated with the 3d simulation with [fe/h]=0. as shown here, thesedifferences are related to the fact that low metallicity implies surface layerswith a higher mean density. in turn, a higher mean density favors smallerconvective velocities and hence less efficient driving of the acoustic modes.our result shows the importance of taking the surface metal abundance intoaccount in the modeling of the mode driving by turbulent convection. acomparison with observational data is presented in a companion paper usingseismic data obtained for the corot target hd 49933.

0910.4733	solar abundances and granulation effects	the solar abundances have undergone a major downward revision in the lastdecade, reputedly as a result of employing 3d hydrodynamical simulations tomodel the inhomogeneous structure of the solar photosphere. the very low oxygenabundance advocated by asplund et al. (2004), a(o)=8.66, together with thedownward revision of the carbon and nitrogen abundances, has created seriousproblems for solar models to explain the helioseismic measurements. in aneffort to contribute to the dispute we have re-derived photospheric abundancesof several elements independently of previous analysis. we applied astate-of-the art 3d (co5bold) hydrodynamical simulation of the solargranulation as well as different 1d model atmospheres for the line by linespectroscopic abundance determinations. the analysis is based on both standarddisc-centre and disc-integrated spectral atlases; for oxygen we acquired inaddition spectra at different heliocentric angles. the derived abundances arethe result of equivalent width and/or line profile fitting of the availableatomic lines. we discuss the different granulation effects on solar abundancesand compare our results with previous investigations. according to ourinvestigations hydrodynamical models are important in the solar abundancedetermination, but are not responsible for the recent downward revision in theliterature of the solar metallicity.

0910.5917	6li in metal-poor halo stars: real or spurious?	the presence of convective motions in the atmospheres of metal-poor halostars leads to systematic asymmetries of the emergent spectral line profiles.since such line asymmetries are very small, they can be safely ignored forstandard spectroscopic abundance analysis. however, when it comes to thedetermination of the 6li/7li isotopic ratio, q(li)=n(6li)/n(7li), the intrinsicasymmetry of the 7li line must be taken into account, because its signature isessentially indistinguishable from the presence of a weak 6li blend in the redwing of the 7li line. in this contribution we quantity the error of theinferred 6li/7li isotopic ratio that arises if the convective line asymmetry isignored in the fitting of the lithium blend at 6707 a. our conclusion is that6li/7li ratios derived by asplund et al. (2006), using symmetric line profiles,must be reduced by typically dq(li) ~ 0.015. this diminishes the number ofcertain 6li detections from 9 to 4 stars or less, casting some doubt on theexistence of a 6li plateau.

0911.4251	accuracy of spectroscopy-based radioactive dating of stars	combined spectroscopic abundance analyses of stable and radioactive elementscan be applied for deriving stellar ages. the achievable precision depends onfactors related to spectroscopy, nucleosynthesis, and chemical evolution. wequantify the uncertainties arising from the spectroscopic analysis, and comparethese to the other error sources. we derive formulae for the age uncertaintiesarising from the spectroscopic abundance analysis, and apply them tospectroscopic and nucleosynthetic data compiled from the literature for the sunand metal-poor stars. we obtained ready-to-use analytic formulae of the ageuncertainty for the cases of stable+unstable and unstable+unstable chronometerpairs, and discuss the optimal relation between to-be-measured age and meanlifetime of a radioactive species. application to the literature data indicatesthat, for a single star, the achievable spectroscopic accuracy is limited toabout +/- 20% for the foreseeable future. at present, theoretical uncertaintiesin nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution models form the precision bottleneck.for stellar clusters, isochrone fitting provides a higher accuracy thanradioactive dating, but radioactive dating becomes competitive when applied tomany cluster members simultaneously, reducing the statistical errors by afactor sqrt(n). spectroscopy-based radioactive stellar dating would benefitfrom improvements in the theoretical understanding of nucleosynthesis andchemical evolution. its application to clusters can provide strong constraintsfor nucleosynthetic models.

1001.3274	convection and 6li in the atmospheres of metal-poor halo stars	based on 3d hydrodynamical model atmospheres computed with the co5bold codeand 3d non-lte (nlte) line formation calculations, we study the effect of theconvection-induced line asymmetry on the derived 6li abundance for a range ineffective temperature, gravity, and metallicity covering the stars of theasplund et al. (2006) sample. when the asymmetry effect is taken into accountfor this sample of stars, the resulting 6li/7li ratios are reduced by about1.5% on average with respect to the isotopic ratios determined by asplund etal. (2006). this purely theoretical correction diminishes the number ofsignificant 6li detections from 9 to 4 (2 sigma criterion), or from 5 to 2 (3sigma criterion). in view of this result the existence of a 6li plateau appearsquestionable. a careful reanalysis of individual objects by fitting theobserved lithium 6707 a doublet both with 3d nlte and 1d lte synthetic lineprofiles confirms that the inferred 6li abundance is systematically lower whenusing 3d nlte instead of 1d lte line fitting. nevertheless, halo stars withunquestionable 6li detection do exist even if analyzed in 3d-nlte, the mostprominent example being hd 84937.

1005.3754	galactic evolution of oxygen: oh lines in 3d hydrodynamical model  atmospheres	the measurement of oxygen lines in metal-poor unevolved stars, in particularnear-uv oh lines, can provide invaluable information on the properties of theearly galaxy. near-uv oh lines constitute an important tool to derive oxygenabundances in metal-poor dwarf stars. therefore, it is important to correctlymodel the line formation of oh lines, especially in metal-poor stars, where 3dhydrodynamical models commonly predict cooler temperatures than plane-parallelhydrostatic models in the upper photosphere. we have made use of a grid of 523d hydrodynamical model atmospheres for dwarf stars computed using the codeco5bold, extracted from the more extended cifist grid. the 52 models cover theeffective temperature range 5000-6500k, the surface gravity range 3.5-4.5 andthe metallicity range -3&lt;[fe/h]&lt;0. we determine 3d-lte abundance corrections inall the 52 3d models for several oh lines and fei lines of different excitationpotentials. these 3d-lte corrections are generally negative reaching values ofroughly -1 dex (for the oh 3167 with excitation potential of approximately 1ev) for the higher temperatures and surface gravities. we apply these 3d-ltecorrections to the individual o abundances, derived from oh lines, of a samplethe metal-poor dwarf stars reported in israelian et al.(1998, 2001) andboesgaard et al.(1999), by interpolating the stellar parameters of the dwarfsin the grid of 3d-lte corrections. the new 3d-lte [o/fe] ratio still keeps asimilar trend as the 1d-lte, i.e, increasing towards lower [fe/h] values. weapplied 1d-nlte corrections to 3d fei abundances and we still see an increasing[o/fe] ratio towards lower metallicites. however, the galactic [o/fe] ratiomust be revisited once 3d-nlte corrections become available for oh and fe linesfor a grid of 3d hydrodynamical model atmospheres.

1011.4635	gravitational redshifts in main-sequence and giant stars	gravitational redshifts in solar-type main-sequence stars are expected to besome 500 ms$^{-1}$ greater than those in giants. such a signature is searchedfor between groups of open-cluster stars which share the same average spacemotion and thus have the same average doppler shift. 144 main-sequence starsand cool giants were observed in the m67 open cluster using the eso ferosspectrograph, obtaining radial velocities by cross correlation with a spectraltemplate. m67 dwarf and giant radial-velocity distributions are wellrepresented by gaussian functions, sharing the same apparent average radialvelocity within $\simeq$ 100 ms$^{-1}$. in addition, dwarfs in m67 appear to bedynamically hotter ($\sigma$ = 0.90 kms$^{-1}$) than giants ($\sigma$ = 0.68kms$^{-1}$). explanations for the lack of an expected signal are sought: alikely cause is the differential wavelength shifts produced by differenthydrodynamics in dwarf and giant atmospheres. radial-velocity differencesmeasured between unblended lines in low-noise averaged spectra vary withline-strength: stronger lines are more blushifted in dwarfs than in giants,apparently 'compensating' for the gravitational redshift. synthetichigh-resolution spectra are computed from 3-dimensional hydrodynamic modelatmospheres for both giants and dwarfs, and synthetic wavelength shiftsobtained. in agreement with observations, 3d models predict substantiallysmaller wavelength-shift differences than expected from gravitational redshiftonly. the procedures developed could be used to test 3d models for differentclasses of stars, but will ultimately require high-fidelity spectra formeasurements of wavelength shifts in individual spectral lines.

1012.4358	first stars xiv. sulfur abundances in extremely metal-poor (emp) stars	sulfur is important: the site of its formation is uncertain, and at very lowmetallicity the trend of [s/fe] against [fe/h] is controversial. below[fe/h]=-2.0, [s/fe] remains constant or it decreases with [fe/h], depending onthe author and the multiplet used in the analysis. moreover, although sulfur isnot significantly bound in dust grains in the ism, it seems to behavedifferently in dlas and in old metal-poor stars. we aim to determine precise sabundance in a sample of extremely metal-poor stars taking into account nlteand 3d effects. nlte profiles of the lines of the multiplet 1 of si have beencomputed using a new model atom for s. we find sulfur in emp stars to behavelike the other alpha-elements, with [s/fe] remaining approximately constant for[fe/h]&lt;-3. however, [s/mg] seems to decrease slightly as a function of [mg/h].the overall abundance patterns of o, na, mg, al, s, and k are best matched bythe sn model yields by heger &amp; woosley. the [s/zn] ratio in emp stars is solar,as found also in dlas. we obtain an upper limit on the abundance of sulfur,[s/fe] &lt; +0.5, for the ultra metal-poor star cs 22949-037. this, along with aprevious reported measurement of zinc, argues against the conjecture that thelight-element abundances pattern in this star, and, by analogy, the hypermetal-poor stars he 0107-5240 and he 1327-2326, are due to dust depletion.

1012.5234	radiative hydrodynamics simulations of red supergiant stars. iii.  spectro-photocentric variability, photometric variability, and consequences  on gaia measurements	context. it has been shown that convection in red supergiant stars gives riseto large granules causing surface inhomogeneities together with shock waves inthe photosphere. the resulting motion of the photocenter (on time scalesranging from months to years) could possibly have adverse effects on theparallax determination with gaia. aims. we explore the impact of thegranulation on the photocentric and photometric variability. we quantify theseeffects in order to better characterize the error possibly altering theparallax. methods. we use 3d radiative-hydrodynamics simulations of convectionwith co5bold and the post-processing radiative transfer code optim3d to computeintensity maps and spectra in the gaia g band [325-1030 nm]. results. weprovide astrometric and photometric predictions from 3d simulations of rsgsthat are used to evaluate the degradation of the astrometric parameters ofevolved stars derived by gaia. we show from rhd simulations that a supergiantlike betelgeuse exhibits a photocentric noise characterised by a standarddeviation of the order of 0.1 au. the number of bright giant and supergiantstars whose gaia parallaxes will be altered by the photocentric noise rangesfrom a few tens to several thousandths. the degradation of the astrometric fitdue to the presence of this photocentric noise will be noticeable up to about 5kpc for the brightest supergiants. moreover, parallaxes of supergiants areaffected by a error of the order of a few percents. we show that thephotocentric noise, as predicted by the 3d simulation, does account for asubstantial part of the supplementary 'cosmic noise' that affects hipparcosmeasurements of betelgeuse and antares.

1106.6007	solution to the problem of the surface gravity distribution of cool da  white dwarfs from improved 3d model atmospheres	the surface gravities of cool (teff &lt; 13,000 k) hydrogen-atmosphere da whitedwarfs, determined from spectroscopic analyses, are found to be significantlyhigher than the canonical value of log g ~ 8 expected for these stars. it wasrecently concluded that a problem with the treatment of convective energytransport within the framework of the mixing-length theory was the mostplausible explanation for this high-log g problem. we pursue the investigationof this discrepancy by computing model spectra of cool convective white dwarfsfrom a small sequence (11,300 k &lt; teff &lt; 12,800 k) of 3d hydrodynamical modelatmospheres, which feature a sophisticated treatment of convection andradiative transfer. our approach is to proceed with a differential analysisbetween 3d and standard 1d models. we find that the 3d spectra predictsignificantly lower surface gravities, with corrections of the right amplitudeas a function of effective temperature to obtain values of log g ~ 8 onaverage. we conclude that the surface gravity distribution of cool convectiveda white dwarfs is much closer to that of hotter radiative objects when using,for the treatment of the convection, 3d models instead of the mixing-lengthframework.

1108.0138	lithium and sodium in the globular cluster m4. detection of a li-rich  dwarf star: preservation or pollution?	context. the abundance inhomogeneities of light elements observed in globularclusters (gcs), and notably the ubiquitous na-o anti-correlation, are generallyinterpreted as evidence that gcs comprise several generations of stars. thereis an on-going debate as to the nature of the stars which produce theinhomogeneous elements, and investigating the behavior of several elements is away to shed new light on this problem. aims. we aim at investigating the li andna content of the gc m 4, that is known to have a well defined na-oanti-correlation. methods. we obtained moderate resolution (r=17 000-18 700)spectra for 91 main sequence (ms)/sub-giant branch stars of m 4 with thegiraffe spectrograph at the flames/vlt eso facility. using model atmospheresanalysis we measured lithium and sodium abundances. results. we detect a weakli-na anti-correlation among un-evolved ms stars. one star in the sample, #37934, shows the remarkably high lithium abundance a(li)=2.87, compatible withcurrent estimates of the primordial lithium abundance. conclusions. the shallowslope found for the li-na anti-correlation suggests that lithium is produced inparallel to sodium. this evidence, coupled with its sodium-rich nature,suggests that the high lithium abundance of star # 37934 may originate bypollution from a previous generations of stars. the recent detection of ali-rich dwarf of pollution origin in the globular cluster ngc 6397 may alsopoint in this direction. still, no clear cut evidence is available against apossible preservation of the primordial lithium abundance for star # 37934.

1109.0992	x-shooter gto: chemical analysis of a sample of emp candidates	context: extremely metal-poor stars (emp) are very rare objects that hold intheir atmospheres the fossil record of the chemical composition of the earlyphases of galactic evolution. finding these objects and determining theirchemical composition provides important constraints on these early phases.aims: using a carefully designed selection method, we chose a sample ofcandidate emp stars from the low resolution spectra of the sloan digital skysurvey and observed them with x-shooter at the vlt to confirm theirmetallicities and determine abundances for as many elements as possible.method: the x-shooter spectra are analysed by means of one-dimensional,plane-parallel, hydrostatic model atmospheres. corrections for the granulationeffects are computed using co5bold hydrodynamical simulations. results: all thecandidates are confirmed to be emp stars, proving the efficiency of ourselection method within about 0.5 dex. the chemical composition of this sampleis compatible with those of brighter samples, suggesting that the stars in thegalactic halo are well mixed. conclusions these observations show that it isfeasible to observe, in a limited amount of time, a large sample of about onehundred stars among emp candidates selected from the sdss. such a size ofsample will allow us, in particular, to confirm or refute the existence of avertical drop in the galactic halo metallicity distribution function around[fe/h] ~ -3.5.

1201.1103	simulations of the solar near-surface layers with the co5bold, muram,  and stagger codes	radiative hydrodynamic simulations of solar and stellar surface convectionhave become an important tool for exploring the structure and gas dynamics inthe envelopes and atmospheres of late-type stars and for improving ourunderstanding of the formation of stellar spectra. we quantitatively compareresults from three-dimensional, radiative hydrodynamic simulations ofconvection near the solar surface generated with three numerical codes co5bold,muram, and stagger and different simulation setups in order to investigate thelevel of similarity and to cross-validate the simulations. for all threesimulations, we considered the average stratifications of various quantities(temperature, pressure, flow velocity, etc.) on surfaces of constantgeometrical or optical depth, as well as their temporal and spatialfluctuations. we also compared observables, such as the spatially resolvedpatterns of the emerging intensity and of the vertical velocity at the solaroptical surface as well as the center-to-limb variation of the continuumintensity at various wavelengths. the depth profiles of the thermodynamicalquantities and of the convective velocities as well as their spatialfluctuations agree quite well. slight deviations can be understood in terms ofdifferences in box size, spatial resolution and in the treatment of non-grayradiative transfer between the simulations. the results give confidence in thereliability of the results from comprehensive radiative hydrodynamicsimulations.

1203.2607	a primordial star in the heart of the lion	context: the discovery and chemical analysis of extremely metal-poor starspermit a better understanding of the star formation of the first generation ofstars and of the universe emerging from the big bang. aims: we report the studyof a primordial star situated in the centre of the constellation leo (sdssj102915+172027). method: the star, selected from the low resolution-spectrum ofthe sloan digital sky survey, was observed at intermediate (with x-shooter atvlt) and at high spectral resolution (with uves at vlt). the stellar parameterswere derived from the photometry. the standard spectroscopic analysis based on1d atlas models was completed by applying 3d and non-lte corrections. results:an iron abundance of [fe/h]=--4.89 makes sdss j102915+172927 one of the lowest[fe/h] stars known. however, the absence of measurable c and n enhancementsindicates that it has the lowest metallicity, z&lt;= 7.40x10^{-7} (metal-massfraction), ever detected. no oxygen measurement was possible. conclusions: thediscovery of sdss j102915+172927 highlights that low-mass star formationoccurred at metallicities lower than previously assumed. even lower metallicitystars may yet be discovered, with a chemical composition closer to thecomposition of the primordial gas and of the first supernovae.

1203.2612	an extremely primitive halo star	the early universe had a chemical composition consisting of hydrogen, heliumand traces of lithium1, almost all other elements were created in stars andsupernovae. the mass fraction, z, of elements more massive than helium, iscalled "metallicity". a number of very metal poor stars have been found some ofwhich, while having a low iron abundance, are rich in carbon, nitrogen andoxygen. for theoretical reasons and because of an observed absence of starswith metallicities lower than z=1.5e-5, it has been suggested that low massstars (m&lt;0.8m\odot, the ones that survive to the present day) cannot form untilthe interstellar medium has been enriched above a critical value, estimated tolie in the range 1.5e-8\leqz\leq1.5e-6, although competing theories claimingthe contrary do exist. here we report the chemical composition of a star with avery low z\leq6.9e-7 (4.5e-5 of that of the sun) and a chemical pattern typicalof classical extremely metal poor stars, meaning without the enrichment ofcarbon, nitrogen and oxygen. this shows that low mass stars can be formed atvery low metallicity. lithium is not detected, suggesting a low metallicityextension of the previously observed trend in lithium depletion. lithiumdepletion implies that the stellar material must have experienced temperaturesabove two million k in its history, which points to rather particular formationcondition or internal mixing process, for low z stars.

1203.3124	barium abundance in red giants of ngc 6752. non-local thermodynamic  equilibrium and three-dimensional effects	(abridged) aims: we study the effects related to departures from non-localthermodynamic equilibrium (nlte) and homogeneity in the atmospheres of redgiant stars in galactic globular cluster ngc 6752, to assess their influence onthe formation of ba ii lines. methods: one-dimensional (1d) local thermodynamicequilibrium (lte) and 1d nlte barium abundances were derived using classical 1datlas stellar model atmospheres. the three-dimensional (3d) lte abundances wereobtained for 8 red giants on the lower rgb, by adjusting their 1d lteabundances using 3d-1d abundance corrections, i.e., the differences between theabundances obtained from the same spectral line using the 3d hydrodynamical(co5bold) and classical 1d (lhd) stellar model atmospheres. results: the mean1d barium-to-iron abundance ratios derived for 20 giants are &lt;[ba/fe]&gt;_{1dnlte} = 0.05 \pm0.06 (stat.) \pm0.08 (sys.). the 3d-1d abundance correctionobtained for 8 giants is small (~+0.05 dex), thus leads to only minoradjustment when applied to the mean 1d nlte barium-to-iron abundance ratio forthe 20 giants, &lt;[ba/fe]&gt;_{3d+nlte} = 0.10 \pm0.06(stat.) \pm0.10(sys.). theintrinsic abundance spread between the individual cluster stars is small andcan be explained in terms of uncertainties in the abundance determinations.conclusions: deviations from lte play an important role in the formation ofbarium lines in the atmospheres of red giants studied here. the role of 3dhydrodynamical effects should not be dismissed either, even if the obtained3d-1d abundance corrections are small. this result is a consequence of subtlefine-tuning of individual contributions from horizontal temperaturefluctuations and differences between the average temperature profiles in the 3dand 1d model atmospheres: owing to the comparable size and opposite sign, theircontributions nearly cancel each other.

1205.4846	amplitudes of solar-like oscillations in red-giant stars: evidences for  non-adiabatic effects using corot observations	a growing number of solar-like oscillations has been detected in red giantstars thanks to corot and kepler space-crafts. the seismic data gathered bycorot on red giant stars allow us to test mode driving theory in physicalconditions different from main-sequence stars. using a set of 3d hydrodynamicalmodels representative of the upper layers of sub- and red giant stars, wecomputed the acoustic mode energy supply rate (pmax). assuming adiabaticpulsations and using global stellar models that assume that the surfacestratification comes from the 3d hydrodynamical models, we computed the modeamplitude in terms of surface velocity. this was converted into intensityfluctuations using either a simplified adiabatic scaling relation or anon-adiabatic one. from l and m (the luminosity and mass), the energy supplyrate pmax is found to scale as (l/m)^2.6 for both main-sequence and red giantstars, extending previous results. the theoretical amplitudes in velocityunder-estimate the doppler velocity measurements obtained so far from theground for red giant stars by about 30%. in terms of intensity, the theoreticalscaling law based on the adiabatic intensity-velocity scaling relation resultsin an under-estimation by a factor of about 2.5 with respect to the corotseismic measurements. on the other hand, using the non-adiabaticintensity-velocity relation significantly reduces the discrepancy with thecorot data. the theoretical amplitudes remain 40% below, however, the corotmeasurements. our results show that scaling relations of mode amplitudes cannotbe simply extended from main-sequence to red giant stars in terms of intensityon the basis of adiabatic relations because non-adiabatic effects for red giantstars are important and cannot be neglected. we discuss possible reasons forthe remaining differences.

1206.2239	6li detection in metal-poor stars: can 3d model atmospheres solve the  second lithium problem?	the presence of 6li in the atmospheres of metal-poor halo stars is usuallyinferred from the detection of a subtle extra depression in the red wing of the7li doublet line at 670.8 nm. however, the intrinsic line asymmetry caused byconvective flows in the photospheres of cool stars is almost indistinguishablefrom the asymmetry produced by a weak 6li blend on a (presumed) symmetric 7liprofile. previous determinations of the 6li/ 7li isotopic ratio based on 1dmodel atmospheres, ignoring the convection-induced line asymmetry, musttherefore be considered as upper limits. by comparing synthetic 1d lte and 3dnon-lte line profiles of the li 670.8 nm feature, we quantify the differentialeffect of the convective line asymmetry on the derived 6li abundance as afunction of effective temperature, gravity, and metallicity. as expected, wefind that the asymmetry effect systematically reduces the resulting 6li/7liratios. depending on the stellar parameters, the 3d-1d offset in 6li/7li rangesbetween -0.005 and -0.020. when this purely theoretical correction is takeninto account for the asplund 2006 sample of stars, the number of significant6li detections decreases from 9 to 5 (2 sigma criterion), or from 5 to 2 (3sigma criterion).  we also present preliminary results of a re-analysis of high-resolution, highs/n spectra of individual metal-poor turn-off stars, to see whether the "secondlithium problem" actually disappears when accounting properly for convectionand non-lte line formation in 3d stellar atmospheres. out of 8 stars, hd84937seems to be the only significant (2 sigma) detection of 6li. in view of ourresults, the existence of a 6li plateau appears questionable.

1211.7304	3d hydrodynamical co5bold model atmospheres of red giant stars: i.  atmospheric structure of a giant located near the rgb tip	we investigate the character and role of convection in the atmosphere of aprototypical red giant located close to the red giant branch (rgb) tip withatmospheric parameters, teff=3660k, log(g)=1.0, [m/h]=0.0. differentialanalysis of the atmospheric structures is performed using the 3d hydrodynamicaland 1d classical atmosphere models calculated with the co5bold and lhd codes,respectively. all models share identical atmospheric parameters, elementalcomposition, opacities and equation-of-state. we find that the atmosphere ofthis particular red giant consists of two rather distinct regions: the loweratmosphere dominated by convective motions and the upper atmosphere dominatedby wave activity. convective motions form a prominent granulation pattern withan intensity contrast (~18%) which is larger than in the solar models (~15%).the upper atmosphere is frequently traversed by fast shock waves, with verticaland horizontal velocities of up to mach ~2.5 and ~6.0, respectively. thetypical diameter of the granules amounts to ~5gm which translates into ~400granules covering the whole stellar surface. the turbulent pressure in thegiant model contributes up to ~35% to the total (i.e., gas plus turbulent)pressure which shows that it cannot be neglected in stellar atmosphere andevolutionary modeling. however, there exists no combination of themixing-length parameter and turbulent pressure that would allow tosatisfactorily reproduce the 3d temperature-pressure profile with 1d atmospheremodels based on a standard formulation of mixing-length theory.

1301.3703	convective line shifts for the gaia rvs from the cifist 3d model  atmosphere grid	to derive space velocities of stars along the line of sight from wavelengthshifts in stellar spectra requires accounting for a number of second-ordereffects. for most stars, gravitational redshifts, convective blueshifts, andtransverse stellar motion are the dominant contributors. we provide theoreticalcorrections for the net velocity shifts due to convection expected for themeasurements from the gaia radial velocity spectrometer (rvs). we used a set ofthree-dimensional time-dependent simulations of stellar surface convectioncomputed with co5bold to calculate spectra of late-type stars in the gaia rvsrange and to infer the net velocity offset that convective motions will inducein radial velocities derived by cross-correlation. the net velocity shiftsderived by cross-correlation depend both on the wavelength range and spectralresolution of the observations. convective shifts for gaia rvs observations areless than 0.1 km/s for late-k-type stars, and they increase with stellar mass,reaching about 0.3 km/s or more for early f-type dwarfs. this tendency is theresult of an increase with effective temperature in both temperature andvelocity fluctuations in the line-forming region. our simulations also indicatethat the net rvs convective shifts can be positive (i.e. redshifts) in somecases. overall, the blueshifts weaken slightly with increasing surface gravity,and are enhanced at low metallicity. gravitational redshifts amount up to 0.7km/s and dominate convective blueshifts for dwarfs, but become much weaker forgiants.

1303.0357	signs of atmospheric inhomogeneities in cool stars from 1d-nlte analysis  of iron lines	for the well studied halo star hd 122563 and the four stars in the globularcluster ngc 6397, we determine nlte abundances of iron using classicalplane-parallel model atmospheres. each star reveals a discrepancy in abundancesbetween the fe i lines arising from the ground state and the other fe i lines,in qualitative agreement with the 3d-lte line formation predictions, however,the magnitude of the observed effect is a factor of 2 smaller compared with thepredicted one. when ignoring the fe i low-excitation lines, the nlte abundancesfrom the two ionization stages, fe i and fe ii, are consistent in eachinvestigated star. for the subgiants in ngc 6397, this is only true when usingthe cooler effective temperature scale of alonso et al.

1303.1791	carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars: the most pristine objects?	carbon-enhanced metal poor stars (cemp) form a significant proportion of themetal-poor stars, their origin is not well understood. three very metal-poorc-rich turnoff stars were selected from the sdss survey, observed with the esovlt (uves) to precisely determine the element abundances. in turnoff stars(unlike giants) the carbon abundance has not been affected by mixing with deeplayers and is therefore easier to interpret. the analysis was performed with 1dlte static model atmospheres. when available, non-lte corrections were appliedto the classical lte abundances. the 3d effects on the ch and cn molecularbands were computed using hydrodynamical simulations of the stellar atmosphere(co5bold) and are found to be very important. to facilitate a comparison withprevious results, only 1d abundances are used in the discussion. the abundances(or upper limits) of the elements enable us to place these stars in differentcemp classes. the carbon abundances confirm the existence of a plateau at a(c)=8.25 for [fe/h] \geq -3.4. the most metal-poor stars ([fe/h] &lt; -3.4) havesignificantly lower carbon abundances, suggesting a lower plateau at a(c)\approx 6.5. detailed analyses of a larger sample of very low metallicitycarbon-rich stars are required to confirm (or refute) this possible secondplateau and specify the behavior of the cemp stars at very low metallicity.

1303.2016	oxygen spectral line synthesis: 3d non-lte with co5bold hydrodynamical  model atmospheres	in this work we present first results of our current project aimed atcombining the 3d hydrodynamical stellar atmosphere approach with non-lte (nlte)spectral line synthesis for a number of key chemical species. we carried out afull 3d-nlte spectrum synthesis of the oxygen ir 777 nm triplet, using amodified and improved version of our nlte3d package to calculate departurecoefficients for the atomic levels of oxygen in a co5bold 3d hydrodynamicalsolar model atmosphere. spectral line synthesis was subsequently performed withthe linfor 3d code. in agreement with previous studies, we find that the linesof the oxygen triplet produce deeper cores under nlte conditions, due to thediminished line source function in the line forming region. this means that thesolar oxygen ir 777 nm lines should be stronger in nlte, leading to negative 3dnlte-lte abundance corrections. qualitatively this result would supportprevious claims for a relatively low solar oxygen abundance. finally, weoutline several further steps that need to be taken in order to improve thephysical realism and numerical accuracy of our current 3d-nlte calculations.

1305.3441	the influence of convection on the atmospheric structures and observable  properties of red giant stars	during the recent years significant progress has been made in the modeling ofred giant atmospheres with the aid of 3d hydrodynamical model atmosphere codes.in this contribution we provide an overview of selected results obtained inthis context by utilizing 3d hydrodynamical co5bold stellar model atmospheres.hydrodynamical simulations show that convective motions lead to significantdifferences in the atmospheric structures of red giants with respect to thosepredicted by the classical 1d model atmospheres. results of these simulationsalso show that in certain cases 1d models fail to reproduce even the averageproperties of the 3d hydrodynamical models, such as p-t profiles. largehorizontal temperature fluctuations in the 3d model atmospheres, as well asdifferences between the temperature profiles of the average &lt;3d&gt; and 1d models,lead to large discrepancies in the strengths of spectral lines predicted by the3d and 1d model atmospheres. this is especially important in models at lowestmetallicities ([m/h]&lt;-2.0) where the 3d-1d abundance differences may reach (oreven exceed) -0.6 dex for lines of neutral atoms and molecules. we also discussseveral simplifications and numerical aspects involved in the present 3dhydrodynamical modeling of red giant atmospheres, and briefly address severalissues where urgent progress may be needed.

1307.2810	granulation properties of giants, dwarfs, and white dwarfs from the  cifist 3d model atmosphere grid	3d model atmospheres for giants, dwarfs, and white dwarfs, computed with theco5bold code and part of the cifist grid, have been used for spectroscopic andasteroseismic studies. unlike existing plane-parallel 1d structures, thesesimulations predict the spatially and temporally resolved emergent intensity sothat granulation can be analysed, which provides insights on how convectiveenergy transfer operates in stars. the wide range of atmospheric parameters ofthe cifist 3d simulations (3600 &lt; teff (k) &lt; 13,000 and 1 &lt; log g &lt; 9) allowsthe comparison of convective processes in significantly different environments.we show that the relative intensity contrast is correlated with both the machand peclet numbers in the photosphere. the horizontal size of granules variesbetween 3 and 10 times the local pressure scale height, with a tightcorrelation between the factor and the mach number of the flow. given thatconvective giants, dwarfs, and white dwarfs cover the same range of mach andpeclet numbers, we conclude that photospheric convection operates in a verysimilar way in those objects.

1309.1488	stellar granulation as seen in disk-integrated intensity. ii.  theoretical scaling relations compared with observations	a large set of stars observed by corot and kepler shows clear evidence forthe presence of a stellar background, which is interpreted to arise fromsurface convection, i.e., granulation. these observations show that thecharacteristic time-scale (tau_eff) and the root-mean-square (rms) brightnessfluctuations (sigma) associated with the granulation scale as a function of thepeak frequency (nu_max) of the solar-like oscillations. we aim at providing atheoretical background to the observed scaling relations based on a modeldeveloped in the companion paper. we computed for each 3d model the theoreticalpower density spectrum (pds) associated with the granulation as seen indisk-integrated intensity on the basis of the theoretical model. for each pdswe derived tau_eff and sigma and compared these theoretical values with thetheoretical scaling relations derived from the theoretical model and the keplermeasurements. we derive theoretical scaling relations for tau_eff and sigma,which show the same dependence on nu_max as the observed scaling relations. inaddition, we show that these quantities also scale as a function of theturbulent mach number (ma) estimated at the photosphere. the theoreticalscaling relations for tau_eff and sigma match the observations well on a globalscale. our modelling provides additional theoretical support for the observedvariations of sigma and tau_eff with nu_m max. it also highlights the importantrole of ma in controlling the properties of the stellar granulation. however,the observations made with kepler on a wide variety of stars cannot confirm thedependence of our scaling relations on ma. measurements of the granulationbackground and detections of solar-like oscillations in a statisticallysufficient number of cool dwarf stars will be required for confirming thedependence of the theoretical scaling relations with ma.

1309.1620	stellar granulation as seen in disk-integrated intensity. i. simplified  theoretical modeling	the solar granulation is known for a long time to be a surface manifestationof convection. thanks to the current space-borne missions corot and kepler, itis now possible to observe in disk-integrated intensity the signature of thisphenomena in a growing number of stars. the space-based photometricmeasurements show that the global brightness fluctuations and the lifetimeassociated with granulation obeys characteristic scaling relations. we thus aimat providing a simple theoretical modeling to reproduce these scaling relationsand subsequently at inferring the physical properties of granulation propertiesacross the hr diagram.  we develop a simple 1d theoretical model that enable us to test anyprescription concerning the time-correlation between granules. the inputparameters of the model are extracted from 3d hydrodynamical models of thesurface layers of stars, and the free parameters involved in the model arecalibrated with solar observations. two different prescriptions forrepresenting the eddy time-correlation in the fourier space are compared: alorentzian and an exponential form. finally, we compare our theoreticalprediction with a 3d radiative hydrodynamical (rhd) numerical modeling ofstellar granulation (ab-initio approach). provided that the free parameters areappropriately adjusted, our theoretical model satisfactorily reproduces theshape and the amplitude of the observed solar granulation spectrum. the bestagreement is obtained with an exponential form. furthermore, our theoreticalmodel results in granulation spectra that consistently agree with the thesecalculated on the basis of the ab-initio approach with two 3d rhd models.comparison between theoretical granulation spectra calculated with the presentmodel and high precision photometry measurements of stellar granulation isundertaken in a companion paper.

1310.6058	isotope spectroscopy	the measurement of isotopic ratios provides a privileged insight both intonucleosynthesis and into the mechanisms operating in stellar envelopes, such asgravitational settling. in this article, we give a few examples of how isotopicratios can be determined from high-resolution, high-quality stellar spectra. weconsider examples of the lightest elements, h and he, for which the isotopicshifts are very large and easily measurable, and examples of heavier elementsfor which the determination of isotopic ratios is more difficult. the presenceof 6li in the stellar atmospheres causes a subtle extra depression in the redwing of the 7li 670.7 nm doublet which can only be detected in spectra of thehighest quality. but even with the best spectra, the derived $^6$li abundancecan only be as good as the synthetic spectra used for their interpretation. itis now known that 3d non-lte modelling of the lithium spectral line profiles isnecessary to account properly for the intrinsic line asymmetry, which isproduced by convective flows in the atmospheres of cool stars, and can mimicthe presence of 6li. we also discuss briefly the case of the carbon isotopicratio in metal-poor stars, and provide a new determination of the nickelisotopic ratios in the solar atmosphere.

1310.6963	topos: i. survey design and analysis of the first sample	the metal-weak tail of the metallicity distribution function (mdf) of thegalactic halo stars contains crucial information on the formation mode of thefirst generation of stars. to determine this observationally, it is necessaryto observe large numbers of extremely metal-poor stars. we present here theturn-off primordial stars survey (topos) that is conducted as an eso largeprogramme at the vlt. this project has {four} main goals: (i) to understand theformation of low-mass stars in a low-metallicity gas: determine the metal-weaktail of the halo mdf below [m/h]=-3.5. in particular, we aim at determining thecritical metallicity, that is the lowest metallicity sufficient for theformation of low-mass stars; (ii) to determine the relative abundance of theelements in extremely metal-poor stars, which are the signature of the massivefirst stars; (iii) to determine the trend of the lithium abundance at the timewhen the galaxy formed; and (iv) to derive the fraction of c-enhanced extremelymetal-poor stars with respect to normal extremely metal-poor stars. the largenumber of stars observed in the sdss provides a good sample of candidates ofstars at extremely low metallicity. candidates with turn-off colours down tomagnitude g=20 were selected from the low-resolution spectra of sdss by meansof an automated procedure. x-shooter has the potential of performing thenecessary follow-up spectroscopy, providing accurate metallicities andabundance ratios for several key elements for these stars. we here present thestellar parameters of the first set of stars. the nineteen stars range in ironabundance between -4.1 and -2.9 dex relative to the sun. two stars have a highradial velocity and, according to our estimate of their kinematics, appear tobe marginally bound to the galaxy and are possibly accreted from anothergalaxy.

1310.7791	three-dimensional hydrodynamical co5bold model atmospheres of red giant  stars. iii. line formation in the atmospheres of giants located close to the  base of rgb	we utilize state-of-the-art 3d hydrodynamical and classical 1d stellar modelatmospheres to study the influence of convection on the formation properties ofvarious atomic and molecular spectral lines in the atmospheres of four redgiant stars, located close to the base of the red giant branch, rgb($t_{\mathrm eff}\approx5000$ k, $\log g=2.5$), and characterized by fourdifferent metallicities, [m/h] = 0.0, -1.0, -2.0, -3.0. the role of convectionin the spectral line formation is assessed with the aid of abundancecorrections, i.e., the differences in abundances predicted for a givenequivalent width of a particular spectral line with the 3d and 1d modelatmospheres. we find that for lines of certain neutral atoms the abundancecorrections strongly depend both on metallicity of a given model atmosphere andthe line excitation potential. while abundance corrections for all lines ofboth neutral and ionized elements tend to be small at solar metallicity, forlines of neutral elements with low ionization potential and low-to-intermediate$\chi$ they quickly increase with decreasing metallicity, reaching in theirextremes to -0.6...-0.8 dex. in all such cases the large abundance correctionsare due to horizontal temperature fluctuations in the 3d hydrodynamical models.abundance corrections of molecular lines are very sensitive to metallicity ofthe underlying model atmosphere and may be larger (in absolute value) than -0.5dex at [m/h] = -3.0 (-1.5 dex in the case of co). we also find that anapproximate treatment of scattering in the 3d model calculations leads to theabundance corrections that are altered by less than ~0.1 dex, both for atomicand molecular (co) lines, with respect to the model where scattering is treatedas true absorption throughout the entire atmosphere, with the largestdifferences for the resonance and low-excitation lines.

1412.1789	calibration of the mixing-length theory for convective white dwarf  envelopes	a calibration of the mixing-length parameter in the local mixing-lengththeory (mlt) is presented for the lower part of the convection zone inpure-hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs. the parameterization is performed from acomparison of 3d co5bold simulations with a grid of 1d envelopes with a varyingmixing-length parameter. in many instances, the 3d simulations are restrictedto the upper part of the convection zone. the hydrodynamical calculationssuggest, in those cases, that the entropy of the upflows does not changesignificantly from the bottom of the convection zone to regions immediatelybelow the photosphere. we rely on this asymptotic entropy value, characteristicof the deep and adiabatically stratified layers, to calibrate 1d envelopes. thecalibration encompasses the convective hydrogen-line (da) white dwarfs in theeffective temperature range 6000 &lt; teff (k) &lt; 15,000 and the surface gravityrange 7.0 &lt; log g &lt; 9.0. it is established that the local mlt is unable toreproduce simultaneously the thermodynamical, flux, and dynamical properties ofthe 3d simulations. we therefore propose three different parameterizations forthese quantities. the resulting calibration can be applied to structure andenvelope calculations, in particular for pulsation, chemical diffusion, andconvective mixing studies. on the other hand, convection has no effect on thewhite dwarf cooling rates until there is a convective coupling with thedegenerate core below teff ~ 5000 k. in this regime, the 1d structures areinsensitive to the mlt parameterization and converge to the mean 3d results,hence remain fully appropriate for age determinations.

1506.00931	the photospheric solar oxygen project: iii. investigation of the  centre-to-limb variation of the 630nm [oi]-nii blend	the solar photospheric abundance of oxygen is still a matter of debate. forabout ten years some determinations have favoured a low oxygen abundance whichis at variance with the value inferred by helioseismology. among the oxygenabundance indicators, the forbidden line at 630nm has often been considered themost reliable even though it is blended with a nii line. in papers i and paperii of this series we reported a discrepancy in the oxygen abundance derivedfrom the 630nm and the subordinate [oi] line at 636nm in dwarf stars, includingthe sun. here we analyse several, in part new, solar observations of the thecentre-to-limb variation of the spectral region including the blend at 630nm inorder to separate the individual contributions of oxygen and nickel. we analyseintensity spectra observed at different limb angles in comparison with lineformation computations performed on a co5bold 3d hydrodynamical simulation ofthe solar atmosphere. the oxygen abundances obtained from the forbidden line atdifferent limb angles are inconsistent if the commonly adopted nickel abundanceof 6.25 is assumed in our local thermodynamic equilibrium computations. with aslightly lower nickel abundance, a(ni)~6.1, we obtain consistent fitsindicating an oxygen abundance of a(o)=8.73+/-0.05. at this value thediscrepancy with the subordinate oxygen line remains. the derived value of theoxygen abundance supports the notion of a rather low oxygen abundance in thesolar hotosphere. however, it is disconcerting that the forbidden oxygen linesat 630 and 636nm give noticeably different results, and that the nickelabundance derived here from the 630nm blend is lower than expected from othernickel lines.

0705.2304	inter-network regions of the sun at millimetre wavelengths	the continuum intensity at wavelengths around 1 mm provides an excellent wayto probe the solar chromosphere. future high-resolution millimetre arrays, suchas the atacama large millimeter array (alma), will thus produce valuable inputfor the ongoing controversy on the thermal structure and the dynamics of thislayer. synthetic brightness temperature maps are calculated on basis ofthree-dimensional radiation (magneto-)hydrodynamic (mhd) simulations. while themillimetre continuum at 0.3mm originates mainly from the upper photosphere, thelonger wavelengths considered here map the low and middle chromosphere. theeffective formation height increases generally with wavelength and also fromdisk-centre towards the solar limb. the average intensity contributionfunctions are usually rather broad and in some cases they are evendouble-peaked as there are contributions from hot shock waves and coolpost-shock regions in the model chromosphere. taking into account thedeviations from ionisation equilibrium for hydrogen gives a less strongvariation of the electron density and with it of the optical depth. the resultis a narrower formation height range. the average brightness temperatureincreases with wavelength and towards the limb. the relative contrast dependson wavelength in the same way as the average intensity but decreases towardsthe limb. the dependence of the brightness temperature distribution onwavelength and disk-position can be explained with the differences in formationheight and the variation of temperature fluctuations with height in the modelatmospheres.

1508.03487	the photospheric solar oxygen project: iv. 3d-nlte investigation of the  777 nm triplet lines	the solar photospheric oxygen abundance is still widely debated. adopting thesolar chemical composition based on the "low" oxygen abundance, as determinedwith the use of three-dimensional (3d) hydrodynamical model atmospheres,results in a well-known mismatch between theoretical solar models andhelioseismic measurements that is so far unresolved. we carry out anindependent redetermination of the solar oxygen abundance by investigating thecenter-to-limb variation of the oi ir triplet lines at 777 nm in different setsof spectra with the help of detailed synthetic line profiles based on 3dhydrodynamical co5bold model atmospheres and 3d non-lte line formationcalculations with nltetd. the idea is to simultaneously derive the oxygenabundance,a(o), and the scaling factor sh that describes the cross-sections forinelastic collisions with neutral hydrogen relative the classical drawinformula. the best fit of the center-to-limb variation of the triplet linesachieved with the co5bold 3d solar model is clearly of superior qualitycompared to the line profile fits obtained with standard 1d model atmospheres.our best estimate of the 3d non-lte solar oxygen abundance is a(o) = 8.76 +/-0.02, with the scaling factor sh in the range between 1.2 and 1.8. all 1dnon-lte models give much lower oxygen abundances, by up to -0.15 dex. this ismainly a consequence of the assumption of a $\mu$-independent microturbulence.

1509.05398	on the evolution of magnetic white dwarfs	we present the first radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of theatmosphere of white dwarf stars. we demonstrate that convective energy transferis seriously impeded by magnetic fields when the plasma-beta parameter, thethermal to magnetic pressure ratio, becomes smaller than unity. the criticalfield strength that inhibits convection in the photosphere of white dwarfs isin the range b = 1-50 kg, which is much smaller than the typical 1-1000 mgfield strengths observed in magnetic white dwarfs, implying that these objectshave radiative atmospheres. we have then employed evolutionary models to studythe cooling process of high-field magnetic white dwarfs, where convection isentirely suppressed during the full evolution (b &gt; 10 mg). we find that theinhibition of convection has no effect on cooling rates until the effectivetemperature (teff) reaches a value of around 5500 k. in this regime, thestandard convective sequences start to deviate from the ones without convectionowing to the convective coupling between the outer layers and the degeneratereservoir of thermal energy. since no magnetic white dwarfs are currently knownat the low temperatures where this coupling significantly changes theevolution, effects of magnetism on cooling rates are not expected to beobserved. this result contrasts with a recent suggestion that magnetic whitedwarfs with teff &lt; 10,000 k cool significantly slower than non-magneticdegenerates.

1510.00300	surface-effect corrections for solar-like oscillations using 3d  hydrodynamical simulations	the space-borne missions have provided us with a wealth of high-qualityobservational data that allows for seismic inferences of stellar interiors.this requires the computation of precise and accurate theoretical frequencies,but imperfect modeling of the uppermost stellar layers introduces systematicerrors. to overcome this problem, an empirical correction has been introducedby kjeldsen et al. (2008, apj, 683, l175) and is now commonly used for seismicinferences. nevertheless, we still lack a physical justification allowing forthe quantification of the surface-effect corrections. we used a grid of thesesimulations computed with the co$^5$bold code to model the outer layers ofsolar-like stars. upper layers of the corresponding 1d standard models werethen replaced by the layers obtained from the horizontally averaged 3d models.the frequency differences between these patched models and the 1d standardmodels were then calculated using the adiabatic approximation and allowed us toconstrain the kjeldsen et al. power law, as well as a lorentzian formulation.we find that the surface effects on modal frequencies depend significantly onboth the effective temperature and the surface gravity. we further provide thevariation in the parameters related to the surface-effect corrections usingtheir power law as well as a lorentzian formulation. scaling relations betweenthese parameters and the elevation (related to the mach number) is alsoprovided. the lorentzian formulation is shown to be more robust for the wholefrequency spectrum, while the power law is not suitable for the frequencyshifts in the frequency range above $\nu_{\rm max}$.

1512.08999	lithium spectral line formation in stellar atmospheres. the impact of  convection and nlte effects	different simplified approaches are used to account for the non-localthermodynamic equilibrium (nlte) effects with 3d hydrodynamical modelatmospheres. in certain cases, chemical abundances are derived in 1d nlte andcorrected for the 3d effects by adding 3d-1d lte abundance corrections (3d+nlteapproach). alternatively, average &lt;3d&gt; model atmospheres are sometimes used tosubstitute for the full 3d hydrodynamical models.  we tested whether the results obtained using these simplified schemes (i.e.,3d+nlte, &lt;3d&gt; nlte) may reproduce those derived using the full 3d nltecomputations. the tests were made using 3d hydrodynamical co5bold modelatmospheres of the main sequence (ms), main sequence turn-off (to), subgiant(sgb), and red giant branch (rgb) stars, all at [m/h]=0.0 and -2.0. our goalwas to investigate the role of 3d and nlte effects on the formation of the670.8 nm lithium line by assessing strengths of synthetic 670.8 nm lineprofiles, computed using 3d/1d nlte/lte approaches.  our results show that li 670.8 nm line strengths obtained using differentmethodologies differ only slightly in most of the models at solar metallicity.however, the line strengths predicted with the 3d nlte and 3d+nlte approachesbecome significantly different at subsolar metallicities. at [m/h]=-2.0, thismay lead to (3d nlte)-(3d+nlte) differences in the predicted lithium abundanceof ~0.46 and ~0.31 dex in the to and rgb stars, respectively. on the otherhand, nlte line strengths computed with the average &lt;3d&gt; and 1d modelatmospheres are similar to those obtained with the full 3d nlte approach forms, to, sgb, and rgb stars, at all metallicities; 3d-&lt;3d&gt; and 3d-1d differencesin the predicted abundances are always less than ~0.04 dex and ~0.08 dex,respectively. however, neither of the simplified approaches can reliablysubstitute 3d nlte spectral synthesis when precision is required.

astro-ph;0005319	the effects of numerical resolution on hydrodynamical surface convection  simulations and spectral line formation	the computationally demanding nature of radiative-hydrodynamical simulationsof stellar surface convection warrants an investigation of the sensitivity ofthe convective structure and spectral synthesis to the numerical resolution anddimension of the simulations, which is presented here. with too coarse aresolution the predicted spectral lines tend to be too narrow, reflectinginsufficient doppler broadening from the convective motions, while at thecurrently highest affordable resolution the line shapes have convergedessentially perfectly to the observed profiles. similar conclusions are drawnfrom the line asymmetries and shifts. in terms of abundances, weak fei and feiilines show a very small dependence (~0.02 dex) while for intermediate stronglines with significant non-thermal broadening the sensitivity increases (~0.10dex). problems arise when using 2d convection simulations to describe aninherent 3d phenomenon, which translates to inaccurate atmospheric velocityfields and temperature and pressure structures. in 2d the theoretical lineprofiles tend to be too shallow and broad compared with the 3d calculations andobservations, in particular for intermediate strong lines. in terms ofabundances, the 2d results are systematically about 0.1 dex lower than for the3d case for fei lines. furthermore, the predicted line asymmetries and shiftsare much inferior in 2d. given these shortcomings and computing timeconsiderations it is better to use 3d simulations of even modest resolutionthan high-resolution 2d simulations.

astro-ph;0205458	small-scale magnetic fields on late-type m-dwarfs	we performed kinematic studies of the evolution of small-scale magneticfields in the surface laters of m-dwarfs. we solved the induction equation fora prescribed velocity field, magnetic reynolds number, and boundary conditionsin a cartesian box, representing a volume comprising the optically thin stellaratmosphere and the uppermost part of the optically thick convective envelope.the velocity field is spatially and temporally variable, and stems fromdetailed radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of convectione flows in aproto-typical late-type m-dwarf. we find dynamo action for large magneticreynolds numbers. growth time scales of the magnetic field is comparable to theconvective turn-over time scale (approximately 150 seconds). the convectivevelocity field concentrates the magnetic field in sheets and tubular structuresin the inter-granular down-flows. scaling from solar conditions suggests thatfield strengths as high as 20 kg might be reached locally. perhps surprisingly,the magnetic reynolds number is of the order unity in the surface layers ofcooler m-dwarfs, rendering the dynamo inoperative. in all studied cases we finda rather low spatial filling factor of the magnetic field.

astro-ph;0208584	numerical simulations of surface convection in a late m-dwarf	based on detailed 2d and 3d numerical radiation-hydrodynamics (rhd)simulations of time-dependent compressible convection, we have studied thedynamics and thermal structure of the convective surface layers of aprototypical late-type m-dwarf (teff~2800k log(g)=5.0, solar chemicalcomposition). the rhd models predict stellar granulation qualitatively similarto the familiar solar pattern. quantitatively, the granular cells show aconvective turn-over time scale of ~100s, and a horizontal scale of 80km; therelative intensity contrast of the granular pattern amounts to 1.1%, androot-mean-square vertical velocities reach 240m/s at maximum. deviations fromradiative equilibrium in the higher, formally convectively stable atmosphericlayers are found to be insignificant allowing a reliable modeling of theatmosphere with 1d standard model atmospheres. a mixing-length parameter ofalpha=2.1 provides the best representation of the average thermal structure ofthe rhd model atmosphere while alternative values are found when fitting theasymptotic entropy encountered in deeper layers of the stellar envelopealpha=1.5, or when matching the vertical velocity field alpha=3.5. the closecorrespondence between rhd and standard model atmospheres implies thatpresently existing discrepancies between observed and predicted stellar colorsin the m-dwarf regime cannot be traced back to an inadequate treatment ofconvection in the 1d standard models. the rhd models predict a modest extensionof the convectively mixed region beyond the formal schwarzschild stabilityboundary which provides hints for the distribution of dust grains in cooler(brown dwarf) atmospheres.

astro-ph;0503208	theoretical modelling of late-type giant atmospheres: preparing for gaia	late type giants (rgb/agb stars) will be important tracers of the galacticmorphology and evolution in the framework of gaia, as they are intrinsicallybright and thus can probe distant stellar populations or those obscured byinterstellar extinction. a realistic representation of their atmospheres andspectra with stellar atmosphere models is thus of crucial importance, both forthe design and optimization of gaia instruments, as well as the interpretationof provided astrophysical data. our analysis of synthetic photometric colors oflate-type giants based on phoenix, marcs and atlas model atmospheres indicatesa general agreement between the current theoretical predictions andobservations in the framework of stationary 1-d model atmospheres. presentlyavailable models allow temperature determinations of rgb/agb stars to anaccuracy of ~\pm100 k. in an exploratory study we try to quantify possibleresidual systematic effects due to the approximations made in 1-d models usingfull 3-d hydrodynamical models. we find that differences in broad-bandphotometric colors calculated with 1-d and 3-d models are significant,translating to the offsets in effective temperature of up to ~70 k. clearly,full 3-d hydrodynamical models will help to alleviate such ambiguities incurrent theoretical modeling. additionally, they will allow to study newphenomena, to open qualitatively new windows for stellar astrophysics in thegaia-era.
