0902.4857	galaxy clusters and the cosmic cycle of baryons across cosmic times	we discuss the central role played by the x-ray study of hot baryons withingalaxy clusters to reconstruct the assembly of cosmic structures and to tracethe past history of star formation and accretion onto supermassive black holes(bhs). we shortly review the progress in this field contributed by the currentgeneration of x-ray telescopes. then, we focus on the outstanding scientificquestions that have been opened by observations carried out in the last yearsand that represent the legacy of chandra and xmm: (a) when and how is entropyinjected into the inter-galactic medium (igm)? (b) what is the history of metalenrichment of the igm? (c) what physical mechanisms determine the presence ofcool cores in galaxy clusters? (d) how is the appearance of proto-clusters atz~2 related to the peak of star formation activity and bh accretion? we showthat a highly efficient observational strategy to address these questions is tocarry out a large-area x-ray survey, reaching a sensitivity comparable to thatof deep chandra and xmm pointings, but extending over several thousands ofsquare degrees. a similar survey can only be carried out with a wide-fieldx-ray telescope (wfxt), which combines a high survey speed with a sharp psfacross the entire fov. we emphasize the important synergies that wfxt will havewith a number of future ground-based and space telescopes, covering from theradio to the x-ray bands. finally, we discuss the immense legacy value thatsuch a mission will have for extragalactic astronomy at large.

0902.4890	the evolution of galaxy clusters across cosmic time	the large scale structure of the present universe is determined by the growthof dark matter density fluctuations and by the dynamical action of dark energyand dark matter. while much progress has been made in recent years inconstraining the cosmological parameters, and in reconstructing the evolutionin the large--scale structure of the dark matter distribution, we still lack anunderstanding of the evolution of the baryonic component of the universe.  located at nodes of the cosmic web, clusters of galaxies are the largestcollapsed structures in the universe with total masses up to 10$^{15}$m$_{\sun}$. over 80% of their mass resides in the form of dark matter. theremaining mass is composed of baryons, most of which (about 85%) is a diffuse,hot plasma that radiates primarily in x-rays. x-ray observations of theevolving cluster population provide a unique opportunity to address such openand fundamental questions as: how do hot diffuse baryons dynamically evolve indark matter potentials? how and when was the excess energy which we observe inthe intergalactic medium generated? what is the cosmic history of heavy-elementproduction and circulation?  our current knowledge comes primarily from detailed studies of clusters inthe relatively nearby universe (z$&lt;$0.5). major advances will come from highthroughput, high spectral and spatial resolution x-ray observations thatmeasure the thermodynamical properties and metal content of the first low massclusters emerging at z $\sim$ 2 and directly trace their evolution into today'smassive clusters.

0910.0853	spectacular x-ray tails, intracluster star formation and ulxs in a3627	we present the discovery of spectacular double x-ray tails associated witheso137-001 and a possibly heated x-ray tail associated with eso137-002, bothlate-type galaxies in the closest rich cluster abell 3627. a deep chandraobservation of eso137-001 allows us for the first time to examine the spatialand spectral properties of such x-ray tails in detail. besides the known brighttail that extends to ~ 80 kpc from eso137-001, a fainter and narrower secondarytail with a similar length was surprisingly revealed. there is littletemperature variation along both tails. we also identified six x-ray pointsources as candidates of intracluster ulxs with l(0.3-10 kev) of up to2.5x10^40 erg s^-1. gemini spectra of intracluster hii regions downstream ofeso137-001 are also presented, as well as the velocity map of these hii regionsthat shows the imprint of eso137-001's disk rotation. for the first time, weunambiguously know that active star formation can happen in the cold ismstripped by icm ram pressure and it may contribute a significant amount of theintracluster light. we also report the discovery of a 40 kpc x-ray tail ofanother late-type galaxy in a3627, eso137-002. its x-ray tail seems hot, ~ 2kev (compared to ~ 0.8 kev for eso137-001's tails). we conclude that the highpressure environment around these two galaxies is important for their brightx-ray tails and the intracluster star formation.

0911.2798	brightest cluster galaxies and core gas density in rexcess clusters	we investigate the relationship between brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) andtheir host clusters using a sample of nearby galaxy clusters from therepresentative xmm cluster structure survey (rexcess). the sample was imagedwith the southern observatory for astrophysical research (soar) in r band toinvestigate the mass of the old stellar population. using a metric radius of12h^-1 kpc, we found that the bcg luminosity depends weakly on overall clustermass as l_bcg \propto m_cl^0.18+-0.07, consistent with previous work. we foundthat 90% of the bcgs are located within 0.035 r_500 of the peak of the x-rayemission, including all of the cool core (cc) clusters. we also found anunexpected correlation between the bcg metric luminosity and the core gasdensity for non-cool core (non-cc) clusters, following a power law of n_e\propto l_bcg^2.7+-0.4 (where n_e is measured at 0.008 r_500). the correlationis not easily explained by star formation (which is weak in non-cc clusters) oroverall cluster mass (which is not correlated with core gas density). the trendpersists even when the bcg is not located near the peak of the x-ray emission,so proximity is not necessary. we suggest that, for non-cc clusters, thiscorrelation implies that the same process that sets the central entropy of thecluster gas also determines the central stellar density of the bcg, and thatthis underlying physical process is likely to be mergers.

1004.1559	chandra observation of two shock fronts in the merging galaxy cluster  abell 2146	we present a new chandra observation of the galaxy cluster abell 2146 whichhas revealed a complex merging system with a gas structure that is remarkablysimilar to the bullet cluster (eg. markevitch et al. 2002). the x-ray image andtemperature map show a cool 2-3 kev subcluster with a ram pressure strippedtail of gas just exiting the disrupted 6-7 kev primary cluster. from the sharpjump in the temperature and density of the gas, we determine that thesubcluster is preceded by a bow shock with a mach number m=2.2+/-0.8,corresponding to a velocity v=2200^{+1000}_{-900} km/s relative to the maincluster. we estimate that the subcluster passed through the primary core only0.1-0.3 gyr ago. in addition, we observe a slower upstream shock propagatingthrough the outer region of the primary cluster and calculate a mach numberm=1.7+/-0.3. based on the measured shock mach numbers m~2 and the strength ofthe upstream shock, we argue that the mass ratio between the two mergingclusters is between 3 and 4 to one. by comparing the chandra observation withan archival hst observation, we find that a group of galaxies is located infront of the x-ray subcluster core but the brightest cluster galaxy is locatedimmediately behind the x-ray peak.

1005.1207	herschel observations of fir emission lines in brightest cluster  galaxies	the question of how much gas cools in the cores of clusters of galaxies hasbeen the focus of many, multiwavelength studies in the past 30 years. in thisletter we present the first detections of the strongest atomic cooling lines,[c ii], [o i] and [n i] in two strong cooling flow clusters, a1068 and a2597,using herschel pacs. these spectra indicate that the substantial mass of coldmolecular gas (&gt;10^9 mo) known to be present in these systems is beingirradiated by intense uv radiation, most probably from young stars. the linewidths of these fir lines indicate that they share dynamics similar but notidentical to other ionised and molecular gas traced by optical, near-infraredand co lines. the relative brightness of the fir lines compared to co and firluminosity is consistent with other star-forming galaxies indicating that theproperties of the molecular gas clouds in cluster cores and the stars they formare not unusual. these results provide additional evidence for a reservoir ofcold gas that is fed by the cooling of gas in the cores of the most compactclusters and provide important diagnostics of the temperature and density ofthe dense clouds this gas resides in.

1006.4379	shocks and cavities from multiple outbursts in the galaxy group ngc  5813: a window to agn feedback	we present results from new chandra, gmrt, and soar observations of ngc 5813,the dominant central galaxy in a nearby galaxy group. the system shows threepairs of collinear cavities at 1 kpc, 8 kpc, and 20 kpc from the centralsource, from three distinct outbursts of the central agn, which occurred3x10^6, 2x10^7, and 9x10^7 yr ago. the h-alpha and x-ray observations revealfilaments of cool gas that has been uplifted by the x-ray cavities. the innertwo cavity pairs are filled with radio emitting plasma, and each pair isassociated with an elliptical surface brightness edge, which we unambiguouslyidentify as shocks (with measured temperature jumps) with mach numbers of m~1.7and m~1.5 for the inner and outer shocks, respectively. such clear signaturesfrom three distinct agn outbursts in an otherwise dynamically relaxed systemprovide a unique opportunity to study agn feedback and outburst history. themean power of the two most recent outbursts differs by a factor of six, from1.5--10x10^42 erg/s, indicating that the mean jet power changes significantlyover long (~10^7 yr) timescales. the total energy output of the most recentoutburst is also more than an order of magnitude less than the total energy ofthe previous outburst (1.5x10^56 erg versus 4x10^57 erg), which may be a resultof the lower mean power, or may indicate that the most recent outburst isongoing. the outburst interval implied by both the shock and cavity ages (~10^7yr) indicates that, in this system, shock heating alone is sufficient tobalance radiative cooling close to the central agn, which is the relevantregion for regulating feedback between the icm and the central smbh.

1102.5080	violent interaction between the agn and the hot gas in the core of the  galaxy cluster sersic 159-03	we present a multi-wavelength study of the energetic interaction between thecentral active galactic nucleus (agn), the intra-cluster medium, and theoptical emission line nebula in the galaxy cluster sersic 159-03. we use x-raydata from chandra, high resolution x-ray spectra and uv images from xmm-newton,halpha images from the soar telescope, hst optical imaging, and vla and gmrtradio data. the cluster center displays signs of powerful agn feedback, whichhas cleared the central regions (r&lt;7.5 kpc) of dense, x-ray emitting icm. x-rayspectral maps reveal a high pressure ring surrounding the central agn at aradius of r~15 kpc, indicating an agn driven weak shock. the cluster harbors abright, 44 kpc long halpha+[nii] filament extending from the centre of the cdgalaxy to the north. along the filament, we see low entropy, high metallicity,cooling x-ray gas. the gas in the filament has most likely been uplifted by`radio mode' agn activity and subsequently stripped from the galaxy due to itsrelative southward motion. because this x-ray gas has been removed from thedirect influence of the agn jets, part of it cools and forms stars as indicatedby the observed dust lanes, molecular and ionized emission line nebulae, andthe excess uv emission.

1103.5618	the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash): strong  lensing analysis of abell 383 from 16-band hst wfc3/acs imaging	we examine the inner mass distribution of the relaxed galaxy cluster abell383 in deep 16-band hst/acs+wfc3 imaging taken as part of the clash multi-cycletreasury program. our program is designed to study the dark matter distributionin 25 massive clusters, and balances depth with a wide wavelength coverage tobetter identify lensed systems and generate precise photometric redshifts. thisinformation together with the predictive strength of our strong-lensinganalysis method identifies 13 new multiply-lensed images and candidates, sothat a total of 27 multiple-images of 9 systems are used to tightly constrainthe inner mass profile, $d\log \sigma/d\log r\simeq -0.6\pm 0.1$ (r&lt;160 kpc).we find consistency with the standard distance-redshift relation for the fullrange spanned by the lensed images, 1.01&lt;z&lt;6.03, with the higher redshiftsources deflected through larger angles as expected. the inner mass profilederived here is consistent with the results of our independent weak-lensinganalysis of wide-field subaru images, with good agreement in the region ofoverlap. the overall mass profile is well fitted by an nfw profile withm_{vir}=(5.37^{+0.70}_{-0.63}\pm 0.26) x 10^{14}m_{\odot}/h and a relativelyhigh concentration, c_{vir}=8.77^{+0.44}_{-0.42}\pm 0.23, which lies above thestandard c-m relation similar to other well-studied clusters. the criticalradius of abell 383 is modest by the standards of other lensing clusters,r_{e}\simeq16\pm2\arcsec (for z_s=2.55), so the relatively large number oflensed images uncovered here with precise photometric redshifts validates ourimaging strategy for the clash survey. in total we aim to provide similarlyhigh-quality lensing data for 25 clusters, 20 of which are x-ray selectedrelaxed clusters, enabling a precise determination of the representative massprofile free from lensing bias.

1107.2649	clash: new multiple-images constraining the inner mass profile of macs  j1206.2-0847	we present a strong-lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster macs j1206.2-0847($z$=0.44) using uv, optical, and ir, hst/acs/wfc3 data taken as part of theclash multi-cycle treasury program, with vlt/vimos spectroscopy for some of themultiply-lensed arcs. the clash observations, combined with our mass-model,allow us to identify 47 new multiply-lensed images of 12 distant sources. theseimages, along with the previously known arc, span the redshift range $1\laz\la5.5$, and thus enable us to derive a detailed mass distribution and toaccurately constrain, for the first time, the inner mass-profile of thiscluster. we find an inner profile slope of $d\log \sigma/d\log \theta\simeq-0.55\pm 0.1$ (in the range [1\arcsec, 53\arcsec], or $5\la r \la300$ kpc), ascommonly found for relaxed and well-concentrated clusters. using the manysystems uncovered here we derive credible critical curves and einstein radiifor different source redshifts. for a source at $z_{s}\simeq2.5$, the criticalcurve encloses a large area with an effective einstein radius of$\theta_{e}=28\pm3\arcsec$, and a projected mass of $1.34\pm0.15\times10^{14}m_{\odot}$. from the current understanding of structure formation inconcordance cosmology, these values are relatively high for clusters at$z\sim0.5$, so that detailed studies of the inner mass distribution of clusterssuch as macs j1206.2-0847 can provide stringent tests of the $\lambda$cdmparadigm.

1202.5320	shock fronts, electron-ion equilibration and icm transport processes in  the merging cluster abell 2146	we present a new 400 ks chandra x-ray observation of the merging galaxycluster abell 2146. this deep observation reveals detailed structure associatedwith the major merger event including the mach m=2.3+/-0.2 bow shock ahead ofthe dense, ram pressure stripped subcluster core and the first known example ofan upstream shock in the icm (m=1.6+/-0.1). by measuring the electrontemperature profile behind each shock front, we determine the timescale for theelectron population to thermally equilibrate with the shock-heated ions. wefind that the temperature profile behind the bow shock is consistent with thetimescale for coulomb collisional equilibration and the postshock temperatureis lower than expected for instant shock-heating of the electrons. althoughlike the bullet cluster the electron temperatures behind the upstream shockfront are hotter than expected, favouring the instant heating model, theuncertainty on the temperature values is greater here and there is significantsubstructure complicating the interpretation. we also measured the width ofeach shock front and the contact discontinuity on the leading edge of thesubcluster core to investigate the suppression of transport processes in theicm. the upstream shock is ~440 kpc in length but appears remarkably narrowover this distance with a best-fit width of only 6^{+5}_{-3} kpc compared withthe mean free path of 23+/-5 kpc. the leading edge of the subcluster core isalso narrow with an upper limit on the width of only 2 kpc separating the cool,multiphase gas at 0.5-2 kev from the shock-heated surrounding icm at ~6 kev.the strong suppression of diffusion and conduction across this edge suggests amagnetic draping layer may have formed around the subcluster core.[abridged]

1203.5097	hundred thousand degree gas in the virgo cluster of galaxies	the physical relationship between low-excitation gas filaments at ~10^4 k,seen in optical line emission, and diffuse x-ray emitting coronal gas at ~10^7k in the centers of many galaxy clusters is not understood. it is unclearwhether the ~10^4 k filaments have cooled and condensed from the ambient hot(~10^7 k) medium or have some other origin such as the infall of cold gas in amerger, or the disturbance of an internal cool reservoir of gas by nuclearactivity. observations of gas at intermediate temperatures (~10^5-10^6 k) canpotentially reveal whether the central massive galaxies are gaining cool gasthrough condensation or losing it through conductive evaporation and henceidentify plausible scenarios for transport processes in galaxy cluster gas.here we present spectroscopic detection of ~10^5 k gas spatially associatedwith the h-alpha filaments in a central cluster galaxy, m87 in the virgocluster. the measured emission-line fluxes from triply ionized carbon (civ 1549a) and singly ionized helium (heii 1640 a) are consistent with a model in whichthermal conduction determines the interaction between hot and cold phases.

1205.2373	residual cooling and persistent star formation amid agn feedback in  abell 2597	new chandra x-ray and herschel fir observations enable a multiwavelengthstudy of active galactic nucleus (agn) heating and intracluster medium (icm)cooling in the brightest cluster galaxy of abell 2597. the new chandraobservations reveal the central &lt; 30 kiloparsec x-ray cavity network to be moreextensive than previously thought, and associated with enough enthalpy totheoretically inhibit the inferred classical cooling flow. nevertheless, wepresent new evidence, consistent with previous results, that a moderatelystrong residual cooling flow is persisting at 4%-8% of the classicallypredicted rates in a spatially structured manner amid the feedback-drivenexcavation of the x-ray cavity network. new herschel observations are used toestimate warm and cold dust masses, a lower-limit gas-to-dust ratio, and a starformation rate consistent with previous measurements. the cooling time profileof the ambient x-ray atmosphere is used to map the locations of theobservational star formation entropy threshold as well as the theoreticalthermal instability threshold. both lie just outside the &lt; 30 kpc centralregion permeated by x-ray cavities, and star formation as well as ionized andmolecular gas lie interior to both. the young stars are distributed in anelongated region that is aligned with the radio lobes, and their estimated agesare both younger and older than the x-ray cavity network, suggesting bothjet-triggered as well as persistent star formation over the current agnfeedback episode. bright x-ray knots that are coincident with extended ly-alphaand fuv continuum filaments motivate a discussion of structured cooling fromthe ambient hot atmosphere along a projected axis that is perpendicular tox-ray cavity and radio axis. we conclude that the cooling icm is the dominantcontributor of the cold gas reservoir fueling star formation and agn activityin the abell 2597 bcg.

1307.5847	evidence for ubiquitous, high-ew nebular emission in z~7 galaxies:  towards a clean measurement of the specific star formation rate using a  sample of bright, magnified galaxies	growing observational evidence now indicates that nebular line emission has asignificant impact on the rest-frame optical fluxes of z~5-7 galaxies observedwith spitzer. this line emission makes z~5-7 galaxies appear more massive, withlower specific star formation rates. however, corrections for this lineemission have been very difficult to perform reliably due to huge uncertaintieson the overall strength of such emission at z&gt;~5.5. here, we present the mostdirect observational evidence yet for ubiquitous high-ew [oiii]+hbeta lineemission in lyman-break galaxies at z~7, while also presenting a strategy foran improved measurement of the ssfr at z~7. we accomplish this through theselection of bright galaxies in the narrow redshift window z~6.6-7.0 where theirac 4.5 micron flux provides a clean measurement of the stellar continuumlight. observed 4.5 micron fluxes in this window contrast with the 3.6 micronfluxes which are contaminated by the prominent [oiii]+hbeta lines. to ensure ahigh s/n for our irac flux measurements, we consider only the brightest(h_{160}&lt;26 mag) magnified galaxies we have identified in clash and otherprograms targeting galaxy clusters. remarkably, the mean rest-frame opticalcolor for our bright seven-source sample is very blue, [3.6]-[4.5]=-0.9+/-0.3.such blue colors cannot be explained by the stellar continuum light and requirethat the rest-frame ew of [oiii]+hbeta be greater than 637 angstroms for theaverage source. the bluest four sources from our seven-source sample require aneven more extreme ew of 1582 angstroms. our derived lower limit for the mean[oiii]+hbeta ew could underestimate the true ew by ~2x based on a simplemodeling of the redshift distribution of our sources. we can also set a robustlower limit of &gt;~4 gyr^-1 on the specific star formation rates based on themean sed for our seven-source sample.

0801.3430	galaxy-cluster gas-density distributions of the representative  xmm-newton cluster structure survey (rexcess)	we present a study of the structural and scaling properties of the gasdistributions in the intracluster medium (icm) of 31 nearby (z &lt; 0.2) clustersobserved with xmm-newton, which together comprise the representative xmm-newtoncluster structure survey (rexcess). in contrast to previous studies, thissample is unbiased with respect to cluster dynamical state, and it fullysamples the cluster x-ray luminosity function. the clusters cover a temperaturerange of 2.0 -- 8.5 kev and possess a variety of morphologies. the samplingstrategy allows us to compare clusters with a wide range of central coolingtimes on an equal footing. we present non-parametric gas-density profiles outto distances ranging between 0.8 r_500 and 1.5 r_500. the central gas densitiesdiffer greatly from system to system, with no clear correlation with systemtemperature. at intermediate radii the scaled density profiles show much lessscatter, with a clear dependence on system temperature, consistent with thepresence of an entropy excess as suggested in previous literature. however, atlarge scaled radii this dependence becomes weaker: clusters with kt &gt; 3 kevscale self-similarly, with no temperature dependence of gas-densitynormalisation. we find some evidence of a correlation between dynamical stateand outer gas density slope, and between dynamical state and both central gasnormalisation and cooling time. we find no evidence of a significant bimodalityin the distributions of central density, density gradient, or cooling time.finally, we present the gas mass-temperature relation for the rexcess sample,which is consistent with the expectation of self-similar scaling modified bythe presence of an entropy excess in the inner regions of the cluster, and hasa logarithmic intrinsic scatter of ~10%.

1309.0014	massive molecular gas flows in the abell 1664 brightest cluster galaxy	we report alma early science co(1-0) and co(3-2) observations of thebrightest cluster galaxy (bcg) in abell 1664. the bcg contains 1.1x10^{10}solar masses of molecular gas divided roughly equally between two distinctvelocity systems: one from -250 to +250 km/s centred on the bcg's systemicvelocity and a high velocity system blueshifted by 570 km/s with respect to thesystemic velocity. the bcg's systemic component shows a smooth velocitygradient across the bcg center with velocity proportional to radius suggestiveof solid body rotation about the nucleus. however, the mass and velocitystructure are highly asymmetric and there is little star formation coincidentwith a putative disk. it may be an inflow of gas that will settle into a diskover several 10^8 yr. the high velocity system consists of two gas clumps, each~2 kpc across, located to the north and southeast of the nucleus. each has aline of sight velocity spread of 250-300 km/s. the velocity of the gas in thehigh velocity system tends to increase towards the bcg center and could signifya massive high velocity flow onto the nucleus. however, the velocity gradientis not smooth and these structures are also coincident with low optical-uvsurface brightness regions, which could indicate dust extinction associatedwith each clump. if so, the high velocity gas would be projected in front ofthe bcg and moving toward us along the line of sight in a massive outflow mostlikely driven by the agn. a merger origin is unlikely but cannot be ruled out.

(2013) using dropout techniques with the 16-band hst photometry acquired aspart of the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble (clash). obtainedas part of the clash-vlt survey, the vimos medium-resolution spectra of thissource show a very faint continuum between ~8700a and ~9300a and a prominentemission line at 8643a, which can be readily identified with lyman-alpha atz=6.110. the emission line exhibits an asymmetric profile, with a morepronounced red wing. the rest-frame equivalent width of the line is ew=79+-10a.after correcting for magnification, the star-formation rate (sfr) estimatedfrom the lya line is sfr(lya)=11 m_{sol}/yr and that estimated from the uv datais sfr(uv)=3 m_{sol}/yr. we estimate that the effective radius of the source isr_e&lt;~0.4 kpc, which implies a star formation surface mass density sigma_{sfr}&gt;6m_{sol}/yr/kpc^2 and, using the kennicutt-schmidt relation, a gas surface massdensity sigma_{gas}&gt;10^3 m_{sol}/pc^2. our results support the idea that thismagnified, distant galaxy is a young and compact object with 0.4 l^* at z=6,with comparable amount of mass in gas and stars. future follow-up observationswith alma will provide valuable insight into the sfr and molecular gas contentof this source. in the spirit of the frontier fields initiative, we alsopublish the redshifts of several multiply imaged sources and other backgroundobjects which will help improving the strong lensing model of this galaxycluster.

1310.4501	cold gas dynamics in hydra-a: evidence for a rotating disk	we present multi-frequency observations of the radio galaxy hydra-a (3c218)located in the core of a massive, x-ray luminous galaxy cluster. ifuspectroscopy is used to trace the kinematics of the ionised and warm molecularhydrogen which are consistent with a ~ 5 kpc rotating disc. broad,double-peaked lines of co(2-1), [cii]157 $\mu$m and [oi]63 $\mu$m are detected.we estimate the mass of the cold gas within the disc to be m$_{gas}$ = 2.3$\pm$ 0.3 x 10$^9$ m$_{\odot}$. these observations demonstrate that the complexline profiles found in the cold atomic and molecular gas are related to therotating disc or ring of gas. finally, an hst image of the galaxy shows thatthis gas disc contains a substantial mass of dust. the large gas mass, sfr andkinematics are consistent with the levels of gas cooling from the icm. weconclude that the cold gas originates from the continual quiescent accumulationof cooled icm gas. the rotation is in a plane perpendicular to the projectedorientation of the radio jets and icm cavities hinting at a possible connectionbetween the kpc-scale cooling gas and the accretion of material onto the blackhole. we discuss the implications of these observations for models of coldaccretion, agn feedback and cooling flows.

1310.5450	the origin of cold gas in giant elliptical galaxies and its role in  fueling radio-mode agn feedback	we present a multi-wavelength study of the interstellar medium in eightnearby, x-ray and optically bright, giant elliptical galaxies. using herschelpacs, we map the cold gas in the lines of [cii], [oi], and [oib]. additionally,we present ha+[nii] imaging of warm ionized gas with the soar telescope, and astudy of the hot x-ray emitting plasma with chandra. all systems with extendedha emission in our sample (6/8 galaxies) display significant [cii] lineemission indicating the presence of cold gas. this emission is co-spatial withthe ha+[nii] emitting nebulae and the lowest entropy x-ray emitting plasma. theentropy profiles of the hot galactic atmospheres show a clear dichotomy, withthe systems displaying extended emission line nebulae having lower entropiesbeyond r~1 kpc than the cold-gas-poor systems. we show that while the hotatmospheres of the cold-gas-poor galaxies are thermally stable outside of theirinnermost cores, the atmospheres of the cold-gas-rich systems are prone tocooling instabilities. this result indicates that the cold gas is producedchiefly by thermally unstable cooling from the hot phase. we show that coolinginstabilities may develop more easily in rotating systems and discuss analternative condition for thermal instability for this case. the hotatmospheres of cold-gas-rich galaxies display disturbed morphologies indicatingthat the accretion of clumpy multiphase gas in these systems may result invariable power output of the agn jets, potentially triggering sporadic, largeroutbursts. in the two cold-gas-poor, x-ray morphologically relaxed galaxies ofour sample, ngc 1399 and ngc 4472, powerful agn outbursts may have destroyed orremoved most of the cold gas from the cores, allowing the jets to propagate anddeposit most of their energy further out, increasing the entropy of the hotgalactic atmospheres and leaving their cores relatively undisturbed.

1404.1384	the music of clash: predictions on the concentration-mass relation	we present the results of a numerical study based on the analysis of themusic-2 simulations, aimed at estimating the expected concentration-massrelation for the clash cluster sample. we study nearly 1400 halos simulated athigh spatial and mass resolution, which were projected along manylines-of-sight each. we study the shape of both their density andsurface-density profiles and fit them with a variety of radial functions,including the navarro-frenk-white, the generalised navarro-frenk-white, and theeinasto density profiles. we derive concentrations and masses from these fitsand investigate their distributions as a function of redshift and halorelaxation. we use the x-ray image simulator x-mas to produce simulated chandraobservations of the halos and we use them to identify objects resembling thex-ray morphologies and masses of the clusters in the clash x-ray selectedsample. we also derive a concentration-mass relation for strong-lensingclusters. we find that the sample of simulated halos which resemble the x-raymorphology of the clash clusters is composed mainly by relaxed halos, but italso contains a significant fraction of un-relaxed systems. for such a samplewe measure an average 2d concentration which is ~11% higher than found for thefull sample of simulated halos. after accounting for projection and selectioneffects, the average nfw concentrations of clash clusters are expected to beintermediate between those predicted in 3d for relaxed and super-relaxed halos.matching the simulations to the individual clash clusters on the basis of thex-ray morphology, we expect that the nfw concentrations recovered from thelensing analysis of the clash clusters are in the range [3-6], with an averagevalue of 3.87 and a standard deviation of 0.61. simulated halos with x-raymorphologies similar to those of the clash clusters are affected by a modestorientation bias.

1409.1598	regulation of star formation in giant galaxies by precipitation,  feedback, and conduction	the universe's largest galaxies reside at the centers of galaxy clusters andare embedded in hot gas that, if left unchecked, would cool prodigiously andcreate many more new stars than are actually observed. cooling can be regulatedby feedback from accretion of cooling gas onto the central black hole, butrequires an accretion rate finely tuned to the thermodynamic state of the hotgas. theoretical models in which cold clouds precipitate out of the hot gas viathermal instability and accrete onto the black hole exhibit the necessarytuning. we have recently presented observational evidence showing that theabundance of cold gas in the central galaxy increases rapidly near thepredicted threshold for instability. here we present observations showing thatthis threshold extends over a large range in cluster radius, cluster mass, andcosmic time, and incorporate the precipitation threshold into a comprehensiveframework of theoretical models for the thermodynamic state of hot gas ingalaxy clusters. according to that framework, precipitation regulates starformation in some giant galaxies, while thermal conduction prevents starformation in others, if it can compensate for radiative cooling and shut offprecipitation.

1409.1601	cooling time, freefall time, and precipitation in the cores of accept  galaxy clusters	star formation in the universe's largest galaxies---the ones at the centersof galaxy clusters---depends critically on the thermodynamic state of their hotgaseous atmospheres. central galaxies with low-entropy, high-densityatmospheres frequently contain multiphase star-forming gas, while those withhigh-entropy, low-density atmospheres never do. the dividing line between thesetwo populations in central entropy, and therefore central cooling time, isamazingly sharp. two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the dichotomy.one points out that thermal conduction can prevent radiative cooling of clustercores above the dividing line. the other holds that cores below the dividingline are subject to thermal instability that fuels the central agn through acold-feedback mechanism. here we explore those hypotheses with an analysis ofthe h-alpha properties of accept galaxy clusters. we find that the twohypotheses are likely to be complementary. our results support a picture inwhich cold clouds inevitably precipitate out of cluster cores in which coolingoutcompetes thermal conduction and rain down on the central black hole, causingagn feedback that stabilizes the cluster core. in particular, the observeddistribution of the cooling-time to freefall-time ratio is nearly identical tothat seen in simulations of this cold-feedback process, implying thatcold-phase accretion, and not bondi-like accretion of hot-phase gas, isresponsible for the agn feedback that regulates star formation in largegalaxies.

1503.02104	supernova sweeping and black-hole feedback in elliptical galaxies	most of the massive elliptical galaxies in the universe stopped forming starsbillions of years ago, even though plenty of hot gas remains available for starformation. here we present compelling evidence indicating that quenching ofstar formation depends on both black-hole feedback and type ia supernovaheating. we analyze chandra x-ray observations of ten massive ellipticals, fivewith extended, potentially star-forming multiphase gas and five single-phaseellipticals with no star formation. the ratio of cooling time to freefall timeat 1--10 kpc in the multiphase galaxies is tc/tff ~10, indicating thatprecipitation-driven feedback limits cooling but does not eliminatecondensation. in the same region of the single-phase galaxies, the radialprofiles of gas entropy are consistent with a thermally stable (tc/tff &gt; 20)supernova-driven outflow that sweeps stellar ejecta out of the galaxy. however,in one of those single-phase ellipticals (ngc 4261) we find tc/tff &lt; 10 at &lt;300 pc. notably, its jets are ~50 times more powerful than in the other nineellipticals, in agreement with models indicating that precipitation near theblack hole should switch its fueling mode from bondi-like accretion to coldchaotic accretion. we conclude by hypothesizing that particularly strongblack-hole outbursts can shut off star formation in massive elliptical galaxiesby boosting the entropy of the hot gas and flipping the system into thesupernova-sweeping state.

1503.08205	a very deep chandra observation of the galaxy group ngc 5813: agn  shocks, feedback, and outburst history	we present results from a very deep (650 ks) chandra x-ray observation of thegalaxy group ngc~5813, the deepest chandra observation of a galaxy group todate. earlier observations showed two pairs of cavities distributed roughlycollinearly, with each pair associated with an elliptical shock front. the newobservations confirm a third pair of outer cavities, collinear with the otherpairs, and reveal an associated outer outburst shock at ~30 kpc. this system istherefore unique in exhibiting three cavity pairs, each associated with anunambiguous agn outburst shock front. the implied mean kinetic power is roughlythe same for each outburst, demonstrating that the average agn kineticluminosity can remain stable over long timescales (~50 myr). the two olderoutbursts have larger, roughly equal total energies as compared with theyoungest outburst, implying that the youngest outburst is ongoing. we find thatthe radiative cooling rate and the mean shock heating rate of the gas are wellbalanced at each shock front, suggesting that agn outburst shock heating aloneis sufficient to offset cooling and establish agn/icm feedback within at leastthe central 30 kpc. this heating takes place roughly isotropically and moststrongly at small radii, as is required for feedback to operate. we suggestthat shock heating may play a significant role in agn feedback at smaller radiiin other systems, where weak shocks are more difficult to detect. we findnon-zero shock front widths that are too large to be explained by particlediffusion. instead, all measured widths are consistent with shock broadeningdue to propagation through a turbulent icm with a mean turbulent speed of ~70km/s. finally, we place lower limits on the temperature of any volume-fillingthermal gas within the cavities that would balance the internal cavity pressurewith the external icm.

0805.2320	chandra studies of the x-ray gas properties of galaxy groups	we present a systematic analysis of 43 galaxy groups (kt_500=0.7-2.7 kev orm_500=10^13-10^14 h^-1 m_solar, 0.012&lt;z&lt;0.12), based on chandra archival data.with robust background subtraction and modeling, we trace gas properties to&gt;r_2500 for all 43 groups. for 23 groups, gas properties can be robustlyderived to or extrapolated to r_500. we show that in spite of the largevariation in t profiles inside 0.15 r_500, the t profiles of these groups aresimilar at &gt;0.15 r_500 and are consistent with a "universal temperatureprofile". we present the entropy-t relations at six characteristics radii (30kpc - r_500), for 43 groups from this work and 14 clusters from vikhlinin etal. (2008). despite large scatter in the entropy values at &lt;0.15 r_500, theintrinsic scatter from r_2500 is much smaller and remains the same (~10%) tor_500. we also present scaling relations for the gas fraction. it appears thatthe average gas fraction between r_2500 and r_500 has no temperaturedependence, ~ 0.12 for 1 - 10 kev systems. the group gas fractions withinr_2500 are generally low and have large scatter. this work shows that thedifference of groups from hotter clusters stems from the difficulty ofcompressing group gas to inside r_2500. the large scatter of the group gasfraction within r_2500 causes large scatter in the group entropy around thecenter and may be responsible for the large scatter of the luminosities.nevertheless, the groups appear more regular and more like clusters beyondr_2500, from the results on gas fraction and entropy. therefore, mass proxiescan be extended into low mass systems. the m-t and m-y relations derived inthis work are indeed well behaved down to at least 2e13 h^-1 m_solar.

astro-ph;9706107	a deep look at the emission-line nebula in abell 2597	the close correlation between cooling flows and emission-line nebulae inclusters of galaxies has been recognized for over a decade and a half, but thephysical reason for this connection remains unclear. here we present deepoptical spectra of the nebula in abell 2597, one of the nearest strongcooling-flow clusters. these spectra reveal the density, temperature, and metalabundances of the line-emitting gas. the abundances are roughly half-solar, anddust produces an extinction of at least a magnitude in v. the absence of [oiii] 4363 emission rules out shocks as a major ionizing mechanism, and theweakness of he ii 4686 rules out a hard ionizing source, such as an activegalactic nucleus or cooling intracluster gas. hot stars are therefore the bestcandidate for producing the ionization. however, even the hottest o starscannot power a nebula as hot as the one we see. some other nonionizing sourceof heat appears to contribute a comparable amount of power. we show that theenergy flux from a confining medium can become important when the ionizationlevel of a nebula drops to the low levels seen in cooling-flow nebulae. wesuggest that this kind of phenomenon, in which energy fluxes from thesurrounding medium augment photoelectric heating, might be the common featureunderlying the diverse group of objects classified as liners.

0706.1220	h-alpha tail, intracluster hii regions and star-formation: eso137-001 in  abell 3627	we present the discovery of a 40 kpc h-alpha tail and at least 29emission-line objects downstream of a star-forming galaxy eso 137-001 in therich, nearby cluster a3627. the galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpcx-ray tail. the detected h-alpha tail coincides positionally with the x-raytail. the h-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front andthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. eso137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously withboth an x-ray tail and an h-alpha tail. the emission-line objects are alldistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc fromthe galaxy. from the analysis on the h-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate ofthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29emission-line objects are hii regions in a3627. the high surface number densityand luminosities of these hii regions (up to 10^40 ergs/s) dwarf the previouslyknown examples of isolated hii regions in clusters. we suggest that starformation may proceed in the stripped ism, in both the galactic halo andintracluster space. the total mass of formed stars in the stripped ism of eso137-001 may approach several times 10^7 solar masses. therefore, stripping ofthe ism not only contributes to the icm, but also adds to the intraclusterstellar light through subsequent star formation. the data also imply that eso137-001 is in an active stage of transformation, accompanied by the build-up ofa central bulge and depletion of the ism.
