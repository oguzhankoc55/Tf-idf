0902.2959	first agile catalog of high confidence gamma-ray sources	we present the first catalog of high-confidence gamma-ray sources detected bythe agile satellite during observations performed from july 9, 2007 to june 30,2008. catalogued sources are detected by merging all the available data overthe entire time period. agile, launched in april 2007, is an asi missiondevoted to gamma-ray observations in the 30 mev - 50 gev energy range, withsimultaneous x-ray imaging capability in the 18-60 kev band. this catalog isbased on gamma-ray imaging detector (grid) data for energies greater than 100mev. for the first agile catalog we adopted a conservative analysis, with ahigh-quality event filter optimized to select gamma-ray events within thecentral zone of the instrument field of view (radius of 40 degrees). this is asignificance-limited (4 sigma) catalog, and it is not a complete flux-limitedsample due to the non-uniform first year agile sky coverage. the catalogincludes 47 sources, 21 of which are associated with confirmed or candidatepulsars, 13 with blazars (7 fsrq, 4 bl lacs, 2 unknown type), 2 with hmxrbs, 2with snrs, 1 with a colliding-wind binary system, 8 with unidentified sources.

0907.2863	ssc radiation in bl lac sources, the end of the tether	the synchrotron-self compton (ssc) radiation process is widely held toprovide a close representation of the double peaked spectral energydistributions from bl lac objects (bl lacs), which are marked by non-thermalbeamed radiations, highly variable on timescales of days or less. theiroutbursts in the gamma ray relative to the optical/x rays might be surmised tobe enhanced in bl lacs as these photons are upscattered via the inverse compton(ic) process. from the observed correlations among the spectral parametersduring optical/x-ray variations we aim at predicting corresponding correlationsin the gamma-ray band, and the actual relations between the gamma-ray and thex-ray variability consistent with the ssc emission process. we start from thehomogeneous single-zone ssc source model, with log-parabolic energiesdistributions of emitting electron as required by the x-ray data of manysources. we find relations among spectral parameters of the ic radiation inboth the thomson (for low energy bl lacs) and the klein-nishina regimes (mainlyfor high energy bl lacs) and we compute how variability is driven by a smoothincrease of key source parameters, primarily the root mean square electronenergy. the single component ssc source model in the thomson regime turns outto be adequate for many lbl sources. however, the simple model meets its limitswith the fast/strong flares recently reported for a few sources in the tevrange; these require sudden accelerations of emitting electrons in a secondsource component.

0909.3484	agile detection of a rapid gamma-ray flare from the blazar pks 1510-089  during the gasp-webt monitoring	we report the detection by the agile satellite of a rapid gamma-ray flarefrom the powerful gamma-ray quasar pks 1510-089, during a pointing centered onthe galactic center region from 1 march to 30 march 2008. this source has beencontinuosly monitored in the radio-to-optical bands by the glast-agile supportprogram (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope (webt). moreover, thegamma-ray flaring episode triggered three too observations by the swiftsatellite in three consecutive days, starting from 20 march 2008. in the period1-16 march 2008, agile detected gamma-ray emission from pks 1510-089 at asignificance level of 6.2-sigma with an average flux over the entire period of(84 +/- 17) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} for photon energies above 100 mev.after a predefined satellite re-pointing, between 17 and 21 march 2008, agiledetected the source at a significance level of 7.3-sigma, with an average flux(e &gt; 100 mev) of (134 +/- 29) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} and a peak levelof (281 +/- 68) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} with daily integration. duringthe observing period january-april 2008, the source also showed an intense andvariable optical activity, with several flaring episodes and a significantincrease of the flux was observed at millimetric frequencies. moreover, in thex-ray band the swift/xrt observations seem to show an harder-when-brighterbehaviour of the source spectrum. the spectral energy distribution of mid-march2008 is modelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self compton emissionplus contributions from inverse compton scattering of external photons fromboth the accretion disc and the broad line region. indeed, some features in theoptical-uv spectrum seem to indicate the presence of seyfert-like components,such as the little blue bump and the big blue bump.

0910.4883	multiwavelength observations of 3c 454.3 ii. the agile 2007 december  campaign	we report on the second agile multiwavelength campaign of the blazar 3c 454.3during the first half of december 2007. this campaign involved agile, spitzer,swift,suzaku,the webt consortium,the rem and mitsume telescopes,offering abroad band coverage that allowed for a simultaneous sampling of the synchrotronand inverse compton (ic) emissions.the 2-week agile monitoring was accompaniedby radio to optical monitoring by webt and rem and by sparse observations inmid-infrared and soft/hard x-ray energy bands performed by means of target ofopportunity observations by spitzer, swift and suzaku, respectively.the sourcewas detected with an average flux of~250x10^{-8}ph cm^-2s^-1 above 100mev,typical of its flaring states.the simultaneous optical and gamma-raymonitoring allowed us to study the time-lag associated with the variability inthe two energy bands, resulting in a possible ~1-day delay of the gamma-rayemission with respect to the optical one. from the simultaneous optical andgamma-ray fast flare detected on december 12, we can constrain the delaybetween the gamma-ray and optical emissions within 12 hours. moreover, weobtain three spectral energy distributions (seds) with simultaneous data for2007 december 5, 13, 15, characterized by the widest multifrequency coverage.we found that a model with an external compton on seed photons by a standarddisk and reprocessed by the broad line regions does not describe in asatisfactory way the seds of 2007 december 5, 13 and 15. an additionalcontribution, possibly from the hot corona with t=10^6 k surrounding the jet,is required to account simultaneously for the softness of the synchrotron andthe hardness of the inverse compton emissions during those epochs.

0910.5344	discovery of extreme particle acceleration in the microquasar cygnus x-3	the study of relativistic particle acceleration is a major topic ofhigh-energy astrophysics. it is well known that massive black holes in activegalaxies can release a substantial fraction of their accretion power intoenergetic particles, producing gamma-rays and relativistic jets. galacticmicroquasars (hosting a compact star of 1-10 solar masses which accretes matterfrom a binary companion) also produce relativistic jets. however, no directevidence of particle acceleration above gev energies has ever been obtained inmicroquasar ejections, leaving open the issue of the occurrence and timing ofextreme matter energization during jet formation. here we report the detectionof transient gamma-ray emission above 100 mev from the microquasar cygnus x-3,an exceptional x-ray binary which sporadically produces powerful radio jets.four gamma-ray flares (each lasting 1-2 days) were detected by the agilesatellite simultaneously with special spectral states of cygnus x-3 during theperiod mid-2007/mid-2009. our observations show that very efficient particleacceleration and gamma-ray propagation out of the inner disk of a microquasarusually occur a few days before major relativistic jet ejections. flaringparticle energies can be thousands of times larger than previously detectedmaximum values (with lorentz factors of 105 and 102 for electrons and protons,respectively). we show that the transitional nature of gamma-ray flares andparticle acceleration above gev energies in cygnus x-3 is clearly linked tospecial radio/x-ray states preceding strong radio flares. thus gamma-raysprovide unique insight into the nature of physical processes in microquasars.

0911.3172	power for dry bl lacertae objects	is it significant that the intrinsic outputs of several bl lacs are observedto level off at values of about 10^46 erg s^-1? in searching for an answer, wecompare gamma-ray observations by the agile satellite of the bl lac s5 0716+714with those of mrk 421 and mrk 501; the former are particularly marked byintense flares up to fluxes of 2 x 10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1 in the 0.1-10 gevenergy range. these "dry" bl lacs show evidence of neither thermal diskemissions nor emission lines signaling any accreting or surrounding gas; thespectral distributions of their pure non-thermal radiations are effectivelyrepresented by the synchrotron self-compton process. with source parameterscorrespondingly derived and tuned with simultaneous multiwavelengthobservations, we find for s5 0716+714 a total jet power of about 3 x 10^45 ergs^-1, which makes it one of the brightest dry bl lacs so far detected in gammarays. we evaluate the mass of the associated kerr hole to be around 5 x 10^8m_sun, implying that the source is significantly gauged in terms of the maximalpower around 4 x 10^45 erg s^-1 extractable via the blandford-znajekelectrodynamical mechanism; other dry bl lacs observed in gamma rays remainwell below that threshold. these findings and those forthcoming from fermi-latwill provide a powerful test of electrodynamics in the surroundings of thehole, that are dominated by gr effects.

0911.3743	temporal properties of gx 301-2 over a year-long observation with  superagile	we present the long-term monitoring of the high mass x-ray binary gx 301-2performed with the superagile instrument on-board the agile mission. the sourcewas monitored in the 20-60 kev energy band during the first year of the missionfrom 2007 july 17 to 2008 august 31, covering about one whole orbital periodand three more pre-periastron passages for a total net observation time ofabout 3.7 ms. the superagile dataset represents one of the most continuous andcomplete monitoring at hard x-ray energies of the 41.5 day long binary periodavailable to date. the source behavior was characterized at all orbital phasesin terms of hard x-ray flux, spectral hardness, spin period history, pulsedfraction and pulse shape profile. we also complemented the superagileobservations with the soft x-ray data of the rossixte/asm. our analysis shows aclear orbital modulation of the spectral hardness, with peaks in correspondencewith the pre-periastron flare and near phase 0.25. the hardness peaks we foundcould be related with the wind-plus-stream accretion model proposed in order toexplain the orbital light curve modulation of gx 301-2. timing analysis of thepulsar spin period shows that the secular trend of the about 680 s pulse periodis consistent with the previous observations, although there is evidence of aslight decrease in the spin-down rate. the analysis of the hard x-ray pulsedemission also showed a variable pulse shape profile as a function of theorbital phase, with substructures detected near the passage at the periastron,and a clear modulation of the pulsed fraction, which appears in turn stronglyanti-correlated with the source intensity.

1001.5150	direct evidence for hadronic cosmic-ray acceleration in the supernova  renmant ic 443	the supernova remnant (snr) ic 443 is an intermediate-age remnant well knownfor its radio, optical, x-ray and gamma-ray energy emissions. in this letter westudy the gamma-ray emission above 100 mev from ic 443 as obtained by the agilesatellite. a distinct pattern of diffuse emission in the energy range 100 mev-3gev is detected across the snr with its prominent maximum (source "a")localized in the northeastern shell with a flux f = (47 \pm 10) 10^{-8} photonscm^{-2} s^{-1} above 100 mev. this location is the site of the strongest shockinteraction between the snr blast wave and the dense circumstellar medium.source "a" is not coincident with the tev source located 0.4 degree away andassociated with a dense molecular cloud complex in the snr central region. fromour observations, and from the lack of detectable diffuse tev emission from itsnortheastern rim, we demonstrate that electrons cannot be the main emitters ofgamma-rays in the range 0.1-10 gev at the site of the strongest snr shock. theintensity, spectral characteristics, and location of the most prominentgamma-ray emission together with the absence of co-spatial detectable tevemission are consistent only with a hadronic model of cosmic-ray accelerationin the snr. a high-density molecular cloud (cloud "e") provides a remarkable"target" for nucleonic interactions of accelerated hadrons: our results showenhanced gamma-ray production near the molecular cloud/shocked shellinteraction site. ic 443 provides the first unambiguous evidence of cosmic-rayacceleration by snrs.

1005.0784	agile detection of gev gamma-ray emission from the snr w28	supernova remnants (snrs) are believed to be the main sources of galacticcosmic rays. molecular clouds associated with snrs can produce gamma-rayemission through the interaction of accelerated particles with the concentratedgas. the middle aged snr w28, for its associated system of dense molecularclouds, provides an excellent opportunity to test this hypothesis. we presentthe agile/grid observations of snr w28, and compare them with observations atother wavelengths (tev and 12co j=1--&gt;0 molecular line emission). the gamma-rayflux detected by agile from the dominant source associated with w28 is (14 +-5) 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for e &gt; 400 mev. this source is positionally wellcorrelated with the tev emission observed by the hess telescope. the localvariations of the gev to tev flux ratio suggest a difference between the crspectra of the north-west and south molecular cloud complexes. a model based ona hadronic-induced interaction and diffusion with two molecular clouds atdifferent distances from the w28 shell can explain both the morphological andspectral features observed by agile in the mev-gev energy range and by the hesstelescope in the tev energy range. the combined set of agile and h.e.s.s. datastrongly support a hadronic model for the gamma-ray production in w28.

1009.0021	agile observations of the "soft" gamma-ray pulsar psr b1509-58	we present the results of new agile observations of psr b1509-58 performedover a period of 2.5 years following the detection obtained with a subset ofthe present data. the modulation significance of the lightcurve above 30 mev isat a 5$\sigma$ confidence level and the lightcurve is similar to those foundearlier by comptel up to 30 mev: a broad asymmetric first peak reaching itsmaximum 0.39 +/- 0.02 cycles after the radio peak plus a second peak at 0.94+/- 0.03. the gamma-ray spectral energy distribution of the pulsed fluxdetected by comptel and agile is well described by a power-law (photon indexalpha=1.87+/-0.09) with a remarkable cutoff at e_c=81 +/- 20 mev, representingthe softest spectrum observed among gamma-ray pulsars so far. the pulsarluminosity at e &gt; 1 mev is $l_{\gamma}=4.2^{+0.5}_{-0.2} \times10^{35}$ erg/s,assuming a distance of 5.2 kpc, which implies a spin-down conversion efficiencyto gamma-rays of $\sim 0.03$. the unusual soft break in the spectrum of psrb1509-58 has been interpreted in the framework of polar cap models as asignature of the exotic photon splitting process in the strong magnetic fieldof this pulsar. in this interpretation our spectrum constrains the magneticaltitude of the emission point(s) at 3 km above the neutron star surface,implying that the attenuation may not be as strong as formerly suggestedbecause pair production can substitute photon splitting in regions of themagnetosphere where the magnetic field becomes too low to sustain photonsplitting. in the case of an outer-gap scenario, or the two pole caustic model,better constraints on the geometry of the emission would be needed from theradio band in order to establish whether the conditions required by the modelsto reproduce agile lightcurves and spectra match the polarization measurements.

1103.3647	agile detection of extreme gamma-ray activity from the blazar pks  1510-089 during march 2009. multifrequency analysis	we report on the extreme gamma-ray activity from the fsrq pks 1510-089observed by agile in march 2009. in the same period a radio-to-opticalmonitoring of the source was provided by the gasp-webt and rem. moreover,several swift too observations were triggered, adding important information onthe source behaviour from optical/uv to hard x-rays. we paid particularattention to the calibration of the swift/uvot data to make it suitable to theblazars spectra. simultaneous observations from radio to gamma rays allowed usto study in detail the correlation among the emission variability at differentfrequencies and to investigate the mechanisms at work. in the period 9-30 march2009, agile detected an average gamma-ray flux of (311+/-21)x10^-8 ph cm^-2s^-1 for e&gt;100 mev, and a peak level of (702+/-131)x10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 ondaily integration. the gamma-ray activity occurred during a period ofincreasing activity from near-ir to uv, with a flaring episode detected on26-27 march 2009, suggesting that a single mechanism is responsible for theflux enhancement observed from near-ir to uv. by contrast, swift/xrtobservations seem to show no clear correlation of the x-ray fluxes with theoptical and gamma-ray ones. however, the x-ray observations show a harderphoton index (1.3-1.6) with respect to most fsrqs and a hint ofharder-when-brighter behaviour, indicating the possible presence of a secondemission component at soft x-ray energies. moreover, the broad band spectrumfrom radio-to-uv confirmed the evidence of thermal features in the optical/uvspectrum of pks 1510-089 also during high gamma-ray state. on the other hand,during 25-26 march 2009 a flat spectrum in the optical/uv energy band wasobserved, suggesting an important contribution of the synchrotron emission inthis part of the spectrum during the brightest gamma-ray flare, therefore asignificant shift of the synchrotron peak.

1104.0115	spectral evolution of the september 2010 gamma-ray flare from the crab  nebula (v2)	strong gamma-ray flares from the crab nebula have been recently discovered byagile and confirmed by fermi-lat. we study here the spectral evolution in thegamma-ray energy range above 50 mev of the september 2010 flare that wassimultaneously detected by agile and fermi-lat. we revisit the agile spectraldata, and present an emission model based on rapid (within 1 day) accelerationfollowed by synchrotron cooling. we show that this model successfully explainsboth the published agile and fermi-lat spectral data showing a rapid rise and adecay within 2-3 days. our analysis constrains the acceleration timescale andmechanism, the properties of the particle distribution function, and the localmagnetic field. the combination of very rapid acceleration, emission well above100 mev, and the spectral evolution consistent with synchrotron coolingcontradicts the idealized scenario predicting an exponential cutoff at photonenergies above 100 mev. we also consider a variation of our model based on evenshorter acceleration and decay timescales which can be consistent with thepublished averaged properties.

1111.4868	neutral pion emission from accelerated protons in the supernova remnant  w44	we present the agile gamma-ray observations in the energy range 50 mev - 10gev of the supernova remnant (snr) w44, one of the most interesting systems forstudying cosmic-ray production. w44 is an intermediate-age snr (20, 000 years)and its ejecta expand in a dense medium as shown by a prominent radio shell,nearby molecular clouds, and bright [sii] emitting regions. we extend ourgamma-ray analysis to energies substantially lower than previous measurementswhich could not conclusively establish the nature of the radiation. we findthat gamma-ray emission matches remarkably well both the position and shape ofthe inner snr shocked plasma. furthermore, the gamma-ray spectrum shows aprominent peak near 1 gev with a clear decrement at energies below a fewhundreds of mev as expected from neutral pion decay. here we demonstrate that:(1) hadron-dominated models are consistent with all w44 multiwavelengthconstraints derived from radio, optical, x-ray, and gamma-ray observations; (2)ad hoc lepton-dominated models fail to explain simultaneously thewell-constrained gamma-ray and radio spectra, and require a circumstellardensity much larger than the value derived from observations; (3) the hadronenergy spectrum is well described by a power-law (with index s = 3.0 \pm 0.1)and a low-energy cut-off at ec = 6 \pm 1 gev. direct evidence for pion emissionis then established in an snr for the first time.

1207.6288	the agile monitoring of cygnus x-3: transient gamma-ray emission and  spectral constraints	we present the agile-grid monitoring of cygnus x-3, during the period betweennovember 2007 and july 2009. we report here the whole agile-grid monitoring ofcygnus x-3 in the agile "pointing" mode data-taking, to confirm that thegamma-ray activity coincides with the same repetitive pattern ofmultiwavelength emission and to analyze in depth the overall gamma-ray spectrumby assuming both leptonic and hadronic scenarios. seven intense gamma-rayevents were detected in this period, with a typical event lasting one or twodays. these durations are longer than the likely cooling times of the gamma-rayemitting particles, implying we see continuous acceleration rather than theresult of an impulsive event such as the ejection of a single plasmoid whichthen cools as it propagates outwards. cross-correlating the agile-grid lightcurve with x-ray and radio monitoring data, we find that the main events ofgamma-ray activity have been detected while the system was in soft spectralx-ray states (rxte/asm count rate &gt; 3 counts/s), that coincide with local andoften sharp minima of the hard x-ray flux (swift/bat count rate &lt; 0.02counts/cm^2/s), a few days before intense radio outbursts. [...] thesegamma-ray events may thus reflect a sharp transition in the structure of theaccretion disk and its corona, which leads to a rebirth of the microquasar jetand subsequent enhanced radio activity. [...] finally, we examine leptonic andhadronic emission models for the gamma-ray events and find that both scenariosare valid. in the leptonic model - based on inverse compton scatterings ofmildly relativistic electrons on soft photons from the wolf-rayet companionstar and from the accretion disk - the emitting particles may also contributeto the overall hard x-ray spectrum, possibly explaining the hard non-thermalpower-law tail sometimes seen during special soft x-ray states in cygnus x-3.

1303.1846	transient gamma-ray emission from cygnus x-3 detected by agile: leptonic  and hadronic emission models	the agile satellite detected several episodes of transient gamma-ray emissionfrom cygnus x-3. cross-correlating the agile light curve with both x-ray andradio monitoring data, we found that the main events of gamma-ray activity weredetected while the system was in soft spectral x-ray states, that coincide withlocal and often sharp minima of the hard x-ray flux, a few days before intenseradio outbursts. this repetitive temporal coincidence between the gamma-raytransient emission and spectral state changes of the source turns out to be thespectral signature of high-energy activity from this microquasar. the gamma-raydifferential spectrum of cygnus x-3 (100 mev - 3 gev), which was obtained byaveraging the data collected by agile during the gamma-ray events, isconsistent with a power law of photon index {\alpha} = 2.0 +/- 0.2. finally, weexamined leptonic and hadronic emission models for the gamma-ray activity andfound that both scenarios are valid. in particular, in the leptonic model -based on inverse compton scatterings of mildly relativistic electrons on softphotons from both the wolf-rayet companion star and the accretion disk - theemitting particles may also contribute to the overall hard x-ray spectrum,possibly explaining the hard non-thermal power-law tail seen during specialsoft x-ray states in cygnus x-3.

1408.1516	the blob crashes into the mirror: modelling the exceptional gamma-ray  flaring activity of 3c 454.3 in november 2010	we focus on the exceptional flaring activity of 3c 454.3 in november 2010 andwe discuss a theoretical framework addressing all data in their overallevolution.  for two weeks the source has shown a plateau of enhanced gev emissionpreceding a sudden major flare lasting about 3 days before decaying. thegamma-ray flare onset is abrupt (about 6 hours), and is characterized by aprominent "compton dominance" with the gev flux exceeding the pre-flare valuesby a factor of 4-5, whereas the optical and x-ray fluxes increased only by afactor 2.  we explore two alternatives. case 1, with high-energy emission originatingwithin the blr; and case 2, with most of it produced outside. we show that case1 has considerable problems in explaining the whole set of multifrequency data.case 2, instead, leads to a consistent and interesting interpretation based onthe enhanced inverse compton radiation that is produced as the jet crashes ontoa mirror cloud positioned at few parsec from the bh. this model explains thegamma-ray vs. optical/x-ray behavior of 3c 454.3, including the otherwisepuzzling phenomena such as the prominent "orphan" optical flare, and theenhanced line emission with no appreciable gamma-ray counterpart that precededthe gev flare. it also accounts for the delayed onset of the latter on top ofthe long plateau. our modelling of the exceptional 3c 454.3 gamma-ray flareshows that, while emission inside the canonical blr is problematic, major andrapid variations can be produced at parsec scales with moderate bulk lorentzfactors $\gamma\approx 15$.

0806.1855	agile and swift simultaneous observations of the blazar s50716+714  during the bright flare of october 2007	we present the results of a series of optical, uv, x-ray and gamma-rayobservations of the bl lac object s50716+714 carried out by the swift and agilesatellites in late 2007 when this blazar was flaring close to its historicalmaximum at optical frequencies. we have found that the optical through softx-ray emission, likely due to synchrotron radiation, was highly variable anddisplayed a different behavior in the optical uv and soft x-ray bands. the 4-10kev flux, most probably dominated by the inverse compton component, remainedinstead constant. the counting statistics in the relatively short agile gridobservation was low and consistent with a constant gamma-ray flux at a levelsimilar to the maximum observed by egret. an estimate of the gamma-ray spectralslope gives a value of the photon index that is close to 2 suggesting that thepeak of the inverse compton component in the spectral energy distribution (sed)is within the agile energy band. the different variability behavior observed indifferent parts of the sed exclude interpretations predicting highly correlatedflux variability like changes of the beaming factor or of the magnetic field insimple ssc scenarios. the observed sed changes may instead be interpreted asdue to the sum of two ssc components, one of which is constant while the otheris variable and with a systematically higher synchrotron peak energy.

astro-ph;0006194	the fall of the quasar population	we derive quantitative predictions of the optical and x-ray luminosityfunctions (lf) for qss in the redshift range $z&lt;3$. based on bh paradigm, weinvestigate how the accretion is controlled by the surrounding structures, asthese grow hierarchically. we argue that for $z &lt; 3$ efficient black holefueling is triggered by the encounters of a gas-rich host with its companionsin a group. the dispersion of the dynamical parameters in the encountersproduces a double power-law lf. strong luminosity evolution (le) is produced asthese encounters deplete the gas supply in the host; an additional, milderdensity evolution obtains since the interactions become progressively rarer asthe groups grow richer but less dense. from the agreement with the optical andthe x-ray data, we conclude that the evolution of the bright quasars isarticulated in two ways. earlier than $z~3$ the gas-rich protogalaxies grow bymerging, which also induces parallel growth of central holes accreting ateddington rates. in the later era of group assemblage the host encounters withcompanions drive onto already existing holes further but meager accretion;these consume the gas in the hosts, and cause supply-limited emissions whichare intermittent, go progressively sub-eddington and peter out. then otherfueling processes come to the foreground; we discuss the faint emissions,especially noticeable in x-rays, which are expected when hosts in the fieldcannibalize satellite galaxies with their meager gas contents.

astro-ph;0303332	quasar evolution driven by galaxy encounters in hierarchical structures	we link the evolution of the galaxies in the hierarchical clustering scenariowith the changing accretion rates of cold gas onto the central massive blackholes that power the quasars. we base on galaxy interactions as main triggersof accretion; the related scaling laws are taken up from cavaliere &amp; vittorini(2000), and grafted to a semi-analytic code for galaxy formation. as a result,at high $z$ the protogalaxies grow rapidly by hierarchical merging; meanwhile,much fresh gas is imported and also destabilized, so the holes are fueled attheir full eddington rates. at lower $z$ the galactic dynamical events aremostly encounters in hierarchically growing groups; now the refueling petersout, as the residual gas is exhausted while the destabilizing encountersdwindle. so, with no parameter tuning other than needed for stellarobservables, our model uniquely produces at $z&gt;3$ a rise, and at $z\lesssim 2.5$ a decline of the bright quasar population as steep as observed. in addition,our results closely fit the observed luminosity functions of quasars, theirspace density at different magnitudes from $z\approx 5$ to $z\approx 0$, andthe local $m_{bh}-\sigma$ relation.

0808.3464	long-term agile monitoring of the puzzling gamma-ray source 3eg  j1835+5918	we present the agile gamma-ray observations of the field containing thepuzzling gamma-ray source 3eg j1835+5918. this source is one of the mostremarkable unidentified egret sources. an unprecedentedly long agile monitoringof this source yields important information on the positional error box, fluxevolution, and spectrum. 3eg j1835+5918 has been in the agile field of viewseveral times in 2007 and 2008 for a total observing time of 138 days from 2007sept 04 to 2008 june 30 encompassing several weeks of continuous coverage. withan exposure time approximately twice that of egret, agile confirms theexistence of a prominent gamma-ray source (agl j1836+5926) at a positionconsistent with that of egret, although with a remarkably lower average fluxvalue for photon energies greater than 100 mev. a 5-day bin temporal analysisof the whole data set of agl j1836+5926 shows some evidence for variability ofthe gamma-ray flux. the source spectrum between 100 mev and 1 gev can be fittedwith a power law with photon index in the range 1.6-1.7, fully consistent withthe egret value. the faint x-ray source rx j1836.2+5925 that has been proposedas a possible counterpart of 3eg j1835+5918 is well within the agile error box.future continuous monitoring (both by agile and glast) is needed to confirm thegamma-ray flux variability and to unveil the source origin, a subject that iscurrently being pursued through a multiwavelength search for counterparts.

astro-ph;0508640	the impact of energy feedback on quasar evolution and black hole  demographics	we investigate how accretion episodes onto massive black holes power quasarsand agn while they accumulate mass into the holes. we compute both the trendand the stochastic component to the trigger of the accretion events, asprovided by structure buildup after the hierarchical paradigm. we base on hostgalaxy evolution proceeding from the protogalactic era at redshifts z &gt; 2.5dominated by major merging events in high density regions, to the subsequentera marked by galaxy-galaxy interactions in newly forming groups. thesedynamical events perturb the gravitational equilibrium of the gas reservoir inthe hosts, and trigger recurrent accretion episodes controlled by energyfeedback from the very source emission onto the surrounding gas. depletion ofthe latter by these events (adding to quiescent star formation) concurs withthe slowing down of the clustering to cause a fast drop of the activity indense regions. meanwhile, in the "field" later and rarer events are triggeredby interactions of still gas-rich galaxies, and eventually by captures of dwarfsatellite galaxies; these are also included in our analytic model. thus wecompute the quasar and agn luminosity functions; we find these to brighten andrise from z ~ 6 to z ~ 2.5, and then toward z ~ 0 to dim and fall somewhat, indetailed agreement with the observations. we predict that for z &lt; 2.5 the massdistribution of the holes progressively rises and shifts rightwards; we compareour results with the local data. we also find that downward of z ~ 2.5 theeddington ratios related to emitting, most massive holes drift below unity onaverage, with a widening scatter; meanwhile, some smaller holes flare up closerto the eddington limit.

0809.1737	multiwavelength observations of 3c 454.3. i. the agile 2007 november  campaign on the "crazy diamond"	[abridged] we report on a multiwavelength observation of the blazar 3c 454.3(which we dubbed "crazy diamond") carried out on november 2007 by means of theastrophysical satellites agile, integral, swift, the webt consortium, and theoptical-nir telescope rem. 3c 454.3 is detected at a $\sim 19-\sigma$ levelduring the 3-week observing period, with an average flux above 100 mev of$f_{\rm e&gt;100mev} = (170 \pm 13) \times 10^{-8}$ \phcmsec. the gamma-rayspectrum can be fit with a single power-law with photon index $\gamma_{\rmgrid} = 1.73 \pm 0.16$ between 100 mev and 1 gev. we detect significantday-by-day variability of the gamma-ray emission during our observations, andwe can exclude that the fluxes are constant at the 99.6% ($\sim 2.9 \sigma$)level. the source was detected typically around 40 degrees off-axis, and it wassubstantially off--axis in the field of view of the agile hard x-ray imager.however, a 5-day long too observation by integral detected 3c 454.3 at anaverage flux of about $f_{\rm 20-200 kev} = 1.49 \times 10^{-3}$ \phcmsec withan average photon index of $\gamma_{\rm ibis} = 1.75 \pm 0.24$ between 20--200kev. swift also detected 3c 454.3 with a flux in the 0.3--10 kev energy band inthe range $(1.23-1.40) \times 10^{-2}$ \phcmsec{} and a photon index in therange $\gamma_{\rm xrt} = 1.56-1.73$. in the optical band, both webt and remshow an extremely variable behavior in the $r$ band. a correlation analysisbased on the entire data set is consistent with no time-lags between thegamma-ray and the optical flux variations. our simultaneous multifrequencyobservations strongly indicate that the dominant emission mechanism between 30mev and 30 gev is dominated by inverse compton scattering of relativisticelectrons in the jet on the external photons from the broad line region.

0809.3917	gamma-ray burst detection with the agile mini-calorimeter	the mini-calorimeter (mcal) instrument on-board the agile satellite is anon-imaging gamma-ray scintillation detector sensitive in the 300kev-100mevenergy range with a total on-axis geometrical area of 1400cm^2. gamma-raybursts (grbs) are one of the main scientific targets of the agile mission andthe mcal design as an independent self-triggering detector makes it a valuableall-sky monitor for grbs. furthermore mcal is one of the very few operativeinstruments with microsecond timing capabilities in the mev range. in thispaper the results of grb detections with mcal after one year of operation inspace are presented and discussed. a flexible trigger logic implemented in theagile payload data-handling unit allows the on-board detection of grbs. fortriggered events, energy and timing information are sent to telemetry on aphoton-by-photon basis, so that energy and time binning are limited by countingstatistics only. when the trigger logic is not active, grbs can be detectedoffline in ratemeter data, although with worse energy and time resolution.between the end of june 2007 and june 2008 mcal detected 51 grbs, with adetection rate of about 1 grb/week, plus several other events at a fewmilliseconds timescales. since february 2008 the on-board trigger logic hasbeen fully active. comparison of mcal detected events and data provided byother space instruments confirms the sensitivity and effective areaestimations. mcal also joined the 3rd inter-planetary network, to contribute togrb localization by means of triangulation.

0811.0593	high energy variability of 3c 273 during the agile multiwavelength  campaign of december 2007 - january 2008	we report the results of a 3-weeks multi-wavelength campaign on the flatspectrum radio quasar 3c 273 carried out with the agile gamma-ray mission,covering the 30 mev -50 gev and 18-60 kev, the rem observatory (covering thenear-ir and optical), swift (near-uv/optical, 0.2-10 kev and 15-50 kev),integral (3 - 200 kev) and rossi xte (2-12 kev). this is the firstobservational campaign including gamma-ray data, after the last egretobservations, more than 8 years ago. our study was carried out usingsimultaneous light curves of the source flux from all the involved instruments,in the different energy ranges, in search for correlated variability. then atime-resolved sed was used for a detailed physical modelling of the emissionmechanisms. the source was detected in gamma-rays only in the second week ofour campaign. we found indication of a possible anti-correlation between theemission at gamma-rays and at soft and hard x-rays, supported by the completeset of instruments. instead, optical data do not show short term variability.only in two egret observations (in 1993 and 1997) 3c 273 showedintra-observation variability in gamma-rays. the sed with almost simultaneousdata, partially covers the regions of the synchrotron emission, the big bluebump, and the inverse-compton. the soft x-ray emission is consistent withcombined ssc and ec mechanisms, while hard x and gamma-ray emissions arecompatible with ec from thermal photons of the disk. the time evolution of thesed is well interpreted and modelled in terms of an acceleration episode of theelectrons population, leading to a shift in the ic peak towards higherenergies.
