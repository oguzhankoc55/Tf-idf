0901.3388	a search for molecular gas toward a bzk-selected star-forming galaxy at  z = 2.044	we present a search for co(3-2) emission in sdf-26821, a bzk-selectedstar-forming galaxy (sbzk) at z = 2.044, using the 45-m telescope of thenobeyama radio observatory and the nobeyama millimeter array. we do not detectsignificant emission and derive 2 \sigma limits: the co luminosity of l'co &lt;3.1 x 10^10 k km s^{-1} pc^{-2}, the ratio of far-infrared luminosity to columinosity of l_fir/l'co &gt; 57 lsun (k km s^{-1} pc^{-2})^{-1}, and themolecular gas mass of m_h2 &lt; 2.5 x 10^10 msun, assuming a velocity width of 200km s^{-1} and a co-to-h2 conversion factor of alpha_co=0.8 msun (k km s^{-1}pc^{-2})^{-1}. the ratio of l_fir/l'co, a measure of star formation efficiency(sfe), is comparable to or higher than the two z ~ 1.5 sbzks detected inco(2-1) previously, suggesting that sbzks can have a wide range of sfes.comparisons of far-infrared luminosity, gas mass, and stellar mass among thesbzks suggest that sdf-26821 is at an earlier stage of forming stars with asimilar sfe and/or more efficiently forming stars than the two z ~ 1.5 sbzks.the higher sfes and specific star formation rates of the sbzks compared tolocal spirals are indicative of the difference in star formation modes betweenthese systems, suggesting that sbzks are not just scaled-up versions of localspirals.

0902.2064	photometric h alpha and [o ii] luminosity function of sdf and sxdf  galaxies: implications for future baryon oscillation surveys	efficient selection of emission line galaxies at z &gt; 1 by photometricinformation in wide field surveys is one of the keys for future spectroscopicsurveys to constrain dark energy using the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao)signature. here we estimate the h alpha and [o ii] line luminosity functions ofgalaxies at z = 0.5-1.7 using a novel approach where multi-wavelength imagingdata is used to jointly estimate both photometric redshifts and star-formationrates. these photometric estimates of line luminosities at high-redshift usethe large data sets of the subaru deep field and subaru xmm-newton deep field(covering \sim 1 deg^2) and are calibrated with the spectroscopic data of thelocal sloan digital sky survey galaxies. the derived luminosity functions(especially h alpha) are in reasonable agreement with the past estimates basedon spectroscopic or narrow-band-filter surveys. this dataset is useful forexamining the photometric selection of target galaxies for bao surveys becauseof the large cosmological volume covered and the large number of galaxies withdetailed photometric information. we use the sample to derive the photometricand physical properties of emission line galaxies to assist planning for futurespectroscopic bao surveys. we also show some examples of photometric selectionprocedures which can efficiently select these emission line galaxies.

0902.4712	lyman break galaxies at z~1.8-2.8: galex/nuv imaging of the subaru deep  field	abridged: a photometric sample of ~7100 v&lt;25.3 lyman break galaxies (lbgs)has been selected by combining subaru/suprime-cam bvrci'z' data with deepgalex/nuv imaging of the subaru deep field. follow-up spectroscopy confirmed 24lbgs at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.7. among the optical spectra, 12 have ly-alpha emission withrest-frame equivalent widths of ~5-60aa. the success rate for identifying lbgsas nuv-dropouts at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.7 is 86%. the rest-frame uv (1700aa) luminosityfunction (lf) is constructed from the photometric sample with corrections forstellar contamination and z&lt;1.5 interlopers. the lf is 1.7+/-0.1 times higherthan those of z~2 bxs and z~3 lbgs. three explanations were considered, and itis argued that significantly underestimating low-z contamination or effectivecomoving volume is unlikely: the former would be inconsistent with thespectroscopic sample at 93% confidence, and the second explanation would notresolve the discrepancy. the third scenario is that different photometricselection of the samples yields non-identical galaxy populations, such thatsome bx galaxies are lbgs and vice versa. this argument is supported by ahigher surface density of lbgs at all magnitudes while the redshiftdistribution of the two populations is nearly identical. this study, whencombined with other star-formation rate (sfr) density uv measurements from lbgsurveys, indicates that there is a rise in the sfr density: a factor of 3-6(3-10) increase from z~5 (z~6) to z~2, followed by a decrease to z~0. thisresult, along with past sub-mm studies that find a peak at z~2 in theirredshift distribution, suggest that z~2 is the epoch of peak star-formation.additional spectroscopy is required to characterize the complete shape of thez~2 lbg uv lf via measurements of contamination and accurate distances.

0908.3191	large area survey for z=7 galaxies in sdf and goods-n: implications for  galaxy formation and cosmic reionization	we present results of our large-area survey for z'-band dropout galaxies atz=7 in a 1568 arcmin^2 sky area covering the sdf and goods-n fields. combiningour ultra-deep subaru/suprime-cam z'- and y-band (lambda_eff=1um) images withlegacy data of subaru and hst, we have identified 22 bright z-dropout galaxiesdown to y=26, one of which has a spectroscopic redshift of z=6.96 determinedfrom lya emission. the z=7 luminosity function (lf) yields the best-fitschechter parameters of phi*=0.69 +2.62/-0.55 x10^(-3) mpc^(-3), muv*=-20.10+/-0.76 mag, and alpha=-1.72 +/-0.65, and indicates a decrease from z=6 at a&gt;95% confidence level. this decrease is beyond the cosmic variance in our twofields, which is estimated to be a factor of &lt;~2. we have found that the cosmicstar formation rate density drops from the peak at z=2-3 to z=7 roughly by afactor of ~10 but not larger than ~100. a comparison with the reionizationmodels suggests either that the universe could not be totally ionized by onlygalaxies at z=7, or more likely that properties of galaxies at z=7 aredifferent from those at low redshifts having, e.g., a larger escape fraction(&gt;~0.2), and/or a flatter imf. our sdf z-dropout galaxies appear to form 60-mpclong filamentary structures, and the z=6.96 galaxy with lya emission is locatedat the center of an overdense region consisting of four uv bright dropoutcandidates, which might suggest an existence of a well-developed ionized bubbleat z=7.

0707.1561	the reionization and galaxy evolution probed by z=7 lyman alpha emitters	we made a narrowband nb973 (bandwidth of 200a at 9755a) imaging of the subarudeep field (sdf) and found two z=7 lyman alpha emitter (lae) candidates down tonb973=24.9. carrying out deep follow-up spectroscopy, we identified one of themas a real z=6.96 lae. this has shown that galaxy formation was in progress just750 myr after the big bang. meanwhile, the lyman alpha line luminosity functionof lae is known to decline from z=5.7 to 6.6 in the sdf. l* at z=6.6 is 40-60%of that at z=5.7. we also confirm that the number density of z=7 lae is only17% of the density at z=6.6 comparing the latest sdf lae samples. this seriesof significant decreases in lae density with increasing redshift can be theresult of galaxy evolution during these epochs. however, using the uv continuumluminosity functions of laes, those of lyman break galaxies, and a laeevolution model based on the hierarchical clustering, we find that galaxyevolution alone cannot explain all the decrease in density. this extra densitydeficit can be interpreted as the attenuation of the lyman alpha photons fromlaes due to a rapid evolution of neutral hydrogen fraction during the ongoingcosmic reionization at z~6.6-7.

0911.2530	high star formation activity in the central region of a distant cluster  at z=1.46	we present an unbiased deep [oii] emission survey of a cluster xmmxcsj2215.9-1738 at z=1.46, the most distant cluster to date with a detection ofextended x-ray emission. with wide-field optical and near-infrared cameras(suprime-cam and moircs, respectively) on subaru telescope, we performed deepimaging with a narrow-band filter nb912 (lambda_c=9139a, delta_lambda=134a) aswell as broad-band filters (b, z', j and ks). from the photometric catalogues,we have identified 44 [oii] emitters in the cluster central region of 6'x6'down to a dust-free star formation rate of 2.6 msun/yr (3 sigma).interestingly, it is found that there are many [oii] emitters even in thecentral high density region. in fact, the fraction of [oii] emitters to thecluster members as well as their star formation rates and equivalent widthsstay almost constant with decreasing cluster-centric distance up to the clustercore. unlike clusters at lower redshifts (z&lt;1) where star formation activity ismostly quenched in their central regions, this higher redshift 2215 clustershows its high star formation activity even at its centre, suggesting that weare beginning to enter the formation epoch of some galaxies in the cluster coreeventually. moreover, we find a deficit of galaxies on the red sequence atmagnitudes fainter than ~m*+0.5 on the colour-magnitude diagram. this breakmagnitude is brighter than that of lower redshift clusters, and it is likelythat we are seeing the formation phase of more massive red galaxies in thecluster core at z~1. these results may indicate inside-out and down-sizingpropagation of star formation activity in the course of cluster evolution.

0911.2544	stellar populations of lyman alpha emitters at z = 3 - 4 based on deep  large area surveys in the subaru-sxds/ukidss-uds field	we investigate the stellar populations of lyman alpha emitters (laes) atz=3.1 and 3.7 in 0.65 deg^2 of the subaru/xmm-newton deep field, based onrest-frame uv-to-optical photometry obtained from the subaru/xmm-newton deepsurvey, the ukidss/ultra deep survey, and the spitzer legacy survey of theukidss/uds. among a total of 302 laes (224 for z=3.1 and 78 for z=3.7), only 11are detected in the k band, i.e., brighter than k(3sigma)=24.1 mag. eight ofthe 11 k-detected laes are spectroscopically confirmed. we find that thek-undetected objects, which should closely represent the lae population as awhole, have low stellar masses of ~ 10^8 - 10^8.5 msun, modest sfrs of 1 - 100msun yr^-1, and modest dust extinction of e(b-v) &lt; 0.2. the k-detected objectsare massive, mstar ~ 10^9 - 10^10.5 msun, and have significant dust extinctionwith a median of e(b-v) ~= 0.3. four k-detected objects with the reddestspectral energy distributions, two of which are spectroscopically confirmed,are heavily obscured with e(b-v) ~ 0.65, and their continua resemble those ofsome local ulirgs. interestingly, they have large lyman alpha equivalent widths~= 70 - 250 a. if these four are excluded, our sample has a weakanti-correlation between ew(lya) and mstar. we compare the stellar masses andthe specific star formation rates (ssfr) of laes with those of lyman-breakgalaxies, distant red galaxies, submillimetre galaxies, and i- or k-selectedgalaxies with z_phot ~ 3. we find that the lae population is the least massiveamong all the galaxy populations in question, but with relatively high ssfrs,while nir-detected laes have mstar and ssfr similar to lbgs. our reddest fourlaes have very high ssfrs in spite of large mstar, thus occupying a uniqueregion in the mstar versus ssfr space.

0912.2786	panoramic h-alpha and mid-infrared mapping of star formation in a z=0.8  cluster	we present the first wide-field h-alpha imaging survey around the distantcluster rxj1716.4+6708 at z=0.81 with a narrow-band filter on moircs/subaru,down to sfr(ha)~1msun/yr. combining with a wide-field mir imaging survey withakari, we compare the unobscured and obscured star formation activities in thecluster. we find that both h-alpha emitters and mir galaxies avoid the clustercentre and their spatial distribution is quite similar. most of the h-alphaemitters show blue colours, but we find some h-alpha emitters on the redsequence. the mir galaxies tend to be systematically redder than the h-alphaemitters probably due to heavy dust extinction. interestingly, the red h-alphaemitters and the red mir galaxies (i.e. dusty red galaxies) are most commonlyseen in the medium-density environment such as cluster outskirts, groups andfilaments, where optical colours of galaxies change. we also find that a(ha)exceeds ~3 in extreme cases and that such very dusty galaxies are also locatedin the medium-density environment. these findings suggest that dusty starformation is triggered in the in-fall region of the cluster, implying aprobable link between galaxy transition and dusty star formation. we finallycalculate the cluster total sfr and find that the cluster total sfr based onh-alpha alone can be underestimated more than factor ~2 even after 1 magextinction correction. we suggest that the mass-normalized cluster sfr rapidlydeclines since z~1 following ~(1+z)^6, although the uncertainty is still large.

1004.0963	stellar populations of lyman alpha emitters at z~6-7: constraints on the  escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxy building blocks	we investigate the stellar populations of lyman alpha emitters (laes) atz=5.7 and 6.6 in a 0.65 deg^2 sky of the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds)field, using deep images taken with subaru/suprime-cam, ukirt/wfcam, andspitzer/irac. we produce stacked multiband images at each redshift from 165(z=5.7) and 91 (z=6.6) irac-undetected objects, to derive typical spectralenergy distributions (seds) of z~6-7 laes for the first time. the stacked laeshave as blue uv continua as the hst/wfc3 z-dropout galaxies of similar muv,with a spectral slope beta ~ -3, but at the same time they have reduv-to-optical colors with detection in the 3.6um band. using sed fitting wefind that the stacked laes have low stellar masses of ~(3-10)*10^7 msun, veryyoung ages of ~1-3 myr, negligible dust extinction, and strong nebular emissionfrom the ionized interstellar medium, although the z=6.6 object is fittedsimilarly well with high-mass models without nebular emission; inclusion ofnebular emission reproduces the red uv-to-optical color while keeping the uvcolor sufficiently blue. we infer that typical laes at z~6-7 are buildingblocks of galaxies seen at lower redshifts. we find a tentative decrease in thelyman alpha escape fraction from z=5.7 to 6.6, which may imply an increase inthe intergalactic medium neutral fraction. from the minimum contribution ofnebular emission required to fit the observed seds, we place an upper limit onthe escape fraction of ionizing photons to be f_esc^ion~0.6 at z=5.7 and ~0.9at z=6.6. we also compare the stellar populations of our laes with that ofstacked hst/wfc3 z-dropout galaxies.

1008.4837	spitzer space telescope constraint on the stellar mass of a z = 6.96  lyman alpha emitter	we obtained mid-infrared 3.6 and 4.5 micron imaging of a z=6.96 lyman alphaemitter (lae) iok-1 discovered in the subaru deep field, using spitzer spacetelescope infrared array camera observations. after removal of a nearby brightsource, we find that iok-1 is not significantly detected in any of theseinfrared bands to m_3.6 ~ 24.00 and m_4.5 ~ 23.54 at 3 sigma. fittingpopulation synthesis models to the spectral energy distribution consisting ofthe upper limit fluxes of the optical to infrared non-detection images andfluxes in detection images, we constrain the stellar mass m* of iok-1. this laecould have either a mass as low as m* &lt;~ 2-9 x 10^8 msun for the young age (&lt;~10 myr) and the low dust reddening (a_v ~ 0) or a mass as large as m* &lt;~ 1-4 x10^{10} msun for either the old age (&gt; 100 myr) or the high dust reddening (a_v~ 1.5). this would be within the range of masses of z ~ 3-6.6 laes studied todate, ~ 10^6-10^{10} msun. hence, iok-1 is not a particularly unique galaxywith extremely high mass or low mass but is similar to one of the laes seen atthe later epochs.

1008.4842	lyman alpha emitters at z=7 in the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey field:  photometric candidates and luminosity function	we conducted a deep narrowband nb973 (fwhm = 200 a centered at 9755 a) surveyof z=7 lyman alpha emitters (laes) in the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey field,using the fully depleted ccds newly installed on the subaru telescopesuprime-cam, which is twice more sensitive to z=7 lyman alpha at ~ 1 micronthan the previous ccds. reaching the depth 0.5 magnitude deeper than ourprevious survey in the subaru deep field that led to the discovery of a z=6.96lae, we detected three probable z=7 lae candidates. even if all the candidatesare real, the lyman alpha luminosity function (lf) at z=7 shows a significantdeficit from the lf at z=5.7 determined by previous surveys. the lae number andlyman alpha luminosity densities at z=7 is ~ 7.7-54% and ~5.5-39% of those atz=5.7 to the lyman alpha line luminosity limit of l(ly-alpha) &gt;~ 9.2 x 10^{42}erg s^{-1}. this could be due to evolution of the lae population at theseepochs as a recent galaxy evolution model predicts that the lae modestlyevolves from z=5.7 to 7. however, even after correcting for this effect ofgalaxy evolution on the decrease in lae number density, the z=7 lyman alpha lfstill shows a deficit from z=5.7 lf. this might reflect the attenuation oflyman alpha emission by neutral hydrogen remaining at the epoch of reionizationand suggests that reionization of the universe might not be complete yet atz=7. if we attribute the density deficit to reionization, the intergalacticmedium (igm) transmission for lyman alpha photons at z=7 would be 0.4 &lt;=t_{ly-alpha}^{igm} &lt;= 1, supporting the possible higher neutral fraction at theearlier epochs at z &gt; 6 suggested by the previous surveys of z=5.7-7 laes, z ~6 quasars and z &gt; 6 gamma-ray bursts.

1104.2330	completing the census of ly-alpha emitters at the reionization epoch	we carried out extended spectroscopic confirmations of ly-alpha emitters(laes) at z=6.5 and 5.7 in the subaru deep field. now, the total number ofspectroscopically confirmed laes is 45 and 54 at z=6.5 and 5.7, respectively,and at least 81% (70%) of our photometric candidates at z=6.5 (5.7) have beenspectroscopically identified as real laes. we made careful measurements of thely-alpha luminosity, both photometrically and spectroscopically, to accuratelydetermine the ly-alpha and rest-uv luminosity functions (lfs). thesubstantially improved evaluation of the ly-alpha lf at z=6.5 shows an apparentdeficit from z=5.7 at least at the bright end, and a possible decline even atthe faint end, though small uncertainties remain. the rest-uv lfs at z=6.5 and5.7 are in good agreement, at least at the bright end, in clear contrast to thedifferences seen in the ly-alpha lf. these results imply an increase in theneutral fraction of the intergalactic medium from z=5.7 to 6.5. the rest-frameequivalent width (ew_0) distribution at z=6.5 seems to be systematicallysmaller than z=5.7, and it shows an extended tail toward larger ew_0. thebright end of the rest-uv lf can be reproduced from the observed ly-alpha lfand a reasonable ew_0-uv luminosity relation. integrating this rest-uv lfprovides the first measurement of the contribution of laes to the photon budgetrequired for reionization. the derived uv lf suggests that the fractionalcontribution of laes to the photon budget among lyman break galaxiessignificantly increases towards faint magnitudes. low-luminosity laes coulddominate the ionizing photon budget, though this inference depends strongly onthe uncertain faint-end slope of the ly-alpha lf.

1104.5019	a census of star-forming galaxies at z = 1-3 in the subaru deep field	several uv and near-infrared color selection methods have identified galaxiesat z = 1-3. since each method suffers from selection biases, we have appliedthree leading techniques (lyman break, bx/bm, and bzk selection) simultaneouslyin the subaru deep field. this field has reliable ({\delta}z/(1 + z) =0.02--0.09) photometric redshifts for ~53,000 galaxies from 20 bands(1500{\aa}--2.2{\mu}m). the bzk, lbg, and bx/bm samples suffer contaminationfrom z&lt;1 interlopers of 6%, 8%, and 20%, respectively. around the redshiftswhere it is most sensitive (z~1.9 for star-forming bzk, z~1.8 for z~2 lbgs,z~1.6 for bm, and z~2.3 for bx), each technique finds 60-80% of the census ofthe three methods. in addition, each of the color techniques shares 75-96% ofits galaxies with another method, which is consistent with previous studiesthat adopt identical criteria on magnitudes and colors. combining the threesamples gives a comprehensive census that includes ~90% of z-phot = 1-3galaxies, using standard magnitude limits similar to previous studies. in fact,we find that among z = 1-2.5 galaxies in the color selection census, 81-90% ofthem can be selected by just combining the bzk selection with one of the uvtechniques (z~2 lbg or bx and bm). the average galaxy stellar mass, reddeningand sfrs all decrease systematically from the sbzk population to the lbgs, andto the bx/bms. the combined color selections yield a total cosmic sfr densityof 0.18 $\pm$ 0.03 m_sun yr^{-1} mpc^{-3} for k_ab &lt;= 24. we find that 65% ofthe star formation is in galaxies with e(b-v) &gt; 0.25 mag, even though they areonly one-fourth of the census by number.

0710.0632	dependence of the build-up of the colour-magnitude relation on cluster  richness at z ~ 0.8	we present environmental dependence of the build-up of the colour-magnituderelation (cmr) at z ~ 0.8. it is well established that massive early-typegalaxies exhibit a tight cmr in clusters up to at least z ~ 1. the faint end ofthe relation, however, has been much less explored especially at high redshiftsprimarily due to limited depths of the data. some recent papers have reported adeficit of the faint red galaxies on the cmr at 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1, but this has notbeen well confirmed yet and is still controversial. using a deep, multi-colour,panoramic imaging data set of the distant cluster rxj1716.4+6708 at z=0.81,newly taken with the prime focus camera (suprime-cam) on the subaru telescope,we carry out an analysis of faint red galaxies with a care for incompleteness.we find that there is a sharp decline in the number of red galaxies toward thefaint end of the cmr below m*+2. we compare our result with those for otherclusters at z ~ 0.8 taken from the literature, which show or do not show thedeficit. we suggest that the "deficit" of faint red galaxies is dependent onthe richness or mass of the clusters, in the sense that poorer systems showstronger deficits. this indicates that the evolutionary stage of less massivegalaxies depends critically on environment.

1107.3159	spectroscopic confirmation of three z-dropout galaxies at z = 6.844 -  7.213: demographics of lyman-alpha emission in z ~ 7 galaxies	we present the results of our ultra-deep keck/deimos spectroscopy ofz-dropout galaxies in the sdf and goods-n. for 3 out of 11 objects, we detectan emission line at ~ 1um with a signal-to-noise ratio of ~ 10. the lines showasymmetric profiles with high weighted skewness values, consistent with beinglya, yielding redshifts of z=7.213, 6.965, and 6.844. specifically, we confirmthe z=7.213 object in two independent deimos runs with different spectroscopicconfigurations. the z=6.965 object is a known lya emitter, iok-1, for which ourimproved spectrum at a higher resolution yields a robust skewness measurement.the three z-dropouts have lya fluxes of 3 x 10^-17 erg s^-1 cm^-2 andrest-frame equivalent widths ew_0^lya = 33-43a. based on the largestspectroscopic sample of 43 z-dropouts that is the combination of our andprevious data, we find that the fraction of lya-emitting galaxies (ew_0^lya &gt;25a) is low at z ~ 7; 17 +- 10% and 24 +- 12% for bright (muv ~= -21) and faint(muv ~= -19.5) galaxies, respectively. the fractions of lya-emitting galaxiesdrop from z ~ 6 to 7 and the amplitude of the drop is larger for faint galaxiesthan for bright galaxies. these two pieces of evidence would indicate that theneutral hydrogen fraction of the igm increases from z ~ 6 to 7, and that thereionization proceeds from high- to low-density environments, as suggested byan inside-out reionization model.

1109.0023	keck spectroscopy of lyman-break galaxies and its implications for the  uv-continuum and ly_alpha luminosity functions at z&gt;6	we present keck spectroscopic observations of z&gt;6 lyman-break galaxy (lbg)candidates in the subaru deep field (sdf). the candidates were selected asi'-dropout objects down to z'=27 ab magnitudes from an ultra-deep sdf z'-bandimage. with the keck spectroscopy we identified 19 lbgs with prominent ly_alphaemission lines at 6&lt; z &lt; 6.4. the median value of the ly_alpha rest-frameequivalent widths (ews) is ~50 a, with four ews &gt;100 a. this well-definedspectroscopic sample spans a uv-continuum luminosity range of -21.8&lt;m_{uv}&lt;-19.5 (0.6~5 l*_{uv}) and a ly_alpha luminosity range of (0.3~3) x10^{43} erg s^{-1} (0.3~3 l*_ {ly_alpha}). we derive the uv and ly_alphaluminosity functions (lfs) from our sample at &lt;z&gt;~6.2 after we correct forsample incompleteness. we find that our measurement of the uv lf is consistentwith the results of previous studies based on photometric lbg samples at 5&lt;z&lt;7.our ly_alpha lf is also generally in agreement with the results ofly_alpha-emitter surveys at z~5.7 and 6.6. this study shows that deepspectroscopic observations of lbgs can provide unique constraints on both theuv and ly_alpha lfs at z&gt;6.

1112.3997	the first systematic survey for lyman alpha emitters at z=7.3 with  red-sensitive subaru/suprime-cam	we have performed deep imaging surveys for lya emitters (laes) at redshift~7.3 in two blank fields, the subaru deep field (sdf) and the subaru/xmm-newtondeep survey field (sxdf), using the subaru/suprime-cam equipped with newred-sensitive ccds and a new narrow-band filter, nb1006 (lambda_c=10052 ang,fwhm=214 ang). we identified four objects as lae candidates that exhibitluminosity excess in nb1006. by carrying out deep follow-up spectroscopy forthree of them using subaru/focas and keck/deimos, a definitively asymmetricemission line is detected for one of them, sxdf-nb1006-2. assuming this line islya, this object is a lae at z=7.215 which has luminosity of 1.2^{+1.5}_{-0.6}x 10^43 [erg s-1] and a weighted skewness s_w=4.90+-0.86. another object,sdf-nb1006-2, shows variable photometry and is thus probably a quasar (qso) oran active galactic nucleus (agn). it shows an asymmetric emission line at 10076ang, which may be due to either lya at z=7.288 or [oii] at z=1.703. the thirdobject, sdf-nb1006-1, is likely a galaxy with temporal luminosity enhancementassociated with a supernova explosion, as the brightness of this object variesbetween the observed epochs. its spectrum does not show any emission lines. theinferred decrease in the number density of laes toward higher redshift isn_lya(z=7.3)/n_lya(z=5.7) = 0.05^+0.11_-0.05 from z=5.7 to 7.3 down tol(lya)=1.0 x 10^43 [erg s-1]. the present result is consistent with theinterpretation in previous studies that the neutral hydrogen fraction israpidly increasing from z=5.7 to 7.3.

1202.0278	dust attenuation and h-alpha star formation rates of z~0.5 galaxies	using deep narrow-band and broad-band imaging, we identify 401 z~0.40 and 249z~0.49 h-alpha line-emitting galaxies in the subaru deep field. compared toother h-alpha surveys at similar redshifts, our samples are unique since theyprobe lower h-alpha luminosities, are augmented with multi-wavelength(rest-frame 1000aa--1.5 microns) coverage, and a large fraction (20%) of oursamples has already been spectroscopically confirmed. our spectra allow us tomeasure the balmer decrement for nearly 60 galaxies with h-beta detected above5-sigma. the balmer decrements indicate an average extinction ofa(h-alpha)=0.7^{+1.4}_{-0.7} mag. we find that the balmer decrementsystematically increases with higher h-alpha luminosities and with largerstellar masses, in agreement with previous studies with sparser samples. wefind that the sfrs estimated from modeling the spectral energy distribution(sed) is reliable---we derived an "intrinsic" h-alpha luminosity which is thenreddened assuming the color excess from sed modeling. the sed-predicted h-alphaluminosity agrees with h-alpha narrow-band measurements over 3 dex (rms of 0.25dex). we then use the sed sfrs to test different statistically-based dustcorrections for h-alpha and find that adopting one magnitude of extinction isinappropriate: galaxies with lower luminosities are less reddened. we find thatthe luminosity-dependent dust correction of hopkins et al. yields consistentresults over 3 dex (rms of 0.3 dex). our comparisons are only possible byassuming that stellar reddening is roughly half of nebular reddening. thestrong correspondence argue that with sed modeling, we can derive reliableintrinsic sfrs even in the absence of h-alpha measurements at z~0.5.

1203.1326	discovery of a protocluster at z~6	we report the discovery of a protocluster at z~6 containing at least eightcluster member galaxies with spectroscopic confirmations in the wide-fieldimage of the subaru deep field (sdf). the overdensity of the protocluster issignificant at the 6 sigma level, based on the surface number density ofi'-dropout galaxies. the overdense region covers ~36 sq. arcmin, and includes30 i'-dropout galaxies. follow-up spectroscopy revealed that 15 of these arereal z~6 galaxies (5.7 &lt; z &lt; 6.3). eight of the 15 are clustering in a narrowredshift range centered at z=6.01, corresponding to a seven-fold increase innumber density over the average in redshift space. we found no significantdifference in the observed properties, such as ly-alpha luminosities and uvcontinuum magnitudes, between the eight protocluster members and the sevennon-members. the velocity dispersion of the eight protocluster members is 647km/s, which is about three times higher than that predicted by the standardcold dark matter model. this discrepancy could be attributed to thedistinguishing three-dimensional distribution of the eight protoclustermembers. we discuss two possible explanations for this discrepancy: either theprotocluster is already mature, with old galaxies at the center, or it is stillimmature and composed of three subgroups merging to become a larger cluster. ineither case, this concentration of z=6.01 galaxies in the sdf may be one of thefirst sites of formation of a galaxy cluster in the universe.

1206.2316	gas motion study of lya emitters at z~2 using uv and optical spectral  lines	we present the results of magellan/mmirs and keck/nirspec spectroscopy forfive lya emitters (laes) at z=2.2 for which high-resolution fuv spectra frommagellan/mage are available. we detect nebular emission lines including ha onthe individual basis and low-ionization interstellar (lis) absorption lines ina stacked fuv spectrum, and measure average offset velocities of the lya line,delta_v_lya, and lis absorption lines, delta_v_abs, with respect to thesystemic velocity defined by the nebular lines. for a sample of eight z~2-3laes without agn from our study and the literature, we obtain delta_v_lya =175+/-35 km s^{-1}, which is significantly smaller than that of lyman-breakgalaxies (lbgs), delta_v_lya=400 km s^{-1}. the stacked fuv spectrum givesdelta_v_abs = -179 +/- 73 km s^{-1}, comparable to that of lbgs. these positivedelta_v_lya and negative delta_v_abs suggest that laes also have outflows. incontrast to lbgs, however, the laes' delta_v_lya is as small as |delta_v_abs|,suggesting low neutral hydrogen column densities. such a low column densitywith a small number of resonant scattering may cause the observed strong lyaemission of laes. we find an anti-correlation between lya equivalent width (ew)and delta_v_lya in a compilation of lae and lbg samples. although its physicalorigin is not clear, this anti-correlation result appears to challenge thehypothesis that a strong outflow, by means of a reduced number of resonantscattering, produces a large ew. if laes at z&gt;6 have similarly smalldelta_v_lya values, constraints on the reionization history derived from thelya transmissivity may need to be revised.

1206.4303	the stellar population and star formation rates of z~1.5-1.6 [o ii]  emitting galaxies selected from narrow-band emission-line surveys	we present the first detailed study of the stellar populations ofstar-forming galaxies at z~1.5, which are selected by their [o ii] emissionline, detected in narrow-band surveys. we identified ~1,300 [o ii] emitters atz=1.47 and z=1.62 in the subaru deep field with rest-frame ews above 13\aa.optical and near-infrared spectroscopic observations for ~10% of our samplesshow that our separation of [o ii] from [o iii] emission-line galaxies intwo-color space is 99% successful. we analyze the multi-wavelength propertiesof a subset of ~1,200 galaxies with the best photometry. they have averagerest-frame ew of 45\aa, stellar mass of 3 x 10^9 m_sun, and stellar age of 100myr. in addition, our sed fitting and broad-band colors indicate that [o ii]emitters span the full range of galaxy populations at z~1.5. we also find that80% of [o ii] emitters are also photometrically classified as "bx/bm" (uv)galaxies and/or the star-forming "bzk" (near-ir) galaxies. our [o ii] emissionline survey produces a far more complete, and somewhat deeper sample of z~1.5galaxies than either the bx/bm or sbzk selection alone. we constructed averageseds and find that higher [o ii] ew galaxies have somewhat bluer continua. sedmodel-fitting shows that they have on average half the stellar mass of galaxieswith lower [o ii] ew. the observed [o ii] luminosity is well-correlated withthe far-uv continuum with a logarithmic slope slightly 0f 0.89\pm0.22. thescatter of the [o ii] luminosity against the far-uv continuum suggests that [oii] can be used as a sfr indicator with a reliability of 0.23 dex.

1208.3260	first spectroscopic evidence for high ionization state and low oxygen  abundance in lya emitters	we present results from keck/nirspec and magellan/mmirs follow-upspectroscopy of lya emitters (laes) at z=2.2 identified in our subarunarrowband survey. we successfully detect ha emission from seven laes, andperform a detailed analysis of six laes free from agn activity, two out ofwhich, cdfs-3865 and cosmos-30679, have [oii] and [oiii] line detections. theyare the first [oii]-detected laes at high-z, and their [oiii]/[oii] ratios andr23-indices provide the first simultaneous determinations of ionizationparameter and oxygen abundance for laes. cdfs-3865 has a very high ionizationparameter (q_{ion}=2.5^{+1.7}_{-0.8}x10^8 cm s^{-1}) and a low oxygen abundance(12+log(o/h)=7.84^{+0.24}_{-0.25}) in contrast with moderate values of otherhigh-z galaxies such as lyman-break galaxies (lbgs). cosmos-30679 alsopossesses a relatively high ionization parameter (q_{ion}=8^{+10}_{-4}x10^7 cms^{-1}) and a low oxygen abundance (12+log(o/h)=8.18^{+0.28}_{-0.28}). bothlaes appear to fall below the mass-metallicity relation of z~2 lbgs. similarly,a low metallicity of 12+log(o/h)&lt;8.4 is independently indicated for typicallaes from a composite spectrum and the [nii]/ha index. such high ionizationparameters and low oxygen abundances can be found in local star-forminggalaxies, but this extreme local population occupies only ~0.06% of the sdssspectroscopic galaxy sample with a number density ~100 times smaller than thatof laes. with their high ionization parameters and low oxygen abundances, laeswould represent an early stage of galaxy formation dominated by massive starsin compact star-forming regions. high-q_{ion} galaxies like laes would produceionizing photons efficiently with a high escape fraction achieved bydensity-bounded hii regions, which would significantly contribute to cosmicreionization at z&gt;6.

1210.4933	a ly-alpha emitter with an extremely large rest-frame equivalent width  of ~900a at z=6.5: a candidate of population iii-dominated galaxy?	we have identified a very interesting ly-alpha emitter, whose ly-alphaemission line has an extremely large observed equivalent width ofew_0=436^{+422}_{-149}a, which corresponds to an extraordinarily largeintrinsic rest-frame equivalent width of ew_0^{int}=872^{+844}_{-298}a afterthe average intergalactic absorption correction. the object wasspectroscopically confirmed to be a real ly-alpha emitter by its apparentasymmetric ly-alpha line profile detected at z=6.538. the continuum emission ofthe object was definitely detected in our deep z'-band image; thus, its ew_0was reliably determined. follow-up deep near-infrared spectroscopy revealedemission lines of neither he ii lambda1640 as an apparent signature ofpopulation iii, nor c iv lambda1549 as a proof of active nucleus. no detectionof short-lived he ii lambda1640 line is not necessarily inconsistent with theinterpretation that the underlying stellar population of the object isdominated by population iii. we found that the observed extremely large ew_0 ofthe ly-alpha emission and the upper limit on the ew_0 of the he ii lambda1640emission can be explained by population synthesis models favoring a very youngage less than 2-4myr and massive metal-poor (z&lt;10^{-5}) or even metal-freestars. the observed large ew_0 of ly-alpha is hardly explained by populationi/ii synthesis models with z&gt;10^{-3}. however, we cannot conclusively rule outthe possibility that this object is composed of a normal stellar populationwith a clumpy dust distribution, which could enhance the ly-alpha ew_0, thoughits significance is still unclear.

1212.3869	evolution of the sizes of galaxies over 7&lt;z&lt;12 revealed by the 2012  hubble ultra deep field campaign	we analyze the redshift- and luminosity-dependent sizes of dropout galaxycandidates in the redshift range z~7-12 using deep images from the udf12campaign, data which offers two distinct advantages over that used in earlierwork. firstly, we utilize the increased s/n ratio offered by the udf12 imagingto provide improved size measurements for known galaxies at z=6.5-8 in thehudf. specifically, we stack the new deep f140w image with the existing f125wdata in order to provide improved measurements of the half-light radii ofz-dropouts. similarly we stack this image with the new deep udf12 f160w imageto obtain new size measurements for a sample of y-dropouts. secondly, becausethe udf12 data have allowed the construction of the first robust galaxy samplein the hudf at z&gt;8, we have been able to extend the measurement of averagegalaxy size out to significantly higher redshifts. restricting our sizemeasurements to sources which are now detected at &gt;15sigma, we confirm earlierindications that the average half-light radii of z~7-12 galaxies are extremelysmall, 0.3-0.4 kpc, comparable to the sizes of giant molecular associations inlocal star-forming galaxies. we also confirm that there is a clear trend ofdecreasing half-light radius with increasing redshift, and provide the firstevidence that this trend continues beyond z~8. modeling the evolution of theaverage half-light radius as a power-law (1+z)^s, we obtain a best-fit index ofs=-1.28+/-0.13 over the redshift range z~4-12, mid-way between the physicallyexpected evolution for baryons embedded in dark halos of constant mass (s=-1)and constant velocity (s=-1.5). a clear size-luminosity relation, such as thatfound at lower redshift, is also evident in both our z- and y-dropout sample.this relation can be interpreted in terms of a constant surface density of starformation over a range in luminosity of 0.05-1.0l*_z=3.(abridged)

1303.0024	physical properties of spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at z &gt;= 6.  i. basic characteristics of the rest-frame uv continuum and lyman-alpha  emission	we present deep hst near-ir and spitzer mid-ir observations of a large sampleof spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at z &gt;= 6. the sample consists of 51lyman-alpha emitters (laes) at z ~ 5.7, 6.5, and 7.0, and 16 lyman-breakgalaxies (lbgs) at 5.9 &lt; z &lt; 6.5. the near-ir images were mostly obtained withwfc3 in the f125w and f160w bands, and the mid-ir images were obtained withirac in the 3.6um and 4.5um bands. our galaxies also have deep optical imagingdata from subaru suprime-cam. we utilize the multi-band data and secureredshifts to derive their rest-frame uv properties. these galaxies have steepuv continuum slopes roughly between beta ~ -1.5 and -3.5, with an average valueof beta ~ -2.3, slightly steeper than the slopes of lbgs in previous studies.the slope shows little dependence on uv continuum luminosity except for a fewof the brightest galaxies. we find a statistically significant excess ofgalaxies with slopes around beta ~ -3, suggesting the existence of very youngstellar populations with extremely low metallicity and dust content. ourgalaxies have moderately strong rest-frame lyman-alpha equivalent width (ew) ina range of ~10 to ~200 \aa. the star-formation rates are also moderate, from afew to a few tens solar masses per year. the laes and lbgs in this sample sharemany common properties, implying that laes represent a subset of lbgs withstrong lyman-alpha emission. finally, the comparison of the uv luminosityfunctions between laes and lbgs suggests that there exists a substantialpopulation of faint galaxies with weak lyman-alpha emission (ew &lt; 20 \aa) thatcould be the dominant contribution to the total ionizing flux at z &gt;= 6.

1303.0118	probing of the interactions between the hot plasmas and galaxies in  clusters from z=0.1 to 0.9	based on optical and x-ray data for a sample of 34 relaxed rich clusters ofgalaxies with redshifts of 0.1-0.9, we studied relative spatial distributionsof the two major baryon contents, the cluster galaxies and the hot plasmas.using multi-band photometric data taken with the uh88 telescope, we determinedthe integrated (two dimensional) radial light profiles of member galaxies ineach cluster using two independent approaches, i.e., the background subtractionand the color-magnitude filtering. the icm mass profile of each cluster in oursample, also integrated in two dimensions, was derived from aspatially-resolved spectral analysis using xmm-newton and chandra data. then,the radially-integrated light profile of each cluster was divided by its icmmass profile, to obtain a profile of "galaxy light vs. icm mass ratio". theratio profiles over the central 0.65 r500 regions were found to steepen fromthe higher- to lower- redshift subsamples, meaning that the galaxies becomemore concentrated in the icm sphere towards lower redshifts. the evolution isalso seen in galaxy number vs. icm mass ratio profiles. a range of systematicuncertainties in the galaxy light measurements, as well as manyradius-/redshift- dependent biases to the galaxy vs. icm profiles have beenassessed, but none of them is significant against the observed evolution.besides, the galaxy light vs. total mass ratio profiles also exhibit gradualconcentration towards lower redshift. we interpret in the context that thegalaxies, the icm, and the dark matter components followed a similar spatialdistribution in the early phase (z&gt;0.5), while the galaxies have fallen towardsthe center relative to the others at a later phase.

1307.7712	"direct" gas-phase metallicities, stellar properties, and local  environments of emission-line galaxies at redshift below 0.90	using deep narrow-band (nb) imaging and optical spectroscopy from the kecktelescope and mmt, we identify a sample of 20 emission-line galaxies (elgs) atz=0.065-0.90 where the weak auroral emission line, [oiii]4363, is detected at&gt;3\sigma. these detections allow us to determine the gas-phase metallicityusing the "direct'' method. with electron temperature measurements and dustattenuation corrections from balmer decrements, we find that 4 of theselow-mass galaxies are extremely metal-poor with 12+log(o/h) &lt;= 7.65 orone-tenth solar. our most metal-deficient galaxy has 12+log(o/h) =7.24^{+0.45}_{-0.30} (95% confidence), similar to some of the lowestmetallicity galaxies identified in the local universe. we find that ourgalaxies are all undergoing significant star formation with average specificstar formation rate (sfr) of (100 myr)^{-1}, and that they have high centralsfr surface densities (average of 0.5 msun/yr/kpc^2. in addition, more thantwo-thirds of our galaxies have between one and four nearby companions within aprojected radius of 100 kpc, which we find is an excess among star-forminggalaxies at z=0.4-0.85. we also find that the gas-phase metallicities for agiven stellar mass and sfr lie systematically below the local m-z-(sfr)relation by \approx0.2 dex (2\sigma\ significance). these results are partlydue to selection effects, since galaxies with strong star formation and lowmetallicity are more likely to yield [oiii]4363 detections. finally, theobserved higher ionization parameter and electron density suggest that they arelower redshift analogs to typical z&gt;1 galaxies.

0801.4827	the subaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds) -vii. clustering segregation  with ultraviolet and optical luminosities of lyman-break galaxies at z~3	we investigate clustering properties of lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) at z~3based on deep multi-waveband imaging data from optical to near-infraredwavelengths in the subaru/xmm-newton deep field. the lbgs are selected by u-vand v-z' colors in one contiguous area of 561 arcmin^2 down to z'=25.5. westudy the dependence of the clustering strength on rest-frame uv and opticalmagnitudes, which can be indicators of star formation rate and stellar mass,respectively. the correlation length is found to be a strong function of bothuv and optical magnitudes with brighter galaxies being more clustered thanfaint ones in both cases. furthermore, the correlation length is dependent on acombination of uv and optical magnitudes in the sense that galaxies bright inoptical magnitude have large correlation lengths irrespective of uv magnitude,while galaxies faint in optical magnitude have correlation lengths decreasingwith decreasing uv brightness. these results suggest that galaxies with largestellar masses always belong to massive halos in which they can have variousstar formation rates, while galaxies with small stellar masses reside in lessmassive halos only if they have low star formation rates. there appears to bean upper limit to the stellar mass and the star formation rate which isdetermined by the mass of hosting dark halos.

1401.1209	what is the physical origin of strong lya emission? i. demographics of  lya emitter structures	we present the results of structure analyses for a large sample of 426 lyaemitters (laes) at z~2.2 that are observed with hst/acs and wfc3-ir by deepextra-galactic legacy surveys. we confirm that the merger fraction and theaverage ellipticity of lae's stellar component are 10-30 % and 0.4-0.6,respectively, that are comparable with previous study results. we successfullyidentify that some laes have a spatial offset between lya and stellar-continuumemission peaks, d_lya, by ~2.5-4 kpc beyond our statistical errors. to uncoverthe physical origin of strong lya emission found in laes, we investigate lyaequivalent width (ew) dependences of these three structural parameters, mergerfraction, d_lya, and ellipticity of stellar distribution in the range ofew(lya)=20-250a. contrary to expectations, we find that merger fraction doesnot significantly increase with lya ew. we reveal an anti-correlation betweend_lya and ew(lya) by kolmogorov-smirnov (ks) test. there is a trend that thelaes with a large lya ew have a small ellipticity. this is consistent with therecent theoretical claims that lya photons can more easily escape from face-ondisks having a small ellipticity, due to less inter-stellar gas along the lineof sight, although our ks test indicates that this trend is not statisticallysignificant. our results of lya-ew dependence generally support the idea thatan hi column density is a key quantity determining lya emissivity.

1402.1168	what is the physical origin of strong lya emission? ii. gas kinematics  and distribution of lya emitters	we present a statistical study of velocities of lya, interstellar (is)absorption, and nebular lines and gas covering fraction for lya emitters (laes)at z~2. we make a sample of 22 laes with a large lya equivalent width (ew) of &gt;50a based on our deep keck/lris observations, in conjunction with spectroscopicdata from the subaru/fmos program and the literature. we estimate the averagevelocity offset of lya from a systemic redshift determined with nebular linesto be dv_lya=234+-9 km s-1. using a kolmogorv-smirnov test, we confirm theprevious claim of hashimoto et al. (2013) that the average dv_lya of laes issmaller than that of lbgs. our lris data successfully identify blue-shiftedmultiple is absorption lines in the uv continua of four laes on an individualbasis. the average velocity offset of is absorption lines from a systemicredshift is dv_is=204+-27 km s-1, indicating lae's gas outflow with a velocitycomparable to typical lbgs. thus, the ratio, r^lya_ is = dv_lya/dv_is of laes,is around unity, suggestive of low impacts on lya transmission by resonantscattering of neutral hydrogen in the is medium. we find an anti-correlationbetween lya ew and the covering fraction, f_c, estimated from the depth ofabsorption lines, where f_c is an indicator of average neutral hydrogen columndensity, n_hi. the results of our study support the idea that n_hi is a keyquantity determining lya emissivity.

1403.0732	diffuse lyman-alpha halos around galaxies at z=2.2-6.6: implications for  galaxy formation and cosmic reionization	we present diffuse lyman-alpha halos (lahs) identified in the compositesubaru narrowband images of 100-3600 lyman-alpha emitters (laes) at z=2.2, 3.1,3.7, 5.7, and 6.6. first, we carefully examine potential artifacts mimickinglahs that include a large-scale point-spread function (psf) made byinstrumental and atmospheric effects. based on our critical test with compositeimages of non-lae samples whose narrowband-magnitude and source-sizedistributions are the same as our lae samples, we confirm that no artifacts canproduce a diffuse extended feature similar to our lahs. after this test, wemeasure the scale lengths of exponential profile for the lahs estimated fromour z=2.2-6.6 lae samples of l(lyman-alpha) &gt; 2 x 10^42 erg s^-1. we obtain thescale lengths of ~ 5-10 kpc at z=2.2-5.7, and find no evolution of scalelengths in this redshift range beyond our measurement uncertainties. combiningthis result and the previously-known uv-continuum size evolution, we infer thatthe ratio of lah to uv-continuum sizes is nearly constant at z=2.2-5.7. thescale length of our z=6.6 lah is larger than 5-10 kpc just beyond the errorbar, which is a hint that the scale lengths of lahs would increase from z=5.7to 6.6. if this increase is confirmed by future large surveys with significantimprovements of statistical and systematical errors, this scale length changeat z &gt; 6 would be a signature of increasing fraction of neutral hydrogenscattering lyman-alpha photons, due to cosmic reionization.

1404.6066	accelerated evolution of ly$\alpha$ luminosity function at $\textit{z}  \gtrsim 7$ revealed by the subaru ultra-deep survey for ly$\alpha$ emitters  at $\textit{z}=7.3$	we present the ultra-deep subaru narrowband imaging survey for lya emitters(laes) at $z=7.3$ in sxds and cosmos fields with a total integration time of106 hours. exploiting our new sharp bandwidth filter, nb101, installed onsuprime-cam, we have reached $l(lya)=2.4\times10^{42} \ erg \ s^{-1}$($5\sigma$) for $z=7.3$ laes, about 4 times deeper than previous subaru $z\gtrsim 7$ studies, which allows us to reliably investigate evolution of lyaluminosity function (lf), for the first time, down to the luminosity limit sameas those of subaru $z=3.1-6.6$ lae samples. surprisingly, we only find threeand four laes in sxds and cosmos fields, respectively, while one expects atotal of $\sim 65$ laes by our survey in the case of no lya lf evolution from$z=6.6$ to $7.3$.we identify a decrease of lya lf from $z=6.6$ to $7.3$ at the$&gt;90\%$ confidence level from our $z=7.3$ lya lf.moreover, the evolution of lyalf is clearly accelerated at $z&gt;6.6$ beyond the measurement uncertaintiesincluding cosmic variance. because no such accelerated evolution ofuv-continuum lf or cosmic star-formation rate (sfr) is found at $z\sim 7$, butsuggested only at $z&gt;8$ (oesch et al. 2013, bouwens et al. 2014), thisaccelerated lya lf evolution is explained by physical mechanisms different froma pure sfr decrease but related to lya production and escape in the process ofcosmic reionization. because a simple accelerating increase of igm neutralhydrogen absorbing lya would not reconcile with thomson scattering opticaldepth measurements from wmap and planck, our findings may support new physicalpictures suggested by recent theoretical studies, such as the existence of hiclumpy clouds within cosmic ionized bubbles selectively absorbing lya and thelarge ionizing photon escape fraction of galaxies making weak lya emission.

1404.7656	large-scale environment of z~5.7 civ absorption systems i: projected  distribution of galaxies	metal absorption systems are products of star formation. they are believed tobe associated with massive star forming galaxies, which have significantlyenriched their surroundings. to test this idea with high column density civabsorption systems at z~5.7, we study the projected distribution of galaxiesand characterise the environment of civ systems in two independent quasarlines-of-sight: j103027.01+052455.0 and j113717.73+354956.9. using wide fieldphotometry (~80x60h$^{-1}$ comoving mpc), we select bright (muv(1350\aa)&lt;-21.0mag.) lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z~5.7 in a redshift slice \delta z~0.2 andwe compare their projected distribution with z~5.7 narrow-band selected lymanalpha emitters (laes, \delta z~0.08).  we find that the civ systems are located more than 10h$^{-1}$ projectedcomoving mpc from the main concentrations of lbgs and no candidate is closerthan ~5h$^{-1}$ projected comoving mpc. in contrast, an excess of laes -lowermass galaxies- is found on scales of ~10h$^{-1}$ comoving mpc, suggesting thatlaes are the primary candidates for the source of the civ systems. furthermore,the closest object to the system in the field j1030+0524 is a faint lae at aprojected distance of 212h$^{-1}$ physical kpc. however, this work cannot ruleout undiscovered lower mass galaxies as the origin of these absorption systems.  we conclude that, in contrast with lower redshift examples (z&lt;3.5), strongciv absorption systems at z~5.7 trace low-to-intermediate density environmentsdominated by low-mass galaxies. moreover, the excess of laes associated withhigh levels of ionizing flux agrees with the idea that faint galaxies dominatethe ionizing photon budget at this redshift.

1407.1851	a first site of galaxy cluster formation: complete spectroscopy of a  protocluster at $z=6.01$	we performed a systematic spectroscopic observation of a protocluster at$z=6.01$ in the subaru deep field. we took spectroscopy for all 53 $i'$-dropoutgalaxies down to $z'=27.09\,\mathrm{mag}$ in/around the protocluster region.from these observations, we confirmed that 28 galaxies are at $z\sim6$, ofwhich ten are clustered in a narrow redshift range of $\delta z&lt;0.06$. to tracethe evolution of this primordial structure, we applied the same $i'$-dropoutselection and the same overdensity measurements used in the observations to asemi-analytic model built upon the millennium simulation. we obtain a relationbetween the significance of overdensities observed at $z\sim6$ and thepredicted dark matter halo mass at $z=0$. this protocluster with $6\sigma$overdensity is expected to grow into a galaxy cluster with a mass of$\sim5\times10^{14}\,\mathrm{m_\odot}$ at $z=0$. ten galaxies within$10\,\mathrm{comoving\&gt;mpc}$ of the overdense region can, with more than an 80%probability, merge into a single dark matter halo by $z=0$. no significantdifferences appeared in uv and ly$\alpha$ luminosities between the protoclusterand field galaxies, suggesting that this protocluster is still in the earlyphase of cluster formation before the onset of any obvious environmentaleffects. however, further observations are required to study other properties,such as stellar mass, dust, and age. we do find that galaxies tend to be inclose pairs in this protocluster. these pair-like subgroups will coalesce intoa single halo and grow into a more massive structure. we may witness an onsetof cluster formation at $z\sim6$ toward a cluster as seen in local universe.

1408.6903	hubble frontier fields first complete cluster data: faint galaxies at  $z\sim 5-10$ for uv luminosity functions and cosmic reionization	we present the comprehensive analyses of faint dropout galaxies up to$z\sim10$ with the first full-depth data set of abell 2744 lensing cluster andparallel fields observed by the hubble frontier fields (hff) program. weidentify $54$ dropouts at $z\sim5-10$ in the hff fields, and enlarge the sizeof $z\sim9$ galaxy sample obtained to date. although the number of highlymagnified ($\mu\sim10$) galaxies is small due to the tiny survey volume ofstrong lensing, our study reaches the galaxies' intrinsic luminositiescomparable to the deepest-field hudf studies. we derive uv luminosity functionswith these faint dropouts, carefully evaluating the combination ofobservational incompleteness and lensing effects in the image plane byintensive simulations including magnification, distortion, and multiplicationof images, with the evaluations of mass model dependences. our results confirmthat the faint-end slope, $\alpha$, is as steep as $-2$ at $z\sim6-8$, andstrengthen the evidence of the rapid decrease of uv luminosity densities,$\rho_\mathrm{uv}$, at $z&gt;8$ from the large $z\sim9$ sample. we examine whetherthe rapid $\rho_\mathrm{uv}$ decrease trend can reconcile with the largethomson scattering optical depth, $\tau_\mathrm{e}$, measured by cmbexperiments allowing a large space of free parameters such as average ionizingphoton escape fraction and stellar-population dependent conversion factor. noparameter set can reproduce both the rapid $\rho_\mathrm{uv}$ decrease and thelarge $\tau_\mathrm{e}$. it is possible that the $\rho_\mathrm{uv}$ decreasemoderates at $z\gtrsim11$, that the free parameters significantly evolvetowards high-$z$, or that there exist additional sources of reionization suchas x-ray binaries and faint agns.

1410.1535	the sizes of $z\sim6-8$ lensed galaxies from the hubble frontier fields  abell 2744 data	we investigate sizes of $z\sim6-8$ dropout galaxies using the complete dataof the abell 2744 cluster and parallel fields in the hubble frontier fieldsprogram. by directly fitting light profiles of observed galaxies withlensing-distorted s\'ersic profiles on the image plane with the \texttt{glafic}software, we accurately measure intrinsic sizes of 31 $z\sim6-7$ and eight$z\sim8$ galaxies, including those as faint as $m_{\mathrm{uv}}\simeq-16.6$. wefind that half-light radii $r_\mathrm{e}$ positively correlates with uvluminosity at each redshift, although the correlation is not very tight.largest ($r_\mathrm{e}&gt;0.8$ kpc) galaxies are mostly red in uv color whilesmallest ($r_\mathrm{e} &lt; 0.08$ kpc) ones tend to be blue. we also find thatgalaxies with multiple cores tend to be brighter. combined with previousresults at $2.5\lesssim z\lesssim12$, our result confirms that the average$r_{\mathrm{e}}$ of bright ($(0.3-1)l^\star_{z=3}$) galaxies scales as$r_{\mathrm{e}}\propto(1+z)^{-m}$ with $m=1.24\pm0.1$. we find that the ratioof $r_\mathrm{e}$ to virial radius is virtually constant at $3.3\pm0.1\%$ overa wide redshift range, where the virial radii of hosting dark matter halos arederived based on the abundance matching. this constant ratio is consistent withthe disk formation model by mo et al. (1998) with $j_\mathrm{d}\simm_\mathrm{d}$, where $j_\mathrm{d}$ and $m_\mathrm{d}$ are the fractions of theangular momentum and mass within halos confined in the disks. a comparison withvarious types of local galaxies indicates that our galaxies are most similar tocircumnuclear star-forming regions of barred galaxies in the sense that asizable amount of stars are forming in a very small area.

1410.7401	the subaru high-z quasar survey: discovery of faint z~6 quasars	we present the discovery of one or two extremely faint z~6 quasars in 6.5deg^2 utilizing a unique capability of the wide-field imaging of thesubaru/suprime-cam. the quasar selection was made in (i'-z_b) and (z_b-z_r)colors, where z_b and z_r are bandpasses with central wavelengths of 8842a and9841a, respectively. the color selection can effectively isolate quasars at z~6from m/l/t dwarfs without the j-band photometry down to z_r&lt;24.0, which is 3.5mag. deeper than sdss. we have selected 17 promising quasar candidates. thefollow-up spectroscopy for seven targets identified one apparent quasar atz=6.156 with m_1450=-23.10. we also identified one possible quasar at z=6.041with a faint continuum of m_1450=-22.58 and a narrow lyman-alpha emission withhwhm=427 km/s, which cannot be distinguished from lyman-alpha emitters. wederive the quasar luminosity function at z~6 by combining our faint quasarsample with the bright quasar samples by sdss and cfhqs. including our datapoints invokes a higher number density in the faintest bin of the quasarluminosity function than the previous estimate employed. this suggests asteeper faint-end slope than lower-z, though it is yet uncertain based on asmall number of spectroscopically identified faint quasars and several quasarcandidates are still remain to be diagnosed. the steepening of the quasarluminosity function at the faint-end does increase the expected emission rateof the ionizing photon, however, it only changes by a factor of ~2-6. this wasfound to be still insufficient for the required photon budget of reionizationat z~6.

1411.1615	first infrared-based implications for the dust attenuation and star  formation of typical ly$\alpha$ emitters	by stacking publicly available deep spitzer/mips 24 $\mu$m and herschel/pacsimages for 213 $z \simeq 2.18$ ly$\alpha$ emitters (laes) in goods-south, weobtain a strong upper limit to the ir luminosity of typical laes and discusstheir attenuation curve for the first time. the $3\sigma$ upper limit $l_{\rmtir}^{3\sigma}= 1.1 \times 10^{10} l_\odot$, determined from the mips dataproviding the lowest limit, gives $irx \equiv l_{\rm tir}/l_{\rm uv} \leq 2.2$.here we assume that the local calibration between the 8 $\mu$m emission and thedust sed shape and metallicity applies at high redshifts and that our laes havelow metallicities as suggested by previous studies. the inferred escapefractions of ly$\alpha$, $16$--$37%$, and uv continuum, $\ge 44%$, are higherthan the cosmic averages at the same epoch. the smc attenuation curve isconsistent with the irx and the uv slope $\beta = -1.4^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$ of ourstacked lae, while the meurer's relation (calzetti curve) predicts a 3.8 timeshigher irx; we also discuss the validity of pacs-based $l_{\rm tir}^{3\sigma}$allowing the meurer's relation. sed fitting using the calzetti curve also givesa $\sim 10$ times higher sfr than from the $l_{\rm tir}^{3\sigma}$ and $l_{\rmuv}$. with $m_{\star}=6.3^{+0.8}_{-2.0} \times10^8 \mathrm{m_{\odot}}$, ourlaes lie on a lower-mass extrapolation of the star formation main sequence at$z \sim 2$, suggesting that the majority of $z \sim 2$ laes are mildly starforming with relatively old ages of $\sim 200$ myr. the faint $l_{\rmtir}^{3\sigma}$ implies that laes contribute little to the faint ($\gtrsim 100\mu$jy) submm number counts by alma.

1509.09001	statistical properties of diffuse lyman-alpha halos around star-forming  galaxies at z~2	we present statistical properties of diffuse lyman-alpha halos (lahs) aroundhigh-$z$ star-forming galaxies with large subaru samples of lyman-alphaemitters (laes) at $z=2.2$. we make subsamples defined by the physicalquantities of laes' central lyman-alpha luminosities, uv magnitudes,lyman-alpha equivalent widths, and uv slopes, and investigate lahs' radialsurface brightness (sb) profiles and scale lengths $r_n$ as a function of thesephysical quantities. we find that there exist prominent lahs around laes withfaint lyman-alpha luminosities, bright uv luminosities, and small lyman-alphaequivalent widths in cumulative radial lyman-alpha sb profiles. we confirm thistrend with the anti-correlation between $r_n$ and lyman-alpha luminosities(equivalent widths) based on the spearman's rank correlation coefficient thatis $\rho=-0.9$ ($-0.7$) corresponding to the $96\%$ ($93\%$) confidence level,although the correlation between $r_n$ and uv magnitudes is not clearly foundin the rank correlation coefficient. our results suggest that laes withproperties similar to typical lyman-break galaxies (with faint lyman-alphaluminosities and small equivalent widths) possess more prominent lahs. weinvestigate scenarios for the major physical origins of lahs with our results,and find that the cold stream scenario is not preferred, due to the relativelysmall equivalent widths up to $77$\aa\ in lahs that include laes' centralcomponents. there remain two possible scenarios of lyman-alpha scattering incircum-galactic medium and satellite galaxies that cannot be tested with ourobservational data.

0806.0888	a close relationship at z~2: submillimetre galaxies and bzk-selected  galaxies	we investigate the relationship between two massive star-forming galaxypopulations at redshift z~ 2; i.e. submillimetre galaxies (smgs) andbzk-selected galaxies (bzks). out of 60 smgs found in the subaru/xmm-newtondeep field, we collect optical--nir photometry of 28 radio counterparts for 24smgs, based on refined sky positions with a radio map for 35 smgs (ivison etal. 2007). we find a correlation between their k-band magnitudes and bzk [=(z-k)-(b-z)] colours: almost all of the k-faint (k_ab &gt; 21.3) radio-detectedsmgs have bzk&gt;-0.2, and therefore bzks. this result gives strong support toperform direct optical identification of smgs by searching for bzks aroundsmgs. we calculate the formal significance (p' value) for each of the bzkassociations around radio-undetected smgs, and find 6 new robustidentifications, including one double identification. from this analysis, weobtain the current best estimate on the surface density of bzk-selected smgs,which indicates that only ~1 per cent of bzks are smgs. if bzks are normaldisk-like galaxies at z~ 2 as indicated by the correlation between their starformation rate (sfr) and stellar mass and also by dynamical properties, smgsare likely to be merging bzks. in this case, a typical enhancement of sfr dueto merging is only a factor of ~ 3, which is an order of magnitude lower thanthat of local ulirgs. this may indicate that most of the merging bzks could beobserved as smgs. considering a possible high fraction of mergers at z~ 2 (atleast it would be higher than the fraction at z&gt; 1 of ~ 10 per cent), it israther puzzling to find such a low fraction of smgs in the progenitorpopulation, i.e. bzks.

1511.01519	physical properties of spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at $z\ge6$.  iii. stellar populations from sed modeling with secure ly$\alpha$ emission  and redshifts	we present a study of stellar populations in a sample ofspectroscopically-confirmed lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) and ly$\alpha$ emitters(laes) at $5.7&lt;z&lt;7$. these galaxies have deep optical and infrared images fromsubaru, $hst$, and $spitzer$/irac. we focus on a subset of 27 galaxies withirac detections, and characterize their stellar populations utilizing galaxysynthesis models based on the multi-band data and secure redshifts. byincorporating nebular emission estimated from the observed ly$\alpha$ flux, weare able to break the strong degeneracy of model spectra between young galaxieswith prominent nebular emission and older galaxies with strong balmer breaks.the results show that our galaxies cover a wide range of ages from several to afew hundred million years (myr), and a wide range of stellar masses from$\sim10^8$ to $\sim10^{11}$ $m_{\odot}$. these galaxies can be roughly dividedinto an `old' subsample and a `young' subsample. the `old' subsample consistsof galaxies older than 100 myr, with stellar masses higher than $10^9$$m_{\odot}$. the galaxies in the `young' subsample are younger than $\sim$30myr, with masses ranging between $\sim10^8$ and $\sim3\times10^9$ $m_{\odot}$.both subsamples display a correlation between stellar mass and star-formationrate (sfr), but with very different normalizations. the average specific sfr(ssfr) of the `old' subsample is 3--4 gyr$^{-1}$, consistent with previousstudies of `normal' star-forming galaxies at $z\ge6$. the average ssfr of the`young' subsample is an order of magnitude higher, likely due to starburstactivity. our results also indicate little or no dust extinction in themajority of the galaxies, as already suggested by their steep rest-frame uvslopes. finally, laes and lbgs with strong ly$\alpha$ emission areindistinguishable in terms of age, stellar mass, and sfr.

0705.2901	wide-field survey around local group dwarf spheroidal galaxy leo ii:  spatial distribution of stellar content	we carried out a wide-field v, i imaging survey of the local group dwarfspheroidal galaxy leo ii using the subaru prime focus camera on the 8.2-msubaru telescope. the survey covered an area of 26.67 x 26.67 arcmin^2, farbeyond the tidal radius of leo ii (8.63 arcmin), down to the limiting magnitudeof v ~26, which is roughly 1 mag deeper than the turn-off point of the mainsequence stars of leo ii. radial number density profiles of bright and faintred giant branch (rgb) stars were found to change their slopes at around thetidal radius, and extend beyond the tidal radius with shallower slopes. asmoothed surface brightness map of leo ii suggests the existence of a smallsubstructure of globular cluster luminosity beyond the tidal radius. weinvestigated the properties of the stellar population by means of thecolor-magnitude diagram. the horizontal branch (hb) morphology index shows aradial gradient in which red hb stars are more concentrated than blue hb stars,which is common to many local group dwarf spheroidal galaxies. the colordistribution of rgb stars around the mean rgb sequence shows a largerdispersion at the center than in the outskirts, indicating a mixture of stellarpopulations at the center and a more homogeneous population in the outskirts.based on the age estimation using subgiant branch (sgb) stars, we found thatalthough the major star formation took place ~8 gyr ago, a considerable stellarpopulation younger than 8 gyr is found at the center; such a younger populationis insignificant in the outskirts.

0807.4174	discovery of a giant lya emitter near the reionization epoch	we report the discovery of a giant lya emitter (lae) with a spitzer/iraccounterpart near the reionization epoch at z=6.595. the giant lae is found fromthe extensive 1 deg^2 subaru narrow-band survey for z=6.6 laes in thesubaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds) field, and subsequently identified by deepspectroscopy of keck/deimos and magellan/imacs. among our 207 lae candidates,this lae is not only the brightest narrow-band object with l(lya) = 3.9+/-0.2 x10^43 erg/s in our survey volume of 10^6 mpc^3, but also a spatially extendedlya nebula with the largest isophotal area whose major axis is at least ~3''.this object is more likely to be a large lya nebula with a size of &gt;~17 kpcthan to be a strongly-lensed galaxy by a foreground object. our keck spectrumwith medium-high spectral and spatial resolutions suggests that the velocitywidth is v(fwhm)=251+/-21 km/s, and that the line-center velocity changes by~60 km/s in a 10-kpc range. the stellar mass and star-formation rate areestimated to be 0.9-5.0 x 10^10 mo and &gt;34 mo/yr, respectively, from thecombination of deep optical to infrared images of subaru, ukidss-ultra deepsurvey, and spitzer/irac. although the nature of this object is not yet clearlyunderstood, this could be an important object for studying cooling cloudsaccreting onto a massive halo, or forming-massive galaxies with significantoutflows contributing to cosmic reionization and metal enrichment ofinter-galactic medium.

(1998). wecompare the observed brightening of lb/mb with luminosity evolution models forthe galaxy population as a whole, changing the e-folding time of star formation\tau by 0.1 \le \tau \le 5 gyr and the formation redshift \zf by 2 \le \zf &lt;\infty. we find that \tau=0.1 gyr 'single burst' models with \zf \ge 3 and\tau=5 gyr 'disk' models with arbitrary \zf are consistent with the observedbrightening, while models with \tau=1-2 gyr tend to predict too steepbrightening. we also derive the ratio of blue luminosity density to baryondensity for field galaxies, adopting \omega_b h^2 = 0.02, and find that blueluminosity per unit baryon is similar in clusters and in fields up to z \simeq1 within the observational uncertainties.

astro-ph;0209445	subaru deep survey iii. evolution of rest-frame luminosity functions  based on the photometric redshifts for a k'-band selected galaxy sample	we have constructed a very deep k'-selected multicolor bvriz'jk' sample of439 field galaxies. photometric redshifts for sample galaxies were estimated.the overall redshift distribution n(z) for the k'&lt;21.0 sample is consistentwith previous observations, and for the first time we derive the n(z) down tok'=24.0. after taking account of the dust extinction and selection effects ofthe sample, the observed n(z) distribution is well described with the plemodel, while the hierarchical galaxy formation model shows an apparentdeficiency of galaxies especially at z&gt;2. the photometric redshift and thebest-fit sed model evaluations allow the derivation of the rest-frame k', b,and uv(2000a) luminosity functions (lfs) and their evolutions. the rest-k' lfshows almost no evolution up to z=3, while the rest b lf shows mild luminosityevolution, and the rest uv lf shows strong luminosity evolution. this trendcorresponds to the evolution of the rest uv-k' color, which gets bluer withincreasing redshift. we also found that more massive galaxies are redder inthis rest-frame color in every epoch. the rest-uv lf of our k'-selectedgalaxies shows a much shallower faint end slope at z=3 than that of previousestimations for rest-uv selected lyman break galaxies. as a consequence, thecontribution to the global star formation rate of our k'-selected galaxies isabout 42% of that derived from the integration of lf of lyman break galaxies atz=3. this result suggests that a large fraction of the star formation ratedensity at z&gt;1.5 comes from the contribution from the faint (m_2000a&gt;-20) bluegalaxy population at high redshift universe that have not yet obviously beenidentified.

astro-ph;0307207	properties of host haloes of lyman-break galaxies and lyman-alpha  emitters from their number densities and angular clustering	we explore empirical relations between three different populations ofhigh-redshift galaxies and their hosting dark halos employing the halo modelapproach. specifically we consider lyman-break galaxies at z\sim4 and atz\sim5, and lyman-alpha emitters at z\simeq 4.86. we adopt a halo occupationfunction prescription to parameterize the properties of their hosting halos andthe efficiency of halo-dependent star formation. we find that the two lbgsamples are well described by the halo model with an appropriate hof. we obtainconstraints on properties of their hosting halos. a typical mass of hostinghalos for lbgs is 5\times10^{11}h^{-1}m_\odot and the expected number of lbgsper halo is \sim0.5, therefore there is an approximate one-to-onecorrespondence between halos and lbgs. we also find a sign of the minimum massof lbg hosting halos decreasing with time. we discuss implications of thesefindings on the star formation history of lbgs. on the other hand, for laes,our simple hof prescription fails to reproduce simultaneously the observedangular correlation function and the number density. this might imply eitherthat the distribution of laes within hosting halos differs from that of darkmatter, or that the strong large-scale correlation is due to the existence ofan unusual, large overdense region, and so the survey region is not arepresentative of the z\sim5 universe, the definite answer should wait for amuch wider survey of laes at high redshifts.

astro-ph;0411132	the environmental dependence of galaxy properties in the local universe:  dependence on luminosity, local density, and system richness	we investigate the environmental dependence of star formation and themorphology of galaxies in the local universe based on a volume-limited sample(0.030&lt;z&lt;0.065 and m_r&lt;m_r^*+2) constructed from the data of the sloan digitalsky survey. first, we focus on how galaxy properties change with local density.the star formation and morphology show a 'break' at the critical local densityof log sigma_crit~0.4 galaxies h_75^2 mpc^-2, which is in agreement withprevious studies. however, the break can be seen only for faint galaxies(m^*_r+1 &lt; m_r &lt; m^*_r+2), and bright galaxies (m_r &lt; m^*_r+1) show no break.thus, galaxies of different luminosities are found to show differentenvironmental dependencies. next, we examine dependencies on richness of galaxysystems. star formation activities of galaxies are different from those offield galaxies even in systems as poor as sigma~100 km/s. this result suggeststhat environmental mechanisms that are effective only in rich systems, such asram-pressure stripping of cold gas and harassment, have not played a major rolein transforming galaxies into red early-type galaxies. strangulation andinteractions between galaxies, however, remain candidates of the driver of theenvironmental dependence. in the dense environments in the local universe, theslow transformation of faint galaxies occurs to some extent, but thetransformation of bright galaxies is not clearly visible. we suggest that theevolution of bright galaxies is not strongly related to galaxy system, such asgroups and clusters, while the evolution of faint galaxies is likely to beclosely connected to galaxy system.

astro-ph;0506713	the build-up of the colour-magnitude relation as a function of  environment	we discuss the environmental dependence of galaxy evolution based on deeppanoramic imaging of two distant clusters taken with suprime-cam as part of thepisces project. by combining with the sdss data as a local counterpart forcomparison, we construct a large sample of galaxies that spans wide ranges inenvironment, time, and stellar mass (or luminosity). we find that colours ofgalaxies, especially those of faint galaxies ($m_v&gt;m_v^*+1$), change from blueto red at a break density as we go to denser regions. based on local and globaldensities of galaxies, we classify three environments: field, groups, andclusters. we show that the cluster colour-magnitude relation is already builtat $z=0.83$. in contrast to this, the bright-end of the field colour-magnituderelation has been vigorously built all the way down to the present-day and thebuild-up at the faint-end has not started yet. a possible interpretation ofthese results is that galaxies evolve in the 'down-sizing' fashion. that is,massive galaxies complete their star formation first and the truncation of starformation is propagated to smaller objects as time progresses. this trend islikely to depend on environment since the build-up of the colour-magnituderelation is delayed in lower-density environments. therefore, we may suggestthat the evolution of galaxies took place earliest in massive galaxies and inhigh density regions, and it is delayed in less massive galaxies and in lowerdensity regions.

astro-ph;0508594	the number density of old passively-evolving galaxies at z=1 in the  subaru/xmm-newton deep survey field	we obtained the number counts and the rest-frame b-band luminosity functionof the color-selected old passively-evolving galaxies (opegs) at z=1 with veryhigh statistical accuracy using a large and homogeneous sample of about 4000such objects with z' &lt;25 detected in the area of 1.03 deg^2 in thesubaru/xmm-newton deep survey (sxds) field. our selection criteria are definedon the i'-z' and r-z' color-magnitude plane so that opegs at z=0.9-1.1 withformation redshift z_f=2-10 are properly sampled. the limiting magnitudecorresponds to the luminosity of galaxies with m_*+3 at z=0. we made a pilotredshift observations for 99 opeg candidates with 19 &lt; z' &lt; 22 and found thatat least 78% (73/93) of the entire sample, or 95% (73/77) of these whoseredshifts were obtained are indeed lie between z=0.87 and 1.12 and the most oftheir spectra show the continuum break and strong ca h and k lines, indicatingthat these objects are indeed dominated by the old stellar populations. we thencompare our results with the luminosity functions of the color- or themorphologically-selected early type galaxies at z=0 taking the evolutionaryfactor into account and found that the number density of old passive galaxieswith sim m_* magnitude at z~1 averaged over the sxds area is 40-60% of theequivalently red galaxies and 60-85% of the morphologically-selected e/s0galaxies at z=0 depending on their luminosity evolution. it is revealed thatmore than half, but not all, of the present-day early-type galaxies had alreadybeen formed into quiescent passive galaxies at z=1.

astro-ph;0509564	clustering of lyman break galaxies at z=4 and 5 in the subaru deep  field: luminosity dependence of the correlation function slope	we explored the clustering properties of lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z=4and 5 with an angular two-point correlation function on the basis of the verydeep and wide subaru deep field data. we found an apparent dependence of thecorrelation function slope on uv luminosity for lbgs at both z=4 and 5. moreluminous lbgs have a steeper correlation function. to compare theseobservational results, we constructed numerical mock lbg catalogs based on asemianalytic model of hierarchical clustering combined with high-resolutionn-body simulation, carefully mimicking the observational selection effects. theluminosity functions for lbgs predicted by this mock catalog were found to bealmost consistent with the observation. moreover, the overall correlationfunctions of lbgs were reproduced reasonably well. the observed dependence ofthe clustering on uv luminosity was not reproduced by the model, unlesssubsamples of distinct halo mass were considered. that is, lbgs belonging tomore massive dark haloes had steeper and larger-amplitude correlationfunctions. with this model, we found that lbg multiplicity in massive darkhalos amplifies the clustering strength at small scales, which steepens theslope of the correlation function. the hierarchical clustering model couldtherefore be reconciled with the observed luminosity-dependence of the angularcorrelation function, if there is a tight correlation between uv luminosity andhalo mass. our finding that the slope of the correlation function depends onluminosity could be an indication that massive dark halos hosted multiplebright lbgs (abridged).

astro-ph;0605360	systematic survey of extended lyman-alpha sources over z~3-5	spatially extended ly-alpha sources which are faint and compact in coninuumare candidates for extremely young galaxies (age of ~&lt;10e+7 yrs) at highredshifts. we carried out a systematic survey for extended ly-alpha sources,using deep intermediate-band imaging data taken with the suprime-cam on thesubaru telescope. our survey covers a field of view of 33' * 25' and a redshiftrange of 3.24&lt;z&lt;4.95, down to a ly-alpha flux of ~1e-17 ergs/cm^2/s. weidentified 41 extended ly-alpha sources. the redshift distribution of thesesources shows that this kind of objects are common in the early universe overthe surveyed redshift range. the identified objects have typical sizes of\~10-15 kpc and luminosities of ~10^42 ergs/s. follow-up spectroscopy made for7 of the 41 objects showed that our sample suffers from little contamination.all 7 objects have large equivalent widths of ly-alpha emission line, all butone exceeding 240a in the rest frame. the large equivalent widths suggest thattheir extended ly-alpha emissions are unlikely to be due to normal starbursts,but possibly originated from very young galaxies. all 41 objects in our samplehave much smaller ly-alpha luminosities than the two ly-alpha blobs (labs)found by steidel et al. (2000) in spite of our much larger survey volume. thissuggests that large and luminous extended ly-alpha objects like the two labsare very rare and are clustered in overdense regions.

astro-ph;0608512	luminosity functions of lyman-break galaxies at z~4 and 5 in the subaru  deep field	we investigate the luminosity functions of lyman-break galaxies (lbg) at z~4and 5 based on the optical imaging data obtained in the subaru deep fieldproject. three samples of lbgs in a contiguous 875 arcmin^2 area areconstructed. one consists of 3,808 lbgs at z~4 down to i'=26.85 selected withthe b-r vs r-i' diagram. the other two consist of 539 and 240 lbgs at z~5 downto z'=26.05 selected with two kinds of two-color diagrams: v-i' vs i'-z' andr-i' vs i'-z'. the adopted selection criteria are proved to be fairly reliableby spectroscopic observation. we derive the luminosity functions of the lbgs atrest-frame ultraviolet wavelengths down to m_{uv}=-19.2 at z~4 and m_{uv}=-20.3at z~5. we find clear evolution of the luminosity function over the redshiftrange of 0&lt;z&lt;6, which is accounted for by a sole change in the characteristicmagnitude, m^*. the cosmic star formation rate (sfr) density at z~4 and z~5 ismeasured from the luminosity functions. we examine the evolution of the cosmicsfr density and its luminosity dependence over 0&lt;z&lt;6. the sfr densitycontributed from brighter galaxies is found to change more drastically withcosmic time. the contribution from brighter galaxies has a sharp peak aroundz=3-4, while that from fainter galaxies evolves relatively mildly with a broadpeak at earlier epoch. combining the observed sfr density with the standardcold dark matter model, we compute the cosmic sfr per unit baryon mass in darkhaloes, i.e., the specific sfr. the specific sfr is found to scale withredshift as (1+z)^3 up to z~4, implying that the efficiency of star formationis on average higher at higher redshift in proportion to the cooling ratewithin dark haloes, while this is not simply the case at z&gt;4.

astro-ph;0609393	a galaxy at a redshift z = 6.96	when galaxy formation started in the history of the universe remains unclear.studies of the cosmic microwave background indicate that the universe, afterinitial cooling (following the big bang), was reheated and reionized by hotstars in newborn galaxies at a redshift in the range 6 &lt; z &lt; 14 (ref. 1).though several candidate galaxies at redshift z &gt; 7 have been identifiedphotometrically (refs 2,3), galaxies with spectroscopically confirmed redshiftshave been confined to z &lt; 6.6 (refs. 4-8). here we report a spectroscopicredshift of z = 6.96 (corresponding to just 750 myr after the big bang) for agalaxy whose spectrum clearly shows lyman-alpha emission at 9,682 a, indicatingactive star formation at a rate of about 10 m_sun/yr, where m_sun us the massof the sun. this demonstrates that galaxy formation was under way when theuniverse was only about 6 per cent of its present age. the number density ofgalaxies at z = 7 seems to be only 18-36 per cent of the density at z = 6.6.

astro-ph;0610846	the luminosity function and star formation rate between redshifts of  0.07 and 1.47 for narrow-band emitters in the subaru deep field	abridged: subaru deep field line-emitting galaxies in four narrow-bandfilters at low and intermediate redshifts are presented. broad-band colors,follow-up optical spectroscopy, and multiple nb filters are used to distinguishha, [o ii], and [o iii] emitters between redshifts of 0.07 and 1.47 toconstruct their luminosity functions (lfs). these lfs are derived down to faintmagnitudes, which allows for a more accurate determination of the faint endslope. with a large (n~200-900) sample for each redshift interval, a schechterprofile is fitted to each lf. prior to dust extinction corrections, the [o iii]and [o ii] lfs reported in this paper agree reasonably well with those ofhippelein et al. the z=0.08 ha lf, which reaches two orders of magnitudefainter than gallego et al., is steeper by 25%. this indicates that there aremore low luminosity star-forming galaxies for z&lt;0.1. the faint end slope \alphaand \phi_{\star} show a strong evolution with redshift while l_{\star} showlittle evolution. the evolution in \alpha indicates that low-luminositygalaxies have a stronger evolution compared to brighter ones. integrated starformation rate densities are derived via ha, [o iii], and [o ii] for0.07&lt;z&lt;1.47. a steep increase in the star-formation rate density, as a functionof redshift, is seen for 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.9. for z&gt;1, the star-formation rate densitiesare more or less constant. the latter is consistent with previous uv and [o ii]measurements. below z&lt;0.4, the sfr densities are consistent with several ha, [oii], and uv measurements, but other measurements are a factor of two higher.for example, the z=0.066-0.092 ha lf agrees with those of jones &amp;bland-hawthorn, but at z=0.24 and 0.40, their number density is higher by afactor of two. this discrepancy can be explained by cosmic variance.

astro-ph;0701637	luminosity dependent clustering of star-forming bzk galaxies at redshift  2	we use the bzk color selection proposed by daddi et al. (2004) to obtain asample of 1092 faint star-forming galaxies (hereafter sbzks) from 180 arcmin^2in the subaru deep field. this sample represents star-forming galaxies at 1.4 &lt;z &lt; 2.5 down to k(ab)=23.2, which roughly corresponds to a stellar-mass limitof ~ 1 x 10^{10} msun. we measure the angular correlation function (acf) ofthese sbzks to be w(theta) = (0.58 +- 0.13) x theta["]^{-0.8} and translate theamplitude into the correlation length assuming a reasonable redshiftdistribution. the resulting value, r0 = 3.2^{+0.6}_{-0.7} h^{-1} mpc, suggeststhat our sbzks reside in haloes with a typical mass of 2.8 x 10^{11} msun.combining this halo mass estimate with those for brighter samples of kong etal. (2006), we find that the mass of dark haloes largely increases with kbrightness, a measure of the stellar mass. comparison with other galaxypopulations suggests that faint sbzks (k(ab)&lt;23.2) and lyman break galaxies atz ~ 2 are similar populations hosted by relatively low-mass haloes, whilebright sbzks (k(ab)&lt;21) reside in haloes comparable to or more massive thanthose of distant red galaxies and extremely red objects. using the extendedpress-schechter formalism, we predict that present-day descendants of haloeshosting sbzks span a wide mass range depending on k brightness, from lower thanthat of the milky way up to those of richest clusters.

0809.2795	mapping dusty star formation in and around a cluster at z=0.81 by  wide-field imaging with akari	we present environmental dependence of dusty star forming activity in andaround the cluster rxj1716.4+6708 at z=0.81 based on wide-field andmulti-wavelength observations with suprime-cam on the subaru telescope and irconboard the akari satellite. our optical data shows that the optical colourdistribution of galaxies starts to dramatically change from blue to red at themedium-density environment such as cluster outskirts, groups and filaments. bycombining with infrared data, we find that 15 micron galaxies tend to haveoptical colours between the red sequence and the blue cloud with a tail intothe red sequence.  the spatial distribution of the 15 micron galaxies over ~200 arcmin^2 aroundthe cluster reveals that few 15 micron galaxies are detected in the clustercentral region. this is probably due to the low star forming activity in thecluster core. however, interestingly, the fraction of 15 micron galaxies in themedium-density environments is as high as in the low-density field, despite thefact that the optical colours start to change in the medium-densityenvironments. furthermore, we find that 15 micron galaxies which have opticallyred colours (candidates for dusty red galaxies) and galaxies with high specificstar formation rates are also concentrated in the medium-density environment.these results imply that the star forming activity in galaxies in groups andfilaments is enhanced due to some environmental effects specific to themedium-density environment, and such a phenomenon is probably directlyconnected to the truncation of star forming activity in galaxies seen as thedramatic change in optical colours in such environments.

astro-ph;9701201	measuring the density fluctuation from the cluster gas mass function	we investigate the gas mass function of clusters of galaxies to measure thedensity fluctuation spectrum on cluster scales. the baryon abundance confinedin rich clusters is computed from the gas mass function and compared with themean baryon density in the universe which is predicted by the big bangnucleosynthesis. this baryon fraction and the slope of the gas mass functionput constraints on $\sigma_8$, the rms linear fluctuation on scales of$8h^{-1}\mpc$, and the slope of the fluctuation spectrum, where $h$ is thehubble constant in units of 100 $\kms \ompc$. we find $\sigma_8 = 0.80 \pm0.15$ and $n \sim -1.5$ for $0.5 \le h \le 0.8$, where we assume that thedensity spectrum is approximated by a power law on cluster scales: $\sigma(r)\propto r^{-{3+n\over{2}}}$. our value of $\sigma_8$ is independent of thedensity parameter, $\omega_0$, and thus we can estimate $\omega_0$ by combining$\sigma_8$ obtained in this study with those from $\omega_0$-dependent analysesto date. we find that $\sigma_8(\omega_0)$ derived from the cluster abundancesuch as the temperature function gives $\omega_0 \sim 0.5$ while$\sigma_8(\omega_0)$ measured from the peculiar velocity field of galaxiesgives $\omega_0 \sim 0.2-1$, depending on the technique used to analyzepeculiar velocity data. constraints are also derived for open, spatially flat,and tilted cold dark matter models and for cold + hot dark matter models.

astro-ph;9705112	an objective and automatic cluster finder: an improvement of the  matched-filter method	we describe an objective and automated method for detecting clusters ofgalaxies from optical imaging data. this method is a variant of the so-called`matched-filter' technique pioneered by postman et al. (1996). withsimultaneous use of positions and apparent magnitudes of galaxies, this methodcan, not only find cluster candidates, but also estimate their redshifts andrichnesses as byproducts of detection. we examine errors in the estimation ofcluster's position, redshift, and richness with a number of monte carlosimulations. no systematic discrepancies between the true and estimated valuesare seen for either redshift or richness. spurious detection rate of the methodis about less than 10% of those of conventional ones which use only surfacedensity of galaxies. a cluster survey in the north galactic pole is executed toverify the performance characteristics of the method with real data. two knownreal clusters are successfully detected. we expect these methods based on`matched-filter' technique to be essential tools for compiling large andhomogeneous optically-selected cluster catalogs.

astro-ph;9909063	probing the evolution of early-type galaxies using multi-colour number  counts and redshift distributions	we investigate pure luminosity evolution models for early-type (ellipticaland s0) galaxies (i.e., no number density change or morphology transition), andexamine whether these models are consistent with observed number counts in theb, i and k bands and redshift distributions of two samples of faint galaxiesselected in the i and k bands. the models are characterized by the starformation time scale $\tau_{sf}$ and the time $t_{gw}$ when galactic wind blowsin addition to several other conventional parameters. we find the single-burstmodel ($\tau_{sf}$=0.1 gyr and $t_{gw}$=0.353 gyr), which is known to reproducethe photometric properties of early-type galaxies in clusters, is inconsistentwith redshift distributions of early-type galaxies in the field environment dueto overpredictions of galaxies at $z\gsim1.4$ even with strong extinction whichis at work until $t_{gw}$. in order for dust extinction to be more effective,we change $\tau_{sf}$ and $t_{gw}$ as free parameters, and find that modelswith $\tau_{sf}\gsim0.5$ gyr and $t_{gw}&gt;1.0$ gyr can be made consistent withboth the observed redshift distributions and number counts, if we introducestrong extinction $(e(b-v)\geq1$ as a peak value). these results suggest thatearly-type galaxies in the field environment do not have the same evolutionaryhistory as described by the single-burst model.

astro-ph;9912447	new improved photometric redshifts of galaxies in the hdf	we report new improved photometric redshifts of 1048 galaxies in the hubbledeep field (hdf). a standard chi^2 minimizing method is applied to seven-colorubvijhk photometry by fernandez-soto, lanzetta, &amp; yahil (1999). we use 187template seds representing a wide variety of morphology and age of observedgalaxies based on a population synthesis model by kodama &amp; arimoto (1997). weintroduce two new recipes. first, the amount of the internal absorption ischanged as a free parameter in the range of e(b-v)=0.0 to 0.5 with an intervalof 0.1. second, the absorption due to intergalactic hi clouds is also changedby a factor of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 around the opacity given by madau (1995). thetotal number of template seds is thus 187x6x3=3,366, except for the redshiftgrid. the dispersion sigma_z of our photometric redshifts with respect tospectroscopic redshifts is sigma_z=0.08 and 0.24 for z&lt;2 and z&gt;2, respectively,which are smaller than the corresponding values (sigma_z=0.09 and 0.45) byfernandez-soto et al. improvement is significant, especially in z&gt;2. this isdue to smaller systematic errors which are largely reduced mainly by includingthree opacities due to intergalactic hi clouds. we discuss redshiftdistribution n(z) and cosmic star formation rate based on our new photometricredshifts.

0809.5100	star formation rates and metallicities of k-selected star forming  galaxies at z~2	we present spectroscopy of 15 star-forming bzk galaxies (sbzks) with k(ab)&lt;23in the subaru deep field, for which halpha and some other emission lines aredetected in 0.9 to 2.3 micron spectra with a resolution of r=500. using halphaluminosities, we obtain star formation rates (sfrs), and then specific sfrs(ssfrs) dividing sfrs by stellar masses, which are derived from sed fitting tobvri'z'k photometry. it is found that sbzks with higher stellar masses havelarger sfrs. a negative correlation is seen between stellar mass and ssfr,which is consistent with the previous results for z~2 galaxies. this impliesthat a larger growth of stellar mass occurs in less massive galaxies. inaddition, gas-phase oxygen abundances, 12+log(o/h), are derived from the ratioof nii(lambda 6584) to halpha using the n2 index method. we have found acorrelation between stellar mass and oxygen abundance in the sense that moremassive sbzks tend to be more metal rich, which is qualitatively consistentwith the relation for uv-selected z~2 galaxies. however, the metallicity of thesbzks is ~0.2 dex higher than that of uv-selected galaxies with similar stellarmasses, which is significant considering the small uncertainties. the sbzks inour sample have redder r-k colors than the uv-selected galaxies. this galaxycolor-dependence in the oxygen abundance may be caused by older or dustiergalaxies having higher metallicities at z~2.
