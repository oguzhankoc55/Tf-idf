1009.0614	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): survey diagnostics and core data  release	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey has been operating since february2008 on the 3.9-m anglo-australian telescope using the aaomega fibre-fedspectrograph facility to acquire spectra with a resolution of r~1300 for120,862 sdss selected galaxies. the target catalogue constitutes threecontiguous equatorial regions centred at 9h (g09), 12h (g12) and 14.5h (g15)each of 12 x 4 sq.deg to limiting fluxes of r &lt; 19.4, r &lt; 19.8, and r &lt; 19.4mag respectively (and additional limits at other wavelengths). spectra andreliable redshifts have been acquired for over 98 per cent of the galaxieswithin these limits. here we present the survey footprint, progression, datareduction, redshifting, re-redshifting, an assessment of data quality after 3years, additional image analysis products (including ugrizyjhk photometry,sersic profiles and photometric redshifts), observing mask, and construction ofour core survey catalogue (gamacore). from this we create three science readycatalogues: gamacoredr1 for public release, which includes data acquired duringyear 1 of operations within specified magnitude limits (february 2008 to april2008); gamacoremainsurvey containing all data above our survey limits for useby the gama team and collaborators; and gamacoreatlassv containing year 1, 2and 3 data matched to herschel-atlas science demonstration data. thesecatalogues along with the associated spectra, stamps and profiles can beaccessed via the gama website: http://www.gama-survey.org/

1009.0616	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): dust obscuration in galaxies and their  recent star formation histories	we present self-consistent star formation rates derived through pan-spectralanalysis of galaxies drawn from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. wedetermine the most appropriate form of dust obscuration correction viaapplication of a range of extinction laws drawn from the literature as appliedto halpha, [o{ii}] and uv luminosities. these corrections are applied to asample of 31,508 galaxies from the gama survey at z &lt; 0.35. we consider severaldifferent obscuration curves, including those of milky way, calzetti (2001) andfischera and dopita (2005) curves and their effects on the observedluminosities. at the core of this technique is the observed balmer decrement,and we provide a prescription to apply optimal obscuration corrections usingthe balmer decrement. we carry out an analysis of the star formation history(sfh) using stellar population synthesis tools to investigate the evolutionaryhistory of our sample of galaxies as well as to understand the effects ofvariation in the initial mass function (imf) and the effects this has on theevolutionary history of galaxies. we find that the fischera and dopita (2005)obscuration curve with an r_{v} value of 4.5 gives the best agreement betweenthe different sfr indicators. the 2200a feature needed to be removed from thiscurve to obtain complete consistency between all sfr indicators suggesting thatthis feature may not be common in the average integrated attenuation of galaxyemission. we also find that the uv dust obscuration is strongly dependent onthe sfr.

1012.3771	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): galaxies at the faint end of the halpha  luminosity function	we present an analysis of the properties of the lowest halpha-luminositygalaxies (l_halpha&lt;4x10^32 w; sfr&lt;0.02 msun/yr) in the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey. these galaxies make up the the rise above a schechter functionin the number density of systems seen at the faint end of the halpha luminosityfunction. above our flux limit we find that these galaxies are principallycomposed of intrinsically low stellar mass systems (median stellar mass=2.5x10^8 msun) with only 5/90 having stellar masses m&gt;10^10 msun. the low sfrsystems are found to exist predominantly in the lowest density environments(median density ~0.02 galaxy mpc^-2 with none in environments more dense than~1.5 galaxy mpc^-2). their current specific star formation rates (ssfr; -8.5 &lt;log(ssfr[yr^-1])&lt;-12.) are consistent with their having had a variety of starformation histories. the low density environments of these galaxiesdemonstrates that such low-mass, star-forming systems can only remain aslow-mass and forming stars if they reside sufficiently far from other galaxiesto avoid being accreted, dispersed through tidal effects or having their gasreservoirs rendered ineffective through external processes.

1103.3080	gama/h-atlas: the ultraviolet spectral slope and obscuration in galaxies	we use multiwavelength data from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) andherschel atlas (h-atlas) surveys to compare the relationship between variousdust obscuration measures in galaxies. we explore the connections between theultraviolet (uv) spectral slope, $\beta$, the balmer decrement, and the farinfrared (ir) to $150\,$nm far ultraviolet (fuv) luminosity ratio. we exploretrends with galaxy mass, star formation rate (sfr) and redshift in order toidentify possible systematics in these various measures. we reiterate thefinding of other authors that there is a large scatter between the balmerdecrement and the $\beta$ parameter, and that $\beta$ may be poorly constrainedwhen derived from only two broad passbands in the uv. we also emphasise thatfuv derived sfrs, corrected for dust obscuration using $\beta$, will beoverestimated unless a modified relation between $\beta$ and the attenuationfactor is used. even in the optimum case, the resulting sfrs have a significantscatter, well over an order of magnitude. while there is a stronger correlationbetween the ir to fuv luminosity ratio and $\beta$ parameter than with thebalmer decrement, neither of these correlations are particularly tight, anddust corrections based on $\beta$ for high redshift galaxy sfrs must be treatedwith caution. we conclude with a description of the extent to which thedifferent obscuration measures are consistent with each other as well as theeffects of including other galactic properties on these correlations.

1104.1239	spatial kinematics of brightest cluster galaxies and their close  companions from integral field unit spectroscopy	we present integral field unit (ifu) spectroscopy of four brightest clustergalaxies (bcgs) at z~0.1. three of the bcgs have close companions within aprojected radius of 20 kpc and one has no companion within that radius. wecalculate the dynamical masses of the bcgs and their companions to be1.4x10^11&lt;m_dyn (m_solar)&lt;1.5x10^12. we estimate the probability that thecompanions of the bcgs are bound using the observed masses and velocityoffsets. we show that the lowest mass companion (1:4) is not bound while thetwo nearly equal mass (1:1.45 and 1:1.25) companions are likely to merge withtheir host bcgs in 0.35 gyr in major, dry mergers. we conclude that some bcgscontinue to grow from major merging even at z~0. we analyse the stellarkinematics of these systems using the \lambda_r parameter developed by thesauron team. this offers a new and unique means to measure the stellar angularmomentum of bcgs and make a direct comparison to other early-type galaxies. thebcgs and their companions have similar ellipticities to those of otherearly-type galaxies but are more massive. we find that not all these massivegalaxies have low \lambda_r_e as one might expect. one of the four bcgs and thetwo massive companions are found to be fast-rotating galaxies with high angularmomentum, thereby providing a new test for models of galaxy evolution and theformation of intra-cluster light.

1104.2379	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the star formation rate dependence of  the stellar initial mass function	the stellar initial mass function (imf) describes the distribution in stellarmasses produced from a burst of star formation. for more than fifty years, theimplicit assumption underpinning most areas of research involving the imf hasbeen that it is universal, regardless of time and environment. we measure thehigh-mass imf slope for a sample of low-to-moderate redshift galaxies from thegalaxy and mass assembly survey. the large range in luminosities and galaxymasses of the sample permits the exploration of underlying imf dependencies. astrong imf-star formation rate dependency is discovered, which shows thathighly star forming galaxies form proportionally more massive stars (they haveimfs with flatter power-law slopes) than galaxies with low star formationrates. this has a significant impact on a wide variety of galaxy evolutionstudies, all of which rely on assumptions about the slope of the imf. ourresult is supported by, and provides an explanation for, the results ofnumerous recent explorations suggesting a variation of or evolution in the imf.

1106.1994	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the gama galaxy group catalogue (g3cv1)	using the complete gama-i survey covering ~142 sq. deg. to r=19.4, of which~47 sq. deg. is to r=19.8, we create the gama-i galaxy group catalogue (g3cv1),generated using a friends-of-friends (fof) based grouping algorithm. ouralgorithm has been tested extensively on one family of mock gama lightcones,constructed from lambda-cdm n-body simulations populated with semi-analyticgalaxies. recovered group properties are robust to the effects of interlopersand are median unbiased in the most important respects. g3cv1 contains 14,388galaxy groups (with multiplicity &gt;= 2$), including 44,186 galaxies out of apossible 110,192 galaxies, implying ~40% of all galaxies are assigned to agroup. the similarities of the mock group catalogues and g3cv1 are multiple:global characteristics are in general well recovered. however, we do find anoticeable deficit in the number of high multiplicity groups in gama comparedto the mocks. additionally, despite exceptionally good local spatialcompleteness, g3cv1 contains significantly fewer compact groups with 5 or moremembers, this effect becoming most evident for high multiplicity systems. thesetwo differences are most likely due to limitations in the physics included ofthe current gama lightcone mock. further studies using a variety of galaxyformation models are required to confirm their exact origin.

1107.0141	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the red fraction and radial  distribution of satellite galaxies	we investigate the properties of satellite galaxies that surround isolatedhosts within the redshift range 0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.15, using data taken as part ofthe galaxy and mass assembly survey. making use of isolation and satellitecriteria that take into account stellar mass estimates, we find 3514 isolatedgalaxies of which 1426 host a total of 2998 satellites. separating the red andblue populations of satellites and hosts, using colour-mass diagrams, weinvestigate the radial distribution of satellite galaxies and determine how thered fraction of satellites varies as a function of satellite mass, host massand the projected distance from their host. comparing the red fraction ofsatellites to a control sample of small neighbours at greater projected radii,we show that the increase in red fraction is primarily a function of host mass.the satellite red fraction is about 0.2 higher than the control sample forhosts with 11.0 &lt; log m_* &lt; 11.5, while the red fractions show no differencefor hosts with 10.0 &lt; log m_* &lt; 10.5. for the satellites of more massive hoststhe red fraction also increases as a function of decreasing projected distance.our results suggest that the likely main mechanism for the quenching of starformation in satellites hosted by isolated galaxies is strangulation.

1109.6274	h-atlas/gama: dusty early-type galaxies and passive spirals	we present the dust properties and star-formation histories of localsubmillimetre-selected galaxies in herschel-atlas, classified by opticalmorphology. the early-type galaxies (etgs) that are detected contain as muchdust as typical spirals, and form a unique sample that has been blindlyselected at submillimetre wavelengths.  comparing h-atlas galaxies to a control sample of optically selectedgalaxies, we find 5.5% of luminous etgs are detected in h-atlas. the h-atlasetgs contain a significant mass of cold dust: the mean dust mass is 5.5x10^7msun, with individual galaxies ranging from 9x10^5-4x10^8 msun. this iscomparable to that of spirals in our sample, and is an order of magnitude moredust than that found for the control etgs, which have a median dust massinferred from stacking of (0.8-4.0)x10^6 msun. the etgs detected in h-atlashave bluer nuv-r colours, higher specific star-formation rates and youngerstellar populations than etgs which are optically selected, and may betransitioning from the blue cloud to the red sequence. we also find thath-atlas and control etgs inhabit similar low-density environments. we concludethat the dust in h-atlas and control etgs cannot be solely from stellarsources, and a large contribution from dust formed in the ism or externalsources is required. alternatively, dust destruction may not be as efficient aspredicted.  we also explore the properties of the most passive spiral galaxies in oursample with ssfr&lt;10^-11/yr. we find these passive spirals have lowerdust-to-stellar mass ratios, higher stellar masses and older stellar populationages than normal spirals. the passive spirals inhabit low density environmentssimilar to those of the normal spiral galaxies in our sample. this shows thatthe processes which turn spirals passive do not occur solely in theintermediate density environments of group and cluster outskirts.

1111.0166	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): ugriz galaxy luminosity functions	galaxy and mass assembly (gama) is a project to study galaxy formation andevolution, combining imaging data from ultraviolet to radio with spectroscopicdata from the aaomega spectrograph on the anglo-australian telescope. usingdata from phase 1 of gama, taken over three observing seasons, and correctingfor various minor sources of incompleteness, we calculate galaxy luminosityfunctions (lfs) and their evolution in the ugriz passbands.  at low redshift, z &lt; 0.1, we find that blue galaxies, defined according to amagnitude-dependent but non-evolving colour cut, are reasonably well fit over arange of more than ten magnitudes by simple schechter functions in all bands.red galaxies, and the combined blue-plus-red sample, require double power-lawschechter functions to fit a dip in their lf faintward of the characteristicmagnitude m* before a steepening faint end. this upturn is at least partly dueto dust-reddened disk galaxies.  we measure evolution of the galaxy lf over the redshift range 0.002 &lt; z &lt; 0.5using both a parametric fit and by measuring binned lfs in redshift slices. thecharacteristic luminosity l* is found to increase with redshift in all bands,with red galaxies showing stronger luminosity evolution than blue galaxies. thecomoving number density of blue galaxies increases with redshift, while that ofred galaxies decreases, consistent with prevailing movement from blue cloud tored sequence. as well as being more numerous at higher redshift, blue galaxiesalso dominate the overall luminosity density beyond redshifts z = 0.2. at lowerredshifts, the luminosity density is dominated by red galaxies in the rizbands, by blue galaxies in u and g.

0704.3097	spatially resolved kinematics and stellar populations of brightest  cluster and group galaxies	we present an examination of the kinematics and stellar populations of asample of 3 brightest group galaxies (bggs) and 3 brightest cluster galaxies(bcgs) in x-ray groups and clusters. we have obtained high signal-to-noisegemini/gmos (gemini south multi-object spectrograph) long-slit spectra of thesegalaxies and use lick indices to determine ages, metallicities andalpha-element abundance ratios out to at least their effective radii. we findthat the bggs and bcgs have very uniform masses, central ages and centralmetallicities. examining the radial dependence of their stellar populations, wefind no significant velocity dispersion, age, or alpha-enhancement gradients.however, we find a wide range of metallicity gradients, suggesting a variety offormation mechanisms. the range of metallicity gradients observed is surprisinggiven the homogeneous environment these galaxies probe and their uniformcentral stellar populations. however, our results are inconsistent with anysingle model of galaxy formation and emphasize the need for more theoreticalunderstanding of both the origins of metallicity gradients and galaxy formationitself. we postulate two possible physical causes for the different formationmechanisms.

1111.5707	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the galaxy stellar mass function at z &lt;  0.06	we determine the low-redshift field galaxy stellar mass function (gsmf) usingan area of 143 deg^2 from the first three years of the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey. the magnitude limits of this redshift survey are r &lt; 19.4 magover two thirds and 19.8 mag over one third of the area. the gsmf is determinedfrom a sample of 5210 galaxies using a density-corrected maximum volume method.this efficiently overcomes the issue of fluctuations in the number densityversus redshift. with h_0 = 70, the gsmf is well described between 10^8 and10^11.5 msun using a double schechter function with mass^* = 10^10.66 msun,phi_1^* = 3.96 x 10^-3 mpc^-3, alpha_1 = -0.35, phi_2^* = 0.79 x 10^-3 mpc^-3and alpha_2 = -1.47. this result is more robust to uncertainties in theflow-model corrected redshifts than from the shallower sloan digital sky surveymain sample (r &lt; 17.8 mag). the upturn in the gsmf is also seen directly in thei-band and k-band galaxy luminosity functions. accurately measuring the gsmfbelow 10^8 msun is possible within the gama survey volume but as expectedrequires deeper imaging data to address the contribution from lowsurface-brightness galaxies.

1201.1916	herschel-atlas/gama: a census of dust in optically selected galaxies  from stacking at submillimetre wavelengths	we use the herschel-atlas survey to conduct the first large-scale statisticalstudy of the submm properties of optically selected galaxies. using ~80,000r-band selected galaxies from 126 deg^2 of the gama survey, we stack into submmimaging at 250, 350 and 500{\mu}m to gain unprecedented statistics on the dustemission from galaxies at z &lt; 0.35. we find that low redshift galaxies accountfor 5% of the cosmic 250{\mu}m background (4% at 350{\mu}m; 3% at 500{\mu}m),of which approximately 60% comes from 'blue' and 20% from 'red' galaxies(rest-frame g - r). we compare the dust properties of different galaxypopulations by dividing the sample into bins of optical luminosity, stellarmass, colour and redshift. in blue galaxies we find that dust temperature andluminosity correlate strongly with stellar mass at a fixed redshift, but redgalaxies do not follow these correlations and overall have lower luminositiesand temperatures. we make reasonable assumptions to account for thecontaminating flux from lensing by red sequence galaxies and conclude thatgalaxies with different optical colours have fundamentally different dustemission properties. results indicate that while blue galaxies are moreluminous than red galaxies due to higher temperatures, the dust masses of thetwo samples are relatively similar. dust mass is shown to correlate withstellar mass, although the dust/stellar mass ratio is much higher for lowstellar mass galaxies, consistent with the lowest mass galaxies having thehighest specific star formation rates. we stack the 250{\mu}m/nuv luminosityratio, finding results consistent with greater obscuration of star formation atlower stellar mass and higher redshift. submm luminosities and dust masses ofall galaxies are shown to evolve strongly with redshift, indicating a fall inthe amount of obscured star formation in ordinary galaxies over the last fourbillion years.

1205.3368	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): galaxy environments and star formation  rate variations	we present a detailed investigation into the effects of galaxy environment ontheir star formation rates (sfr) using galaxies observed in the galaxy and massassembly survey (gama). we use three independent volume-limited samples ofgalaxies within z &lt; 0.2 and mr &lt; -17.8. we investigate the known sfr-densityrelationship and explore in detail the dependence of sfr on stellar mass anddensity. we show that the sfr-density trend is only visible when we include thepassive galaxy population along with the star-forming population. thissfr-density relation is absent when we consider only the star-formingpopulation of galaxies, consistent with previous work. while there is a strongdependence of the ewh?a on density we find, as in previous studies, that thesetrends are largely due to the passive galaxy population and this relationshipis absent when considering a "star-forming" sample of galaxies. we find thatstellar mass has the strongest influence on sfr and ewh?a with the environmenthaving no significant effect on the star-formation properties of the starforming population. we also show that the sfr-density relationship is absentfor both early and late-type star-forming galaxies. we conclude that thestellar mass has the largest impact on the current sfr of a galaxy, and anyenvironmental effect is not detectable. the observation that the trends withdensity are due to the changing morphology fraction with density implies thatthe timescales must be very short for any quenching of the sfr in infallinggalaxies. alternatively galaxies may in fact undergo predominantly in-situevolution where the infall and quenching of galaxies from the field into denseenvironments is not the dominant evolutionary mode.

1206.0943	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): colour and luminosity dependent  clustering from calibrated photometric redshifts	we measure the two-point angular correlation function of a sample of4,289,223 galaxies with r &lt; 19.4 mag from the sloan digital sky survey as afunction of photometric redshift, absolute magnitude and colour down to m_r -5log h = -14 mag. photometric redshifts are estimated from ugriz modelmagnitudes and two petrosian radii using the artificial neural network packageannz, taking advantage of the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) spectroscopicsample as our training set. the photometric redshifts are then used todetermine absolute magnitudes and colours. for all our samples, we estimate theunderlying redshift and absolute magnitude distributions using monte-carloresampling. these redshift distributions are used in limber's equation toobtain spatial correlation function parameters from power law fits to theangular correlation function. we confirm an increase in clustering strength forsub-l* red galaxies compared with ~l* red galaxies at small scales in allredshift bins, whereas for the blue population the correlation length is almostindependent of luminosity for ~l* galaxies and fainter. a linear relationbetween relative bias and log luminosity is found to hold down to luminositiesl~0.03l*. we find that the redshift dependence of the bias of the l* populationcan be described by the passive evolution model of tegmark &amp; peebles (1998). avisual inspection of a random sample of our r &lt; 19.4 sample of sdss galaxiesreveals that about 10 per cent are spurious, with a higher contamination ratetowards very faint absolute magnitudes due to over-deblended nearby galaxies.we correct for this contamination in our clustering analysis.

1208.4293	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): in search of milky-way magellanic cloud  analogues	analysing all galaxy and mass assembly (gama) galaxies within a factor two(+/- 0.3 dex) of the stellar mass of the milky way (mw), there is a 11.9%chance that one of these galaxies will have a close companion (within aprojected separation of 70 kpc and radial separation of 400 km/s) that is atleast as massive as the large magellanic cloud (lmc). two close companions atleast as massive as the small magellanic cloud (smc) are rare at the 3.4%level. two full analogues to the mw- lmc-smc system were found in gama (allgalaxies late-type and star forming), suggesting such a combination of closetogether, late-type, star-forming galaxies is rare: only 0.4% of mw massgalaxies (in the range where we could observe both the lmc and smc) have such asystem. in summary, the mw-lmc-smc system is a 2.7? event (when recast intogaussian statistics).  using cross-correlation comparisons we find that there is a preference forsmc- lmc binary pair analogues to be located within 2 mpc of a range ofdifferent lumi- nosity groups. there is a particular preference is for suchbinaries to be located near lg luminosity systems. when these groups aresubdivided into small magnitude gap and large magnitude gap subsets, thebinaries prefer to be spatially associated with the small magnitude gapsystems. these systems will be dynamically less evolved, but still offer thesame amount of gravitational dark matter. this suggests that binaries such asthe smc-lmc might be transient systems, usually destroyed during vigorousmerger events. details of a particularly striking analogue to the mw-smc-lmcand m31 complex are included.

1208.5143	evidence for significant growth in the stellar mass of brightest cluster  galaxies over the past 10 billion years	using new and published data, we construct a sample of 160 brightest clustergalaxies (bcgs) spanning the redshift interval 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 1.63. we use thissample, which covers 70% of the history of the universe, to measure the growthin the stellar mass of bcgs after correcting for the correlation between thestellar mass of the bcg and the mass of the cluster in which it lives. we findthat the stellar mass of bcgs increase by a factor of 1.8 between z=0.9 andz=0.2. compared to earlier works, our result is closer to the predictions ofsemi-analytic models. however, bcgs at z=0.9, relative to bcgs at z=0.2, arestill a factor of 1.5 more massive than the predictions of these models. starformation rates in bcgs at z~1 are generally to low to result in significantamounts of mass. instead, it is likely that most of the mass build up occursthrough mainly dry mergers in which perhaps half of the mass is lost to theintra-cluster medium of the cluster.

1209.0259	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the 0.013 &lt; z &lt; 0.1 cosmic spectral  energy distribution from 0.1 micron to 1mm	we use the gama i dataset combined with galex, sdss and ukidss imaging toconstruct the low-redshift (z&lt;0.1) galaxy luminosity functions in fuv, nuv,ugriz, and yjhk bands from within a single well constrained volume of 3.4 x10^5 (mpc/h)^{3}. the derived luminosity distributions are normalised to thesdss dr7 main survey to reduce the estimated cosmic variance to the 5 per centlevel. the data are used to construct the cosmic spectral energy distribution(csed) from 0.1 to 2.1 \mum free from any wavelength dependent cosmic variancefor both the elliptical and non-elliptical populations. the two populationsexhibit dramatically different cseds as expected for a predominantly old andyoung population respectively. using the driver et al. (2008) prescription forthe azimuthally averaged photon escape fraction, the non-ellipticals arecorrected for the impact of dust attenuation and the combined csed constructed.the final results show that the universe is currently generating (1.8 +/- 0.3)x 10^{35} h w mpc^{-3} of which (1.2 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} h w mpc^{-3} isdirectly released into the inter-galactic medium and (0.6 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} hw mpc^{-3} is reprocessed and reradiated by dust in the far-ir. using the gamadata and our dust model we predict the mid and far-ir emission which agreesremarkably well with available data. we therefore provide a robust descriptionof the pre- and post dust attenuated energy output of the nearby universe from0.1micron to 0.6mm. the largest uncertainty in this measurement lies in the midand far-ir bands stemming from the dust attenuation correction and itscurrently poorly constrained dependence on environment, stellar mass, andmorphology.

1209.1636	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the mass-metallicity relationship	context: the mass-metallicity relationship (mmr) of star-forming galaxies iswell-established, however there is still some disagreement with respect to itsexact shape and its possible dependence on other observables. aims: we measurethe mmr in the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. we compare our measuredmmr to that measured in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and study thedependence of the mmr on various selection criteria to identify potentialcauses for disparities seen in the literature. methods: we use strong emissionline ratio diagnostics to derive oxygen abundances. we then apply a range ofselection criteria for the minimum signal-to-noise in various emission lines,as well as the apparent and absolute magnitude to study variations in theinferred mmr. results: the shape and position of the mmr can differsignificantly depending on the metallicity calibration and selection used.after selecting a robust metallicity calibration amongst those tested, we findthat the mass-metallicity relation for redshifts 0.061&lt; z&lt;0.35 in gama is inreasonable agreement with that found in the sdss despite the difference in theluminosity range probed. conclusions: in view of the significant variations ofthe mmr brought about by reasonable changes in the sample selection criteriaand method, we recommend that care be taken when comparing the mmr fromdifferent surveys and studies directly. we also conclude that there could be amodest level of evolution over 0.06&lt;z&lt;0.35 within the gama sample.

1211.6440	herschel-atlas/gama: a difference between star-formation rates in  strong-line and weak-line radio galaxies	we have constructed a sample of radio-loud objects with optical spectroscopyfrom the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) project over the herschel-atlas phase1 fields. classifying the radio sources in terms of their optical spectra, wefind that strong-emission-line sources (`high-excitation radio galaxies') have,on average, a factor ~4 higher 250-micron herschel luminosity than weak-line(`low-excitation') radio galaxies and are also more luminous thanmagnitude-matched radio-quiet galaxies at the same redshift. using all fiveh-atlas bands, we show that this difference in luminosity between theemission-line classes arises mostly from a difference in the average dusttemperature; strong-emission-line sources tend to have comparable dust massesto, but higher dust temperatures than, radio galaxies with weak emission lines.we interpret this as showing that radio galaxies with strong nuclear emissionlines are much more likely to be associated with star formation in their hostgalaxy, although there is certainly not a one-to-one relationship between starformation and strong-line agn activity. the strong-line sources are estimatedto have star-formation rates at least a factor 3-4 higher than those in theweak-line objects. our conclusion is consistent with earlier work, generallycarried out using much smaller samples, and reinforces the general picture ofhigh-excitation radio galaxies as being located in lower-mass, less evolvedhost galaxies than their low-excitation counterparts.

1301.7127	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): spectroscopic analysis	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey is a multiwavelength photometricand spectroscopic survey, using the aaomega spectrograph on theanglo-australian telescope to obtain spectra for up to ~300000 galaxies over280 square degrees, to a limiting magnitude of r_pet &lt; 19.8 mag. the targetgalaxies are distributed over 0&lt;z&lt;0.5 with a median redshift of z~0.2, althoughthe redshift distribution includes a small number of systems, primarilyquasars, at higher redshifts, up to and beyond z=1. the redshift accuracyranges from sigma_v~50km/s to sigma_v~100km/s depending on the signal-to-noiseof the spectrum. here we describe the gama spectroscopic reduction and analysispipeline. we present the steps involved in taking the raw two-dimensionalspectroscopic images through to flux-calibrated one-dimensional spectra. theresulting gama spectra cover an observed wavelength range of 3750&lt;lambda&lt;8850 aat a resolution of r~1300. the final flux calibration is typically accurate to10-20%, although the reliability is worse at the extreme wavelength ends, andpoorer in the blue than the red. we present details of the measurement ofemission and absorption features in the gama spectra. these measurements arecharacterised through a variety of quality control analyses detailing therobustness and reliability of the measurements. we illustrate the quality ofthe measurements with a brief exploration of elementary emission lineproperties of the galaxies in the gama sample. we demonstrate the luminositydependence of the balmer decrement, consistent with previously publishedresults, and explore further how balmer decrement varies with galaxy mass andredshift. we also investigate the mass and redshift dependencies of the[nii]/halpha vs [oiii]/hbeta spectral diagnostic diagram, commonly used todiscriminate between star forming and nuclear activity in galaxies.

1301.7129	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the life and times of l* galaxies	in this work we investigate in detail the effects local environment (groupsand pairs) has on galaxies with stellar mass similar to the milky-way (l*galaxies). a volume limited sample of 6,150 galaxies is classified to determineemission features, morphological type and presence of a disk. this sampleallows for characteristics of galaxies to be isolated (e.g. stellar mass andgroup halo mass), and their codependencies determined.  we observe that galaxy-galaxy interactions play the most important role inshaping the evolution within a group halo, the main role of halo mass is ingathering the galaxies together to encourage such interactions. dominant pairgalaxies find their overall star formation enhanced when the pair's mass ratiois close to 1, otherwise we observe the same galaxies as we would in anunpaired system. the minor galaxy in a pair is greatly affected by itscompanion galaxy, and whilst the star forming fraction is always suppressedrelative to equivalent stellar mass unpaired galaxies, it becomes lower stillwhen the mass ratio of a pair system increases.  we find that, in general, the close galaxy-galaxy interaction rate drops as afunction of halo mass for a given amount of stellar mass. we find evidence of alocal peak of interactions for milky-way stellar mass galaxies in milky-wayhalo mass groups. low mass halos, and in particular local group mass halos, arean important environment for understanding the typical evolutionary path of aunit of stellar mass.  we find compelling evidence for galaxy conformity in both groups and pairs,where morphological type conformity is dominant in groups, and emission classconformity is dominant in pairs. this suggests that group scale conformity isthe result of many galaxy encounters over an extended period of time, whilstpair conformity is a fairly instantaneous response to a transitory interaction.

1302.1379	gama/h-atlas: the dust opacity - stellar mass surface density relation  for spiral galaxies	we report the discovery of a well-defined correlation between b-band face-oncentral optical depth due to dust, \tau^f_b, and the stellar mass surfacedensity, \mu_{*}, of nearby (z &lt; 0.13) spiral galaxies: log(\tau^f_b) =1.12(+-0.11)log(\mu_{*}/m_sol kpc^2)-8.6(+-0.8). this relation was derived froma sample of spiral galaxies taken from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)survey and detected in the fir/submm in the herschel-atlas survey. using aquantitative analysis of the nuv attenuation-inclination relation for completesamples of gama spirals categorized according to \mu_{*} we demonstrate thatthis correlation can be used to statistically correct for dust attenuationpurely on the basis of optical photometry and s'ersic-profile morphologicalfits. considered together with previously established empirical relationshipsbetween stellar mass, metallicity and gas mass, the near linearity and highconstant of proportionality of the \tau^f_b-\mu_{*} relation disfavors astellar origin for the bulk of refractory grains in spiral galaxies, insteadbeing consistent with the existence of a ubiquitous and very rapid mechanismfor the growth of dust in the ism. we use the \tau^f_b-\mu_{*} relation inconjunction with the radiation transfer model for spiral galaxies of popescu &amp;tuffs (2011) to derive intrinsic scaling relations between specific starformation rate (ssfr), stellar mass, and \mu_{*}, in which the attenuation ofthe uv light used to measure the sfr is corrected on an object-to-object basis.a marked reduction in scatter in these relations is achieved which isdemonstrably due to correction of both the inclination-dependent and face-oncomponents of attenuation. our results are consistent with a picture of spiralgalaxies in which most of the submm emission originates from grains residing intranslucent structures, exposed to uv in the diffuse interstellar radiationfield.

1302.4276	gama/h-atlas: linking the properties of sub-mm detected and undetected  early-type galaxies: i. z$\le$0.06 sample	we present two large, nearby (0.013$\le$z$\le$0.06) samples of early-typegalaxies (etgs): a visually classified sample of 220 etgs, created usingsource-matched data from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) database withfir/sub-mm detections from $herschel$-atlas; and a visually classified sampleof 551 etgs which are undetected with $herschel$-atlas. active galactic nuclei(agn) are removed from our samples using optical emission line diagnostics.these samples are scrutinised to determine characteristics of sub-mm detectedversus undetected etgs. we find similarities in the stellar mass distributionsof the two etg samples but testing other properties uncovers significantdifferences. the sub-mm detected sample is shown to have lower concentrationand s\'ersic indices than those in the undetected sample - a result which maybe linked to the presence of dust in the former. optical and uv-optical coloursare also shown to be much bluer, indicating that the dust is linked with recentstar formation. the intrinsic effective radii are on average 1.5 times largerfor the sub-mm detected etgs. surface densities and groups data from the gamadatabase are examined for the two samples, leading to the conclusion that dustyetgs inhabit sparser environments than non-dusty etgs in the nearby universe,although environments of the brightest etgs are shown to differ the least.modified planck functions are fit to the h-atlas detected pacs and spire fluxesfor etgs with sub-mm flux densities of at least 3$\sigma$ in the 350$\mu$mspire band, giving a resultant mean cold dust temperature of t$_{d}$=22.1k,with a range of 9-30k. the corresponding mean dust mass is1.8$\times10^{7}$m$_{\odot}$, with a range of(0.08-35.0)$\times10^{7}$m$_{\odot}$. the dust masses calculated from thesefits, normalised by stellar mass, are shown to increase with decreasing stellarmass and bluer colours.

1304.3889	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the connection between metals,  specific-sfr, and hi gas in galaxies: the z-ssfr relation	we study the interplay between gas phase metallicity (z), specific starformation rate (ssfr) and neutral hydrogen gas (hi) for galaxies of differentstellar masses. our study uses spectroscopic data from gama and sdss starforming galaxies, as well as hi-detection from the alfalfa and gass publiccatalogues. we present a model based on the z-ssfr relation that shows that ata given stellar mass, depending on the amount of gas, galaxies will followopposite behaviours. low-mass galaxies with a large amount of gas will showhigh ssfr and low metallicities, while low-mass galaxies with small amounts ofgas will show lower ssfr and high metallicities. in contrast, massive galaxieswith a large amount of gas will show moderate ssfr and high metallicities,while massive galaxies with small amounts of gas will show low ssfr and lowmetallicities. using alfalfa and gass counterparts, we find that the amount ofgas is related to those drastic differences in z and ssfr for galaxies of asimilar stellar mass.

1305.0424	{\em herschel}-atlas/gama: the environmental density of far-infrared  bright galaxies at $z \leq 0.5$	we compare the environmental and star formation properties of far-infrareddetected and non--far-infrared detected galaxies out to $z \sim0.5$. usingoptical spectroscopy and photometry from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)and sloan digital sky survey (sdss), with far-infrared observations from the{\em herschel}-atlas science demonstration phase (sdp), we apply the techniqueof voronoi tessellations to analyse the environmental densities of individualgalaxies. applying statistical analyses to colour, $r-$band magnitude andredshift-matched samples, we show there to be a significant difference at the3.5$\sigma$ level between the normalized environmental densities of these twopopulations. this is such that infrared emission (a tracer of star formationactivity) favours underdense regions compared to those inhabited by exclusivelyoptically observed galaxies selected to be of the same $r-$band magnitude,colour and redshift. thus more highly star-forming galaxies are found to residein the most underdense environments, confirming previous studies that haveproposed such a correlation. however, the degeneracy between redshift andfar-infrared luminosity in our flux-density limited sample means that we areunable to make a stronger statement in this respect. we then apply our methodto synthetic light cones generated from semi-analytic models, finding that overthe whole redshift distribution the same correlations between star-formationrate and environmental density are found.

1305.5308	galaxy and mass assembly: evolution of the halpha luminosity function  and star formation rate density up to z&lt;0.35	measurements of the low-z halpha luminosity function have a large dispersionin the local number density of sources, and correspondingly in the sfr density.the possible causes for these discrepancies include limited volume sampling,biases arising from survey sample selection, different methods of correctingfor dust obscuration and agn contamination. the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)survey and sloan digital sky survey (sdss) provide deep spectroscopicobservations over a wide sky area enabling detection of a large sample ofstar-forming galaxies spanning 0.001&lt;sfr(halpha)&lt;100 with which to robustlymeasure the evolution of the sfr density in the low-z universe. the largenumber of high sfr galaxies present in our sample allow an improved measurementof the bright end of the luminosity function, indicating that the decrease innumber density of sources at bright luminosities is best described by asaunders functional form rather than the traditional schechter function. thisresult is consistent with other published luminosity functions in the fir andradio. for gama and sdss we find the r-band apparent magnitude limit, combinedwith the subsequent requirement for halpha detection leads to an incompletenessdue to missing bright halpha sources with faint r-band magnitudes.

1306.1583	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): a deeper view of the mass, metallicity,  and sfr relationships	a full appreciation of the role played by gas metallicity (z), star-formationrate (sfr), and stellar mass is fundamental to understanding how galaxies formand evolve. the connections between these three parameters at differentredshifts significantly affect galaxy evolution, and thus provide importantconstraints for galaxy evolution models. using data from the sloan digital skysurvey-data release 7 (sdss-dr7) and the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)surveys we study the relationships and dependencies between sfr, z, and stellarmass, as well as the fundamental plane for star-forming galaxies. we combineboth surveys using volume-limited samples up to a redshift of z ~ 0.36. thegama and sdss surveys complement each other when analyzing the relationshipsbetween sfr, mass and z. we present evidence for sfr and metallicity evolutionto z ~ 0.2. we study the dependencies between sfr, mass, z, and specificstar-formation rate (ssfr) on the m-z, m-sfr, m-ssfr, z-sfr, and z-ssfrrelations, finding strong correlations between all. based on thosedependencies, we propose a simple model that allows us to explain the differentbehaviour observed between low and high mass galaxies. finally, our analysisallows us to confirm the existence of a fundamental plane, for which mass=f(z,sfr) in star-forming galaxies.

1306.2424	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): linking star formation histories and  stellar mass growth	we present evidence for stochastic star formation histories in low-mass (m* &lt;10^10 msun) galaxies from observations within the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey. for ~73,000 galaxies between 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.32, we calculate starformation rates (sfr) and specific star formation rates (ssfr = sfr/m*) fromspectroscopic halpha measurements and apply dust corrections derived frombalmer decrements. we find a dependence of ssfr on stellar mass, such thatssfrs decrease with increasing stellar mass for star-forming galaxies, and forthe full sample, ssfrs decrease as a stronger function of stellar mass. we usesimple parametrizations of exponentially declining star formation histories toinvestigate the dependence on stellar mass of the star formation timescale andthe formation redshift. we find that parametrizations previously fit to samplesof z~1 galaxies cannot recover the distributions of ssfrs and stellar massesobserved in the gama sample between 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.32. in particular, a large numberof low-mass (m* &lt; 10^10 msun) galaxies are observed to have much higher ssfrsthan can be explained by these simple models over the redshift range of0.05&lt;z&lt;0.32, even when invoking mass-dependent staged evolution. for such alarge number of galaxies to maintain low stellar masses, yet harbour such highssfrs, requires the late onset of a weak underlying exponentially declining sfhwith stochastic bursts of star formation superimposed.

1308.2985	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): resolving the role of environment in  galaxy evolution	we present observations of 18 galaxies from the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey made with the spiral optical integral field unit (ifu) on theanglo-australian telescope. the galaxies are selected to have a narrow range instellar mass (6x10^9msolar &lt; m* &lt;2x10^10 msolar) in order to focus on theeffects of environment. local galaxy environments are measured quantitativelyusing 5th nearest neighbour surface densities. we find that the total starformation rates (sfr) measured from the ifu data are consistent with total sfrsmeasured from aperture correcting either gama or sloan digital sky surveysingle-fibre observations. the mean differences are sfr_gama/sfr_ifu =1.26+/-0.23, sigma=0.90 and for the sloan digital sky survey we similarly findsfr_brinchmann/sfr_ifu = 1.34+/-0.17, sigma=0.67. examining the relationshipswith environment, we find off-centre and clumpy halpha emission is notsignificantly dependent on environment, being present in 2/7 (29^+20_-11 percent) galaxies in high-density environments (&gt;0.77 mpc^-2), and 5/11(45^+15_-13 per cent) galaxies in low-density environments (&lt;0.77 mpc^-2). wefind a weak but not significant relationship of the total star formation ratesof star-forming galaxies with environment. due to the size of our sample andthe scatter observed we do not draw a definitive conclusion about a possiblesfr dependence on environment. examining the spatial distribution of the halphaemission, we find no evidence for a change in shape or amplitude of the radialprofile of star-forming galaxies with environment. if these observations areborne out in larger samples this would infer that any environment-drivenstar-formation suppression must either act very rapidly (the`infall-and-quench' model) or that galaxies must evolve in a density-dependentmanner (an `in-situ evolution' model).

1402.4139	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): testing galaxy formation models through  the most massive galaxies in the universe	we have analysed the growth of brightest group galaxies and brightest clustergalaxies (bggs/bcgs) over the last 3 billion years using a large sample of 883galaxies from the galaxy and mass assembly survey. by comparing the stellarmass of bggs and bcgs in groups and clusters of similar dynamical masses, wefind no significant growth between redshift $z=0.27$ and $z=0.09$. we alsoexamine the number of bggs/bcgs that have line emission, finding thatapproximately 65 per cent of bggs/bcgs show h$\alpha$ in emission. from thegalaxies where the necessary spectroscopic lines were accurately recovered (54per cent of the sample), we find that half of this (i.e. 27 per cent of thesample) harbour on-going star formation with rates up to$10\,$m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, and the other half (i.e. 27 per cent of the sample)have an active nucleus (agn) at the centre. bggs are more likely to haveongoing star formation, while bcgs show a higher fraction of agn activity. byexamining the position of the bggs/bcgs with respect to their host dark matterhalo we find that around 13 per cent of them do not lie at the centre of thedark matter halo. this could be an indicator of recent cluster-cluster mergers.we conclude that bggs and bcgs acquired their stellar mass rapidly at higherredshifts as predicted by semi-analytic models, mildly slowing down at lowredshifts.

1404.2626	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): autoz spectral redshift measurements,  confidence and errors	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey has obtained spectra of over230000 targets using the anglo-australian telescope. to homogenise the redshiftmeasurements and improve the reliability, a fully automatic redshift code wasdeveloped (autoz). the measurements were made using a cross-correlation methodfor both absorption-line and emission-line spectra. large deviations in thehigh-pass filtered spectra are partially clipped in order to be robust againstuncorrected artefacts and to reduce the weight given to single-line matches. asingle figure of merit (fom) was developed that puts all template matches ontoa similar confidence scale. the redshift confidence as a function of the fomwas fitted with a tanh function using a maximum likelihood method applied torepeat observations of targets. the method could be adapted to provide robustautomatic redshifts for other large galaxy redshift surveys. for the gamasurvey, there was a substantial improvement in the reliability of assignedredshifts and in the lowering of redshift uncertainties with a median velocityuncertainty of 33 km/s.

1408.1476	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): galaxy close-pairs, mergers, and the  future fate of stellar mass	we use a highly complete subset of the gama-ii redshift sample to fullydescribe the stellar mass dependence of close-pairs and mergers between 10^8msun and 10^12 msun. using the analytic form of this fit we investigate thetotal stellar mass accreting onto more massive galaxies across all mass ratios.depending on how conservatively we select our robust merging systems, thefraction of mass merging onto more massive companions is 2.0%-5.6%. using thegama-ii data we see no significant evidence for a change in the close-pairfraction between redshift $z = 0.05-0.2$. however, we find a systematicallyhigher fraction of galaxies in similar mass close-pairs compared to publishedresults over a similar redshift baseline. using a compendium of data and thefunction $\gamma_m =a(1+z)m$ to predict the major close-pair fraction, we findfitting parameters of $a = 0.021 \pm 0.001$ and $m = 1.53 \pm 0.08$, whichrepresents a higher low-redshift normalisation and shallower power-law slopethan recent literature values. we find that the relative importance of in-situstar-formation versus galaxy merging is inversely correlated, withstar-formation dominating the addition of stellar material below mstar andmerger accretion events dominating beyond mstar. we find mergers have ameasurable impact on the whole extent of the gsmf, manifest as a deepening ofthe dip in the gsmf over the next gyr and an increase in mstar by as much as0.01-0.05 dex.

1409.4681	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the dependence of the galaxy luminosity  function on environment, redshift and colour	we use 80922 galaxies in the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey tomeasure the galaxy luminosity function (lf) in different environments over theredshift range 0.04&lt;z&lt;0.26. the depth and size of gama allows us to definesamples split by colour and redshift to measure the dependence of the lf onenvironment, redshift and colour. we find that the lf varies smoothly withoverdensity, consistent with previous results, with little environmentaldependent evolution over the last 3 gyrs. the modified galform modelpredictions agree remarkably well with our lfs split by environment,particularly in the most overdense environments. the lfs predicted by the modelfor both blue and red galaxies are consistent with gama for the environmentsand luminosities at which such galaxies dominate. discrepancies between themodel and the data seen in the faint end of the lf suggest too many faint redgalaxies are predicted, which is likely to be due to the over-quenching ofsatellite galaxies. the excess of bright blue galaxies predicted in underdenseregions could be due to the implementation of agn feedback not beingsufficiently effective in the lower mass halos.

1409.7295	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the unimodal nature of the dwarf galaxy  population	in this paper we aim to (i) test the number of statistically distinct classesrequired to classify the local galaxy population, and, (ii) identify thedifferences in the physical and star formation properties of visually-distinctgalaxies. to accomplish this, we analyse the structural parameters (effectiveradius r_e, effective surface brightness within r_e (mu_e), central surfacebrightness (mu_0), and s'ersic index (n)), obtained by fitting the lightprofile of 432 galaxies (0.002&lt;z&lt;=0.02 viking z-band), and their spectralenergy distribution using multi-band photometry in 18 broadbands to obtain thestellar mass (m*), the star formation rate (sfr), the specific sfr (ssfr) andthe dust mass (m_{dust}), respectively.  we show that visually distinct, star-forming dwarf galaxies (irregulars, bluespheroids and low surface brightness galaxies) form a unimodal population in aparameter space mapped by mu_e, mu_0, n, r_e, sfr, ssfr, m*, m_{dust} and(g-i). the sfr and ssfr distribution of passively evolving (dwarf) ellipticalson the other hand, statistically distinguish them from other galaxies withsimilar luminosity, while the giant galaxies clearly segregate intostar-forming spirals and passive lenticulars. we therefore suggest that themorphology classification scheme(s) used in literature for dwarf galaxies onlyreflect the observational differences based on luminosity and surfacebrightness among the apparent distinct classes, rather than any physicaldifferences between them.

1412.2141	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the galaxy luminosity function within  the cosmic web	we investigate the dependence of the galaxy luminosity function on geometricenvironment within the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. the tidal tensorprescription, based on the hessian of the pseudo-gravitational potential, isused to classify the cosmic web and define the geometric environments: for agiven smoothing scale, we classify every position of the surveyed region,$0.04&lt;{z}&lt;0.26$, as either a void, a sheet, a filament or a knot. we considerhow to choose appropriate thresholds in the eigenvalues of the hessian in orderto partition the galaxies approximately evenly between environments. we find asignificant variation in the luminosity function of galaxies between differentgeometric environments; the normalisation, characterised by $\phi^{*}$ in aschechter function fit, increases by an order of magnitude from voids to knots.the turnover magnitude, characterised by $m^*$, brightens by approximately$0.5$ mag from voids to knots. however, we show that the observed modulationcan be entirely attributed to the indirect local-density dependence. wetherefore find no evidence of a direct influence of the cosmic web on thegalaxy luminosity function.

1503.01128	a multi-wavelength exploration of the [cii]/ir ratio in h-atlas/gama  galaxies out to z=0.2	we explore the behaviour of [cii]-157.74um forbidden fine-structure lineobserved in a sample of 28 galaxies selected from ~50deg^2 of the h-atlassurvey. the sample is restricted to galaxies with flux densities higher thans_160um&gt;150mjy and optical spectra from the gama survey at 0.02&lt;z&lt;0.2. far-irspectra centred on this redshifted line were taken with the pacs instrumenton-board the herschel space observatory. the galaxies span 10&lt;log(l_ir/lo)&lt;12(where l_ir=l_ir[8-1000um]) and 7.3&lt;log(l_[cii]/lo)&lt;9.3, covering a variety ofoptical galaxy morphologies. the sample exhibits the so-called [cii] deficit athigh ir luminosities, i.e. l_[cii]/l_ir (hereafter [cii]/ir) decreases at highl_ir. we find significant differences between those galaxies presenting[cii]/ir&gt;2.5x10^-3 with respect to those showing lower ratios. in particular,those with high ratios tend to have: (1) l_ir&lt;10^11lo; (2) cold dusttemperatures, t_d&lt;30k; (3) disk-like morphologies in r-band images; (4) a wisecolour 0.5&lt;s_12um/s_22um&lt;1.0; (5) low surface brightness sigma_ir~10^8-9 lokpc^-2, (6) and specific star-formation rates of ssfr~0.05-3 gyr^-1. we suggestthat the strength of the far-uv radiation fields (&lt;g_o&gt;) is main parameterresponsible for controlling the [cii]/ir ratio. it is possible that relativelyhigh &lt;g_o&gt; creates a positively charged dust grain distribution, impeding anefficient photo-electric extraction of electrons from these grains to thencollisionally excite carbon atoms. within the brighter ir population,11&lt;log(l_ir/lo)&lt;12, the low [cii]/ir ratio is unlikely to be modified by [cii]self absorption or controlled by the presence of a moderately luminous agn(identified via the bpt diagram).

1503.04813	galaxy and mass assembly (gama) blended spectra catalog: strong  galaxy-galaxy lens and occulting galaxy pair candidates	we present the catalogue of blended galaxy spectra from the galaxy and massassembly (gama) survey. these are cases where light from two galaxies aresignificantly detected in a single gama fibre. galaxy pairs identified fromtheir blended spectrum fall into two principal classes: they are either stronglenses, a passive galaxy lensing an emission-line galaxy; or occultinggalaxies, serendipitous overlaps of two galaxies, of any type. blended spectracan thus be used to reliably identify strong lenses for follow-up observations(high resolution imaging) and occulting pairs, especially those that are alate-type partly obscuring an early-type galaxy which are of interest for thestudy of dust content of spiral and irregular galaxies. the gama survey setupand its autoz automated redshift determination were used to identify candidateblended galaxy spectra from the cross-correlation peaks. we identify 280blended spectra with a minimum velocity separation of 600 km/s, of which 104are lens pair candidates, 71 emission-line-passive pairs, 78 are pairs ofemission-line galaxies and and 27 are pairs of galaxies with passive spectra.we have visually inspected the candidates in the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) and kilo degree survey (kids) images. many blended objects areellipticals with blue fuzz (ef in our classification). these latter "ef"classifications are candidates for possible strong lenses, massive ellipticalswith an emission-line galaxy in one or more lensed images. the gama lens andocculting galaxy candidate samples are similar in size to those identified inthe entire sdss. this blended spectrum sample stands as a testament of thepower of this highly complete, second-largest spectroscopic survey in existenceand offers the possibility to expand e.g., strong gravitational lens surveys.

1505.06947	h-atlas/gama and hevics - dusty early-type galaxies in different  environments	the herschel space observatory has had a tremendous impact on the study ofextragalactic dust. specifically, early-type galaxies (etg) have been the focusof several studies. in this paper we combine results from two herschel studies- a virgo cluster study hevics and a broader, low-redshift h-atlas/gama study -and contrast the dust and associated properties for similar mass galaxies. thiscomparison is motivated by differences in results exhibited between multipleherschel studies of early-type galaxies. a comparison between consistentmodified blackbody derived dust mass is carried out, revealing strongdifferences between the two samples in both dust mass and dust-to-stellar massratio. in particular, the hevics sample lacks massive etg with as high aspecific dust content as found in h-atlas. this is most likely connected withthe difference in environment for the two samples. we calculate nearestneighbour environment densities in a consistent way, showing that h-atlas etgoccupy sparser regions of the local universe, whereas hevics etg occupy denseregions. this is also true for etg that are not herschel-detected but are inthe virgo and gama parent samples. spectral energy distributions are fit to thepanchromatic data. from these we find that in h-atlas the specific starformation rate anticorrelates with stellar mass and reaches values as high asin our galaxy. on the other hand hevics etg appear to have little starformation. based on the trends found here, h-atlas etg are thought to have moreextended star formation histories and a younger stellar population than hevicsetg.

1506.08222	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): end of survey report and data release 2	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey is one of the largest contemporaryspectroscopic surveys of low-redshift galaxies. covering an area of ~286 deg^2(split among five survey regions) down to a limiting magnitude of r &lt; 19.8 mag,we have collected spectra and reliable redshifts for 238,000 objects using theaaomega spectrograph on the anglo-australian telescope. in addition, we haveassembled imaging data from a number of independent surveys in order togenerate photometry spanning the wavelength range 1 nm - 1 m. here we report onthe recently completed spectroscopic survey and present a series of diagnosticsto assess its final state and the quality of the redshift data. we alsodescribe a number of survey aspects and procedures, or updates thereof,including changes to the input catalogue, redshifting and re-redshifting, andthe derivation of ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared photometry. finally,we present the second public release of gama data. in this release we provideinput catalogue and targeting information, spectra, redshifts, ultraviolet,optical and near-infrared photometry, single-component s\'ersic fits, stellarmasses, h$\alpha$-derived star formation rates, environment information, andgroup properties for all galaxies with r &lt; 19.0 mag in two of our surveyregions, and for all galaxies with r &lt; 19.4 mag in a third region (72,225objects in total). the database serving these data is available athttp://www.gama-survey.org/.

1507.04447	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the effect of close interactions on  star formation in galaxies	the modification of star formation (sf) in galaxy interactions is a complexprocess, with sf observed to be both enhanced in major mergers and suppressedin minor pair interactions. such changes likely to arise on short timescalesand be directly related to the galaxy-galaxy interaction time. here weinvestigate the link between dynamical phase and direct measures of sf ondifferent timescales for pair galaxies, targeting numerous star-formation rate(sfr) indicators and comparing to pair separation, individual galaxy mass andpair mass ratio. we split our sample into the higher (primary) and lower(secondary) mass galaxies in each pair and find that sf is indeed enhanced inall primary galaxies but suppressed in secondaries of minor mergers. we findthat changes in sf of primaries is consistent in both major and minor mergers,suggesting that sf in the more massive galaxy is agnostic to pair mass ratio.we also find that sf is enhanced/suppressed more strongly for short-timeduration sfr indicators (e.g. h-alpha), highlighting recent changes to sf inthese galaxies, which are likely to be induced by the interaction. we propose ascenario where the lower mass galaxy has its sf suppressed by gas heating orstripping, while the higher mass galaxy has its sf enhanced, potentially bytidal gas turbulence and shocks. this is consistent with the seeminglycontradictory observations for both sf suppression and enhancement in closepairs.

1508.06186	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the bright void galaxy population in  the optical and mid-ir	we examine the properties of galaxies in the galaxies and mass assembly(gama) survey located in voids with radii $&gt;10~h^{-1}$ mpc. utilising the gamaequatorial survey, 592 void galaxies are identified out to z~0.1 brighter than$m_{r} = -18.4$, our magnitude completeness limit. using the $w_{\rm{h\alpha}}$vs. [nii]/h$\alpha$ (whan) line strength diagnostic diagram, we classify theirspectra as star forming, agn, or dominated by old stellar populations. forobjects more massive than $5\times10^{9}$ m$_{\odot}$, we identify a sample of26 void galaxies with old stellar populations classed as passive and retiredgalaxies in the whan diagnostic diagram, else they lack any emission lines intheir spectra. when matched to wise mid-ir photometry, these passive andretired galaxies exhibit a range of mid-ir colour, with a number of voidgalaxies exhibiting [4.6]-[12] colours inconsistent with completely quenchedstellar populations, with a similar spread in colour seen for a randomly drawnnon-void comparison sample. we hypothesise that a number of these galaxies hostobscured star formation, else they are star forming outside of their centralregions targeted for single fibre spectroscopy. when matched to a randomlydrawn sample of non-void galaxies, the void and non-void galaxies exhibitsimilar properties in terms of optical and mid-ir colour, morphology, and starformation activity, suggesting comparable mass assembly and quenchinghistories. a trend in mid-ir [4.6]-[12] colour is seen, such that both void andnon-void galaxies with quenched/passive colours &lt;1.5 typically have masseshigher than $10^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$, where internally driven processes play anincreasingly important role in galaxy evolution.

1509.02641	the sami pilot survey: stellar kinematics of galaxies in abell 85, 168  and 2399	we present the sami pilot survey, consisting of integral field spectroscopyof 106 galaxies across three galaxy clusters, abell 85, abell 168 and abell2399. the galaxies were selected by absolute magnitude to have $m_r&lt;-20.25$mag. the survey, using the sydney-aao multi-object integral field spectrograph(sami), comprises observations of galaxies of all morphological types with 75\%of the sample being early-type galaxies (etgs) and 25\% being late-typegalaxies (ltgs). stellar velocity and velocity dispersion maps are derived forall 106 galaxies in the sample.  the $\lambda_{r}$ parameter, a proxy for the specific stellar angularmomentum, is calculated for each galaxy in the sample. we find a trend between$\lambda_{r}$ and galaxy concentration such that ltgs are less concentratedhigher angular momentum systems, with the fast-rotating etgs (frs) moreconcentrated and lower in angular momentum. this suggests that some dynamicalprocesses are involved in transforming ltgs to frs, though a significantoverlap between the $\lambda_{r}$ distributions of these classes of galaxiesimplies that this is just one piece of a more complicated picture.  we measure the kinematic misalignment angle, $\psi$, for the etgs in thesample, to probe the intrinsic shapes of the galaxies. we find the majority offrs (83\%) to be aligned, consistent with them being oblate spheroids (i.e.disks). the slow rotating etgs (srs), on the other hand, are significantly morelikely to show kinematic misalignment (only 38\% are aligned). this confirmsprevious results that srs are likely to be mildly triaxial systems.

1511.02245	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): growing up in a bad neighbourhood - how  do low-mass galaxies become passive?	both theoretical predictions and observations of the very nearby universesuggest that low-mass galaxies (log$_{10}$[m$_{*}$/m$_{\odot}$]&lt;9.5) are likelyto remain star-forming unless they are affected by their local environment. totest this premise, we compare and contrast the local environment of bothpassive and star-forming galaxies as a function of stellar mass, using thegalaxy and mass assembly survey. we find that passive fractions are higher inboth interacting pair and group galaxies than the field at all stellar masses,and that this effect is most apparent in the lowest mass galaxies. we also findthat essentially all passive log$_{10}$[m$_{*}$/m$_{\odot}$]&lt;8.5 galaxies arefound in pair/group environments, suggesting that local interactions with amore massive neighbour cause them to cease forming new stars. we find that theeffects of immediate environment (local galaxy-galaxy interactions) in formingpassive systems increases with decreasing stellar mass, and highlight that thisis potentially due to increasing interaction timescales giving sufficient timefor the galaxy to become passive via starvation. we then present a simplisticmodel to test this premise, and show that given our speculative assumptions, itis consistent with our observed results.

1511.08018	h-atlas/gama: the nature and characteristics of optically red galaxies  detected at submillimetre wavelengths	we combine herschel/spire sub-millimeter (submm) observations with existingmulti-wavelength data to investigate the characteristics of low redshift,optically red galaxies detected in submm bands. we select a sample of galaxiesin the redshift range 0.01$\leq$z$\leq$0.2, having &gt;5$\sigma$ detections in thespire 250 micron submm waveband. sources are then divided into two sub-samplesof $red$ and $blue$ galaxies, based on their uv-optical colours. galaxies inthe $red$ sample account for $\approx$4.2 per cent of the total number ofsources with stellar masses m$_{*}\gtrsim$10$^{10}$ solar-mass. followingvisual classification of the $red$ galaxies, we find that $\gtrsim$30 per centof them are early-type galaxies and $\gtrsim$40 per cent are spirals. thecolour of the $red$-spiral galaxies could be the result of their highlyinclined orientation and/or a strong contribution of the old stellarpopulation.  it is found that irrespective of their morphological types, $red$ and $blue$sources occupy environments with more or less similar densities (i.e., the$\sigma_5$ parameter). from the analysis of the spectral energy distributions(seds) of galaxies in our samples based on magphys, we find that galaxies inthe $red$ sample (of any morphological type) have dust masses similar to thosein the $blue$ sample (i.e. normal spiral/star-forming systems). however, incomparison to the $red$-spirals and in particular $blue$ systems,$red$-ellipticals have lower mean dust-to-stellar mass ratios. besides galaxiesin the $red$-elliptical sample have much lower meanstar-formation/specific-star-formation rates in contrast to their counterpartsin the $blue$ sample. our results support a scenario where dust in early-typesystems is likely to be of an external origin.

1601.00003	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the 325 mhz radio luminosity function  of agn and star forming galaxies	measurement of the evolution of both active galactic nuclei (agn) andstar-formation in galaxies underpins our understanding of galaxy evolution overcosmic time. radio continuum observations can provide key information on thesetwo processes, in particular via the mechanical feedback produced by radio jetsin agn, and via an unbiased dust-independent measurement of star-formationrates. in this paper we determine radio luminosity functions at 325 mhz for asample of agn and star-forming galaxies by matching a 138 deg sq. radio surveyconducted with the giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt), with optical imagingand redshifts from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. we find that theradio luminosity function at 325 mhz for star-forming galaxies closely followsthat measured at 1.4 ghz. by fitting the agn radio luminosity function out to$z = 0.5$ as a double power law, and parametrizing the evolution as ${\phi}\propto (1 + z)^{k}$ , we find evolution parameters of $k = 0.92 \pm 0.95$assuming pure density evolution and $k = 2.13 \pm 1.96$ assuming pureluminosity evolution. we find that the low excitation radio galaxies are thedominant population in space density at lower luminosities. comparing our 325mhz observations with radio continuum imaging at 1.4 ghz, we determine separateradio luminosity functions for steep and flat-spectrum agn, and show that thebeamed population of flat-spectrum sources in our sample can be shifted innumber density and luminosity to coincide with the unbeamed population ofsteep-spectrum sources, as is expected in the orientation based unification ofagn.
