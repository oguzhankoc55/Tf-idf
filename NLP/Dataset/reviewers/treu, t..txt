0902.4804	the mass profile of early-type galaxies in overdense environments: the  case of the double source plane gravitational lens sl2sj02176-0513	sl2sj02176-0513 is a remarkable lens for the presence of two multiply-imagedsystems at different redshifts lensed by a foreground massive galaxy at $z_{\rmlens}=0.656$: a bright cusp arc at $z_{\rm arc}=1.847$ and an additionaldouble-image system at an estimated redshift of $z_{\rm dbl}\sim2.9$ based onphotometry and lensing geometry. the system is located about 400 kpc away fromthe center of a massive group of galaxies. mass estimates for the group areavailable from x-ray observations and satellite kinematics. multicolorphotometry provides an estimate of the stellar mass of the main lens galaxy.the lensing galaxy is modeled with two components (stars and dark matter), andwe include the perturbing effect of the group environment, and all availableconstraints. we find that classic lensing degeneracies, e.g. between externalconvergence and mass density slope, are significantly reduced with respect tostandard systems and infer tight constraints on the mass density profile: (i)the dark matter content of the main lens galaxy is in line with that of typicalgalaxies $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm e})=0.41^{+0.09}_{-0.06}$; (ii) the required massassociated with the dark matter halo of the nearby group is consistent withx-ray and weak-lensing estimates ($\sigma_{\rm grp}=550^{+130}_{-240}$); (iii)accounting for the group contribution in the form of an external convergence,the slope of the mass density profile of the main lens galaxy alone is found tobe $\alpha=-1.03^{+0.22}_{-0.16}$, consistent with the isothermal ($\alpha=-1$)slope. we demonstrate that multiple source plane systems together with goodancillary dataset can be used to disentangle local and environmental effects.

0906.1349	the structure &amp; dynamics of massive early-type galaxies: on homology,  isothermality and isotropy inside one effective radius	based on 58 slacs strong-lens early-type galaxies with direct total-mass andstellar-velocity dispersion measurements, we find that inside one effectiveradius massive elliptical galaxies with m_eff &gt;= 3x10^10 m_sun arewell-approximated by a power-law ellipsoid with an average logaritmic densityslope of &lt;gamma'_ld&gt; = -dlog(rho_tot)/dlog(r)=2.085^{+0.025}_{-0.018} (randomerror on mean) for isotropic orbits with beta_r=0, +-0.1 (syst.) andsigma_gamma' &lt;= 0.20^{+0.04}_{-0.02} intrinsic scatter (all errors indicate the68 percent cl). we find no correlation of gamma'_ld with galaxy mass (m_eff),rescaled radius (i.e. r_einst/r_eff) or redshift, despite intrinsic differencesin density-slope between galaxies. based on scaling relations, the averagelogarithmic density slope can be derived in an alternative manner, fullyindependent from dynamics, yielding &lt;gamma'_sr&gt;=1.959 +- 0.077. agreementbetween the two values is reached for &lt;beta_r&gt; =0.45 +- 0.25, consistent withmild radial anisotropy. this agreement supports the robustness of our results,despite the increase in mass-to-light ratio with total galaxy mass: m_eff ~l_{v,eff}^(1.363+-0.056). we conclude that massive early-type galaxies arestructurally close-to homologous with close-to isothermal total densityprofiles (&lt;=10 percent intrinsic scatter) and have at most some mild radialanisotropy. our results provide new observational limits on galaxy formationand evolution scenarios, covering four gyr look-back time.

0909.3527	the distribution of dark matter over 3 decades in radius in the lensing  cluster abell 611	we present a detailed analysis of the baryonic and dark matter distributionin the lensing cluster abell 611 (z=0.288), with the goal of determining thedark matter profile over an unprecedented range of cluster-centric distance. bycombining three complementary probes of the mass distribution, weak lensingfrom deep multi-color imaging, strong lensing constraints based on theidentification of multiply-imaged sources, and resolved stellar velocitydispersion measures for the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg), we extend themethodology for separating the dark and baryonic mass components introduced bysand et al. (2008). our resulting dark matter profile samples the cluster from~3 kpc to 3.25 mpc, thereby providing an excellent basis for comparisons withrecent numerical models. we demonstrate that only by combining our threeobservational techniques can degeneracies in constraining the form of the darkmatter profile be broken on scales crucial for detailed comparisons withnumerical simulations. our analysis reveals that a simple navarro, frenk, andwhite (nfw) profile is an unacceptable fit to our data. we confirm earlierclaims that the inner profile of the dark matter profile deviates significantlyfrom the nfw form and find a inner logarithmic slope \beta flatter than 0.3(68%; where rho_dm ~ r^{-\beta} at small radii). in order to reconcile our datawith cluster formation in a lambdacdm cosmology, we speculate that it may benecessary to revise our understanding of the nature of baryon--dark matterinteractions in cluster cores. comprehensive weak and strong lensing data, whencoupled with kinematic information on the brightest cluster galaxy, can readilybe applied to a larger sample of clusters to test the universality of theseresults.

0910.0760	detection of a dark substructure through gravitational imaging	we report the detection of a dark substructure through direct gravitationalimaging - undetected in the hst-acs f814w image - in the gravitational lensgalaxy of slacs sdssj0946+1006 (the "double einstein ring"). the detection isbased on a bayesian grid reconstruction of the two-dimensional surface densityof the galaxy inside an annulus around its einstein radius (few kpc). [...] weconfirm this detection by modeling the system including a parametric mass modelwith a tidally truncated pseudo-jaffe density profile; in that case thesubstructure mass is m_sub=(3.51+-0.15)x10^9 msun, located at(-0.651+-0.038,1.040+-0.034)'', precisely where also the surface density mapshows a strong convergence peak. [...] we set a lower limit of (m/l)_v}&gt;=120(msun/l}_v,sun (3-sigma) inside a sphere of 0.3 kpc centred on the substructure(r_tidal=1.1kpc). the result is robust under substantial changes in the modeland the data-set (e.g. psf, pixel number and scale, source and potentialregularization, rotations and galaxy subtraction). despite being at the limitsof detectability, it can therefore not be attributed to obvious systematiceffects. our detection implies a dark matter mass fraction at the radius of theinner einstein ring of f_cdm=2.15^{+2.05}_{-1.25} percent (68 percent c.l) inthe mass range 4x10^6 msun to 4x10^9 msun assuming alpha=1.9+-0.1 (with dn/dm ~m^-alpha). assuming a flat prior on alpha, between 1.0 and 3.0, increases thisto f_cdm=2.56^{+3.26}_{-1.50} percent (68 percent c.l). the likelihood ratio is0.51 between our best value (f_cdm=0.0215) and that from simulations(f_sim=0.003). hence the inferred mass fraction, admittedly based on a singlelens system, is large but still consistent with predictions.

0910.1133	the mass distribution of a moderate redshift galaxy group and brightest  group galaxy from gravitational lensing and kinematics	the gravitational lens system class b2108+213 has two radio-loud lensedimages separated by 4.56 arcsec. the relatively large image separation impliesthat the lensing is caused by a group of galaxies. in this paper, new opticalimaging and spectroscopic data for the lensing galaxies of b2108+213 and thesurrounding field galaxies are presented. these data are used to investigatethe mass and composition of the lensing structure. the redshift and stellarvelocity dispersion of the main lensing galaxy (g1) are found to be z = 0.3648+/- 0.0002 and sigma_v = 325 +/- 25 km/s, respectively. the optical spectrum ofthe lensed quasar shows no obvious emission or absorption features and isconsistent with a bl lac type radio source. however, the tentative detection ofthe g-band and mg-b absorption lines, and a break in the spectrum of the hostgalaxy of the lensed quasar gives a likely source redshift of z = 0.67.spectroscopy of the field around b2108+213 finds 51 galaxies at a similarredshift to g1, thus confirming that there is a much larger structure at z ~0.365 associated with this system. the width of the group velocity distributionis 694 +/- 93 km/s, but is non-gaussian, implying that the structure is not yetviralized. the main lensing galaxy is also the brightest group member and has asurface brightness profile consistent with a typical cd galaxy. a lensing anddynamics analysis of the mass distribution, which also includes the newly foundgroup members, finds that the logarithmic slope of the mass density profile ison average isothermal inside the einstein radius, but steeper at the locationof the einstein radius. this apparent change in slope can be accounted for ifan external convergence gradient, representing the underlying parent halo ofthe galaxy group, is included in the mass model.

0910.2708	focusing cosmic telescopes: exploring redshift z~5-6 galaxies with the  bullet cluster 1e0657-56	the gravitational potential of clusters of galaxies acts as a cosmictelescope allowing us to find and study galaxies at fainter limits thanotherwise possible and thus probe closer to the epoch of formation of the firstgalaxies. we use the bullet cluster 1e0657-56 (z = 0.296) as a case study,because its high mass and merging configuration makes it one of the mostefficient cosmic telescopes we know. we develop a new algorithm to reconstructthe gravitational potential of the bullet cluster, based on a non-uniformadaptive grid, combining strong and weak gravitational lensing data derivedfrom deep hst/acs f606w-f775w-f850lp and ground-based imaging. we exploit thisimproved mass map to study z~5-6 lyman break galaxies (lbgs), which we detectas dropouts. one of the lbgs is multiply imaged, providing a geometricconfirmation of its high redshift, and is used to further improve our massmodel. we quantify the uncertainties in the magnification map reconstruction inthe intrinsic source luminosity, and in the volume surveyed, and show that theyare negligible compared to sample variance when determining the luminosityfunction of high-redshift galaxies. with shallower and comparable magnitudelimits to hudf and goods, the bullet cluster observations, after correcting formagnification, probe deeper into the luminosity function of the high redshiftgalaxies than goods and only slightly shallower than hudf. we conclude thataccurately focused cosmic telescopes are the most efficient way to sample thebright end of the luminosity function of high redshift galaxies and - in casethey are multiply imaged - confirm their redshifts.

0910.2731	can dry merging explain the size evolution of early-type galaxies?	the characteristic size of early-type galaxies (etgs) of given stellar massis observed to increase significantly with cosmic time, from redshift z&gt;2 tothe present. a popular explanation for this size evolution is that etgs growthrough dissipationless ("dry") mergers, thus becoming less compact. combiningn-body simulations with up-to-date scaling relations of local etgs, we showthat such an explanation is problematic, because dry mergers do not decreasethe galaxy stellar-mass surface-density enough to explain the observed sizeevolution, and also introduce substantial scatter in the scaling relations.based on our set of simulations, we estimate that major and minor dry mergersincrease half-light radius and projected velocity dispersion with stellar mass(m) as m^(1.09+/-0.29) and m^(0.07+/-0.11), respectively. this implies that: 1)if the high-z etgs are indeed as dense as estimated, they cannot evolve intopresent-day etgs via dry mergers; 2) present-day etgs cannot have assembledmore than ~45% of their stellar mass via dry mergers. alternatively, drymergers could be reconciled with the observations if there was extreme finetuning between merger history and galaxy properties, at variance with ourassumptions. full cosmological simulations will be needed to evaluate whetherthis fine-tuned solution is acceptable.

0910.2773	dissecting the gravitational lens b1608+656. ii. precision measurements  of the hubble constant, spatial curvature, and the dark energy equation of  state	strong gravitational lens systems with measured time delays between themultiple images provide a method for measuring the "time-delay distance" to thelens, and thus the hubble constant. we present a bayesian analysis of thestrong gravitational lens system b1608+656, incorporating (i) new, deep hubblespace telescope (hst) observations, (ii) a new velocity dispersion measurementof 260+/-15 km/s for the primary lens galaxy, and (iii) an updated study of thelens' environment. when modeling the stellar dynamics of the primary lensgalaxy, the lensing effect, and the environment of the lens, we explicitlyinclude the total mass distribution profile logarithmic slope gamma' and theexternal convergence kappa_ext; we marginalize over these parameters, assigningwell-motivated priors for them, and so turn the major systematic errors intostatistical ones. the hst images provide one such prior, constraining the lensmass density profile logarithmic slope to be gamma'=2.08+/-0.03; a combinationof numerical simulations and photometric observations of the b1608+656 fieldprovides an estimate of the prior for kappa_ext: 0.10 +0.08/-0.05. this latterdistribution dominates the final uncertainty on h_0. compared with previouswork on this system, the new data provide an increase in precision of more thana factor of two. in combination with the wmap 5-year data set, we find that theb1608+656 data set constrains the curvature parameter to be -0.031 &lt; omega_k &lt;0.009 (95% cl), a level of precision comparable to that afforded by the currenttype ia sne sample. asserting a flat spatial geometry, we find that, incombination with wmap, h_0 = 69.7 +4.9/-5.0 km/s/mpc and w=-0.94 +0.17/-0.19(68% cl), suggesting that the observations of b1608+656 constrain w as tightlyas do the current baryon acoustic oscillation data.

0911.2471	the sloan lens acs survey. ix. colors, lensing and stellar masses of  early-type galaxies	we present the current photometric dataset for the sloan lens acs (slacs)survey, including hst photometry from acs, wfpc2, and nicmos. these data haveenabled the confirmation of an additional 15 grade `a' (certain) lens systems,bringing the number of slacs grade `a' lenses to 85; including 13 grade `b'(likely) systems, slacs has identified nearly 100 lenses and lens candidates.approximately 80% of the grade `a' systems have elliptical morphologies while~10% show spiral structure; the remaining lenses have lenticular morphologies.spectroscopic redshifts for the lens and source are available for every system,making slacs the largest homogeneous dataset of galaxy-scale lenses to date. wehave developed a novel bayesian stellar population analysis code to determinerobust stellar masses with accurate error estimates. we apply this code todeep, high-resolution hst imaging and determine stellar masses with typicalstatistical errors of 0.1 dex; we find that these stellar masses are unbiasedcompared to estimates obtained using sdss photometry, provided that informativepriors are used. the stellar masses range from 10^10.5 to 10^11.8 m$_\odot$ andthe typical stellar mass fraction within the einstein radius is 0.4, assuming achabrier imf. the ensemble properties of the slacs lens galaxies, e.g. stellarmasses and projected ellipticities, appear to be indistinguishable from othersdss galaxies with similar stellar velocity dispersions. this further supportsthat slacs lenses are representative of the overall population of massiveearly-type galaxies with m* &gt;~ 10^11 m$_\odot$, and are therefore an idealdataset to investigate the kpc-scale distribution of luminous and dark matterin galaxies out to z ~ 0.5.

0911.3392	the initial mass function of early-type galaxies	we determine an absolute calibration of the initial mass function (imf) ofearly-type galaxies, by studying a sample of 56 gravitational lenses identifiedby the slacs survey. under the assumption of standard navarro, frenk &amp; whitedark matter halos, a combination of lensing, dynamical, and stellar populationsynthesis models is used to disentangle the stellar and dark mattercontribution for each lens. we define an "imf mismatch" parameter\alpha=m*(l+d)/m*(sps) as the ratio of stellar mass inferred by a joint lensingand dynamical models (m*(l+d)) to the current stellar mass inferred fromstellar populations synthesis models (m*(sps)). we find that a salpeter imfprovides stellar masses in agreement with those inferred by lensing anddynamical models (&lt;\log \alpha&gt;=0.00+-0.03+-0.02), while a chabrier imfunderestimates them (&lt;\log \alpha&gt;=0.25+-0.03+-0.02). a tentative trend isfound, in the sense that \alpha appears to increase with galaxy velocitydispersion. taken at face value, this result would imply a non universal imf,perhaps dependent on metallicity, age, or abundance ratios of the stellarpopulations. alternatively, the observed trend may imply non-universal darkmatter halos with inner density slope increasing with velocity dispersion.while the degeneracy between the two interpretations cannot be broken withoutadditional information, the data imply that massive early-type galaxies cannothave both a universal imf and universal dark matter halos.

1007.2409	dark matter contraction and the stellar content of massive early-type  galaxies: disfavoring "light" initial mass functions	we use stellar dynamics, strong lensing, stellar population synthesis models,and weak lensing shear measurements to constrain the dark matter (dm) profileand stellar mass in a sample of 53 massive early-type galaxies. we explorethree dm halo models (unperturbed navarro frenk &amp; white [nfw] halos and theadiabatic contraction models of blumenthal and gnedin) and impose a model forthe relationship between the stellar and virial mass (i.e., a relationship forthe star-formation efficiency as a function of halo mass). we show that, givenour model assumptions, the data clearly prefer a salpeter-like initial massfunction (imf) over a lighter imf (e.g., chabrier or kroupa), irrespective ofthe choice of dm halo. in addition, we find that the data prefer at most amoderate amount of adiabatic contraction (blumenthal adiabatic contraction isstrongly disfavored) and are only consistent with no adiabatic contraction(i.e., a nfw halo) if a mass-dependent imf is assumed, in the sense of a moremassive normalization of the imf for more massive halos.

(ii) asingle-component (stellar plus dark) mass model of the lens galaxy yields alogarithmic total-density slope of {\gamma}' = 1.72+0.05-0.06. (iii) theprojected stellar mass fraction, derived solely from lensing, is f*(&lt;reff) =0.19+0.04-0.09 inside the einstein radius for a hernquist profile and noanisotropy. the dark-matter fraction inside the effective radius f_dm(&lt;reff) =0.60+0.15\pm0.1. (iv) based on the sdss colors, we find f*(&lt;reff)=0.17 \pm 0.06for a salpeter imf and f*(&lt;reff)=0.07 \pm 0.02 for a chabrier imf. the lensingand dynamics constraints on the stellar mass fraction agree well with thoseindependently derived from the sdss colors for a salpeter imf, preferred overchabrier imf at variance with standard results for lower mass galaxies.dwarf-rich imfs in the lower mass range of 0.1-0.7 solar mass, with {\alpha} &gt;=3 (with dn/dm \propto m^(-{\alpha})) -such as that recently suggested formassive etgs- are excluded at the &gt; 90 % c.l. and in some cases violate thetotal lensing-derived mass limit. we conclude that this very massive etg isdark-matter dominated inside one effective radius, consistent with the trendrecently found from massive slacs galaxies, with a imf normalization consistentwith salpeter.

0710.1069	separating baryons and dark matter in cluster cores: a full 2-d lensing  and dynamic analysis of abell 383 and ms2137-23	(abridged) we utilize existing imaging and spectroscopic data for the galaxyclusters ms2137-23 and abell 383 to present improved measures of thedistribution of dark and baryonic material in the clusters' central regions.our method, based on the combination of gravitational lensing and dynamicaldata, is uniquely capable of separating the distribution of dark and baryoniccomponents at scales below 100 kpc. we find a variety of strong lensing modelsfit the available data, including some with dark matter profiles as steep asexpected from recent simulations. however, when combined with stellar velocitydispersion data for the brightest member, shallower inner slopes than predictedby numerical simulations are preferred. for abell 383, the preferred shallowinner slopes are statistically a good fit only when the multiple image positionuncertainties associated with our lens model are assumed to be 0\farcs5, toaccount for unknown substructure. no statistically satisfactory fit wasobtained matching both the multiple image lensing data and the velocitydispersion profile of the brightest cluster galaxy in ms2137-23. this suggeststhat the mass model we are using, which comprises a pseudo-ellipticalgeneralized nfw profile and a brightest cluster galaxy component mayinadequately represent the inner cluster regions. this may plausibly arise dueto halo triaxiality or by the gravitational interaction of baryons and darkmatter in cluster cores. however, the progress made via this detailed studyhighlights the key role that complementary observations of lensed features andstellar dynamics offer in understanding the interaction between dark andbaryonic matter on non-linear scales in the central regions of clusters.

1110.0468	overdensities of y-dropout galaxies from the brightest-of-reionizing  galaxies survey: a candidate protocluster at redshift z~8	theoretical and numerical modeling of dark-matter halo assembly predicts thatthe most luminous galaxies at high redshift are surrounded by overdensities offainter companions. we test this prediction with hst observations acquired byour brightest of reionizing galaxies (borg) survey, which identified four verybright z~8 candidates as y-dropout sources in four of the 23 non-contiguouswfc3 fields observed. we extend here the search for y-dropouts to fainterluminosities (m_* galaxies with m_ab\sim-20), with detections at &gt;5sigmaconfidence (compared to &gt;8sigma confidence adopted earlier) identifying 17 newcandidates. we demonstrate that there is a correlation between number counts offaint and bright y-dropouts at &gt;99.84% confidence. field borg58, which containsthe best bright z\sim8 candidate (m_ab=-21.3), has the most significantoverdensity of faint y-dropouts. four new sources are located within 70arcsec(corresponding to 3.1 comoving mpc at z=8) from the previously known brighterz\sim8 candidate. the overdensity of y-dropouts in this field has a physicalorigin to high confidence (p&gt;99.975%), independent of completeness andcontamination rate of the y-dropout selection. we modeled the overdensity bymeans of cosmological simulations and estimate that the principal dark matterhalo has mass m_h\sim(4-7)x10^11msun (\sim5sigma density peak) and issurrounded by several m_h\sim10^11msun halos which could host the fainterdropouts. in this scenario, we predict that all halos will eventually mergeinto a m_h&gt;2x10^14msun galaxy cluster by z=0. follow-up observations withground and space based telescopes are required to secure the z\sim8 nature ofthe overdensity, discover new members, and measure their precise redshift.

1201.0016	inferences on the distribution of ly-alpha emission of z~7 and z~8  galaxies	spectroscopic confirmation of galaxies at z~7 and above has been extremelydifficult, owing to a drop in intensity of ly-alpha emission in comparison withsamples at z~6. this crucial finding could potentially signal the ending ofcosmic reionization. however it is based on small datasets, often incompleteand heterogeneous in nature. we introduce a flexible bayesian framework, usefulto interpret such evidence. within this framework, we implement two simplephenomenological models: a smooth one, where the distribution of ly-alpha isattenuated by a factor \es with respect to z~6; a patchy one where a fraction\ep is absorbed/non-emitted while the rest is unabsorbed. from a compilation of39 observed z~7 galaxies we find \es=0.69+-0.12 and \ep=0.66+-0.16. the modelscan be used to compute fractions of emitters above any equivalent width w. forw&gt;25\aa, we find x^{25}_{z=7}=0.37+-0.11 (0.14+-0.06) for galaxies fainter(brighter) than m_{uv}=-20.25 for the patchy model, consistent with previouswork, but with smaller uncertainties by virtue of our full use of the data. atz~8 we combine new deep (5-\sigma flux limit 10^{-17}ergs^{-1}cm^{-2})keck-nirspec observations of a bright y-dropout identified by our borg survey,with those of three objects from the literature and find that the inference isinconclusive. we compute predictions for future near-infrared spectroscopicsurveys and show that it is challenging but feasible to constrain thedistribution of ly-alpha emitters at z~8 and distinguish between models.

1202.0971	size and velocity-dispersion evolution of early-type galaxies in a  lambda cold dark matter universe	early-type galaxies (etgs) are observed to be more compact at z&gt;2 than in thelocal universe. remarkably, much of this size evolution appears to take placein a short (1.8 gyr) time span between z=2.2 and z=1.3, which poses a seriouschallenge to hierarchical galaxy formation models where mergers occurring on asimilar timescale are the main mechanism for galaxy growth. we compute themerger-driven redshift evolution of stellar mass mstar\propto(1+z)^am,half-mass radius re\propto(1+z)^ar and velocity-dispersionsigma0\propto(1+z)^asigma predicted by concordance lambda cold dark matter fora typical massive etg in the redshift range z=1.3-2.2. neglecting dissipativeprocesses, and thus maximizing evolution in surface density, we find-1.5&lt;am&lt;-0.6, -1.9&lt;ar&lt;-0.7 and 0.06&lt;asigma&lt;0.22, under the assumption that theaccreted satellites are spheroids. it follows that the predicted z=2.2progenitors of z=1.3 etgs are significantly less compact (on average a factorof 2 larger re at given mstar) than the quiescent galaxies observed at z&gt;2.furthermore, we find that the scatter introduced in the size-mass correlationby the predicted merger-driven growth is difficult to reconcile with thetightness of the observed scaling law. we conclude that - barring unknownsystematics or selection biases in the current measurements - minor and majormergers with spheroids are not sufficient to explain the observed size growthof etgs within the standard model.

1204.3641	the brightest of reionizing galaxies survey: constraints on the bright  end of the z~8 luminosity function	we report the discovery of 33 lyman break galaxy (lbg) candidates at z~8detected in hubble space telescope (hst) wide field camera 3 (wfc3) imaging aspart of the brightest of reionizing galaxies (borg) pure-parallel survey. theongoing borg survey currently has the largest area (274 arcmin^2) with y_098(or y_105), j_125, and h_160 band coverage needed to search for z~8 galaxies,about three times the current candels area, and slightly larger than what willbe the final candels wide component with y_105 data. our sample of 33relatively bright y_098-dropout galaxies have j_125 band magnitudes between25.5 and 27.4 mag. this is the largest sample of bright (j_125 &lt;~ 27.4) z~8galaxy candidates presented to date. combining our dataset with the hubbleultra-deep field (hudf09) dataset, we constrain the rest-frame ultravioletgalaxy luminosity function at z~8 over the widest dynamic range currentlyavailable. the combined datasets are well fitted by a schechter function, i.e.\phi(l) = \phi_* (l/l_*)^{\alpha}\ e^{-(l/l_*)}, without evidence for an excessof sources at the bright end. at 68% confidence, we derive \phi_* =(4.3^{+3.5}_{-2.1}) \times 10^{-4} mpc^{-3}, m_* = -20.26^{+0.29}_{-0.34}, anda very steep faint-end slope \alpha = -1.98^{+0.23}_{-0.22}. while the best-fitparameters still have a strong degeneracy, especially between \phi_* and m_*,our improved coverage at the bright end has reduced the uncertainty of thefaint-end power-law slope at z~8 compared to the best previous determination at+/-0.4. with a future expansion of the borg survey, combined with plannedultradeep wfc3/ir observations, it will be possible to further reduce thisuncertainty and clearly demonstrate the steepening of the faint-end slopecompared to measurements at lower redshift, thereby confirming the key roleplayed by small galaxies in the reionization of the universe.

1206.4310	the swells survey - v. a salpeter stellar initial mass function in the  bulges of massive spiral galaxies	recent work has suggested that the stellar initial mass function (imf) is notuniversal, but rather is correlated with galaxy stellar mass, stellar velocitydispersion, or morphological type. in this paper, we investigate variations ofthe imf within individual galaxies. for this purpose, we use strong lensing andgas kinematics to measure independently the normalisation of the imf of thebulge and disk components of a sample of 5 massive spiral galaxies withsubstantial bulge components taken from the swells survey. we find that thestellar mass of the bulges are tightly constrained by the lensing and kinematicdata. a comparison with masses based on stellar population synthesis modelsfitted to optical and near infrared photometry favors a salpeter-likenormalisation of the imf. conversely, the disk masses are less well constraineddue to degeneracies with the dark matter halo, but are consistent with milkyway type imfs in agreement with previous studies. the disks are submaximal at2.2 disk scale lengths, but due to the contribution of the bulges, the galaxiesare baryon dominated at 2.2 disk scale lengths. globally, our inferred imfnormalisation is consistent with that found for early-type galaxies ofcomparable stellar mass (&gt; 10^11 m_sun). our results suggest a non-universalimf within the different components of spiral galaxies, adding to thewell-known differences in stellar populations between disks and bulges.

1302.3243	the cosmic evolution of faint satellite galaxies as a test of galaxy  formation and the nature of dark matter	the standard cosmological model based on cold dark matter (cdm) predicts alarge number of subhalos for each galaxy-size halo. it is well known thatmatching the subhalos to the observed properties of luminous satellites ofgalaxies in the local universe poses a significant challenge to ourunderstanding of the astrophysics of galaxy formation. we show that the cosmicevolution and host mass dependence of the luminosity function of satellitesprovides a powerful new diagnostic to disentangle astrophysical effects fromvariations in the underlying dark matter mass function. we illustrate this bycomparing the results of recent observations of satellites out to $z=0.8$ basedon hubble space telescope images with the predictions of three different setsof state-of-the art semi-analytic models with underlying cdm power spectra andone semi-analytic model with an underlying warm dark matter (wdm) powerspectrum. we find that even though cdm models provide a reasonable fit to thelocal luminosity function of satellites around galaxies comparable or slightlylarger than the milky way, they do not reproduce the data as well for differentredshift and host galaxy stellar mass. this tension indicates that furtherimprovements are likely to be needed in the description of star formation ifthe models are to be reconciled with the data. the wdm model matches theobserved mass dependence and redshift evolution of satellite galaxies moreclosely than any of the cdm models, indicating that a modification of theunderlying power spectrum may offer an alternative solution to this tension. weconclude by presenting predictions for the color magnitude relation ofsatellite galaxies to demonstrate how future observations will be able tofurther distinguish between these models and help constrain baryonic andnon-baryonic physics.

1306.1272	dark energy with gravitational lens time delays	strong lensing gravitational time delays are a powerful and cost effectiveprobe of dark energy. recent studies have shown that a single lens can providea distance measurement with 6-7 % accuracy (including random and systematicuncertainties), provided sufficient data are available to determine the timedelay and reconstruct the gravitational potential of the deflector.gravitational-time delays are a low redshift (z~0-2) probe and thus allow oneto break degeneracies in the interpretation of data from higher-redshift probeslike the cosmic microwave background in terms of the dark energy equation ofstate. current studies are limited by the size of the sample of known lensedquasars, but this situation is about to change. even in this decade, wide fieldimaging surveys are likely to discover thousands of lensed quasars, enablingthe targeted study of ~100 of these systems and resulting in substantial gainsin the dark energy figure of merit. in the next decade, a further order ofmagnitude improvement will be possible with the 10000 systems expected to bedetected and measured with lsst and euclid. to fully exploit these gains, weidentify three priorities. first, support for the development of softwarerequired for the analysis of the data. second, in this decade, small robotictelescopes (1-4m in diameter) dedicated to monitoring of lensed quasars willtransform the field by delivering accurate time delays for ~100 systems. third,in the 2020's, lsst will deliver 1000's of time delays; the bottleneck willinstead be the aquisition and analysis of high resolution imaging follow-up.thus, the top priority for the next decade is to support fast high resolutionimaging capabilities, such as those enabled by the james webb space telescopeand next generation adaptive optics systems on large ground based telescopes.

1309.2642	do gravitational lens galaxies have an excess of luminous substructure?	strong gravitational lensing can be used to directly measure the massfunction of their satellites, thus testing one of the fundamental predictionsof cold dark matter cosmological models. given the importance of this test itis essential to ensure that galaxies acting as strong lenses have dark andluminous satellites which are representative of the overall galaxy population.we address this issue by measuring the number and spatial distribution ofluminous satellites in acs imaging around lens galaxies from the sloan lensadvanced camera for surveys (slacs) lenses, and comparing them with thesatellite population in acs imaging of non lens galaxies selected from cosmos,which has similar depth and resolution to the acs images of slacs lenses. inorder to compare the samples of lens and non lens galaxies, which haveintrinsically different stellar mass distributions, we measure, for the firsttime, the number of satellites per host as a continuous function of hoststellar mass for both populations. we find that the number of satellites as afunction of host stellar mass, as well as the spatial distribution areconsistent between the samples. using these results, we predict the number ofsatellites we would expect to find around a subset of the cosmic lens all skysurvey (class) lenses, and find a result consistent with the the numberobserved by jackson et al. 2010. thus we conclude that within our measurementuncertainties there is no significant difference in the satellite populationsof lens and non lens galaxies.

1402.1496	detection of substructure with adaptive optics integral field  spectroscopy of the gravitational lens b1422+231	strong gravitational lenses can be used to detect low mass subhalos, based ondeviations in image fluxes and positions from what can be achieved with asmooth mass distribution. so far, this method has been limited by the smallnumber of (radio-loud, microlensing free) systems which can be analysed for thepresence of substructure. using the gravitational lens b1422+231, wedemonstrate that adaptive optics integral field spectroscopy can also be usedto detect dark substructures. we analyse data obtained with osiris on the kecki telescope, using a bayesian method that accounts for uncertainties relatingto the point spread function and image positions in the separate exposures. thenarrow-line [oiii] fluxes measured for the lensed images are consistent withthose measured in the radio, and show a significant deviation from what wouldbe expected in a smooth mass distribution, consistent with the presence of aperturbing low mass halo. detailed lens modelling shows that image fluxes andpositions are fit significantly better when the lens is modelled as a systemcontaining a single perturbing subhalo in addition to the main halo, ratherthan by the main halo on its own, indicating the significant detection ofsubstructure.the inferred mass of the subhalo depends on the subhalo massdensity profile: the 68% confidence interval for the perturber mass within 600pc are: 8.2$^{+0.6}_{-0.8}$, 8.2$^{+0.6}_{-1}$ and 7.6$\pm0.3$$\log_{10}$[m$_{\rm{sub}}$/m$_\odot$] respectively for a singular isothermalsphere, a pseudo-jaffe, and an nfw mass profile. this method can extend thestudy of flux ratio anomalies to virtually all quadruply imaged quasars, andtherefore offers great potential to improve the determination of the subhalomass function in the near future.

0705.1007	the mass assembly history of spheroidal galaxies: did newly-formed  systems arise via major mergers?	we examine the properties of a morphologically-selected sample of 0.4&lt;z&lt;1.0spheroidal galaxies in the goods fields in order to ascertain whether theirincrease in abundance with time arises primarily from mergers. to address thisquestion we determine scaling relations between the dynamical mass determinedfrom stellar velocity dispersions, and the stellar mass determined from opticaland infrared photometry. we exploit these relations across the larger samplefor which we have stellar masses in order to construct the first statisticallyrobust estimate of the evolving dynamical mass function over 0&lt;z&lt;1. the trendsobserved match those seen in the stellar mass functions of bundy et al. 2005regarding the top-down growth in the abundance of spheroidal galaxies. byreferencing our dynamical masses to the halo virial mass we compare the growthrate in the abundance of spheroidals to that predicted by the assembly of darkmatter halos. our comparisons demonstrate that major mergers do not fullyaccount for the appearance of new spheroidals since z~1 and that additionalmechanisms, such as morphological transformations, are required to drive theobserved evolution.

1403.5466	new observations of z~7 galaxies: evidence for a patchy reionization	we present new results from our search for z~7 galaxies from deepspectroscopic observations of candidate z-dropouts in the candels fields.despite the extremely low flux limits achieved by our sensitive observations,only 2 galaxies have robust redshift identifications, one from its lyalphaemission line at z=6.65, the other from its lyman-break, i.e. the continuumdiscontinuity at the lyalpha wavelength consistent with a redshift 6.42, butwith no emission line. in addition, for 23 galaxies we present deep limits inthe lyalpha ew derived from the non detections in ultra-deep observations.using this new data as well as previous samples, we assemble a total of 68candidate z~7 galaxies with deep spectroscopic observations, of which 12 have aline detection. with this much enlarged sample we can place solid constraintson the declining fraction of ly$\alpha$ emission in z~7 lyman break galaxiescompared to z~6, both for bright and faint galaxies. applying a simpleanalytical model, we show that the present data favor a patchy reionizationprocess rather than a smooth one.

0804.2827	dissecting the gravitational lens b1608+656. i. lens potential  reconstruction	strong gravitational lensing is a powerful technique for probing galaxy massdistributions and for measuring cosmological parameters. we present a pixelatedapproach to modeling simultaneously the lens potential and source intensity ofstrong gravitational lens systems with extended source-intensity distributions.for systems with sources of sufficient extent such that the separate lensedimages are connected by intensity measurements, the accuracy in thereconstructed potential is solely limited by the quality of the data. we applythis potential reconstruction technique to deep hst observations of b1608+656,a four-image gravitational lens system formed by a pair of interacting lensgalaxies. we present a comprehensive bayesian analysis of the system that takesinto account the extended source-intensity distribution, dust extinction, andthe interacting lens galaxies. our approach allows us to compare various modelsof the components of the lens system, which include the point-spread function(psf), dust, lens galaxy light, source-intensity distribution, and lenspotential. using optimal combinations of the psf, dust, and lens galaxy lightmodels, we successfully reconstruct both the lens potential and the extendedsource-intensity distribution of b1608+656. the resulting reconstruction can beused as the basis of a measurement of the hubble constant. we use ourreconstruction of the gravitational potential to study the relativedistribution of mass and light in the lensing galaxies. we find that themass-to-light ratio for the primary lens galaxy is (2.0+/-0.2)h m_{\sun}l_{b,\sun}^{-1} within the einstein radius 3.9 h^{-1} kpc, in agreement withwhat is found for noninteracting lens galaxies at the same scales.

1502.03887	the impact of strong gravitational lensing on observed lyman-break  galaxy numbers at 4&lt;z&lt;8 in the goods and the xdf blank fields	detection of lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) at high-redshift can be affected bygravitational lensing induced by foreground deflectors not only in galaxyclusters, but also in blank fields. we quantify the impact of strongmagnification in the samples of $b$, $v$, $i$, $z$ $\&amp;$ $y$ lbgs ($4\lesssim z\lesssim8$) observed in the xdf and goods/candels fields, by investigating theproximity of dropouts to foreground objects. we find that $\sim6\%$ of brightlbgs ($m_{h_{160}}&lt;26$) at $z\sim7$ have been strongly lensed ($\mu&gt;2$) byforeground objects. this fraction decreases from $\sim 3.5\%$ at $z\sim6$ to$\sim1.5\%$ at $z\sim4$. since the observed fraction of strongly lensedgalaxies is a function of the shape of the luminosity function (lf), it can beused to derive schechter parameters, $\alpha$ and $m_{\star}$, independentlyfrom galaxy number counts. our magnification bias analysis yieldsschechter-function parameters in close agreement with those determined fromgalaxy counts albeit with larger uncertainties. extrapolation of our analysisto $z\gtrsim 8$ suggests that future surveys with jswt, wfirst and euclidshould find excess lbgs at the bright-end, even if there is an intrinsicexponential cutoff of number counts. finally, we highlight how themagnification bias measurement near the detection limit can be used as probe ofthe population of galaxies too faint to be detected. preliminary results usingthis novel idea suggest that the magnification bias at $m_{uv}\sim -18$ is notas strong as expected if $\alpha\lesssim -1.7$ extends well below the currentdetection limits in the xdf. at face value this implies a flattening of the lfat $m_{uv}\gtrsim-16.5$. however, selection effects and completeness estimatesare difficult to quantify precisely. thus, we do not rule out a steep lfextending to $m_{uv}\gtrsim -15$.

0806.0570	mass distribution and orbital anisotropy of early-type galaxies:  constraints from the mass plane	massive early-type galaxies are observed to lie on the mass plane (mp), atwo-dimensional manifold in the space of effective radius r_e, projected massm_p (measured via strong gravitational lensing) and projected velocitydispersion sigma within r_e/2. the mp is less `tilted' than the fundamentalplane, and the two have comparable associated scatter. this means thatc_e2=2*g*m_p/(r_e*sigma^2) is a nearly universal constant in the rangesigma=175-400 km/s. this finding can be used to constrain the mass distributionand internal dynamics of early-type galaxies. we find that a relatively wideclass of spherical galaxy models has values of c_e2 in the observed range,because c_e2 is not very strongly sensitive to the mass distribution andorbital anisotropy. if the total mass distribution is isothermal, a broad rangeof stellar luminosity profile and anisotropy is consistent with theobservations, while nfw dark-matter halos require more fine tuning of thestellar mass fraction, luminosity profile and anisotropy. if future data cancover a broader range of masses, the mp could be seen to be tilted and thevalue of any such tilt would provide a discriminant between models for thetotal mass-density profile of the galaxies.

1511.04205	the grism lens-amplified survey from space (glass). iii. a census of  ly\alpha\ emission at $z\gtrsim$7 from hst spectroscopy	[abbreviated] we present a census of ly\alpha\ emission at $z\gtrsim7$utilizing deep near infrared hst grism spectroscopy from the first sixcompleted clusters of the grism lens-amplified survey from space (glass). in24/159 photometrically selected galaxies we detect emission lines consistentwith ly\alpha\ in the glass spectra. based on the distribution ofsignal-to-noise ratios and on simulations we expect the completeness and thepurity of the sample to be 40-100% and 60-90%, respectively. for the objectswithout detected emission lines we show that the observed (not corrected forlensing magnification) 1$\sigma$ flux limits reaches$5\times10^{-18}$erg/s/cm$^{2}$ per position angle over the full wavelengthrange of glass (0.8-1.7$\mu$m). based on the conditional probability ofly\alpha\ emission measured from the ground at $z\sim7$ we would have expected12-18 ly\alpha\ emitters. this is consistent with the number of detections,within the uncertainties, confirming the drop in ly\alpha\ emission withrespect to $z\sim6$. these candidates include a promising source at $z=8.1$.the spatial extent of ly\alpha\ in a deep stack of the most convincingly\alpha\ emitters with $\langle z\rangle=7.2$ is consistent with that of therest-frame uv continuum. extended ly$\alpha$ emission, if present, has asurface brightness below our detection limit, consistent with the properties oflower redshift comparison samples. from the stack we estimate upper limits onrest-frame uv emission line ratios and find $f_\textrm{civ} /f_\textrm{ly${\alpha}$} \lesssim 0.32$ and $f_\textrm{ciii]} /f_\textrm{ly$\alpha$} \lesssim 0.23$ in good agreement with other valuespublished in the literature.

astro-ph;0007252	the fundamental plane of field early-type galaxies at intermediate  redshift	we present preliminary results on the evolution of the stellar populations offield early-type galaxies (e/s0) from z=0.4 to z=0. the diagnostic tool used inthis study is the fundamental plane (fp), a tight empirical correlation betweentheir central velocity dispersion (sigma), effective radius (re), and effectivesurface brightness (sbe), which is observed to hold in the local universe.using hst-wfpc2 archive images and spectra obtained at the eso-3.6m telescopewe measured the fp parameters for a sample of ~30 field e/s0s at z=0.2-0.4.remarkably, field e/s0s at intermediate redshift also define a tight fp, withscatter unchanged with respect to that of local samples. the intermediateredshift fp is offset from the local one, in the sense that, for given re andsigma, galaxies are brighter at z=0.4 than at z=0. the implication of theoffset of the fp in terms of passive evolution of the stellar populationdepends on its star formation history. in a single burst scenario, the stellarpopulations of field e/s0s were formed at z=0.8-1.6 (omega=0.3;omega_{lambda}=0.7; h_0=50 km/s/mpc). alternatively, the bulk of stars (90% inmass) can be formed at high redshift (z~3), and the rest in a secondary burstoccurred more recently (z~0.5-0.8).

astro-ph;0104177	the properties of field elliptical galaxies at intermediate redshift.  ii: photometry and spectroscopy of an hst selected sample	a sample of field early-type galaxies (e/s0) at intermediate redshift($z\sim0.1-0.6$) is selected, based on morphology and colours from hst-wfpc2parallel images. photometric structural parameters (effective radius$r_{\tx{e}}$ and effective surface brightness $sb_{\tx{e}}$) are derivedthrough the f606w and f814w filters, using luminosity profile fitting andtwo-dimensional fitting techniques. the combined parameter that enters thefundamental plane ($\log r_{\tx{e}}-\beta sb_{\tx{e}}$, with$\beta\approx0.32$) is shown to suffer from significantly smaller uncertainties(r.m.s. 0.03) than the individual structural parameters (e.g. $\sim 15$ percent r.m.s. on the effective radius).  high signal-to-noise intermediate resolution spectra, taken at the eso-3.6m,yield redshifts for 35 galaxies and central velocity dispersions for 22galaxies. central velocity dispersions are derived using a library of stellartemplates covering a wide range of spectral types, in order to study theeffects of templates mismatches. the average random error on the centralvelocity dispersion is found to be 8 per cent and the average systematic errordue to template mismatch is found to be 5 per cent. the errors on velocitydispersion measurement and the effects of template mismatches are studied bymeans of extensive montecarlo simulations. in addition, we investigate whetherthe determination of the velocity dispersion is sensitive to the spectral rangeused, finding that the value of velocity dispersion is unchanged when thespectral regions that include the absorption features ca hk and nad are maskedout during the fit.

astro-ph;0106147	the properties of field elliptical galaxies at intermediate redshift.  iii: the fundamental plane and the evolution of stellar populations from  z~0.4 to z=0	we report on the study of a sample of 25 field early-type galaxies, in theredshift range z~0.1-0.5, selected on the basis of colours and morphology fromthe hst-mds. field early-type galaxies define a tight fundamental plane (fp)out to z~0.4, with scatter unchanged with respect to local samples, within theobservational errors. the intermediate redshift fp is offset with respect tothe fp of the coma cluster. the offset of the fp is found to increase withredshift. the evolution of the fp is studied quantitatively with abayesian-montecarlo technique. by applying this technique, we find that theoffset of the intercept of the fp (\delta \gamma) with respect to the local fpincreases as \delta \gamma = \tau z with the following 68 per cent limits:0.33&lt;\tau&lt;0.44 (for \omega=1, \omega_{\lambda}=0) or 0.44&lt;\tau&lt;0.56 (for\omega=0.3,\omega_{\lambda}=0.7). in addition, we interpret the results interms of the evolution of the stellar populations, under the assumption ofpassive evolution. in a single-burst scenario, the observed properties areconsistent with those of a stellar population formed at z&gt;2 (for \omega=1,\omega_{\lambda}=0, h_0=50 \kms mpc^{-1}) or 0.8&lt;z&lt;1.6 (for \omega=0.3,\omega_{\lambda}=0.7, h_0=65 \kms mpc^{-1}). if a small fraction of the stellarmass is formed in a secondary burst, the primary burst may have occurred athigher z. finally, the intercept and scatter of the fp found for fieldearly-type galaxies and for cluster data at z~0.4 are mutually consistent,within the observational errors. if higher redshift (up to z=0.83) cluster dataare considered, the ages of the stellar populations of field early-typegalaxies inferred from a single-burst scenario are found to be marginallysmaller than the ages derived for the cluster galaxies.

astro-ph;0201017	the stellar velocity dispersion of the lens galaxy in mg2016+112 at  z=1.004	we present a direct measurement of the stellar velocity dispersion of theearly-type lens galaxy d in the system mg2016+112 (z=1.004), determined from aspectrum obtained with the echelle spectrograph and imager (esi) on the w.m.keck-ii telescope, as part of the lenses structure and dynamics (lsd) survey.we find a velocity dispersion of sigma_ap=304+-27 km/s inside an effectivecircular aperture with a radius of 0.65'', corresponding to a central velocitydispersion of sigma=328+-32 km/s. from a hubble space telescope f160w-bandimage, we measure the effective radius and effective surface brightness inorder to determine the offset of the lens galaxy with respect to the localfundamental plane. the offset corresponds to an evolution of the rest-frameeffective mass-to-light ratio of delta log(m/l_b)=-0.62+-0.08 from z=0 toz=1.004. by interpreting colors and offset of the fp with two independentstellar population synthesis models, we obtain a single-burst equivalent age of2.8+-0.8 gyr (i.e. z_f&gt;1.9) and a supersolar metallicity oflog[z/z_sun]=0.25+-0.25. the lens galaxy is therefore a massive ellipticaldominated by an old and metal rich stellar population at z&gt;1. the excellentagreement of the stellar velocity dispersion with that predicted from recentlens models confirms that the angular separation of the multiple images of thebackground qso is predominantly due to the lens galaxy, and not to a massive``dark cluster'', in agreement with recent weak lensing and x-ray observations.however, the significant overdensity of galaxies in the field might indicatethat this system is a proto-cluster, in formation around galaxy d, responsiblefor the ~10% external shear inferred from the strong lens models.

astro-ph;0303267	a wide field hubble space telescope study of the cluster cl0024+16 at  z=0.4. i: morphological distributions to 5 mpc radius	we describe a new wide field hubble space telescope survey of the galaxycluster cl0024+16 (z~0.4) consisting of a sparse-sampled mosaic of 39 widefield and planetary camera 2 images which extends to a cluster radius of 5 mpc.[abridged] we examine both the morphology-radius (t-r) and morphology-density(t-sigma) relations and demonstrate sensitivities adequate for measures fromthe core to a radius of 5 mpc, spanning over 3 decades in local projecteddensity. the fraction of early-type galaxies declines steeply from the clustercenter to 1 mpc radius and more gradually thereafter, asymptoting towards thefield value at the periphery. we discuss our results in the context of threedistinct cluster zones, defined according to different physical processes thatmay be effective in transforming galaxy morphology in each. by treatinginfalling galaxies as isolated test particles, we deduce that the most likelyprocesses responsible for the mild gradient in the morphological mix outsidethe virial radius are harassment and starvation. although more data are neededto pin down the exact mechanisms, starvation seems more promising in that itwould naturally explain the stellar and dynamical homogeneity of cluster e/s0s.however, we find significant scatter in the local density at any given radiusoutside 0.5 mpc, and that the same t-sigma relation holds in subregions of thecluster, independent of location. in this hitherto unprobed region, where thepotential of the cluster is weak, galaxies apparently retain their identitiesas members of infalling sub-groups whose characteristic morphologicalproperties remain intact. only upon arrival in the central regions is thesubstructure erased, as indicated by the tight correlation between clusterradius and sigma.

(iii) the average projecteddark-matter mass fraction is inferred to be 0.25+-0.06 inside r_e, using thestellar mass-to-light ratios derived from the fundamental plane as priors. (iv)combined with results from the lsd survey, we find no significant evolution ofthe total density slope inside one effective radius: a linear fit givesd\gamma'/dz = 0.23+-0.16 (1-sigma) for the range z=0.08-1.01. the small scatterand absence of significant evolution in the inner density slopes suggest acollisional scenario where gas and dark matter strongly couple during galaxyformation, leading to a total mass distribution that rapidly converge todynamical isothermality.

[abridged] weconclude that ~30 objects (~20%) of the original flux-limited sample of 168spheroidal galaxies in the goods-north are detected during phases of prominentactivity, of both stellar and quasar origin. due to the short expectedlifetimes of the ir and x-ray emissions, this fraction might imply asignificant level of activity in this class of galaxies during the relativelyrecent cosmic epochs, z~0.3 to z~1, under investigation.

astro-ph;0702135	variability of moderate luminosity active galactic nuclei at z=0.36	we monitored 13 moderate luminosity active galactic nuclei at z=0.36 tomeasure flux variability, explore feasibility of reverberation mapping, anddetermine uncertainties on estimating black hole mass from single-epoch data.spectra and images were obtained with approximately weekly cadence for up to 4months, using the kast spectrograph on the 3-m shane telescope. in broad bandwe detect peak-to-peak variations of 9-37% and rms variations of 2-10%. theobserved flux variability in the g' band (rest-frame 2800-4000\aa) isconsistent with that in the r' band (rest-frame 4000-5200\aa), but with largeramplitude. however, after correcting for stellar light dilution, using hubblespace telescope images, we find nuclear variability of 3-24% (rms variation)with similar amplitudes in the g' and r' bands within the errors. intrinsicflux variability of the h$\beta$ line is also detected at the 3-13% level,after accounting for systematic errors on the spectrophotometry. thisdemonstrates that a reverberation mapping campaign beyond the local universecan be carried out with a 3-m class telescope, provided that sufficiently longlight curves are obtained. finally, we compare the h$\beta$ fwhm measured frommean spectra with that measured from single-epoch data, and find no bias but anrms scatter of 14%, mostly accounted for by the uncertainty on fwhmmeasurements. the propagated uncertainty on black hole mass estimates, due tothe fwhm measurement errors using low s/n (10--15 per pixel) single-epochspectra, is 30%.

astro-ph;9808282	an extremely red r^{1/4} galaxy in the test image of the hubble deep  field south	we report the serendipitous discovery of an extremely red object in thehubble deep field south (hdfs) test nicmos (near infrared camera and multiobject spectrograph) field of view. the object is resolved in the nicmos imageand has a light profile very well described by an r^{1/4} law with effectiveradius r_e=0."20+-0."05 and h_{ab}=21.7+-0.1 magnitudes. in contrast, thegalaxy is undetected in the r and i band ground based images taken at the ctio4 m blanco telescope, giving a lower limit to the color of (r-h)_{ab}&gt;3.9 and(i-h)_{ab}&gt;3.5 at the 95% confidence level. the colors of a range of syntheticgalactic spectra are computed, showing that the object is likely to be an``old'' elliptical galaxy at redshift z&gt;~1.7. alternatively the colors can bereproduced by an ``old'' elliptical galaxy at somewhat lower redshift (z&gt;~1)with significant amount of dust, or by a younger galaxy at higher redshift.this object represents a very interesting target for future vlt observations.

astro-ph;9812102	vlt and hst observations of a candidate high redshift elliptical galaxy  in the hubble deep field south	the combined use of the eso very large telescope (vlt) ut1 scienceverification (sv) images and of the hubble space telescope (hst) hubble deepfield south observations allows us to strengthen the identification as acandidate elliptical galaxy of the extremely red object hdfs 223251-603910previously identified by us on the basis of nicmos and cerro tololointeramerican observatory imaging. the photometry presented here includes vltdata in u, b, v, r, i, a stis unfiltered image, nicmos j, h, and k band data,thus combining the 16.5 hours of vlt sv exposures with 101 hours of hstobserving. the object is detected in all images except the vlt u band and isone of the reddest known with b-k=9.7+-0.5. we consider a wide range of modelswith different ages, metallicities, star formation histories and dust content,and conclude that the observed spectral energy distribution agrees best withthat of an old elliptical galaxy at redshift just below 2. alternativepossibilities are discussed in light of their likelihood and of the perspectiveof spectroscopic confirmation.

astro-ph;9904327	the properties of field elliptical galaxies at intermediate redshift. i:  empirical scaling laws	we present measurements of the fundamental plane (fp) parameters (theeffective radius, the mean effective surface brightness, and the centralvelocity dispersion) of six field elliptical galaxies at intermediate redshift.the imaging is taken from the medium deep survey of the hubble space telescope,while the kinematical data are obtained from long-slit spectroscopy using the3.6-m eso telescope. the fundamental plane appears well defined in the fieldeven at redshift $\approx$ 0.3. the data show a shift in the fp zero point withrespect to the local relation, possibly indicating modest evolution, consistentwith the result found for intermediate redshift cluster samples. the fp slopesderived for our field data, plus other cluster ellipticals at intermediateredshift taken from the literature, differ from the local ones, but are stillconsistent with the interpretation of the fp as a result of homology, of thevirial theorem and of the existence of a relation between luminosity and mass,$l \propto m^{\eta}$. we also derive the surface brightness vs. effectiveradius relation for nine galaxies with redshift up to $z \approx0.6$, and datafrom the literature; the evolution that can be inferred is consistent with whatis found using the fp.

0812.0748	stars and dark matter in the spiral gravitational lens 2237+0305	we construct a mass model for the spiral lens galaxy 2237+0305, at redshiftz_l=0.04, based on gravitational-lensing constraints, hi rotation, and newstellar-kinematic information, based on data taken with the esi spectrograph onthe 10m keck-ii telescope. high resolution rotation curves and velocitydispersion profiles along two perpendicular directions, close to the major andminor axes of the lens galaxy, were obtained by fitting the mgb-fe absorptionline region. the stellar rotation curve rises slowly and flattens at r~1.5"(~1.1 kpc). the velocity dispersion profile is approximately flat. acombination of photometric, kinematic and lensing information is used toconstruct a mass model for the four major mass components of the system -- thedark matter halo, disc, bulge, and bar. the best-fitting solution has a darkmatter halo with a logarithmic inner density slope of gamma=0.9+/-0.3 forrho_dm propto r^-gamma, a bulge with m/l_b=6.6+/-0.3 upsilon_odot, and a discwith m/l_b =1.2+/-0.3 upsilon_odot, in agreement with measurements of late-typespirals. the bulge dominates support in the inner regions where the multipleimages are located and is therefore tightly constrained by the observations.the disc is sub-maximal and contributes 45+/-11 per cent of the rotationalsupport of the galaxy at 2.2r_d. the halo mass is (2.0+/-0.6) x 10^12 m_odot,and the stellar to virial mass ratio is 7.0+/-2.3 per cent, consistent withtypical galaxies of the same mass.
