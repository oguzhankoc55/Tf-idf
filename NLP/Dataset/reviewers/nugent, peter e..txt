0902.3142	type ii supernovae as probes of cosmology	- constraining the cosmological parameters and understanding dark energy havetremendous implications for the nature of the universe and its physical laws.  - the pervasive limit of systematic uncertainties reached by cosmographybased on cepheids and type ia supernovae (sne ia) warrants a search forcomplementary approaches.  - type ii sne have been shown to offer such a path. their distances can bewell constrained by luminosity-based or geometric methods. competing,complementary, and concerted efforts are underway, to explore and exploit thoseobjects that are extremely well matched to next generation facilities.spectroscopic follow-up will be enabled by space- based and 20-40 meter classtelescopes.  - some systematic uncertainties of type ii sne, such as reddening by dust andmetallicity effects, are bound to be different from those of sne ia. theirstellar progenitors are known, promising better leverage on cosmic evolution.in addition, their rate - which closely tracks the ongoing star formation rate- is expected to rise significantly with look- back time, ensuring an adequatesupply of distant examples.  - these data will competitively constrain the dark energy equation of state,allow the determination of the hubble constant to 5%, and promote ourunderstanding of the processes involved in the last dramatic phases of massivestellar evolution.

0906.5355	exploring the optical transient sky with the palomar transient factory	the palomar transient factory (ptf) is a wide-field experiment designed toinvestigate the optical transient and variable sky on time scales from minutesto years. ptf uses the cfh12k mosaic camera, with a field of view of 7.9 deg^2and a plate scale of 1 asec/pixel, mounted on the the palomar observatory48-inch samuel oschin telescope. the ptf operation strategy is devised to probethe existing gaps in the transient phase space and to search for theoreticallypredicted, but not yet detected, phenomena, such as fallback supernovae,macronovae, .ia supernovae and the orphan afterglows of gamma-ray bursts. ptfwill also discover many new members of known source classes, from cataclysmicvariables in their various avatars to supernovae and active galactic nuclei,and will provide important insights into understanding galactic dynamics(through rr lyrae stars) and the solar system (asteroids and near-earthobjects). the lessons that can be learned from ptf will be essential for thepreparation of future large synoptic sky surveys like the large synoptic surveytelescope. in this paper we present the scientific motivation for ptf anddescribe in detail the goals and expectations for this experiment.

1004.0615	core-collapse supernovae from the palomar transient factory: indications  for a different population in dwarf galaxies	we use the first compilation of 72 core-collapse supernovae (sne) from thepalomar transient factory (ptf) to study their observed subtype distribution indwarf galaxies compared to giant galaxies. our sample is the largestsingle-survey, untargeted, spectroscopically classified, homogeneous collectionof core-collapse events ever assembled, spanning a wide host-galaxy luminosityrange (down to m_r ~ -14 mag) and including a substantial fraction (&gt;20%) ofdwarf (m_r &gt;= -18 mag) hosts. we find more core-collapse sne in dwarf galaxiesthan expected and several interesting trends emerge. we use detailedsubclassifications of stripped-envelope core-collapse sne and find that alltype i core-collapse events occurring in dwarf galaxies are either sne ib orbroad-lined sne ic (sne ic-bl), while "normal" sne ic dominate in giantgalaxies. we also see a significant excess of sne iib in dwarf hosts. wehypothesize that in lower metallicity hosts, metallicity-driven mass loss isreduced, allowing massive stars that would have appeared as "normal" sne ic inmetal-rich galaxies to retain some he and h, exploding as ib/iib events. at thesame time, another mechanism allows some stars to undergo extensive strippingand explode as sne ic-bl (and presumably also as long-duration gamma-raybursts). our results are still limited by small-number statistics, and ourmeasurements of the observed n(ib/c)/n(ii) number ratio in dwarf and gianthosts (0.25_{-0.15}^{+0.3} and 0.23_{-0.08}^{+0.11}, respectively; 1 sigmauncertainties) are consistent with previous studies and theoreticalpredictions. as additional ptf data accumulate, more robust statisticalanalyses will be possible, allowing the evolution of massive stars to be probedvia the dwarf-galaxy sn population.

1008.0877	type ii-p supernovae as standard candles: the sdss-ii sample revisited	we revisit the observed correlation between hbeta and feii velocities fortype ii-p supernovae (sne~ii-p) using 28 optical spectra of 13 sne ii-p anddemonstrate that it is well modeled by a linear relation with a dispersion ofabout 300 km/s. using this correlation, we reanalyze the publicly availablesample of sne ii-p compiled by d'andrea et al. and find a hubble diagram withan intrinsic scatter of 11% in distance, which is nearly as tight as thatmeasured before their sample is added to the existing set. the larger scatterreported in their work is found to be systematic, and most of it can bealleviated by measuring hbeta rather than feii velocities, due to the lowsignal-to-noise ratios and early epochs at which many of the optical spectrawere obtained. their sample, while supporting the mounting evidence that sneii-p are good cosmic rulers, is biased toward intrinsically brighter objectsand is not a suitable set to improve upon sn ii-p correlation parameters. thiswill await a dedicated survey.

1101.1298	peculiar type ii supernovae from blue supergiants	the vast majority of type ii supernovae (sne) are produced by red supergiants(rsgs), but sn 1987a revealed that blue supergiants (bsgs) can produce membersof this class as well, albeit with some peculiar properties. this best studiedevent revolutionized our understanding of sne, and linking it to the bulk oftype ii events is essential. we present here optical photometry andspectroscopy gathered for sn 2000cb, which is clearly not a standard type ii snand yet is not a sn 1987a analog. the light curve of sn 2000cb is reminiscentof that of sn 1987a in shape, with a slow rise to a late optical peak, but onsubstantially different time scales. spectroscopically, sn 2000cb resembles anormal sn ii but with ejecta velocities that far exceed those measured for sn1987a or normal sne ii, above 18000 km/s for h-alpha at early times. the redcolours, high velocities, late photometric peak, and our modeling of thisobject all point toward a scenario involving the high-energy explosion of asmall-radius star, most likely a bsg, producing 0.1 solar masses of ni-56.adding a similar object to the sample, sn 2005ci, we derive a rate of about 2%of the core-collapse rate for this loosely defined class of bsg explosions.

1103.0779	ptf10iya: a short-lived, luminous flare from the nuclear region of a  star-forming galaxy	we present the discovery and characterisation of ptf10iya, a short-lived (dt~ 10 d, with an optical decay rate of ~ 0.3 mag per d), luminous (m_g ~ -21mag) transient source found by the palomar transient factory. theultraviolet/optical spectral energy distribution is reasonably well fit by ablackbody with t ~ 1-2 x 10^4 k and peak bolometric luminosity l_bb ~ 1-5 x10^44 erg per s (depending on the details of the extinction correction). acomparable amount of energy is radiated in the x-ray band that appears toresult from a distinct physical process. the location of ptf10iya is consistentwith the nucleus of a star-forming galaxy (z = 0.22405 +/- 0.00006) to within350 mas (99.7 per cent confidence radius), or a projected distance of less than1.2 kpc. at first glance, these properties appear reminiscent of thecharacteristic "big blue bump" seen in the near-ultraviolet spectra of manyactive galactic nuclei (agns). however, emission-line diagnostics of the hostgalaxy, along with a historical light curve extending back to 2007, show noevidence for agn-like activity. we therefore consider whether the tidaldisruption of a star by an otherwise quiescent supermassive black hole mayaccount for our observations. though with limited temporal information,ptf10iya appears broadly consistent with the predictions for the early"super-eddington" phase of a solar-type star disrupted by a ~ 10^7 m_sun blackhole. regardless of the precise physical origin of the accreting material, thelarge luminosity and short duration suggest that otherwise quiescent galaxiescan transition extremely rapidly to radiate near the eddington limit; many suchoutbursts may have been missed by previous surveys lacking sufficient cadence.

1106.3551	ptf11eon/sn2011dh: discovery of a type iib supernova from a compact  progenitor in the nearby galaxy m51	on may 31, 2011 ut a supernova (sn) exploded in the nearby galaxy m51 (thewhirlpool galaxy). we discovered this event using small telescopes equippedwith ccd cameras, as well as by the palomar transient factory (ptf) survey, andrapidly confirmed it to be a type ii supernova. our early light curve andspectroscopy indicates that ptf11eon resulted from the explosion of arelatively compact progenitor star as evidenced by the rapid shock-breakoutcooling seen in the light curve, the relatively low temperature in early-timespectra and the prompt appearance of low-ionization spectral features. thespectra of ptf11eon are dominated by h lines out to day 10 after explosion, butinitial signs of he appear to be present. assuming that he lines continue todevelop in the near future, this sn is likely a member of the ciib (compactiib; chevalier and soderberg 2010) class, with progenitor radius larger thanthat of sn 2008ax and smaller than the eiib (extended iib) sn 1993j progenitor.our data imply that the object identified in pre-explosion hubble spacetelescope images at the sn location is possibly a companion to the progenitoror a blended source, and not the progenitor star itself, as its radius (~10^13cm) would be highly inconsistent with constraints from our post-explosionphotometric and spectroscopic data.

1106.3570	the palomar transient factory orion project: eclipsing binaries and  young stellar objects	the palomar transient factory (ptf) orion project is an experiment within thebroader ptf survey, a systematic automated exploration of the sky for opticaltransients. taking advantage of the wide field of view available using the ptfcamera at the palomar 48" telescope, 40 nights were dedicated in december2009-january 2010 to perform continuous high-cadence differential photometry ona single field containing the young (7-10myr) 25 ori association. the primarymotivation for the project is to search for planets around young stars in thisregion. the unique data set also provides for much ancillary science. in thisfirst paper we describe the survey and data reduction pipeline, and presentinitial results from an inspection of the most clearly varying stars relatingto two of the ancillary science objectives: detection of eclipsing binaries andyoung stellar objects. we find 82 new eclipsing binary systems, 9 of which weare candidate 25 ori- or orion ob1a-association members. of these, 2 arepotential young w uma type systems. we report on the possible low-mass (m-dwarfprimary) eclipsing systems in the sample, which include 6 of the candidateyoung systems. 45 of the binary systems are close (mainly contact) systems; oneshows an orbital period among the shortest known for w uma binaries, at0.2156509 \pm 0.0000071d, with flat-bottomed primary eclipses, and a deriveddistance consistent with membership in the general orion association. one ofthe candidate young systems presents an unusual light curve, perhapsrepresenting a semi-detached binary system with an inflated low-mass primary ora star with a warped disk, and may represent an additional young orion member.finally, we identify 14 probable new classical t-tauri stars in our data, alongwith one previously known (cvso 35) and one previously reported as a candidateweak-line t-tauri star (sdss j052700.12+010136.8).

1108.2868	sn2010jp (ptf10aaxi): a jet-driven type ii supernova	we present photometry and spectroscopy of the peculiar typeii supernova (sn)2010jp, also named ptf10aaxi. the light curve exhibits a linear decline with arelatively low peak absolute magnitude of only -15.9, and a low radioactivedecay luminosity at late times that suggests a nickel mass below 0.003$m_{\odot}$. spectra of sn2010jp display an unprecedented triple-peakedh$\alpha$ line profile, showing: (1) a narrow (800 km/s) central component thatsuggests shock interaction with dense csm; (2) high-velocity blue and redemission features centered at -12600 and +15400 km/s; and (3) broad wingsextending from -22000 to +25000 km/s. these features persist during 100 daysafter explosion. we propose that this line profile indicates a bipolarjet-driven explosion, with the central component produced by normal sn ejectaand csm interaction at mid latitudes, while the high-velocity bumps and broadline wings arise in a nonrelativistic bipolar jet. two variations of the jetinterpretation seem plausible: (1) a fast jet mixes 56ni to high velocities inpolar zones of the h-rich envelope, or (2) the reverse shock in the jetproduces blue and red bumps in balmer lines when a jet interacts with densecsm. jet-driven sneii are predicted for collapsars resulting from a wide rangeof initial masses above 25 $m_{\odot}$ at sub-solar metallicity. this seemsconsistent with the sn host environment, which is either an extremelylow-luminosity dwarf galaxy or very remote parts of an interacting pair ofstar-forming galaxies. it also seems consistent with the low 56ni mass that mayaccompany black hole formation. we speculate that the jet survives to produceobservable signatures because the star's h envelope was mostly stripped away byprevious eruptive mass loss.

1109.1593	constraints on the progenitor system of the type ia supernova sn  2011fe/ptf11kly	type ia supernovae (sne) serve as a fundamental pillar of modern cosmology,owing to their large luminosity and a well-defined relationship betweenlight-curve shape and peak brightness. the precision distance measurementsenabled by sne ia first revealed the accelerating expansion of the universe,now widely believed (though hardly understood) to require the presence of amysterious "dark" energy. general consensus holds that type ia sne result fromthermonuclear explosions of a white dwarf (wd) in a binary system; however,little is known of the precise nature of the companion star and the physicalproperties of the progenitor system. here we make use of extensive historicalimaging obtained at the location of sn 2011fe/ptf11kly, the closest sn iadiscovered in the digital imaging era, to constrain the visible-lightluminosity of the progenitor to be 10-100 times fainter than previous limits onother sn ia progenitors. this directly rules out luminous red giants and thevast majority of helium stars as the mass-donating companion to the explodingwhite dwarf. any evolved red companion must have been born with mass less than3.5 times the mass of the sun. these observations favour a scenario where theexploding wd of sn 2011fe/ptf11kly, accreted matter either from another wd, orby roche-lobe overflow from a subgiant or main-sequence companion star.

1111.0966	a compact degenerate primary-star progenitor of sn 2011fe	while a white dwarf is, from a theoretical perspective, the most plausibleprimary star in type ia supernova (sn ia), many other candidates have not beenformally ruled out. shock energy deposited in the envelope of any explodingprimary contributes to the early sn brightness and, since this radiation energyis degraded by expansion after the explosion, the diffusive luminosity dependson the initial primary radius. we present a new non-detection limit of thenearby sn ia 2011fe, obtained what appears to be just 4 hours after explosion,allowing us to directly constrain the initial primary radius, r_p. coupled withthe non-detection of a quiescent x-ray counterpart and the inferred synthesizedni mass, we show that r_p &lt;~ 0.02 r_sun (a factor of 5 smaller than previouslyinferred), that the average density of the primary must be rho_p &gt; 10,000 gmcm^{-3}, and that the effective temperature must be less than a few x 10^5 k.this rules out hydrogen burning main sequence stars and giants. constructingthe helium-burning main sequence and carbon-burning main sequence, we find suchobjects are also excluded. by process of elimination, we find that onlydegeneracy-supported compact objects---wds and neutron stars---are viable asthe primary star of sn 2011fe. with few caveats, we also restrict the companion(secondary) star radius to r_ c &lt;~ 0.1 r_sun, excluding roche-lobe overflowingred giant and main-sequence companions to high significance.

1111.6109	calcium-rich gap transients in the remote outskirts of galaxies	from the first two seasons of the palomar transient factory, we identifythree peculiar transients (ptf09dav, ptf10iuv, ptf11bij) with fivedistinguishing characteristics: peak luminosity in the gap between novae andsupernovae (m_r = 15.5 to -16.5), rapid photometric evolution (rise-time~12--15 days), large photospheric velocities (~6000 to 11000 km/s), earlyspectroscopic evolution into nebular phase (~1 to 3 months) and peculiarnebular spectra dominated by calcium. we also culled the extensive decade-longlick observatory supernova search database and identified an additional memberof this group, sn 2007ke. our choice of photometric and spectroscopicproperties was motivated by sn 2005e (perets et al. 2010). to our surprise, asin the case of sn 2005e, all four members of this group are also clearly offsetfrom the bulk of their host galaxy. given the well-sampled early and late-timelight curves, we derive ejecta masses in the range of 0.4--0.7 msun.spectroscopically, we find that there may be a diversity in the photosphericphase, but the commonality is in the unusual nebular spectra. our extensivefollow-up observations rule out standard thermonuclear and standardcore-collapse explosions for this class of "calcium-rich gap" transients. ifthe progenitor is a white dwarf, we are likely seeing a detonation of the whitedwarf core and perhaps, even shockfront interaction with a previously ejectednova shell. in the less likely scenario of a massive star progenitor, a verynon-standard channel specific to a low-metallicity environment needs to beinvoked (e.g., ejecta fallback leading to black hole formation). detection (orlack thereof) of a faint underlying host (dwarf galaxy, cluster) will provide acrucial and decisive diagnostic to choose between these alternatives.

1209.1102	an early &amp; comprehensive millimeter and centimeter wave and x-ray study  of supernova 2011dh: a non-equipartition blastwave expanding into a massive  stellar wind	only a handful of supernovae (sne) have been studied in multi-wavelength fromradio to x-rays, starting a few days after explosion. the early detection andclassification of the nearby type iib sn2011dh/ptf11eon in m51 provides aunique opportunity to conduct such observations. we present detailed dataobtained at the youngest phase ever of a core-collapse supernova (days 3 to 12after explosion) in the radio, millimeter and x-rays; when combined withoptical data, this allows us to explore the early evolution of the sn blastwave and its surroundings. our analysis shows that the expanding supernovashockwave does not exhibit equipartition (e_e/e_b ~ 1000), and is expandinginto circumstellar material that is consistent with a density profile fallinglike r^-2. within modeling uncertainties we find an average velocity of thefast parts of the ejecta of 15,000 +/- 1800 km/s, contrary to previousanalysis. this velocity places sn 2011dh in an intermediate blast-wave regimebetween the previously defined compact and extended sn iib subtypes. ourresults highlight the importance of early (~ 1 day) high-frequency observationsof future events. moreover, we show the importance of combined radio/x-rayobservations for determining the microphysics ratio e_e/e_b.

1303.7234	late-time spectral observations of the strongly interacting type ia  supernova ptf11kx	ptf11kx was a type ia supernova (sn ia) that showed time-variable absorptionfeatures, including saturated ca ii h&amp;k lines that weakened and eventually wentinto emission. the strength of the emission component of h{\alpha} increased,implying that the sn was undergoing significant interaction with itscircumstellar medium (csm). these features were blueshifted slightly and showeda p-cygni profile, likely indicating that the csm was directly related to, andprobably previously ejected by, the progenitor system itself. these and otherobservations led dilday et al. (2012) to conclude that ptf11kx came from asymbiotic nova progenitor like rs oph. in this work we extend the spectralcoverage of ptf11kx to 124-680 rest-frame days past maximum brightness. thesespectra of ptf11kx are dominated by h{\alpha} emission (with widths of ~2000km/s), strong ca ii emission features (~10,000 km/s wide), and a blue"quasi-continuum" due to many overlapping narrow lines of fe ii. emission fromoxygen, he i, and balmer lines higher than h{\alpha} is weak or completelyabsent at all epochs, leading to large observed h{\alpha}/h{\beta} intensityratios. the broader (~2000 km/s) h{\alpha} emission appears to increase instrength with time for ~1 yr, but it subsequently decreases significantly alongwith the ca ii emission. our latest spectrum also indicates the possibility ofnewly formed dust in the system as evidenced by a slight decrease in the redwing of h{\alpha}. during the same epochs, multiple narrow emission featuresfrom the csm temporally vary in strength. the weakening of the h{\alpha} and caii emission at late times is possible evidence that the sn ejecta haveovertaken the majority of the csm and agrees with models of other stronglyinteracting sne ia. the varying narrow emission features, on the other hand,may indicate that the csm is clumpy or consists of multiple thin shells.

1304.0763	type ia supernovae strongly interacting with their circumstellar medium	owing to their utility for measurements of cosmic acceleration, type iasupernovae (sne) are perhaps the best-studied class of sne, yet the progenitorsystems of these explosions largely remain a mystery. a rare subclass of sne iashow evidence of strong interaction with their circumstellar medium (csm), andin particular, a hydrogen-rich csm; we refer to them as sne ia-csm. in thefirst systematic search for such systems, we have identified 16 sne ia-csm, andhere we present new spectra of 13 of them. six sne ia-csm have beenwell-studied previously, three were previously known but are analyzed in-depthfor the first time here, and seven are new discoveries from the palomartransient factory. the spectra of all sne ia-csm are dominated by h{\alpha}emission (with widths of ~2000 km/s) and exhibit large h{\alpha}/h{\beta}intensity ratios (perhaps due to collisional excitation of hydrogen via the snejecta overtaking slower-moving csm shells); moreover, they have an almostcomplete lack of he i emission. they also show possible evidence of dustformation through a decrease in the red wing of h{\alpha} 75-100 d past maximumbrightness, and nearly all sne ia-csm exhibit strong na i d absorption from thehost galaxy. the absolute magnitudes (uncorrected for host-galaxy extinction)of sne ia-csm are found to be -21.3 &lt;= m_r &lt;= -19 mag, and they also seem toshow ultraviolet emission at early times and strong infrared emission at latetimes (but no detected radio or x-ray emission). finally, the host galaxies ofsne ia-csm are all late-type spirals similar to the milky way, or dwarfirregulars like the large magellanic cloud, which implies that these objectscome from a relatively young stellar population. this work represents the mostdetailed analysis of the sn ia-csm class to date.

1304.4236	discovery of a cosmological, relativistic outburst via its rapidly  fading optical emission	we report the discovery by the palomar transient factory (ptf) of thetransient source ptf11agg, which is distinguished by three primarycharacteristics: (1) bright, rapidly fading optical transient emission; (2) afaint, blue quiescent optical counterpart; and (3) an associated year-long,scintillating radio transient. we argue that these observed properties areinconsistent with any known class of galactic transients, and instead suggest acosmological origin. the detection of incoherent radio emission at suchdistances implies a large emitting region, from which we infer the presence ofrelativistic ejecta. the observed properties are all consistent with thepopulation of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs), marking the first timesuch an outburst has been discovered in the distant universe independent of ahigh-energy trigger. we searched for possible high-energy counterparts toptf11agg, but found no evidence for associated prompt emission. we thereforeconsider three possible scenarios to account for a grb-like afterglow without ahigh-energy counterpart: an "untriggered" grb (lack of satellite coverage), an"orphan" afterglow (viewing-angle effects), and a "dirty fireball" (suppressedhigh-energy emission). the observed optical and radio light curves appearinconsistent with even the most basic predictions for off-axis afterglowmodels. the simplest explanation, then, is that ptf11agg is a normal, on-axislong-duration grb for which the associated high-energy emission was simplymissed. however, we have calculated the likelihood of such a serendipitousdiscovery by ptf and find that it is quite small (~ 2.6%). while notdefinitive, we nonetheless speculate that ptf11agg may represent a new, morecommon (&gt; 4 times the on-axis grb rate at 90% confidence) class of relativisticoutbursts lacking associated high-energy emission.

1304.4952	'super-chandrasekhar' type ia supernovae at nebular epochs	we present a first systematic comparison of superluminous type ia supernovae(sne ia) at late epochs, including previously unpublished photometric andspectroscopic observations of sn 2007if, sn 2009dc and snf20080723-012.photometrically, the objects of our sample show a diverse late-time behaviour,some of them fading quite rapidly after a light-curve break at ~150-200d. thelatter is likely the result of flux redistribution into the infrared, possiblycaused by dust formation, rather than a true bolometric effect. nebular spectraof superluminous sne ia are characterised by weak or absent [fe iii] emission,pointing at a low ejecta ionisation state as a result of high densities. toconstrain the ejecta and 56ni masses of superluminous sne ia, we compare theobserved bolometric light curve of sn 2009dc with synthetic model light curves,focusing on the radioactive tail after ~60d. models with enough 56ni to explainthe light-curve peak by radioactive decay, and at the same time sufficient massto keep the ejecta velocities low, fail to reproduce the observed light-curvetail of sn 2009dc because of too much gamma-ray trapping. we instead propose amodel with ~1 solar mass of 56ni and ~2 solar masses of ejecta, which may beinterpreted as the explosion of a chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf (wd)enshrouded by 0.6-0.7 solar masses of c/o-rich material, as it could resultfrom a merger of two massive c/o wds. this model reproduces the late lightcurve of sn 2009dc well. a flux deficit at peak may be compensated by lightfrom the interaction of the ejecta with the surrounding material.

1307.1470	discovery, progenitor &amp; early evolution of a stripped envelope supernova  iptf13bvn	the intermediate palomar transient factory reports our discovery of a youngsupernova, iptf13bvn, in the nearby galaxy, ngc5806 (22.5mpc). our spectralsequence in the optical and infrared suggests a likely type ib classification.we identify a single, blue progenitor candidate in deep pre-explosion imagingwithin a 2{\sigma} error circle of 80 mas (8.7 pc). the candidate has a mbluminosity of -5.2 +/- 0.4 mag and a b-i color of 0.1+/-0.3 mag. if confirmedby future observations, this would be the first direct detection for aprogenitor of a type ib. fitting a power law to the early light curve, we findan extrapolated explosion date around 1.1 days before our first detection. wesee no evidence of shock cooling. the pre-explosion detection limits constrainthe radius of the progenitor to be smaller than a few solar radii. iptf13bvn isalso detected in cm and mm-wavelengths. fitting a synchrotron self-absorptionmodel to our radio data, we find a mass loading parameter of 1.3*10^12 g/cm.assuming a wind velocity of 10^3km/s, we derive a progenitor mass loss rate of3*10^-5msun/yr. our observations, taken as a whole, are consistent with a wolfrayet progenitor of the supernova iptf13bvn.

1307.3555	sn 2000cx and sn 2013bh: extremely rare, nearly twin type ia supernovae	the type ia supernova (sn ia) sn 2000cx was one of the most peculiartransients ever discovered, with a rise to maximum brightness typical of a snia, but a slower decline and a higher photospheric temperature. thirteen yearslater sn 2013bh (aka iptf13abc), a near identical twin, was discovered and weobtained optical and near-ir photometry and low-resolution optical spectroscopyfrom discovery until about 1 month past r-band maximum brightness. the spectraof both objects show iron-group elements (co ii, ni ii, fe ii, fe iii, andhigh-velocity features [hvfs] of ti ii), intermediate-mass elements (si ii, siiii, and s ii), and separate normal velocity features (~12000 km/s) and hvfs(~24000 km/s) of ca ii. persistent absorption from fe iii and si iii, alongwith the colour evolution, imply high blackbody temperatures for sne 2013bh and2000cx (~12000 k). both objects lack narrow na i d absorption and exploded inthe outskirts of their hosts, indicating that the sn environments wererelatively free of interstellar or circumstellar material and may imply thatthe progenitors came from a relatively old and low-metallicity stellarpopulation. models of sn 2000cx, seemingly applicable to sn 2013bh, imply theproduction of up to ~1 m_sun of ni-56 and (4.3-5.5)e-3 m_sun of fast-moving caejecta.

1307.5851	discovery and redshift of an optical afterglow in 71 square degrees:  iptf13bxl and grb 130702a	we report the discovery of the optical afterglow of the gamma-ray burst (grb)130702a, identified upon searching 71 square degrees surrounding the fermigamma-ray burst monitor (gbm) localization. discovered and characterized by theintermediate palomar transient factory (iptf), iptf13bxl is the first afterglowdiscovered solely based on a gbm localization. real-time image subtraction,machine learning, human vetting, and rapid response multi-wavelength follow-upenabled us to quickly narrow a list of 27,004 optical transient candidates to asingle afterglow-like source. detection of a new, fading x-ray source by swiftand a radio counterpart by carma and the vla confirmed the association betweeniptf13bxl and grb 130702a. spectroscopy with the magellan and palomar 200-inchtelescopes showed the afterglow to be at a redshift of z=0.145, placing grb130702a among the lowest redshift grbs detected to date. the prompt gamma-rayenergy release and afterglow luminosity are intermediate between typicalcosmological grbs and nearby sub-luminous events such as grb 980425 and grb060218. the bright afterglow and emerging supernova offer an opportunity forextensive panchromatic follow-up. our discovery of iptf13bxl demonstrates thefirst observational proof-of-principle for ~10 fermi-iptf localizationsannually. furthermore, it represents an important step towards overcoming thechallenges inherent in uncovering faint optical counterparts to comparablylocalized gravitational wave events in the advanced ligo and virgo era.

1308.3899	a statistical analysis of circumstellar material in type ia supernovae	a key tracer of the elusive progenitor systems of type ia supernovae (sne ia)is the detection of narrow blueshifted time-varying na i d absorption lines,interpreted as evidence of circumstellar material (csm) surrounding theprogenitor system. the origin of this material is controversial, but thesimplest explanation is that it results from previous mass loss in a systemcontaining a white dwarf and a non-degenerate companion star. we present newsingle-epoch intermediate-resolution spectra of 17 low-redshift sne ia takenwith xshooter on the eso very large telescope. combining this sample withevents from the literature, we confirm an excess (~20 per cent) of sne iadisplaying blueshifted narrow na i d absorption features compared tonon-blueshifted na i d features. the host galaxies of sne ia displayingblueshifted absorption profiles are skewed towards later-type galaxies,compared to sne ia that show no na i d absorption, and sne ia displayingblueshifted narrow na i d absorption features have broader light curves. thestrength of the na i d absorption is stronger in sne ia displaying blueshiftedna i d absorption features than those without blueshifted features, and thestrength of the blueshifted na i d is correlated with the b-v colour of the snat maximum light. this strongly suggests the absorbing material is local to thesn. in the context of the progenitor systems of sne ia, we discuss thesignificance of these findings and other recent observational evidence on thenature of sn ia progenitors. we present a summary that suggests there are atleast two distinct populations of normal, cosmologically useful sne ia.

1401.2426	an accreting white dwarf near the chandrasekhar limit in the andromeda  galaxy	the iptf detection of the most recent outburst of the recurrent nova systemrx j0045.4+4154 in the andromeda galaxy has enabled the unprecedented study ofa massive ($m&gt;1.3\ m_\odot$) accreting white dwarf (wd). we detected this novaas part of the near daily iptf monitoring of m31 to a depth of $r\approx21$\,mag and triggered optical photometry, spectroscopy and soft x-raymonitoring of the outburst. peaking at an absolute magnitude of $m_r=-6.6$ mag,and with a decay time of 1 mag per day, it is a faint and very fast nova. itshows optical emission lines of he/n and expansion velocities of 1900 to 2600km s$^{-1}$ 1--4 days after the optical peak. the {\it swift} monitoring of thex-ray evolution revealed a supersoft source (sss) with $kt_{\rm eff}\approx90-110\ {\rm ev}$ that appeared within 5 days after the optical peak, andlasted only 12 days. most remarkably, this is not the first event from thissystem, rather it is a recurrent nova with a time between outbursts ofapproximately 1 year, the shortest known. recurrent x-ray emission from thisbinary was detected by rosat in 1992 and 1993, and the source was wellcharacterized as a $m&gt;1.3\ m_\odot$ wd sss. based on the observed recurrencetime between different outbursts, the duration and effective temperature of thess phase, mesa models of accreting wds allow us to constrain the accretion rateto $\dot m&gt;1.7\times10^{-7}\ {m_{\odot}\ {\rm yr}}^{-1}$ and wd mass $&gt;1.30\m_{\odot}$. if the wd keeps $30\%$ of the accreted material, it will take lessthan a myr to reach core densities high enough for carbon ignition (if made ofc/o) or electron capture (if made of o/ne) to end the binary evolution.

1502.00646	constraining the progenitor companion of the nearby type ia sn 2011fe  with a nebular spectrum at +981 days	we present an optical nebular spectrum of the nearby type ia supernova2011fe, obtained 981 days after explosion. sn 2011fe exhibits little evolutionsince the +593 day optical spectrum, but there are several curious aspects inthis new extremely late-time regime. we suggest that the persistence of the$\sim5800$~\aa\ feature is due to na i d, and that a new emission feature at$\sim7300$~\aa\ may be [ca ii]. also, we discuss whether the new emissionfeature at $\sim6400$~\aa\ might be [fe i] or the high-velocity hydrogenpredicted by mazzali et al. the nebular feature at 5200~\aa\ exhibits a linearvelocity evolution of $\sim350$ $\rm km\ s^{-1}$ per 100 days from at least+220 to +980 days, but the line's shape also changes in this time, suggestingthat line blending contributes to the evolution. at $\sim 1000$ days afterexplosion, flux from the sn has declined to a point where contribution from aluminous secondary could be detected. in this work we make the firstobservational tests for a post-impact remnant star and constrain itstemperature and luminosity to $t \gtrsim 10^4$ $\rm k$ and $l \lesssim 10^4$$\rm l_{\odot}$. additionally, we do not see any evidence for narrow h$\alpha$emission in our spectrum. we conclude that observations continue to stronglyexclude many single-degenerate scenarios for sn 2011fe.

1506.03115	detection of a type iin supernova in optical follow-up observations of  icecube neutrino events	the icecube neutrino observatory pursues a follow-up program selectinginteresting neutrino events in real-time and issuing alerts for electromagneticfollow-up observations. in march 2012, the most significant neutrino alertduring the first three years of operation was issued by icecube. in thefollow-up observations performed by the palomar transient factory (ptf), a typeiin supernova (sn) ptf12csy was found $0.2^\circ$ away from the neutrino alertdirection, with an error radius of $0.54^\circ$. it has a redshift of$z=0.0684$, corresponding to a luminosity distance of about $300 \,\mathrm{mpc}$ and the pan-starrs1 survey shows that its explosion time was atleast 158 days (in host galaxy rest frame) before the neutrino alert, so that acausal connection is unlikely. the a posteriori significance of the chancedetection of both the neutrinos and the sn at any epoch is $2.2 \, \sigma$within icecube's 2011/12 data acquisition season. also, a complementaryneutrino analysis reveals no long-term signal over the course of one year.therefore, we consider the sn detection coincidental and the neutrinosuncorrelated to the sn. however, the sn is unusual and interesting by itself:it is luminous and energetic, bearing strong resemblance to the sn iin 2010jl,and shows signs of interaction of the sn ejecta with a dense circumstellarmedium. high-energy neutrino emission is expected in models of diffusive shockacceleration, but at a low, non-detectable level for this specific sn. in thispaper, we describe the sn ptf12csy and present both the neutrino andelectromagnetic data, as well as their analysis.

1508.04775	search for precursor eruptions among type iib supernovae	the progenitor stars of several type iib supernovae (sne) show indicationsfor extended hydrogen envelopes. these envelopes might be the outcome ofluminous energetic pre-explosion events, so-called precursor eruptions. we usethe palomar transient factory (ptf) pre-explosion observations of a sample of27 nearby type iib sne to look for such precursors during the final years priorto the sn explosion. no precursors are found when combining the observations in15-day bins, and we calculate the absolute-magnitude-dependent upper limit onthe precursor rate. at the 90% confidence level, type iib sne have on average$&lt;0.86$ precursors as bright as absolute $r$-band magnitude $-14$ in the final3.5 years before the explosion and $&lt;0.56$ events over the final year. incontrast, precursors among sne iin have a $\gtrsim 5$ times higher rate. thekinetic energy required to unbind a low-mass stellar envelope is comparable tothe radiated energy of a few-weeks-long precursor which would be detectable forthe closest sne in our sample. therefore, mass ejections, if they are common insuch sne, are radiatively inefficient or have durations longer than months.indeed, when using 60-day bins a faint precursor candidate is detected prior tosn 2012cs ($\sim2$% false-alarm probability). we also report the detection ofthe progenitor of sn 2011dh which does not show detectable variability over thefinal two years before the explosion. the suggested progenitor of sn 2012p isstill present, and hence is likely a compact star cluster, or an unrelatedobject.

1512.00733	type ii supernova energetics and comparison of light curves to  shock-cooling models	during the first few days after explosion, type ii supernovae (sne) aredominated by relatively simple physics. theoretical predictions regardingearly-time sn light curves in the ultraviolet (uv) and optical bands are thusquite robust. we present, for the first time, a sample of $57$ $r$-band type iisn light curves that are well monitored during their rise, having $&gt;5$detections during the first 10 days after discovery, and a well-constrainedtime of explosion to within $1-3$ days. we show that the energy per unit mass($e/m$) can be deduced to roughly a factor of five by comparing early-timeoptical data to the model of rabinak &amp; waxman (2011), while the progenitorradius cannot be determined based on $r$-band data alone. we find that type iisn explosion energies span a range of $e/m=(0.2-20)\times 10^{51} \;\rm{erg/(10 m}_\odot$), and have a mean energy per unit mass of $\left\langlee/m \right\rangle = 0.85\times 10^{51} \; \rm{erg/(10 m}_\odot$), corrected formalmquist bias. assuming a small spread in progenitor masses, this indicates alarge intrinsic diversity in explosion energy. moreover, $e/m$ is positivelycorrelated with the amount of $^{56}\rm{ni}$ produced in the explosion, aspredicted by some recent models of core-collapse sne. we further presentseveral empirical correlations. the peak magnitude is correlated with thedecline rate ($\delta m_{15}$), the decline rate is weakly correlated with therise time, and the rise time is not significantly correlated with the peakmagnitude. faster declining sne are more luminous and have longer rise times.this limits the possible power sources for such events.

astro-ph;0104455	the farthest known supernova: support for an accelerating universe and a  glimpse of the epoch of deceleration	we present photometric observations of an apparent type ia supernova (sn ia)at a redshift of ~1.7, the farthest sn observed to date. sn 1997ff, wasdiscovered in a repeat observation by the hst of the hdf-), and serendipitouslymonitored with nicmos on hst throughout the gto campaign. the sn type can bedetermined from the host galaxy type:an evolved, red elliptical lacking enoughrecent star formation to provide a significant population of core-collapse sne.the class- ification is further supported by diagnostics available from theobserved colors and temporal behavior of the sn, both of which match a typicalsn ia. the photo- metric record of the sn includes a dozen flux measurements inthe i, j, and h bands spanning 35 days in the observed frame. the redshiftderived from the sn photometry, z=1.7+/-0.1, is in excellent agreement with theredshift estimate of z=1.65+/-0.15 derived from theu_300,b_450,v_606,i_814,j_110,j_125,h_160, h_165,k_s photometry of the galaxy.optical and near-infrared spectra of the host provide a very tentativespectroscopic redshift of 1.755. fits to observations of the sn provideconstraints for the redshift-distance relation of sne~ia and a powerful test ofthe current accelerating universe hypothesis. the apparent sn brightness isconsistent with that expected in the decelerating phase of the preferredcosmological model, omega_m~1/3, omega_lambda~2/3. it is inconsistent with greydust or simple luminosity evolution, candidate astro- physical effects whichcould mimic past evidence for an accelerating universe from sne ia at z~0.5.weconsider several sources of possible systematic error including lensing, snmisclassification, selection bias, and calibration errors. currently, none ofthese effects appears likely to challenge our conclusions.

astro-ph;0212071	determination of primordial metallicity and mixing in the type iip  supernova 1993w	we present the results of a large grid of synthetic spectra and compare themto early spectroscopic observations of sn 1993w. this supernova was discoveredclose to its explosion date and at a recession velocity of 5400 km/s is locatedin the hubble flow. we focus here on two early spectra that were obtainedapproximately 5 and 9 days after explosion. we parameterize the outer supernovaenvelope as a power-law density profile in homologous expansion. in order toextract information on the value of the parameters a large number of models wasrequired. we show that very early spectra combined with detailed models canprovide constraints on the value of the power law index, the ratio of hydrogento helium in the surface of the progenitor, the progenitor metallicity and theamount of radioactive nickel mixed into the outer envelope of the supernova.the spectral fits reproduce the observed spectra exceedingly well. the spectralresults combined with the early photometry predict that the explosion date was4.7 \pm 0.7 days before the first spectrum was obtained. the ability to obtainthe metallicity from early spectra make sn iip attractive probes of chemicalevolution in the universe and by showing that we have the ability to pin downthe parameters of the progenitor and mixing during the supernova explosion, itis likely to make sn iip useful cosmological distance indicators which are atthe same time complementary to sne ia.

astro-ph;0303397	spectropolarimetry of sn 2001el in ngc 1448: asphericity of a normal  type ia supernova	high-quality spectropolarimetry (range 417-860 nm; spectral resolution 1.27nm and 0.265 nm/pixel) of the sn ia 2001el were obtained with the eso verylarge telescope melipal (+ fors1) at 5 epochs. the spectra a week beforemaximum and around maximum indicate photospheric expansion velocities of about10,000 km s$^{-1}$. prior to optical maximum, the linear polarization of thecontinuum was $\approx 0.2 - 0.3 %$ with a constant position angle, showingthat sn 2001el has a well-defined axis of symmetry. the polarization was nearlyundetectable a week after optical maximum. the spectra are similar to those ofthe normally-bright sn 1994d with the exception of a strong double-troughedabsorption feature seen around 800 nm (fwhm about 22 nm). this feature could bean important clue to the binary nature of sn ia, perhaps associated with anaccretion disk, or to the nature of the thermonuclear burning. if modeled interms of an oblate spheroid, the continuum polarization implies a minor tomajor axis ratio of around 0.9 if seen equator-on; this level of asymmetrywould produce an absolute luminosity dispersion of about 0.1 mag when viewed atdifferent viewing angles. if typical for sne ia, this would create an rmsscatter of several hundredths of a magnitude around the mean brightness-declinerelation.

astro-ph;0609616	the type ia supernova snls-03d3bb from a super-chandrasekhar-mass white  dwarf star	the acceleration of the expansion of the universe, and the need for darkenergy, were inferred from the observations of type ia supernovae (sne ia).there is consensus that sne ia are thermonuclear explosions that destroycarbon-oxygen white dwarf stars that accrete matter from a companion star,although the nature of this companion remains uncertain. sne ia are thought tobe reliable distance indicators because they have a standard amount of fuel anda uniform trigger -- they are predicted to explode when the mass of the whitedwarf nears the chandrasekhar mass -- 1.4 solar masses. here we show that thehigh redshift supernova snls-03d3bb has an exceptionally high luminosity andlow kinetic energy that both imply a super-chandrasekhar mass progenitor.super-chandrasekhar mass sne ia should preferentially occur in a young stellarpopulation, so this may provide an explanation for the observed trend thatoverluminous sne ia only occur in young environments. since this supernova doesnot obey the relations that allow them to be calibrated as standard candles,and since no counterparts have been found at low redshift, future cosmologystudies will have to consider contamination from such events.
