0905.2695	hydrodynamical simulations of convection-related stellar  micro-variability. ii. the enigmatic granulation background of the corot  target hd49933	local-box hydrodynamical model atmospheres provide statistical informationabout a star's emergent radiation field which allows one to predict the levelof its granulation-related micro-variability. space-based photometry is nowsufficiently accurate to test model predictions. we aim to model thephotometric granulation background of hd49933 as well as the sun, and comparethe predictions to the measurements obtained by the corot and soho satellitemissions. we construct hydrodynamical model atmospheres representing hd49933and the sun, and use a previously developed scaling technique to obtain theobservable disk-integrated brightness fluctuations. we further performedexploratory magneto-hydrodynamical simulations to gauge the impact of smallscale magnetic fields on the synthetic light-curves. we find that thegranulation-related brightness fluctuations depend on metallicity. we obtain asatisfactory correspondence between prediction and observation for the sun,validating our approach. for hd49933, we arrive at a significantover-estimation by a factor of two to three in total power. locally generatedmagnetic fields are unlikely to be responsible, otherwise existing fields wouldneed to be rather strong to sufficiently suppress the granulation signal.presently suggested updates on the fundamental stellar parameters do notimprove the correspondence; however, an ad-hoc increase of the hd49933 surfacegravity by about 0.2dex would eliminate most of the discrepancy. we diagnose apuzzling discrepancy between the predicted and observed granulation backgroundin hd49933, with only rather ad-hoc ideas for remedies at hand.

0905.3340	looking for pulsations in hgmn stars through corot lightcurves	hgmn chemically peculiar stars are among the quietest stars of themain-sequence. however, according to theoretical predictions, these stars couldhave pulsations related to the very strong overabundances of iron peakelements, which are produced by atomic diffusion in upper layers. suchpulsations have never been detected from ground based observations.  our aim is to search for signatures of pulsations in hgmn stars using thehigh quality lightcurves provided by the corot satellite.  we identified three faint stars (v&gt;12), from vlt-giraffe multiobjectspectrograph survey in a field which was planned for observation by corot. theypresent the typical characteristics of hgmn stars. they were observed by thecorot satellite during the long run (131 days) which started from the 24th ofoctober 2007, with the exoplanets ccd's (additional programme). in the presentwork, we present the analysis of the ground based spectra of these three starsand the analysis of the corresponding corot lightcurves.  two of these three hgmn candidates show low amplitude (less than 1.6 mmag)periodic variations (4.3 and 2.53 days respectively, with harmonics) which arecompatible with periods predicted by theoretical models.

0906.0864	on posterior probability and significance level: application to the  power spectrum of hd49933 observed by corot	we emphasize that the mention of the significance level when rejecting thenull hypothesis (h0) which assumes that what is observed is pure noise) canmislead one to think that the h0 hypothesis is unlikely to occur with thatsignificance level. we show that the significance level has nothing to do withthe posterior probability of h0 given the observed data set, and that thisposterior probability is very much higher than what the significance levelnaively provides. we use bayes theorem for deriving the posterior probabilityof h0 being true assuming an alternative hypothesis h1 that assumes that a modeis present, taking some prior for the mode height, for the mode amplitude andlinewidth.we report the posterior probability of h0 for the p modes detected onhd49933 by corot. we conclude that the posterior probability of h0 provide amuch more conservative quantification of the mode detection than thesignificance level. this framework can be applied to any stellar power spectrasimilar to those obtained for asteroseismology.

0909.1488	mode excitation by turbulent convection in rotating stars. i. effect of  uniform rotation	we focus on the influence of the coriolis acceleration on the stochasticexcitation of oscillation modes in convective regions of rotating stars. ouraim is to estimate the asymmetry between excitation rates of prograde andretrograde modes. we extend the formalism derived for obtaining stellar $p$-and $g$-mode amplitudes (samadi &amp; goupil 2001, belkacem et al. 2008) to includethe effect of the coriolis acceleration. we then study the special case ofuniform rotation for slowly rotating stars by performing a perturbativeanalysis. this allows us to consider the cases of the sun and the corot targethd 49933. we find that, in the subsonic regime, the influence of rotation as adirect contribution to mode driving is negligible in front of the reynoldsstress contribution. in slow rotators, the indirect effect of the modificationof the eigenfunctions on mode excitation is investigated by performing aperturbative analysis of the excitation rates. it turns out that the excitationof solar $p$ modes is affected by rotation with excitation rates asymmetriesbetween prograde and retrograde modes of the order of several percents. solarlow-order $g$ modes are also affected by uniform rotation and their excitationrates asymmetries are found to reach up to 10 %. the corot target hd 49933 isrotating faster than the sun ($\omega / \omega_\odot \approx 8$) and we showthat the resulting excitation rates asymmetry is about 10 % for the excitationrates of $p$ modes. we have then demonstrated that $p$ and $g$ mode excitationrates are modified by uniform rotation through the coriolis acceleration. studyof the effect of differential rotation is dedicated to a forthcoming paper.

0910.3513	hd 174884: a strongly eccentric, short-period early-type binary system  discovered by corot	accurate photometric corot space observations of a secondary seismologicaltarget, hd 174884, led to the discovery that this star is an astrophysicallyimportant double-lined eclipsing spectroscopic binary in an eccentric orbit (eof about 0.3), unusual for its short (3.65705d) orbital period. the higheccentricity, coupled with the orientation of the binary orbit in space,explains the very unusual observed light curve with strongly unequal primaryand secondary eclipses having the depth ratio of 1-to-100 in the corot 'seismo'passband. without the high accuracy of the corot photometry, the secondaryeclipse, 1.5 mmag deep, would have gone unnoticed. a spectroscopic follow-upprogram provided 45 high dispersion spectra. the analysis of the corot lightcurve was performed with an adapted version of phoebe that supports corotpassbands. the final solution was obtained by simultaneous fitting of the lightand the radial velocity curves. individual star spectra were derived byspectrum disentangling. the uncertainties of the fit were derived by bootstrapresampling and the solution uniqueness was tested by heuristic scanning. theresults provide a consistent picture of the system composed of two late bstars. the fourier analysis of the light curve fit residuals yields twocomponents, with orbital frequency multiples and an amplitude of about 0.1mmag, which are tentatively interpreted as tidally induced pulsations. anextensive comparison with theoretical models is carried out by means of thelevenberg-marquardt minimization technique and the discrepancy between modelsand the derived parameters is discussed. the best fitting models yield a youngsystem age of 125 million years which is consistent with the eccentric orbitand synchronous component rotation at periastron.

0910.4027	the corot target hd 49933: 1- role of the metal abundance	solar-like oscillations are stochastically excited by turbulent convection atthe surface layers of the stars. we study the role of the surface metalabundance on the efficiency of the stochastic driving in the case of the corottarget hd 49933. we compute two 3d hydrodynamical simulations representative --in effective temperature and gravity -- of the surface layers of the corottarget hd 49933, a star that is rather metal poor and significantly hottercompared to the sun. one 3d simulation has a solar metal abundance and theother has a surface iron-to-hydrogen, [fe/h], abundance ten times smaller. foreach 3d simulation we match an associated global 1d model and we compute theassociated acoustic modes using a theoretical model of stochastic excitationvalidated in the case of the sun and alpha cen a. the rate at which energy issupplied per unit time into the acoustic modes associated with the 3dsimulation with [fe/h]=-1 are found about three times smaller than thoseassociated with the 3d simulation with [fe/h]=0. as shown here, thesedifferences are related to the fact that low metallicity implies surface layerswith a higher mean density. in turn, a higher mean density favors smallerconvective velocities and hence less efficient driving of the acoustic modes.our result shows the importance of taking the surface metal abundance intoaccount in the modeling of the mode driving by turbulent convection. acomparison with observational data is presented in a companion paper usingseismic data obtained for the corot target hd 49933.

1009.0123	on the interpretation of echelle diagrams for solar-like oscillations.  effect of centrifugal distortion	this work aims at determining the impact of slow to moderate rotation on theregular patterns often present in solar-like oscillation spectra. we focus onthe well-known asteroseismic diagnostic echelle diagrams, examining howrotation may modify the estimates of the large and small spacings, as well asthe identification of modes. we illustrate the work with a real case: thesolar-like star $\eta$ bootis. the modeling takes into account rotation effectson the equilibrium models through an effective gravity and on the oscillationfrequencies through both perturbative and non-perturbative calculations. wecompare the results of both type of calculations in the context of the regularspacings (like the small spacings and the scaled small spacings) and echellediagrams. we show that for echelle diagrams the perturbative approach remainsvalid for rotational velocities up to 40-50 km/s. we show that for therotational velocities measured in solar-like stars, theoretical oscillationfrequencies must be corrected up to the second-order in terms of rotation rate,including near degeneracy effects. for rotational velocities of about 16 km/sand higher, diagnostics on large spacings and on modal identification throughechelle diagrams can be significantly altered by the presence of the $m\neq0$components of the rotationally split modes. we found these effects to bedetectable in the observed frequency range. analysis of the effects of rotationon small spacings and scaled small spacings reveals that these can be of theorder of, or even larger than surface effects, typically turbulence,microscopic diffusion, etc. furthermore, we show that scaled spacings aresignificantly affected by stellar distortion even for small stellar rotationalvelocities (from 10-15 km/s) and therefore some care must be taken when usingthem as indicators for probing deep stellar interiors.

1010.2682	turbulent eddy-time-correlation in the solar convective zone	theoretical modeling of the driving processes of solar-like oscillations is apowerful way of understanding the properties of the convective zones ofsolar-type stars. in this framework, the description of the temporalcorrelation between turbulent eddies is an essential ingredient to model modeamplitudes. however, there is a debate between a gaussian or lorentziandescription of the eddy-time correlation function (samadi et al. 2003, chaplinet al. 2005). indeed, a gaussian description reproduces the low-frequency shapeof the mode amplitude for the sun, but is unsatisfactory from a theoreticalpoint of view (houdek, 2009) and leads to other disagreements with observations(samadi et al., 2007). these are solved by using a lorentzian description, butthere the low-frequency shape of the solar observations is not correctlyreproduced. we reconcile the two descriptions by adopting the sweepingapproximation, which consists in assuming that the eddy-time-correlationfunction is dominated by the advection of eddies, in the inertial range, byenergy-bearing eddies. using a lorentzian function together with a cut-offfrequency derived from the sweeping assumption allows us to reproduce thelow-frequency shape of the observations. this result also constitutes avalidation of the sweeping assumption for highly turbulent flows as in thesolar case.

1011.2671	hd 46375: seismic and spectropolarimetric analysis of a young sun  hosting a saturn-like planet	hd 46375 is known to host a saturn-like exoplanet orbiting at 0.04 au fromits host star. stellar light reflected by the planet was tentatively identifiedin the 34-day corot run acquired in october-november 2008. we constrain theproperties of the magnetic field of hd 46375 based on spectropolarimetricobservations with the narval spectrograph at the pic du midi observatory. inaddition, we use a high-resolution narval flux spectrum to contrain theatmospheric parameters. with these constraints, we perform an asteroseismicanalysis and modelling of hd 46375 using the frequencies extracted from thecorot light curve. we used zeeman doppler imaging to reconstruct the magneticmap of the stellar surface. in the spectroscopic analysis we fitted isolatedlines using 1d lte atmosphere models. this analysis was used to constrain theeffective temperature, surface gravity, and chemical composition of the star.to extract information about the p-mode oscillations, we used a technique basedon the envelope autocorrelation function (eacf). from the zeeman dopplerimaging observations, we observe a magnetic field of ~5 gauss. from thespectral analysis, hd 46375 is inferred to be an unevolved k0 type star withhigh metallicity [fe/h]=+0.39. owing to the relative faintness of the star(m_hip=8.05), the signal-to-noise ratio is too low to identify individualmodes. however, we measure the p-mode excess power and large separation deltanu_0=153.0 +/- 0.7 muhz. we are able do constrain the fundamental parameters ofthe star thanks to spectrometric and seismic analyses. we conclude that hd46375 is similar to a young version of alpha-cenb. this work is of specialinterest because of its combination of exoplanetary science andasteroseismology, which are the subjects of the current kepler mission and theproposed plato mission.

1011.2690	possible detection of phase changes from the non-transiting planet hd  46375b by corot	the present work deals with the detection of phase changes in an exoplanetarysystem. hd 46375 is a solar analog known to host a non-transiting saturn-massexoplanet with a 3.0236 day period. it was observed by the corot satellite for34 days during the fall of 2008. we attempt to identify at optical wavelengths,the changing phases of the planet as it orbits its star. we then try to improvethe star model by means of a seismic analysis of the same light curve and theuse of ground-based spectropolarimetric observations. the data analysis relieson the fourier spectrum and the folding of the time series. we find evidence ofa sinusoidal signal compatible in terms of both amplitude and phase with lightreflected by the planet. its relative amplitude is delta fp/f* = [13.0, 26.8]ppm, implying an albedo a=[0.16, 0.33] or a dayside visible brightnesstemperature tb ~ [1880,2030] k by assuming a radius r=1.1 r_jup and aninclination i=45 deg. its orbital phase differs from that of theradial-velocity signal by at most 2 sigma_rv. however, the tiny planetarysignal is strongly blended by another signal, which we attribute to a telluricsignal with a 1 day period. we show that this signal is suppressed, but noteliminated, when using the time series for hd 46179 from the same corot run asa reference. this detection of reflected light from a non-transiting planetshould be confirmable with a longer corot observation of the same field. in anycase, it demonstrates that non-transiting planets can be characterized usingultra-precise photometric lightcurves with present-day observations by corotand kepler. the combined detection of solar-type oscillations on the sametargets (gaulme et al. 2010a) highlights the overlap between exoplanetaryscience and asteroseismology and shows the high potential of a mission such asplato.

1104.0630	the underlying physical meaning of the $\nu_{\rm max}-\nu_{\rm c}$  relation	asteroseismology of stars that exhibit solar-like oscillations are enjoying agrowing interest with the wealth of observational results obtained with thecorot and kepler missions. in this framework, scaling laws betweenasteroseismic quantities and stellar parameters are becoming essential tools tostudy a rich variety of stars. however, the physical underlying mechanisms ofthose scaling laws are still poorly known. our objective is to provide atheoretical basis for the scaling between the frequency of the maximum in thepower spectrum ($\nu_{\rm max}$) of solar-like oscillations and the cut-offfrequency ($\nu_{\rm c}$). using the soho golf observations together withtheoretical considerations, we first confirm that the maximum of the height inoscillation power spectrum is determined by the so-called \emph{plateau} of thedamping rates. the physical origin of the plateau can be traced to thedestabilizing effect of the lagrangian perturbation of entropy in theupper-most layers which becomes important when the modal period and the localthermal relaxation time-scale are comparable. based on this analysis, we thenfind a linear relation between $\nu_{\rm max}$ and $\nu_{\rm c}$, with acoefficient that depends on the ratio of the mach number of the excitingturbulence to the third power to the mixing-length parameter.

1104.2185	a quantitative analysis of stellar activity based on corot photometric  data	the corot satellite has made available high precision photometricobservations of a large number of stars of different spectral types. continuousphotometric time series allow the characterization of stellar microvariabilityin a systematic way. we determine an index indicating the level of activity,derived from photometric data, for a large sample of stars with different colortemperatures. we also assess to what extent this index can be related to anestimated rossby number for stars whose rotation period can be estimated. wealso estimate a characteristic lifetime of the surface heterogeneities. ourwork is based on the fourier analysis of stellar light curves. we analyzed thefourier power spectra of 430 selected light curves obtained by corot duringthree observation runs. the low-frequency contribution of the stellarvariability is modelled by a "generalized semi-lorentzian" profile. an activityindex is derived from the fitted amplitude and width of the semi-lorentzianmodel. some of the fourier spectra exhibit a rotational modulation whichenables the determination of the rotation period. in addition, a convectiveturnover time is derived from a grid of stellar models, so that a rossby numbercan be estimated. a characteristic lifetime of the phenomena causing theobserved power at low frequency is assessed from the fitted model of the powerspectrum and is compared to the rotation period. higher values of themicrovariability index are observed among the coolest stars from our sample. 28light curves show a clear rotational modulation. the estimated rossby number ofmost of the observed stars with a rotational modulation is less than 1. theactivity index decreases with increasing rossby number. the quality of thecorot data enables the determination of the characteristic lifetime of activestructures. it is shown to increase with the rotation period.

1105.6113	mixed modes in red-giant stars observed with corot	the corot mission has provided thousands of red-giant light curves. theanalysis of their solar-like oscillations allows us to characterize theirstellar properties. up to now, the global seismic parameters of the pressuremodes remain unable to distinguish red-clump giants from members of thered-giant branch. as recently done with kepler red giants, we intend to analyzeand use the so-called mixed modes to determine the evolutionary status of thered giants observed with corot. we also aim at deriving different seismiccharacteristics depending on evolution. the complete identification of thepressure eigenmodes provided by the red-giant universal oscillation patternallows us to aim at the mixed modes surrounding the l=1 expectedeigenfrequencies. a dedicated method based on the envelope autocorrelationfunction is proposed to analyze their period separation. we have identified themixed-mode signature separation thanks to their pattern compatible with theasymptotic law of gravity modes. we have shown that, independent of anymodelling, the g-mode spacings help to distinguish the evolutionary status of ared-giant star. we then report different seismic and fundamental properties ofthe stars, depending on their evolutionary status. in particular, we show thathigh-mass stars of the secondary clump present very specific seismicproperties. we emphasize that stars belonging to the clump were affected bysignificant mass loss. we also note significant population and/or evolutiondifferences in the different fields observed by corot.

0710.1039	stochastic excitation of non-radial modes i. high-angular-degree p modes	turbulent motions in stellar convection zones generate acoustic energy, partof which is then supplied to normal modes of the star. their amplitudes resultfrom a balance between the efficiencies of excitation and damping processes inthe convection zones. we develop a formalism that provides the excitation ratesof non-radial global modes excited by turbulent convection. as a firstapplication, we estimate the impact of non-radial effects on excitation ratesand amplitudes of high-angular-degree modes which are observed on the sun. amodel of stochastic excitation by turbulent convection has been developed tocompute the excitation rates, and it has been successfully applied to solarradial modes (samadi &amp; goupil 2001, belkacem et al. 2006b). we generalize thisapproach to the case of non-radial global modes. this enables us to estimatethe energy supplied to high-($\ell$) acoustic modes. qualitative arguments aswell as numerical calculations are used to illustrate the results. we find thatnon-radial effects for $p$ modes are non-negligible:  - for high-$n$ modes (i.e. typically $n &gt; 3$) and for high values of $\ell$;the power supplied to the oscillations depends on the mode inertia.  - for low-$n$ modes, independent of the value of $\ell$, the excitation isdominated by the non-diagonal components of the reynolds stress term. wecarried out a numerical investigation of high-$\ell$ $p$ modes and we find thatthe validity of the present formalism is limited to $\ell &lt; 500$ due to thespatial separation of scale assumption. thus, a model for very high-$\ell$$p$-mode excitation rates calls for further theoretical developments, howeverthe formalism is valid for solar $g$ modes, which will be investigated in apaper in preparation.

1110.0980	characterization of the power excess of solar-like oscillations in red  giants with kepler	we aim to describe the oscillation power excess observed in kepler redgiants, and to investigate empirical scaling relations governing theseparameters. from these scalings relations, we derive new physical properties ofred giant oscillations. various different methods were compared in order tovalidate the processes and to derive reliable output values. for consistency, asingle method was then used to determine scaling relations for the relevantglobal asteroseismic parameters: mean mode height, mean height of thebackground signal superimposed on the oscillation power excess, width of thepower excess, bolometric amplitude of the radial modes and visibility ofnon-radial modes. a method for deriving oscillation amplitudes is proposed,which relies on the complete identification of the red giant oscillationspectrum. the comparison of the different methods has shown the important roleof the way the background is modelled. the convergence reached by thecollaborative work enables us to derive significant results concerning theoscillation power excess. we obtain several scaling relations, and identify theinfluence of the stellar mass and the evolutionary status. the effect of heliumburning on the red giant interior structure is confirmed: it yields a strongmass-radius relation for clump stars. we find that none of the amplitudescaling relations motivated by physical considerations predict the observedmode amplitudes of red giant stars. in parallel, the degree-dependent modevisibility exhibits important variations. both effects seem related to thesignificant influence of the high mode mass of non-radial mixed modes. a familyof red giants with very weak dipole modes is identified, and its properties areanalyzed.

1205.4846	amplitudes of solar-like oscillations in red-giant stars: evidences for  non-adiabatic effects using corot observations	a growing number of solar-like oscillations has been detected in red giantstars thanks to corot and kepler space-crafts. the seismic data gathered bycorot on red giant stars allow us to test mode driving theory in physicalconditions different from main-sequence stars. using a set of 3d hydrodynamicalmodels representative of the upper layers of sub- and red giant stars, wecomputed the acoustic mode energy supply rate (pmax). assuming adiabaticpulsations and using global stellar models that assume that the surfacestratification comes from the 3d hydrodynamical models, we computed the modeamplitude in terms of surface velocity. this was converted into intensityfluctuations using either a simplified adiabatic scaling relation or anon-adiabatic one. from l and m (the luminosity and mass), the energy supplyrate pmax is found to scale as (l/m)^2.6 for both main-sequence and red giantstars, extending previous results. the theoretical amplitudes in velocityunder-estimate the doppler velocity measurements obtained so far from theground for red giant stars by about 30%. in terms of intensity, the theoreticalscaling law based on the adiabatic intensity-velocity scaling relation resultsin an under-estimation by a factor of about 2.5 with respect to the corotseismic measurements. on the other hand, using the non-adiabaticintensity-velocity relation significantly reduces the discrepancy with thecorot data. the theoretical amplitudes remain 40% below, however, the corotmeasurements. our results show that scaling relations of mode amplitudes cannotbe simply extended from main-sequence to red giant stars in terms of intensityon the basis of adiabatic relations because non-adiabatic effects for red giantstars are important and cannot be neglected. we discuss possible reasons forthe remaining differences.

1211.1546	seismic diagnostics for transport of angular momentum in stars 2.  interpreting observed rotational splittings of slowly-rotating red giant  stars	asteroseismology with the space-borne missions corot and kepler provides apowerful mean of testing the modeling of transport processes in stars.rotational splittings are currently measured for a large number of red giantstars and can provide stringent constraints on the rotation profiles. the aimof this paper is to obtain a theoretical framework for understanding theproperties of the observed rotational splittings of red giant stars with slowlyrotating cores. this allows us to establish appropriate seismic diagnostics forrotation of these evolved stars. rotational splittings for stochasticallyexcited dipolar modes are computed adopting a first-order perturbative approachfor two $1.3 m_\odot$ benchmark models assuming slowly rotating cores. for redgiant stars with slowly rotating cores, we show that the variation of therotational splittings of $\ell=1$ modes with frequency depends only on thelarge frequency separation, the g-mode period spacing, and the ratio of theaverage envelope to core rotation rates (${\cal r}$). this leds us to propose away to infer directly ${\cal r}$ from the observations. this method isvalidated using the kepler red giant star kic 5356201. finally, we provide atheoretical support for the use of a lorentzian profile to measure the observedsplittings for red giant stars.

1309.1488	stellar granulation as seen in disk-integrated intensity. ii.  theoretical scaling relations compared with observations	a large set of stars observed by corot and kepler shows clear evidence forthe presence of a stellar background, which is interpreted to arise fromsurface convection, i.e., granulation. these observations show that thecharacteristic time-scale (tau_eff) and the root-mean-square (rms) brightnessfluctuations (sigma) associated with the granulation scale as a function of thepeak frequency (nu_max) of the solar-like oscillations. we aim at providing atheoretical background to the observed scaling relations based on a modeldeveloped in the companion paper. we computed for each 3d model the theoreticalpower density spectrum (pds) associated with the granulation as seen indisk-integrated intensity on the basis of the theoretical model. for each pdswe derived tau_eff and sigma and compared these theoretical values with thetheoretical scaling relations derived from the theoretical model and the keplermeasurements. we derive theoretical scaling relations for tau_eff and sigma,which show the same dependence on nu_max as the observed scaling relations. inaddition, we show that these quantities also scale as a function of theturbulent mach number (ma) estimated at the photosphere. the theoreticalscaling relations for tau_eff and sigma match the observations well on a globalscale. our modelling provides additional theoretical support for the observedvariations of sigma and tau_eff with nu_m max. it also highlights the importantrole of ma in controlling the properties of the stellar granulation. however,the observations made with kepler on a wide variety of stars cannot confirm thedependence of our scaling relations on ma. measurements of the granulationbackground and detections of solar-like oscillations in a statisticallysufficient number of cool dwarf stars will be required for confirming thedependence of the theoretical scaling relations with ma.

(2008, apj, 683, l175) and is now commonly used for seismicinferences. nevertheless, we still lack a physical justification allowing forthe quantification of the surface-effect corrections. we used a grid of thesesimulations computed with the co$^5$bold code to model the outer layers ofsolar-like stars. upper layers of the corresponding 1d standard models werethen replaced by the layers obtained from the horizontally averaged 3d models.the frequency differences between these patched models and the 1d standardmodels were then calculated using the adiabatic approximation and allowed us toconstrain the kjeldsen et al. power law, as well as a lorentzian formulation.we find that the surface effects on modal frequencies depend significantly onboth the effective temperature and the surface gravity. we further provide thevariation in the parameters related to the surface-effect corrections usingtheir power law as well as a lorentzian formulation. scaling relations betweenthese parameters and the elevation (related to the mach number) is alsoprovided. the lorentzian formulation is shown to be more robust for the wholefrequency spectrum, while the power law is not suitable for the frequencyshifts in the frequency range above $\nu_{\rm max}$.

astro-ph;0303198	numerical constraints on the model of stochastic excitation of  solar-type oscillations	analyses of a 3d simulation of the upper layers of a solar convectiveenvelope provide constraints on the physical quantities which enter thetheoretical formulation of a stochastic excitation model of solar p modes, forinstance the convective velocities and the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum.these constraints are then used to compute the acoustic excitation rate forsolar p modes, p. the resulting values are found ~5 times larger than thevalues resulting from a computation in which convective velocities and entropyfluctuations are obtained with a 1d solar envelope model built with thetime-dependent, nonlocal gough (1977) extension of the mixing lengthformulation for convection (gmlt). this difference is mainly due to the assumedmean anisotropy properties of the velocity field in the excitation region. the3d simulation suggests much larger horizontal velocities compared to verticalones than in the 1d gmlt solar model. the values of p obtained with the 3dsimulation constraints however are still too small compared with the valuesinferred from solar observations. improvements in the description of theturbulent kinetic energy spectrum and its depth dependence yield furtherincreased theoretical values of p which bring them closer to the observations.it is also found that the source of excitation arising from the advection ofthe turbulent fluctuations of entropy by the turbulent movements contributes ~65-75 % to the excitation and therefore remains dominant over the reynoldsstress contribution. the derived theoretical values of p obtained with the 3dsimulation constraints remain smaller by a factor ~3 compared with the solarobservations. this shows that the stochastic excitation model still needs to beimproved.

astro-ph;0304457	numerical 3d constraints on convective eddy time-correlations :  consequences for stochastic excitation of solar p modes	a 3d simulation of the upper part of the solar convective zone is used toobtain information on the frequency component, chi_k, of the correlationproduct of the turbulent velocity field. this component plays an important rolein the stochastic excitation of acoustic oscillations. a time analysis of thesolar simulation shows that a gaussian function does not correctly reproducethe nu-dependency of chi_k inferred from the 3d simuation in the frequencyrange where the acoustic energy injected into the solar p modes is important(nu ~ 2 - 4 mhz). the nu-dependency of chi_k is fitted with differentanalytical functions which can then conveniently be used to compute theacoustic energy supply rate p injected into the solar radial oscillations. withconstraints from a 3d simulation, adjustment of free parameters to solar datais no longer necessary and is not performed here. the result is compared withsolar seismic data. computed values of p obtained with the analytical functionwhich fits best chi_k are found ~ 2.7 times larger than those obtained with thegaussian model and reproduce better the solar seismic observations. thisnon-gaussian description also leads to a reynolds stress contribution of thesame order as the one arising from the advection of the turbulent fluctuationsof entropy by the turbulent motions. some discrepancy between observed andcomputed p values still exist at high frequency and possible causes for thisdiscrepancy are discussed.

astro-ph;0310360	inferring information about rotation from stellar oscillations	the first part of this paper aims at illustrating the intense scientificactivity in the field of stellar rotation although, for sake of shortness, wecannot be exhaustive nor give any details. the second part is devoted to therotation as a pertubation effect upon oscillation frequencies. the discussionfocuses on one specific example: the p-modes frequency small separation whichprovides information about properties of the stellar inner layers. it is shownthat the small separation can be affected by rotation at the level of 0.1-0.2microhz for a 1.4 mo model rotating with an equatorial velocity of 20 km/s atthe surface. this is of the same order of magnitude as the expected precisionon frequencies with a 3 months observation and must therefore be taken intoaccount. we show however that it is possible to recover the small separationfree of these contaminating effects of rotation, provided enough high qualitydata are available as will be with space seismic missions such as eddington.

astro-ph;0409324	effect of local treatments of convection upon the solar p-mode  excitation rates	we compute, for several solar models, the rates p at which the solar radial pmodes are expected to be excited. the solar models are computed with twodifferent local treatments of convection : the classical mixing-length theory(mlt hereafter) and canuto, goldmann and mazzitelli(1996, cgm hereafter)'sformulation. for one set of solar models (emlt and ecgm models), the atmosphereis gray and assumes eddington's approximation. for a second set of models (kmltand kcgm models), the atmosphere is built using a t(tau) law which has beenobtained from a kurucz's model atmosphere computed with the same localtreatment of convection. the mixing-length parameter in the model atmosphere ischosen so as to provide a good agreement between synthetic and observed balmerline profiles, while the mixing-length parameter in the interior model iscalibrated so that the model reproduces the solar radius at solar age. for themlt treatment, the rates p do depend significantly on the properties of theatmosphere. on the other hand, for the cgm treatment, differences in p betweenthe ecgm and the kcgm models are very small compared to the error bars attachedto the seismic measurements. the excitation rates p for modes from the emltmodel are significantly under-estimated compared with the solar seismicconstraints. the kmlt model results in intermediate values for p and shows alsoan important discontinuity in the temperature gradient and the convectivevelocity. on the other hand, the kcgm model and the ecgm model yield values forp closer to the seismic data than the emlt and kmlt models. we conclude thatthe solar p-mode excitation rates provide valuable constraints and according tothe present investigation cleary favor the cgm treatment with respect to themlt.

astro-ph;0409325	oscillation power spectra of the sun and of alpha cen a: observations  versus models	hydrodynamical, 3d simulations of the outer layers of the sun and alpha cen aare used to obtain constraints on the properties of turbulent convection insuch stars. these constraints enable us to compute - on the base of atheoretical model of stochastic excitation - the rate p at which p modes areexcited by turbulent convection in those two stars. results are then comparedwith solar seismic observations and recent observations of alpha cen a. for thesun, a good agreement between observations and computed p is obtained. foralpha cen a a large discrepancy is obtained which origin cannot be yetidentified: it can either be caused by the present data quality which is notsufficient for our purpose or by the way the intrinsic amplitudes and thelife-times of the modes are determined or finally attributed to our presentmodelling. nevertheless, data with higher quality or/and more adapted datareductions will likely provide constraints on the p-mode excitation mechanismin alpha cen a.

astro-ph;0507243	influence of local treatments of convection upon solar p mode excitation  rates	we compute the rates p at which acoustic energy is injected into the solarradial p modes for several solar models. the solar models are computed with twodifferent local treatments of convection: the classical mixing-length theory(mlt hereafter) and canuto et al (1996)'s formulation (cgm hereafter). amongthe models investigated here, our best models reproduce both the solar radiusand the solar luminosity at solar age and the observed balmer line profiles.for the mlt treatment, the rates p do depend significantly on the properties ofthe atmosphere whereas for the cgm's treatment the dependence of p on theproperties of the atmosphere is found smaller than the error bars attached tothe seismic measurements. the excitation rates p for modes associated with themlt models are significantly underestimated compared with the solar seismicconstraints. the cgm models yield values for p closer to the seismic data thanthe mlt models. we conclude that the solar p-mode excitation rates providevaluable constraints and according to the present investigation clearly favorthe cgm treatment with respect to the mlt, although neither of them yieldsvalues of p as close to the observations as recently found for 3d numericalsimulations.

astro-ph;0607568	a closure model with plumes i. the solar convection	oscillations of stellar p modes, excited by turbulent convection, areinvestigated. we take into account the asymmetry of the up and downflowscreated by turbulent plumes through an adapted closure model. in a companionpaper, we apply it to the formalism of excitation of solar p modes developed bysamadi &amp; goupil 2001. using results from 3d numerical simulations of the uppermost part of the solar convection zone, we show that the two-scale-mass-fluxmodel (tfm) is valid only for quasi-laminar or highly skewed flows (gryanik &amp;hartmann 2002). we build a generalized-two-scale-mass-flux model (gtfm) modelwhich takes into account both the skew introduced by the presence of two flowsand the effects of turbulence in each flow. in order to apply the gtfm to thesolar case, we introduce the plume dynamics as modelled by rieutord &amp; zahn(1995) and construct a closure model with plumes (cmp). when comparing with 3dsimulation results, the cmp improves the agreement for the fourth ordermoments, by approximatively a factor of two compared with the use of thequasi-normal approximation or a skewness computed with the classical tfm. theasymmetry of turbulent convection in the solar case has an important impact onthe vertical-velocity fourth-order moment which has to be accounted for bymodels. the cmp is a significant improvement and is expected to improve themodelling of solar p-mode excitation.

astro-ph;0607570	a closure model with plumes ii. application to the stochastic excitation  of stellar p modes	our goal is to improve the theoretical modelling of stochastic excitation ofp modes by turbulent convection. with the help of the closure model with plume(cmp) developed in a companion paper, we refine the theoretical description ofthe excitation by the turbulent reynolds stress term. the cmp is generalizedfor two-point correlation products so as to apply it to the formalism developedby samadi &amp; goupil (2001). the excitation source terms are then computed withthis improvement, and a comparison with solar data from the golf instrument isperformed. the present model provides a significant improvement when comparingabsolute values of theoretical ampplitudes with observational data. it givesrise to a frequency dependence of the power supplied to solar p modes, whichagrees with golf observations. it is shown that the asymmetry of the turbulentconvection zone (up- and downflows) plays a major role in the excitationprocesses. despite an increase in the reynolds stress term contribution due toour improved description, an additional source of excitation, identified as theentropy source term, is still necessary for reproducing the observational data.theoretical excitation rates in the frequency range [2.5 mhz, 4 mhz] now are inagreement with the observational data from the golf instrument. however, atlower frequencies, it exhibits small discrepancies at the maximum level of afew per cent. improvements are likely to come from a better physicaldescription of the excitation by entropy fluctuations in the superadiabaticzone.

astro-ph;0611762	excitation of solar-like oscillations across the hr diagram	we extend semi-analytical computations of excitation rates for solaroscillation modes to those of other solar-like oscillating stars to comparethem with recent observations. numerical 3d simulations of surface convectivezones of several solar-type oscillating stars are used to characterize theturbulent spectra as well as to constrain the convective velocities andturbulent entropy fluctuations in the uppermost part of the convective zone ofsuch stars. these constraints, coupled with a theoretical model for stochasticexcitation, provide the rate 'p' at which energy is injected into the p-modesby turbulent convection. these energy rates are compared with those deriveddirectly from the 3d simulations. the excitation rates obtained from the 3dsimulations are systematically lower than those computed from thesemi-analytical excitation model. we find that pmax, the excitation ratemaximum, scales as (l/m)^s where s is the slope of the power law and l and mare the mass and luminosity of the 1d stellar model built consistently with theassociated 3d simulation. the slope is found to depend significantly on theadopted form of the eddy time-correlation ; using a lorentzian form results ins=2.6, whereas a gaussian one gives s=3.1. finally, values of vmax, the maximumin the mode velocity, are estimated from the computed power laws for pmax andwe find that vmax increases as (l/m)^sv. comparisons with the currentlyavailable ground-based observations show that the computations assuming alorentzian eddy time-correlation yield a slope, sv, closer to the observed onethan the slope obtained when assuming a gaussian. we show that the spatialresolution of the 3d simulations must be high enough to obtain accuratecomputed energy rates.

0810.0602	stochastic excitation of nonradial modes ii. are solar asymptotic  gravity modes detectable?	detection of solar gravity modes remains a major challenge to ourunderstanding of the innerparts of the sun. their frequencies would enable thederivation of constraints on the core physical properties while theiramplitudes can put severe constraints on the properties of the inner convectiveregion. our purpose is to determine accurate theoretical amplitudes of solar gmodes and estimate the soho observation duration for an unambiguous detection.we investigate the stochastic excitation of modes by turbulent convection aswell as their damping. input from a 3d global simulation of the solarconvective zone is used for the kinetic turbulent energy spectrum. damping iscomputed using a parametric description of the nonlocal time-dependentconvection-pulsation interaction. we then provide a theoretical estimation ofthe intrinsic, as well as apparent, surface velocity. asymptotic g-modevelocity amplitudes are found to be orders of magnitude higher than previousworks. using a 3d numerical simulation, from the ash code, we attribute this tothe temporal-correlation between the modes and the turbulent eddies which isfound to follow a lorentzian law rather than a gaussian one as previously used.we also find that damping rates of asymptotic gravity modes are dominated byradiative losses, with a typical life-time of $3 \times 10^5$ years for the$\ell=1$ mode at $\nu=60 \mu$hz. the maximum velocity in the consideredfrequency range (10-100 $\mu$hz) is obtained for the $\ell=1$ mode at $\nu=60\mu$hz and for the $\ell=2$ at $\nu=100 \mu$hz. due to uncertainties in themodeling, amplitudes at maximum i.e. for $\ell=1$ at 60 $\mu$hz can range from3 to 6 mm s$^{-1}$.
