hep-th;0410247	evolution of gravitational waves in the high-energy regime of  brane-world cosmology	we discuss the cosmological evolution of gravitational waves (gws) afterinflation in a brane-world cosmology embedded in five-dimensional anti-desitter (ads_5) bulk spacetime. in a brane-world scenario, the evolution of gwsis affected by the non-standard cosmological expansion and the excitation ofthe kaluza-klein modes (kk-modes), which are significant in the high-energyregime of the universe. we numerically solve the wave equation of gws in thepoincare coordinates of the ads_5 spacetime. using a plausible initialcondition from inflation, we find that, while the behavior of gws in the bulkis sensitive to the transition time from inflation to the radiation dominatedepoch, the amplitude of gws on the brane is insensitive to this time if thetransition occurs early enough before horizon re-entry. as a result, theamplitude of gws is suppressed by the excitation of kk-modes which escape fromthe brane into the bulk, and the effect may compensate the enhancement of thegws by the non-standard cosmological expansion. based on this, the influence ofthe high-energy effects on the stochastic background of gws is discussed.

0902.0371	simulations of baryon acoustic oscillations ii: covariance matrix of the  matter power spectrum	we use 5000 cosmological n-body simulations of 1(gpc/h)^3 box for theconcordance lcdm model in order to study the sampling variances of nonlinearmatter power spectrum. we show that the non-gaussian errors can be importanteven on large length scales relevant for baryon acoustic oscillations (bao).our findings are (1) the non-gaussian errors degrade the cumulativesignal-to-noise ratios (s/n) for the power spectrum amplitude by up to a factorof 2 and 4 for redshifts z=1 and 0, respectively. (2) there is littleinformation on the power spectrum amplitudes in the quasi-nonlinear regime,confirming the previous results. (3) the distribution of power spectrumestimators at bao scales, among the realizations, is well approximated by agaussian distribution with variance that is given by the diagonal covariancecomponent. (4) for the redshift-space power spectrum, the degradation in s/n bynon-gaussian errors is mitigated due to nonlinear redshift distortions. (5) foran actual galaxy survey, the additional shot noise contamination compromisesthe cosmological information inherent in the galaxy power spectrum, but alsomitigates the impact of non-gaussian errors. the s/n is degraded by up to 30%for a wfmos-type survey. (6) the finite survey volume causes additionalnon-gaussian errors via the correlations of long-wavelength fluctuations withthe fluctuations we want to measure, further degrading the s/n values by about30% even at high redshift z=3.

0902.0618	non-linear evolution of matter power spectrum in modified theory of  gravity	we present a formalism to calculate the non-linear matter power spectrum inmodified gravity models that explain the late-time acceleration of the universewithout dark energy. any successful modified gravity models should contain amechanism to recover general relativity (gr) on small scales in order to avoidthe stringent constrains on deviations from gr at solar system scales. based onour formalism, the quasi non-linear power spectrum in thedvali-gabadadze-porratti (dgp) braneworld models and $f(r)$ gravity models arederived by taking into account the mechanism to recover gr properly. we alsoextrapolate our predictions to fully non-linear scales using the parametrizedpost friedmann (ppf) framework. in $f(r)$ gravity models, the predictednon-linear power spectrum is shown to reproduce n-body results. we find thatthe mechanism to recover gr suppresses the difference between the modifiedgravity models and dark energy models with the same expansion history, but thedifference remains large at weakly non-linear regime in these models. ourformalism is applicable to a wide variety of modified gravity models and it isready to use once consistent models for modified gravity are developed.

0906.0507	non-linear evolution of baryon acoustic oscillations from improved  perturbation theory in real and redshift spaces	we study the non-linear evolution of baryon acoustic oscillations in thematter power spectrum and correlation function from the improved perturbationtheory (pt). based on the framework of renormalized pt, we apply the {\itclosure approximation} that truncates the infinite series of loop contributionsat one-loop order, and obtain a closed set of integral equations for powerspectrum and non-linear propagator. the resultant integral expressions keepimportant non-perturbative properties which can dramatically improve theprediction of non-linear power spectrum. employing the born approximation, wethen derive the analytic expressions for non-linear power spectrum and thepredictions are made for non-linear evolution of baryon acoustic oscillationsin power spectrum and correlation function. a detailed comparison betweenimproved pt results and n-body simulations shows that a percent-level agreementis achieved in a certain range in power spectrum and in a rather wider range incorrelation function. combining a model of non-linear redshift-spacedistortion, we also evaluate the power spectrum and correlation function incorrelation function. in contrast to the results in real space, the agreementbetween n-body simulations and improved pt predictions tends to be worse, and amore elaborate modeling for redshift-space distortion needs to be developed.nevertheless, with currently existing model, we find that the prediction ofcorrelation function has a sufficient accuracy compared with thecosmic-variance errors for future galaxy surveys with volume of a few (gpc/h)^3at z&gt;=0.5.

0910.2365	analytic description of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect for transiting  exoplanets: cross-correlation method and comparison with simulated data	we obtain analytical expressions for the velocity anomaly due to therossiter- mclaughlin effect, for the case when the anomalous radial velocity isobtained by cross-correlation with a stellar template spectrum. in the limit ofvanishing width of the stellar absorption lines, our result reduces to theformula derived by ohta et al. (2005), which is based on the first moment ofdistorted stellar lines. our new formula contains a term dependent on thestellar linewidth, which becomes important when rotational line broadening isappreciable. we generate mock transit spectra for four existing exoplanetarysystems (hd17156, tres-2, tres- 4, and hd209458) following the procedure ofwinn et al. (2005), and find that the new formula is in better agreement withthe velocity anomaly extracted from the mock data. thus, our result provides amore reliable analytical description of the velocity anomaly due to therossiter-mclaughlin effect, and explains the previously observed dependence ofthe velocity anomaly on the stellar rotation velocity.

0911.0525	cosmological test of gravity with polarizations of stochastic  gravitational waves around 0.1-1 hz	in general relativity, a gravitational wave has two polarization modes(tensor mode), but it could have additional polarizations (scalar and vectormodes) in the early stage of the universe, where the general relativity may notstrictly hold and/or the effect of higher-dimensional gravity may becomesignificant. in this paper, we discuss how to detect extra-polarization modesof stochastic gravitational wave background (gwb), and study the separabilityof each polarization using future space-based detectors such as bbo and decigo.we specifically consider two plausible setups of the spacecraft constellationsconsisting of two and four clusters, and estimate the sensitivity to eachpolarization mode of gwbs. we find that a separate detection of eachpolarization mode is rather sensitive to the geometric configuration anddistance between clusters and that the clusters should be, in general,separated by an appropriate distance. this seriously degrades the signalsensitivity, however, for suitable conditions, space-based detector canseparately detect scalar, vector and tensor modes of gwbs with energy densityas low as ~10^-15.

0912.1381	non-gaussian error contribution to likelihood analysis of the matter  power spectrum	we study the sample variance of the matter power spectrum for the standardlambda cold dark matter universe. we use a total of 5000 cosmological n-bodysimulations to study in detail the distribution of best-fit cosmologicalparameters and the baryon acoustic peak positions. the obtained distribution iscompared with the results from the fisher matrix analysis with and withoutincluding non-gaussian errors. for the fisher matrix analysis, we compute thederivatives of the matter power spectrum with respect to cosmologicalparameters using directly full nonlinear simulations. we show that thenon-gaussian errors increase the unmarginalized errors by up to a factor 5 fork_{max}=0.4h/mpc if there is only one free parameter provided other parametersare well determined by external information. on the other hand, formulti-parameter fitting, the impact of the non-gaussian errors is significantlymitigated due to severe parameter degeneracies in the power spectrum. thedistribution of the acoustic peak positions is well described by a gaussiandistribution, with its width being consistent with the statistical intervalpredicted from the fisher matrix. we also examine systematic bias in thebest-fit parameter due to the non-gaussian errors. the bias is found to besmaller than the 1 sigma statistical error for both the cosmological parametersand the acoustic scale positions.

1006.0699	baryon acoustic oscillations in 2d: modeling redshift-space power  spectrum from perturbation theory	we present an improved prescription for matter power spectrum in redshiftspace taking a proper account of both the non-linear gravitational clusteringand redshift distortion, which are of particular importance for accuratelymodeling baryon acoustic oscillations (baos). contrary to the models ofredshift distortion phenomenologically introduced but frequently used in theliterature, the new model includes the corrections arising from the non-linearcoupling between the density and velocity fields associated with twocompetitive effects of redshift distortion, i.e., kaiser and finger-of-godeffects. based on the improved treatment of perturbation theory forgravitational clustering, we compare our model predictions with monopole andquadrupole power spectra of n-body simulations, and an excellent agreement isachieved over the scales of baos. potential impacts on constraining dark energyand modified gravity from the redshift-space power spectrum are alsoinvestigated based on the fisher-matrix formalism. we find that the existingphenomenological models of redshift distortion produce a systematic error onmeasurements of the angular diameter distance and hubble parameter by 1~2%, andthe growth rate parameter by ~5%, which would become non-negligible for futuregalaxy surveys. correctly modeling redshift distortion is thus essential, andthe new prescription of redshift-space power spectrum including the non-linearcorrections can be used as an accurate theoretical template for anisotropicbaos.

1009.3204	probing dark energy and neutrino mass from upcoming lensing experiments  of cmb and galaxies	we discuss the synergy of the cosmic shear and cmb lensing experiments tosimultaneously constrain the neutrino mass and dark energy properties. takingfully account of the cmb lensing, cosmic shear, cmb anisotropies, and theircross correlation signals, we clarify a role of each signal, and investigatethe extent to which the upcoming observations by a high-angular resolutionexperiment of cmb and deep galaxy imaging survey can tightly constrain theneutrino mass and dark energy equation-of-state parameters. including theprimary cmb information as a prior cosmological information, the fisheranalysis reveals that the time varying equation-of-state parameters, given byw(a)=w_0+w_a(1-a), can be tightly constrained with the accuracies of 5% for w_0and 15% for w_a, which are comparable to or even better than those of thestage-iii type surveys neglecting the effect of massive neutrinos. in otherwords, including the neutrino mass in the parameter estimation would notdrastically alter the figure-of-merit estimates of dark energy parameters fromthe weak lensing measurements. for the neutrino mass, a clear signal for totalneutrino mass with 0.1 ev can be detected with 2-sigma significance. therobustness and sensitivity of these results are checked in detail by allowingthe setup of cosmic shear experiment to vary as a function of observation timeor exposure time, showing that the improvement of the constraints very weaklydepends on the survey parameters, and the results mentioned above are nearlyoptimal for the dark energy parameters and the neutrino mass.

1101.4723	forecasting the cosmological constraints with anisotropic baryon  acoustic oscillations from multipole expansion	baryon acoustic oscillations (baos) imprinted in the galaxy power spectrumcan be used as a standard ruler to determine angular diameter distance andhubble parameter at high redshift galaxies. combining redshift distortioneffect which apparently distorts the galaxy clustering pattern, we can alsoconstrain the growth rate of large-scale structure formation. usually, futureforecast for constraining these parameters from galaxy redshift surveys hasbeen made with a full 2d power spectrum characterized as function of wavenumber$k$ and directional cosine $\mu$ between line-of-sight direction and wavevector, i.e., $p(k,\mu)$. here, we apply the multipole expansion to the full 2dpower spectrum, and discuss how much cosmological information can be extractedfrom the lower-multipole spectra, taking a proper account of the non-lineareffects on gravitational clustering and redshift distortion. the fisher matrixanalysis reveals that compared to the analysis with full 2d spectrum, a partialinformation from the monopole and quadrupole spectra generally degrades theconstraints by a factor of $\sim1.3$ for each parameter. the additionalinformation from the hexadecapole spectrum helps to improve the constraints,which lead to an almost comparable result expected from the full 2d spectrum.

1105.1491	next-to-leading resummation of cosmological perturbations via the  lagrangian picture: 2-loop correction in real and redshift spaces	we present an improved prediction of the nonlinear perturbation theory (pt)via the lagrangian picture, which was originally proposed by matsubara (2008).based on the relations between the power spectrum in standard pt and that inlagrangian pt, we derive analytic expressions for the power spectrum inlagrangian pt up to 2-loop order in both real and redshift spaces. comparingthe improved prediction of lagrangian pt with $n$-body simulations in realspace, we find that the 2-loop corrections can extend the valid range of wavenumbers where we can predict the power spectrum within 1% accuracy by a factorof 1.0 ($z=0.5$), 1.3 (1), 1.6 (2) and 1.8 (3) vied with 1-loop lagrangian ptresults. on the other hand, in all redshift ranges, the higher-ordercorrections are shown to be less significant on the two-point correlationfunctions around the baryon acoustic peak, because the 1-loop lagrangian pt isalready accurate enough to explain the nonlinearity on those scales in $n$-bodysimulations.

1108.4430	improved modeling of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect for transiting  exoplanets	we present an improved formula for the anomalous radial velocity of the starduring planetary transits due to the rossiter-mclaughlin (rm) effect. theimprovement comes from a more realistic description of the stellar absorptionline profiles, taking into account stellar rotation, macroturbulence, thermalbroadening, pressure broadening, and instrumental broadening. although theformula is derived for the case in which radial velocities are measured bycross-correlation, we show through numerical simulations that the formulaaccurately describes the cases where the radial velocities are measured withthe iodine absorption-cell technique. the formula relies on prior knowledge ofthe parameters describing macroturbulence, instrumental broadening and otherbroadening mechanisms, but even 30% errors in those parameters do notsignificantly change the results in typical circumstances. we show that the newanalytic formula agrees with previous ones that had been computed on acase-by-case basis via numerical simulations. finally, as one application ofthe new formula, we reassess the impact of the differential rotation on the rmvelocity anomaly. we show that differential rotation of a rapidly rotating starmay have a significant impact on future rm observations.

1205.2139	weak lensing generated by vector perturbations and detectability of  cosmic strings	we study the observational signature of vector metric perturbations throughthe effect of weak gravitational lensing. in the presence of vectorperturbations, the non-vanishing signals for b-mode cosmic shear and curl-modedeflection angle, which have never appeared in the case of scalar metricperturbations, naturally arise. solving the geodesic and geodesic deviationequations, we drive the full-sky formulas for angular power spectra of weaklensing signals, and give the explicit expressions for e-/b-mode cosmic shearand gradient-/curl-mode deflection angle. as a possible source for seedingvector perturbations, we then consider a cosmic string network, and discuss itsdetectability from upcoming weak lensing and cmb measurements. based on theformulas and a simple model for cosmic string network, we calculate the angularpower spectra and expected signal-to-noise ratios for the b-mode cosmic shearand curl-mode deflection angle. we find that the weak lensing signals areenhanced for a smaller intercommuting probability of the string network, $p$,and they are potentially detectable from the upcoming cosmic shear and cmblensing observations. for $p\sim 10^{-1}$, the minimum detectable tension ofthe cosmic string will be down to $g\mu\sim 5\times 10^{-8}$. with atheoretically inferred smallest value $p\sim 10^{-3}$, we could even detect thestring with $g\mu\sim 5\times 10^{-10}$.

1309.1162	broadband alcock-paczynski test exploiting redshift distortions	baryon acoustic oscillations (bao), known as one of the largest cosmologicalobjects, is now recognized as standard cosmological tool to measure geometricdistances via the alcock-paczynski effect, by which the observed bao exhibitscharacteristic anisotropies in addition to the redshift distortions. thisimplies that once we know the correct distances to the observed bao, the tippoints of baryon acoustic peaks in the anisotropic correlation function ofgalaxies, $\xi(\sigma,\pi)$, can form a great circle (hereafter 2d bao circle)in the $\sigma$ and $\pi$ plane, where $\sigma$ and $\pi$ are the separation ofgalaxy pair parallel and perpendicular to the line-of-sight, respectively. this2d bao circle remains unchanged under the variations of the unknown galaxy biasand/or coherent motion, while it varies transversely and radially with respectto the variations of $d_a$ and $h^{-1}$, respectively. hereby the ratio betweentransverse distance $d_a$ and the radial distance $h^{-1}$ reproduces theintrinsic shape of 2d bao circle, which is {\it a priori} given by the knownbroadband shape of spectra. all bao peaks of $\xi(\sigma,\pi)$ are preciselycalculated with the improved theoretical model of redshift distortion. we testthis broadband alcock--paczynski method using boss--like mock catalogues. thetransverse and radial distances are probed in precision of several percentagefractional errors, and the coherent motion is observed to match with thefiducial values accurately.

1309.6783	beyond consistency test of gravity with redshift-space distortions at  quasi-linear scales	redshift-space distortions (rsd) offer an attractive method to measure thegrowth of cosmic structure on large scales, and combining with the measurementof the cosmic expansion history, it can be used as cosmological tests ofgravity. with the advent of future galaxy redshift surveys aiming at preciselymeasuring the rsd, an accurate modeling of rsd going beyond linear theory is acritical issue in order to detect or disprove small deviations from generalrelativity (gr). while several improved models of rsd have been recentlyproposed based on the perturbation theory (pt), the framework of these modelsheavily relies on gr. here, we put forward a new pt prescription for rsd ingeneral modified gravity models. as a specific application, we presenttheoretical predictions of the redshift-space power spectra in f(r) gravitymodel, and compare them with n-body simulations. using the pt template thattakes into account the effects of both modifications of gravity and rsdproperly, we successfully recover the fiducial model parameter in n-bodysimulations in an unbiased way. on the other hand, we found it difficult todetect the scale dependence of the growth rate in a model-independent way basedon gr templates.

1310.5771	characterization of the koi-94 system with transit timing variation  analysis: implication for the planet-planet eclipse	the koi-94 system is a closely-packed, multi-transiting planetary systemdiscovered by the kepler space telescope. it is known as the first system thatexhibited a rare event called a "planet-planet eclipse (ppe)," in which twoplanets partially overlap with each other in their double-transit phase. inthis paper, we constrain the parameters of the koi-94 system with an analysisof the transit timing variations (ttvs). such constraints are independent ofthe radial velocity (rv) analysis recently performed by weiss and coworkers,and valuable in examining the reliability of the parameter estimate using ttvs.we numerically fit the observed ttvs of koi-94c, koi-94d, and koi-94e for theirmasses, eccentricities, and longitudes of periastrons, and obtain the best-fitparameters including $m_{\rm c} = 9.4_{-2.1}^{+2.4} m_{\oplus}$, $m_{\rm d} =52.1_{-7.1}^{+6.9} m_{\oplus}$, $m_{\rm e} = 13.0_{-2.1}^{+2.5} m_{\oplus}$,and $e \lesssim 0.1$ for all the three planets. while these values are mostlyin agreement with the rv result, the mass of koi-94d estimated from the ttv issignificantly smaller than the rv value $m_{\rm d} = 106 \pm 11 m_{\oplus}$. inaddition, we find that the ttv of the outermost planet koi-94e is not wellreproduced in the current modeling. we also present analytic modeling of theppe and derive a simple formula to reconstruct the mutual inclination of thetwo planets from the observed height, central time, and duration of thebrightening caused by the ppe. based on this model, the implication of theresults of ttv analysis for the time of the next ppe is discussed.

0802.1808	simulations of baryon acoustic oscillations i: growth of large-scale  density fluctuations	we critically examine how well the evolution of large-scale densityperturbations is followed in cosmological $n$-body simulations. we first run alarge volume simulation and perform a mode-by-mode analysis inthree-dimensional fourier space. we show that the growth of large-scalefluctuations significantly deviates from linear theory predictions. thedeviations are caused by {\it nonlinear} coupling with a small number of modesat largest scales owing to finiteness of the simulation volume. we then developan analytic model based on second-order perturbation theory to quantify theeffect. our model accurately reproduces the simulation results. for a singlerealization, the second-order effect appears typically as ``zig-zag'' patternsaround the linear-theory prediction, which imprints artificial ``oscillations''that lie on the real baryon-acoustic oscillations. although an ensemble averageof a number of realizations approaches the linear theory prediction, thedispersions of the realizations remain large even for a large simulation volumeof several hundred megaparsecs on a side. for the standard $\lambda$cdm model,the deviations from linear growth rate are as large as 10 percent for asimulation volume with $l = 500h^{-1}$mpc and for a bin width in wavenumber of$\delta k = 0.005h$mpc$^{-1}$, which are comparable to the intrinsic varianceof gaussian random realizations. we find that the dispersions scales as$\propto l^{-3/2} \delta k^{-1/2}$ and that the mean dispersion amplitude canbe made smaller than a percent only if we use a very large volume of $l &gt;2h^{-1}$gpc. the finite box size effect needs to be appropriately taken intoaccount when interpreting results from large-scale structure simulations forfuture dark energy surveys using baryon acoustic oscillations.

1401.5876	tidal evolution of the spin-orbit angle in exoplanetary systems	the angle between the stellar spin and the planetary orbit axes (spin-orbitangle) is supposed to carry valuable information on the initial condition ofthe planet formation and the subsequent migration history. indeed currentobservations of the rossiter- mclaughlin effect have revealed a wide range ofspin-orbit misalignments for transiting exoplanets. we examine in detail thetidal evolution of a simple system comprising a sun-like star and a hot jupiteradopting the equilibrium tide and the inertial wave dissipation effectssimultaneously. we find that the combined tidal model works as a very efficientrealignment mechanism; it predicts three distinct states of the spin-orbitangle (i.e., parallel, polar, and anti-parallel orbits) for a while, but thelatter two states eventually approach the parallel spin-orbit configuration.the intermediate spin-orbit angles as measured in recent observations aredifficult to be achieved. therefore the current model cannot reproduce theobserved broad distribution of the spin-orbit angles, at least in its simpleform. this indicates that the observed diversity of the spin-orbit angles mayemerge from more complicated interactions with outer planets and/or may be theconsequence of the primordial misalignment between the proto-planetary disk andthe stellar spin, which requires future detailed studies.

1408.4232	regularized cosmological power spectrum and correlation function in  modified gravity models	based on the multi-point propagator expansion, we present resummedperturbative calculations for cosmological power spectra and correlationfunctions in the context of modified gravity. in a wide class of modifiedgravity models that have a screening mechanism to recover general relativity(gr) on small scales, we apply the eikonal approximation to derive thegoverning equation for resummed propagator that partly includes thenon-perturbative effect in the high-k limit. the resultant propagator in thehigh-k limit contains the new corrections arising from the screening mechanismas well as the standard exponential damping. we explicitly derive theexpression for new high-k contributions in specific modified gravity models,and find that in the case of f(r) gravity for a currently constrained modelparameter, the corrections are basically of the sub-leading order and can beneglected. thus, in f(r) gravity, similarly to the gr case, we can analyticallyconstruct the regularized propagator that reproduces both the resummed high-kbehavior and the low-k results computed with standard perturbation theory,consistently taking account of the nonlinear modification of gravity valid atlarge scales. with the regularized multi-point propagators, we give predictionsfor power spectrum and correlation function at one-loop order, and comparethose with n-body simulations in f(r) gravity model. as an importantapplication, we also discuss the redshift-space distortions and compute theanisotropic power spectra and correlation functions.

0705.1589	characteristic scales of baryon acoustic oscillations from perturbation  theory: non-linearity and redshift-space distortion effects	an acoustic oscillation of the primeval photon-baryon fluid around thedecoupling time imprints a characteristic scale in the galaxy distributiontoday, known as the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) scale. several on-goingand/or future galaxy surveys aim at detecting and precisely determining the baoscale so as to trace the expansion history of the universe. we considernonlinear and redshift-space distortion effects on the shifts of the bao scalein $k$-space using perturbation theory. the resulting shifts are indeedsensitive to different choices of the definition of the bao scale, which needsto be kept in mind in the data analysis. we present a toy model to explain thephysical behavior of the shifts. we find that the bao scale defined as inpercival et al. (2007) indeed shows very small shifts ($\lesssim$ 1%) relativeto the prediction in {\it linear theory} in real space. the shifts can bepredicted accurately for scales where the perturbation theory is reliable.

1411.2970	response function of the large-scale structure of the universe to the  small scale inhomogeneities	in order to infer the impact of the small-scale physics to the large-scaleproperties of the universe, we use a series of cosmological $n$-bodysimulations of self-gravitating matter inhomogeneities to measure, for thefirst time, the response function of such a system defined as a functionalderivative of the nonlinear power spectrum with respect to its linearcounterpart. its measured shape and amplitude are found to be in good agreementwith perturbation theory predictions except for the coupling from small tolarge-scale perturbations. the latter is found to be significantly damped,following a lorentzian form. these results shed light on validity regime ofperturbation theory calculations giving a useful guideline for regularizationof small scale effects in analytical modeling. most importantly our resultindicates that the statistical properties of the large-scale structure of theuniverse are remarkably insensitive to the details of the small-scale physics,astrophysical or gravitational, paving the way for the derivation of robustestimates of theoretical uncertainties on the determination of cosmologicalparameters from large-scale survey observations.

1411.7427	future detectability of gravitational-wave induced lensing from  high-sensitivity cmb experiments	we discuss the future detectability of gravitational-wave induced lensingfrom high-sensitivity cosmic microwave background (cmb) experiments.gravitational waves can induce a rotational component of the weak-lensingdeflection angle, usually referred to as the curl mode, which would beimprinted on the cmb maps. using the technique of reconstructing lensingsignals involved in cmb maps, this curl mode can be measured in an unbiasedmanner, offering an independent confirmation of the gravitational wavescomplementary to the b-mode polarization experiments. based on the fishermatrix analysis, we first show that with the noise levels necessary to confirmthe consistency relation for the primordial gravitational waves, the future cmbexperiments will be able to detect the gravitational-wave induced lensingsignals. for a tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r &lt; 0.1$, even if the consistencyrelation is difficult to confirm with a high significance, thegravitational-wave induced lensing would be detected at more than $3\,\sigma$significance level. further, we point out that high-sensitivity experimentswill be also powerful to constrain the gravitational waves generated after therecombination epoch. compared to the b-mode polarization, the curl mode isparticularly sensitive to gravitational waves generated at low redshifts ($z &lt;10$) with a low frequency ($k &lt; 10^{-3}$ mpc$^{-1}$), and it could give a muchtighter constraint on their energy density $\omega_{\rm gw}$ by more than threeorders of magnitude.

1412.0354	modeling the anomaly of surface number densities of galaxies on the  galactic extinction map due to their fir emission contamination	the most widely used galactic extinction map (schlegel, finkbeiner, &amp; davis1998, sfd) is constructed assuming that the observed fir fluxes entirely comefrom the galactic dust. according to the earlier suggestion by yahata et al.(2007), we consider how far-infrared (fir) emission of galaxies affects the sfdmap. we first compute the surface number density of sdss dr7 galaxies as afunction of the $r$-band extinction, $a_{r,\rm sfd}$. we confirm that thesurface densities of those galaxies positively correlate with $a_{r,\rm sfd}$for $a_{r,\rm sfd}&lt;0.1$, as first discovered by yahata et al. (2007) for sdssdr4 galaxies. next we construct an analytic model to compute the surfacedensity of galaxies taking account of the contamination of their fir emission.we adopt a log-normal probability distribution for the ratio of $100\mu {\rmm}$ and $r$-band luminosities of each galaxy, $y \equiv (\nu l)_{100\mu {\rmm}}/(\nu l)_r$. then we search for the mean and r.m.s values of $y$ that fitthe observed anomaly using the analytic model. the required values to reproducethe anomaly are roughly consistent with those measured from the stackinganalysis of sdss galaxies (kashiwagi, yahata, &amp; suto 2013). due to thelimitation of our statistical modeling, we are not yet able to remove the fircontamination of galaxies from the extinction map. nevertheless the agreementwith the model prediction suggests that the fir emission of galaxies is mainlyresponsible for the observed anomaly. while the corresponding systematic errorin the galactic extinction map is 0.1 to 1mmag, it is directly correlated withgalaxy clustering, and thus needs to be carefully examined in precisioncosmology.

1502.03099	cosmology with anisotropic galaxy clustering from the combination of  power spectrum and bispectrum	the apparent anisotropies of the galaxy clustering in observable redshiftspace provide a unique opportunity to simultaneously probe cosmic expansion andgravity on cosmological scales via the alcock--paczynski effect andredshift-space distortions. while the improved theoretical models have beenproposed and developed to describe the apparent anisotropic clustering atweakly non-linear scales, the applicability of these models is still limited inthe presence of the non--perturbative smearing effect caused by the randomnessof the relative velocities. although the cosmological constraint from theanisotropic clustering will be certainly improved with a more elaboratetheoretical model, we here consider an alternative way by using the statisticalpower of both the power spectrum and bispectrum at large scales. based on thefisher matrix analysis, we estimate the benefit of combining the power spectraand bispectra, finding that the constraints on the cosmic expansion and growthof structure will be improved by a factor of two. this compensates for the lossof constraining power using the power spectrum alone due to the randomness ofthe relative velocities.

astro-ph;0004288	nonlinear stochastic biasing from the formation epoch distribution of  dark halos	we propose a physical model for nonlinear stochastic biasing of one-pointstatistics resulting from the formation epoch distribution of dark halos. incontrast to previous works on the basis of extensive numerical simulations, ourmodel provides for the first time an analytic expression for the jointprobability function. specifically we derive the joint probability function ofhalo and mass density contrasts from the extended press-schechter theory. sincethis function is derived in the framework of the standard gravitationalinstability theory assuming the random-gaussianity of the primordial densityfield alone, we expect that the basic features of the nonlinear and stochasticbiasing predicted from our model are fairly generic. as representativeexamples, we compute the various biasing parameters in cold dark matter modelsas a function of a redshift and a smoothing length. our major findings are (1)the biasing of the variance evolves strongly as redshift while itsscale-dependence is generally weak and a simple linear biasing model provides areasonable approximation roughly at $r\simgt 2(1+z)\himpc$, and (2) thestochasticity exhibits moderate scale-dependence especially on $r\simlt20\himpc$, but is almost independent of $z$. comparison with the previousnumerical simulations shows good agreement with the above behavior, indicatingthat the nonlinear and stochastic nature of the halo biasing is essentiallyunderstood by taking account of the distribution of the halo mass and theformation epoch.

astro-ph;0011426	isodensity statistics on clustering of high-z objects in cosmological  redshift-spaces	we discuss the systematic effects arising from the cosmologicalredshift-space (geometric) distortion on the statistical analysis of isodensitycontour using high-redshift catalogs. especially, we present a simpletheoretical model for isodensity statistics in cosmological redshift-space, asa generalization of the work by matsubara (1996). the statistical quantitiesconsidered here are the two- and three-dimensional genus of isodensity contour,the area of surface, the length of contour intersecting with a plane and thenumber of the crossing points of isodensity contour on a line. we give usefulanalytic formulae for the isodensity statistics, which take into account thecorrections from the geometric distortion, the nonlinear clustering and thenonlinear velocity distortion phenomenologically. we then demonstrate how thegeometric distortion and the nonlinear corrections alter shapes of thestatistical quantities on the basis of plausible cosmological models. ourresults show that the nonlinear correction can be sensitive to a choice of theredshift-space coordinate as increasing the redshift. the low-dimensionalquantities such as two-dimensional genus systematically yield anisotropy due tothe geometric and velocity distortions and their angle-dependence shows the$10\sim20%$ difference of amplitude. sensitivity for typical high-redshiftsamples are estimated in an analytic manner, and the influence of thelight-cone effect for the isodensity statistics is also discussed.

astro-ph;0012433	the effect of bias and redshift distortions on a geometric test for the  cosmological constant	we revisit the feasibility of a cosmological test with the geometricdistortion focusing on an ambiguous factor of the evolution of bias. startingfrom defining estimators for the spatial two-point correlation function and thepower spectrum, in a rigorous manner, we derive useful formulas for thetwo-point clustering statistics which take the light-cone effect and theredshift-space distortions into account. then we investigate how the predictedcorrelation functions are affected by the redshift-space distortions and thebias assuming quasar samples which roughly match the 2df survey. effect of thebias is crucial, in particular, on anisotropic component of the clusteringstatistics in redshift-space. by surveying behavior of the predictedcorrelation functions to parameters of a phenomenological model for theevolution of bias, it is shown that the correlation functions on the light-coneis sensitive to a mean amplitude of the bias and rather insensitive to thespeed of its redshift-evolution. this feature is useful for an analysis of thegeometric test.

astro-ph;0112119	strong gravitational lensing time delay statistics and the density  profile of dark halos	the distribution of differential time delays \delta t between images producedby strong gravitational lensing contains information on the mass distributionsin the lensing objects as well as on cosmological parameters such as h_0. wederive an explicit expression for the conditional probability distributionfunction of time delays p(\delta t|\theta), given an image separation betweenmultiple images \theta, and related statistics. we consider lensing halosdescribed by the singular isothermal sphere (sis) approximation and by itsgeneralization as proposed by navarro, frenk, &amp; white (nfw) which has a densityprofile \rho \propto r^{-\alpha} in the innermost region. the time delaydistribution is very sensitive to these profiles; steeper inner slopes tend toproduce larger time delays. for example, if h_0=70 km/s/mpc, a\lambda-dominated cosmology and a source redshift z_s=1.27 are assumed, lenseswith \theta=5'' produce a time delay of \delta t[yr]=1.5^{+1.7}_{-0.9},0.39^{+0.37}_{-0.22}, 0.15^{+0.11}_{-0.09}, and 0.071^{+0.054}_{-0.038} (50%confidence interval), for sis, generalized nfw with \alpha=1.5, \alpha=1.0, and\alpha=0.5, respectively. at a fixed image separation, the time delay isdetermined by the difference in the lensing potential between the position ofthe two images, which typically occur at different impact parameters. althoughthe values of \delta t are proportional to the inverse of h_0, p(\deltat|\theta) is rather insensitive to all other cosmological model parameters,source redshifts, magnification biases and so on. a knowledge of p(\deltat|\theta) will also be useful in designing the observing program of futurelarge scale synoptic variability surveys and for evaluating possible selectionbiases operating against large splitting lens systems.

astro-ph;0301567	evolution of cosmological density distribution function from the local  collapse model	we present a general framework to treat the evolution of one-pointprobability distribution function (pdf) for cosmic density $\delta$ andvelocity-divergence fields $\theta$. in particular, we derive an evolutionequation for the one-point pdfs and consider the stochastic nature associatedwith these quantities. under the local approximation that the evolution ofcosmic fluid fields can be characterized by the lagrangian local dynamics withfinite degrees of freedom, evolution equation for pdfs becomes a closed formand consistent formal solutions are constructed. adopting this localapproximation, we explicitly evaluate the one-point pdfs $p(\delta)$ and$p(\theta)$ from the spherical and the ellipsoidal collapse models as therepresentative lagrangian local dynamics. in a gaussian initial condition,while the local density pdf from the ellipsoidal model almost coincides withthe that of the spherical model, differences between spherical and ellipsoidalcollapse model are found in the velocity-divergence pdf. importantly, the jointpdf of local density, $p(\delta,t;\delta',t')$, evaluated at the samelagrangian position but at the different times $t$ and $t'$ from theellipsoidal collapse model exhibits a large amount of scatter. the meanrelation between $\delta$ and $\delta'$ does fail to match the one-to-onemapping obtained from spherical collapse model. moreover, the joint pdf$p(\delta;\theta)$ from the ellipsoidal collapse model shows a similarstochastic feature, both of which are indeed consistent with the recent resultfrom n-body simulations.

astro-ph;0302444	biasing and genus statistics of dark matter halos in the hubble volume  simulation	we present a numerical analysis of genus statistics for dark matter halocatalogs from the hubble volume simulation. the huge box-size of the hubblevolume simulation enables us to carry out a reliable statistical analysis ofthe biasing properties of halos at a gaussian smoothing scale of r_g&gt;30mpc/hwith a cluster-mass scale of between 7*10^{13}msolar/h and 6*10^{15}msolar/h. adetailed comparison of the genus for dark matter halos with that for the massdistribution shows that the non-gaussianity induced by the halo biasing iscomparable to that by nonlinear gravitational evolution, and both the shape andthe amplitude of the genus are almost insensitive to the halo mass atr_g&gt;30mpc/h. in order to characterize the biasing effect on the genus, we applya perturbative formula developed by matsubara (1994). we find that theperturbative formula well describes the simulated halo genus at r_g&gt;50mpc/h.the result indicates that the biasing effect on the halo genus is wellapproximated by nonlinear deterministic biasing up to the second-order term inthe mass density fluctuation. the two parameters describing the linear andquadratic terms in the nonlinear biasing accurately specify the genus forgalaxy clusters.

astro-ph;0402618	cosmological density distribution function from the ellipsoidal collapse  model in real space	we calculate the one-point probability distribution function (pdf) for cosmicdensity in non-linear regime of the gravitational evolution. under the localapproximation that the evolution of cosmic fluid fields can be characterized bythe lagrangian local dynamics with finite degrees of freedom, the analyticexpressions of pdf are derived taking account of the smoothing effect. thevalidity and the usefulness of the local approximation are then discussedcomparing those results with n-body simulations in a gaussian initialcondition. adopting the ellipsoidal collapse model (ecm) and the sphericalcollapse model (scm) as lagrangian local dynamics, we found that the pdfs fromthe local approximation excellently match the simulation results in the case ofthe cold dark matter initial spectrum.  as for the scale-free initial spectra given by $p(k)\propto k^n$,  n-body result suffers from spurious numerical effects, which prevent us togive a detailed comparison.  nevertheless, at the quality of n-body data, the model predictions based onthe ecm and the scm quantitatively agree with n-body results in cases withspectral index n&lt;0.  for the index n&gt;=0, choice of the lagrangian local dynamics becomes crucialfor an accurate prediction and a more delicate modeling is required, however,we find that the model prediction based on the ecm provides a betterapproximation to the n-body results of cumulants and pdfs.

astro-ph;0410499	the rossiter-mclaughlin effect and analytic radial velocity curves for  transiting extrasolar planetary systems	a transiting extrasolar planet sequentially blocks off the light coming fromthe different parts of the disk of the host star in a time dependent manner.due to the spin of the star, this produces an asymmetric distortion in the lineprofiles of the stellar spectrum, leading to an apparent anomaly of the radialvelocity curves, known as the rossiter - mclaughlin effect. here, we deriveapproximate but accurate analytic formulae for the anomaly of radial velocitycurves taking account of the stellar limb darkening. the formulae areparticularly useful in extracting information of the projected angle betweenthe planetary orbit axis and the stellar spin axis, \lambda, and the projectedstellar spin velocity, v sin i_s. we create mock samples for the radial curvesfor the transiting extrasolar system hd209458, and demonstrate that constraintson the spin parameters (v sin i_s, \lambda) may be significantly improved bycombining our analytic template formulae and the precision velocity curves fromhigh-resolution spectroscopic observations with 8-10 m class telescopes. thusfuture observational exploration of transiting systems using the rossiter -mclaughlin effect is one of the most important probes to better understandingof the origin of extrasolar planetary systems, especially the origin of theirangular momentum.

astro-ph;0504555	measurement of spin-orbit alignment in an extrasolar planetary system	we determine the stellar, planetary, and orbital properties of the transitingplanetary system hd 209458, through a joint analysis of high-precision radialvelocities, photometry, and timing of the secondary eclipse. of primaryinterest is the strong detection of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect, thealteration of photospheric line profiles that occurs because the planet occultspart of the rotating surface of the star. we develop a new technique formodeling this effect, and use it to determine the inclination of the planetaryorbit relative to the apparent stellar equator [lambda = (-4.4 +/- 1.4)degrees], and the line-of-sight rotation speed of the star [v*sin(i) = (4.70+/- 0.16) km/s]. the uncertainty in these quantities has been reduced by anorder of magnitude relative to the pioneering measurements by queloz andcollaborators. the small but nonzero misalignment is probably a relic of theplanet formation epoch, because the expected timescale for tidalcoplanarization is larger than the age of the star. our determination ofv*sin(i) is a rare case in which rotational line broadening has been isolatedfrom other broadening mechanisms.

astro-ph;0609740	bispectrum and nonlinear biasing of galaxies: perturbation analysis,  numerical simulation and sdss galaxy clustering	we consider nonlinear biasing models of galaxies with particular attention toa correlation between linear and quadratic biasing coefficients, b_1 and b_2.we first derive perturbative expressions for b_1 and b_2 in halo and peakbiasing models. then we compute power spectra and bispectra of dark matterparticles and halos using n-body simulation data and of volume-limitedsubsamples of sloan digital sky survey (sdss) galaxies, and determine their b_1and b_2. we find that the values of those coefficients at linear regimes(k&lt;0.2h/mpc) are fairly insensitive to the redshift-space distortion and thesurvey volume shape. the resulting normalized amplitudes of bispectra, q, forequilateral triangles, are insensitive to the values of b_1 implying that b_2indeed correlates with b_1. the present results explain the previous finding ofkayo et al. (2004) for the hierarchical relation of three-point correlationfunctions of sdss galaxies. while the relations between b_1 and b_2 arequantitatively different for specific biasing models, their approximatelysimilar correlations indicate a fairly generic outcome of the biasing due tothe gravity in primordial gaussian density fields.

astro-ph;0611466	predicting photometric and spectroscopic signatures of rings around  transiting extrasolar planets	we present theoretical predictions for photometric and spectroscopicsignatures of rings around transiting extrasolar planets. on the basis of ageneral formulation for the transiting signature in the stellar light curve andthe velocity anomaly due to the rossiter effect, we compute the expectedsignals analytically for a face-on ring system, and numerically for moregeneral configurations. we study the detectability of a ring around atransiting planet located at a=3au for a variety of obliquity and azimuthalangles, and find that it is possible to detect the ring signature bothphotometrically and spectroscopically unless the ring is almost edge-on (i.e.,the obliquity angle of the ring \theta is much less than unity). we alsoconsider the detectability of planetary rings around a close-in planet, hd209458b ($\theta\approx 90^\circ-i_{\rm orbit} \approx 3^\circ.32$), and saturn($\theta \approx 26^\circ.7$) as illustrative examples. while the former isdifficult to detect with the current precision (photometric precision of 10^-4and radial velocity precision of 1 m/s), a marginal detection of the latter ispossible photometrically. if the future precision of the radial velocitymeasurement reaches even below 0.1 m/s, they will be even detectable from theground-based spectroscopic observations.

astro-ph;9909124	stochastic biasing and weakly non-linear evolution of power spectrum	distribution of galaxies may be a biased tracer of the dark matterdistribution and the relation between the galaxies and the total mass may bestochastic, non-linear and time-dependent. since many observations of galaxyclustering will be done at high redshift, the time evolution of non-linearstochastic biasing would play a crucial role for the data analysis of thefuture sky surveys. in this paper, we develop the weakly non-linear analysisand attempt to clarify the non-linear feature of the stochastic biasing. wecompute the one-loop correction of the power spectrum for the total mass, thegalaxies and their cross correlation. assuming the local functional form forthe initial galaxy distribution, we investigate the time evolution of thebiasing parameter and the correlation coefficient. on large scales, we firstfind that the time evolution of the biasing parameter could deviate from thelinear prediction in presence of the initial skewness. however, the deviationcan be reduced when the initial stochasticity exists. next, we focus on thequasi-linear scales, where the non-linear growth of the total mass becomesimportant. it is recognized that the scale-dependence of the biasingdynamically appears and the initial stochasticity could affect the timeevolution of the scale-dependence. the result is compared with the recentn-body simulation that the scale-dependence of the halo biasing can appear onrelatively large scales and the biasing parameter takes the lower value onsmaller scales. qualitatively, our weakly non-linear results can explain thistrend if the halo-mass biasing relation has the large scatter at high redshift.

0810.0813	modeling nonlinear evolution of baryon acoustic oscillations:  convergence regime of n-body simulations and analytic models	we use a series of cosmological n-body simulations and various analyticmodels to study the evolution of the matter power spectrum in real space in a\lambda cold dark matter universe. we compare the results of n-body simulationsagainst three analytical model predictions; standard perturbation theory,renormalized perturbation theory, and the closure approximation. we include theeffects from finite simulation box size in the comparison. we determine thevalues of the maximum wavenumbers, k^{lim}_{1%} and k^{lim}_{3%}, below whichthe analytic models and the simulation results agree to within 1 and 3 percent,respectively. we then provide a simple empirical function which describes theconvergence regime determined by comparison between our simulations and theanalytical models. we find that if we use the fourier modes within theconvergence regime alone, the characteristic scale of baryon acousticoscillations can be determined within 1% accuracy from future surveys with avolume of a few h^{-3}gpc^3 at z\sim1 or z\sim3 in the absence of anysystematic distortion of the power spectrum.

cond-mat;0211305	gravothermal catastrophe and tsallis' generalized entropy of  self-gravitating systems iii. quasi-equilibrium structure using normalized  q-values	we revisit the issues on the thermodynamic property of stellarself-gravitating system arising from tsallis' non-extensive entropy. previouspapers (taruya &amp; sakagami, physica a 307 (2002) 185 (cond-mat/0107494); ibid.(2002) in press (cond-mat/0204315)) have revealed that the extremum-state oftsallis entropy characterized by the so-called stellar polytrope has consistentthermodynamic structure, which predicts the thermodynamic instability due tothe negative specific heat. however, their analyses heavily relies on the oldtsallis formalism using standard linear mean values. in this paper, extendingour previous study, we focus on the equilibrium structure based on the standardframework by means of the normalized q-expectation values. it then turns outthat the new extremum-state of tsallis entropy essentially remains unchangedfrom the previous result, i.e., the stellar quasi-equilibrium distribution canbe described by the stellar polytrope. while the thermodynamic stability for asystem confined in an adiabatic wall completely agrees with the previous studyand thereby the stability/instability criterion remains unchanged, thestability analysis reveals a new equilibrium property for the system surroundedby a thermal bath. in any case, the stability/instability criteria areconsistently explained from the presence of negative specific heat and withinthe formalism, the stellar polytrope is characterized as a plausiblenon-extensive meta-equilibrium state.

gr-qc;0411017	probing anisotropies of gravitational-wave backgrounds with a  space-based interferometer: geometric properties of antenna patterns and  their angular power	we discuss the sensitivity to anisotropies of stochastic gravitational-wavebackgrounds (gwbs) observed via space-based interferometer. in addition to theunresolved galactic binaries as the most promising gwb source of the plannedlaser interferometer space antenna (lisa), the extragalactic sources for gwbsmight be detected in the future space missions. the anisotropies of the gwbsthus play a crucial role to discriminate various components of the gwbs. westudy general features of antenna pattern sensitivity to the anisotropies ofgwbs beyond the low-frequency approximation. we show that the sensitivity ofspace-based interferometer to gwbs is severely restricted by the datacombinations and the symmetries of the detector configuration. the sphericalharmonic analysis of the antenna pattern functions reveals that the angularpower of the detector response increases with frequency and the detectablemultipole moments with effective sensitivity h_{eff} \sim 10^{-20} hz^{-1/2}may reach $\ell \sim$ 8-10 at $f \sim f_*=10$ mhz in the case of the singlelisa detector. however, the cross correlation of optimal interferometricvariables is blind to the monopole (\ell=0) intensity anisotropy, and also tothe dipole (\ell=1) in some case, irrespective of the frequency band. besides,all the self-correlated signals are shown to be blind to the odd multipolemoments (\ell=odd), independently of the frequency band.

gr-qc;0507114	probing anisotropies of gravitational-wave backgroundswith a space-based  interferometer ii: perturbative reconstruction of a low-frequency skymap	we present a perturbative reconstruction method to make a skymap ofgravitational-wave backgrounds (gwbs) observed via space-based interferometer.in the presence of anisotropies in gwbs, the cross-correlated signals ofobserved gwbs are inherently time-dependent due to the non-stationarity of thegravitational-wave detector. since the cross-correlated signal is obtainedthrough an all-sky integral of primary signals convolving with the antennapattern function of gravitational-wave detectors, the non-stationarity ofcross-correlated signals, together with full knowledge of antenna patternfunctions, can be used to reconstruct an intensity map of the gwbs. here, wegive two simple methods to reconstruct a skymap of gwbs based on theperturbative expansion in low-frequency regime. the first one is based onharmonic-fourier representation of data streams and the second is based on"direct" time-series data. the latter method enables us to create a skymap in adirect manner. the reconstruction technique is demonstrated in the case of thegalactic gravitational wave background observed via planned spaceinterferometer, lisa. although the angular resolution of low-frequency skymapis rather restricted, the methodology presented here would be helpful indiscriminating the gwbs of galactic origins by those of the extragalacticand/or cosmological origins.
