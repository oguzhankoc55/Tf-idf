0901.4093	the physical properties of four ~600k t dwarfs	we present spitzer 7.6-14.5um spectra of ulas j003402.77-005206.7 and ulasj133553.45+113005.2, two t9 dwarfs with the latest spectral types currentlyknown. we fit synthetic spectra and photometry to the near- throughmid-infrared energy distributions of these dwarfs and that of the t8 dwarf2mass j09393548-2448279. we also analyse near-infrared data for another t9,cfbd j005910.82-011401.3. we find that the ratio of the mid- to near-infraredfluxes is very sensitive to effective temperature at these low temperatures,and that the 2.2 and 4.5um fluxes are sensitive to metallicity and gravity;there is a degeneracy between these parameters. the 4.5 and 10um fluxes arealso sensitive to vertical transport of gas through the atmosphere, which wefind to be significant for these dwarfs. the full near- through mid-infraredspectral energy distribution allows us to constrain the effective temperature(k)/gravity (m/s2)/metallicity ([m/h] dex) of ulas j0034-00 and ulas j1335+11to 550-600/ 100-300/ 0.0-0.3 and 500-550/ 100-300/ 0.0-0.3, respectively. thesefits imply low masses and young ages for the dwarfs of 5-20 m(jup) and 0.1-2gyr. the fits to 2mass j0939-24 are in good agreement with the measureddistance, the observational data, and the earlier t8 near-infrared spectraltype if it is a slightly metal-poor 4-10 gyr old system consisting of a 500 and700k, ~25 and ~40 m(jup), pair, although it is also possible that it is anidentical pair of 600k, 30 m(jup), dwarfs. as no mid-infrared data areavailable for cfbd j0059-01 its properties are less well constrained;nevertheless it appears to be a 550-600k dwarf with g= 300-2000 m/s2 and [m/h]=0-0.3 dex. these properties correspond to mass and age ranges of 10-50 m(jup)and 0.5-10 gyr for this dwarf.

0902.1812	the discovery of an m4+t8.5 binary system	we report the discovery of a t8.5 dwarf, which is a companion to the m4 dwarfwolf 940. at a distance of 12.50 (+0.75,-0.67) pc, the angular separation of32arcsec corresponds to a projected separation of 400 au. the m4 primarydisplays no halpha emission, and we apply the age-activity relations of west etal. to place a lower limit on the age of the system of 3.5 gyr. weak halphaabsorption suggests some residual activity and we estimate an upper age limitof 6 gyr. we apply the relations of bonfils et al for v-ks and m_ks todetermine the metallicity, [fe/h] = -0.06 +/- 0.20 for wolf~940a, and byextension the t8.5 secondary, wolf 940b. we have obtained jhk niri spectroscopyand jhkl' photometry of wolf 940b, and use these data, in combination withtheoretical extensions, to determine its bolometric flux, fbol = 1.75 +/- 0.18e-16 wm^-2 and thus its luminosity log(l*/lsun) = -6.07 +/- 0.04. using the ageconstraints for the system, and evolutionary structural models of baraffe etal. we determine teff = 570 +/- 25k and log g = 4.75-5.00 for wolf940b, basedon its bolometric luminosity. this represents the first determination of theseproperties for a t8+ dwarf that does not rely on the fitting of t-dwarfspectral models. this object represents the first system containing a t8+ dwarffor which fiducial constraints on its properties are available, and we compareits spectra with those of the latest very cool bt-settl models. this clearlydemonstrates that the use of the (w_j,k/j) spectral ratios (used previously toconstrain teff and log g) would have over-estimated teff by ~100k.

1001.0762	mid-infrared photometry of cold brown dwarfs: diversity in age, mass and  metallicity	we present spitzer irac photometry of twelve very late-type t dwarfs; ninehave [3.6], [4.5], [5.8] and [8.0] photometry and three have [3.6] and [4.5]photometry only. we investigate trends with type and color for the planning andinterpretation of surveys for the coldest t or y dwarfs. brown dwarfs witheffective temperature (t_eff) below 700k emit more than half their flux atwavelengths beyond 3um, and the ratio of the mid-infrared flux to thenear-infrared flux becomes very sensitive to t_eff. the color h-[4.5] is a goodindicator of t_eff with a relatively weak dependence on metallicity andgravity. conversely, the colors h-k and [4.5]-[5.8] are sensitive tometallicity and gravity. thus near- and mid-infrared photometry provide usefulindicators of the fundamental properties of brown dwarfs, and if temperatureand gravity are known, then mass and age can be determined from evolutionarymodels. there are twelve dwarfs known with h-[4.5]&gt;3.0, and 500&lt; t_eff k &lt; 800,which we examine in detail. the ages of these dwarfs range from very young(0.1-1.0 gyr) to relatively old (3-12 gyr). the mass range is possibly as lowas 5 jupiter masses to up to 70 jupiter masses. the metallicities also span alarge range, from [m/h] -0.3 to [m/h] +0.3. the small number of t8-t9 dwarfsfound in the ukirt infrared deep sky survey to date appear to be mostly younglow-mass dwarfs. extensions to the mid-infrared space missions warm-spitzer andwise are desirable in order to obtain the vital mid-infrared data for coldbrown dwarfs, and to discover more of these rare objects.

1001.4393	the discovery of a very cool binary system	we report the discovery of a very cool d/sdl7+t7.5p common proper motionbinary system, sdss j1416+13ab, found by cross-matching the ukidss large areasurvey data release 5 against the sloan digital sky survey data release 7. thed/sdl7 is blue in j-h and h-k and has other features suggestive oflow-metallicity and/or high gravity. the t7.5p displays spectral peculiarityseen before in earlier type dwarfs discovered in ukidss las dr4, and referredto as ch4-j-early peculiarity. we suggest that ch4-j-early peculiarity arisesfrom low-metallicity and/or high-gravity, and speculate as to its use forclassifying t dwarfs. ukidss and follow-up ukirt/wfcam photometry shows the tdwarf to have the bluest near infrared colours yet seen for such an object withh-k = -1.31+/-0.17. warm spitzer irac photometry shows the t dwarf to haveextremely red h-[4.5] = 4.86+/-0.04, which is the reddest yet seen for asubstellar object. the lack of parallax measurement for the pair limits ourability to estimate parameters for the system. however, applying a conservativedistance estimate of 5-15 pc suggests a projected separation in range 45-135au. by comparing h-k:h-[4.5] colours of the t dwarf to spectral models weestimate that teff = 500 k and [m/h]~-0.30, with log g ~ 5.0. this suggests amass of ~30 mjupiter for the t dwarf and an age of ~10 gyr for the system. theprimary would then be a 75mjupiter object with log g ~ 5.5 and a relativelydust-free teff ~ 1500k atmosphere. given the unusual properties of the systemwe caution that these estimates are uncertain. we eagerly await parallaxmeasurements and high-resolution imaging which will constrain the parametersfurther.

1003.1753	the linear polarization of nearby bright stars measured at the parts per  million level	we report observations of the linear polarization of a sample of 49 nearbybright stars measured to sensitivities of between ~1 and 4 x 10^-6. themajority of stars in the sample show measurable polarization, but mostpolarizations are small with 75% of the stars having p &lt; 2 x 10^-5.correlations of the polarization with distance and position, indicate that mostof the polarization is of interstellar origin. polarizations are small near thegalactic pole and larger at low galactic latitudes, and the polarizationincreases with distance. however, the interstellar polarization is very muchless than would be expected based on polarization-distance relations fordistant stars showing that the solar neighbourhood has little interstellardust. bs 3982 (regulus) has a polarization of ~ 37 x 10^-6, which is mostlikely due to electron scattering in its rotationally flattened atmosphere. bs7001 (vega) has polarization at a level of ~ 17 x 10^-6 which could be due toscattering in its dust disk, but is also consistent with interstellarpolarization in this direction. the highest polarization observed is that of bs7405 (alpha vul) with a polarization of 0.13%

1004.1912	forty seven new t dwarfs from the ukidss large area survey	we report the discovery of 47 new t dwarfs in the fourth data release (dr4)from the large area survey (las) of the ukirt infrared deep sky survey withspectral types ranging from t0 to t8.5. these bring the total sample of las tdwarfs to 80 as of dr4. in assigning spectral types to our objects we haveidentified 8 new spectrally peculiar objects, and divide 7 of them into twoclasses. h2o-h-early have a h2o-h index that differs with the h2o-j index by atleast 2 sub-types. ch4-j-early have a ch4-j index that disagrees with the h20-jindex by at least 2 subtypes. we have ruled out binarity as a sole explanationfor both types of peculiarity, and suggest that they may represent hithertounrecognised tracers of composition and/or gravity. clear trends in z'(ab)-jand y-j are apparent for our sample, consistent with weakening absorption inthe red wing of the ki line at 0.77microns with decreasing effectivetemperature. we have used our sample to estimate space densities for t6-t9dwarfs. by comparing our sample to monte-carlo simulations of field t dwarfsfor various mass functions of the form phi(m) \propto m^-alpha, we have placedweak constraints on the form of the field mass function. our analysis suggeststhat the substellar mass function is declining at lower masses, with negativevalues of alpha preferred. this is at odds with results for young clusters thathave been generally found to have alpha &gt; 0.

0708.0655	a very cool brown dwarf in ukidss dr1	(abridged) we report the discovery of a very cool brown dwarf, ulasj003402.77-005206.7 (ulas j0034-00), identified in ukidss dr1. we provideoptical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared photometry of the source, and twonear-infrared spectra. comparing the spectral energy distribution of ulasj0034-00 to that of the t8 brown dwarf 2mass j0415-09, the latest-type andcoolest well-studied brown dwarf to date, with teff~750 k, we find evidencethat ulas j0034-00 is significantly cooler. first, the measured values of thenear-infrared absorption spectral indices imply a later classification, oft8.5. second, the h-[4.49] colour provides an empirical estimate of thetemperature of 540&lt;teff&lt;660 k (+/-2sig range). third, the j- and h-band peaksare somewhat narrower in ulas j0034-00, and detailed comparison againstspectral models calibrated to 2mass j0415-09 yields an estimated temperaturelower by 60-120 k relative to 2mass j0415-09 i.e. 630&lt;teff&lt;690 k (+/-2sig), andlower gravity or higher metallicity according to the degenerate combination-0.5&lt;delta(log g-2[m/h])&lt;-0.25 (+/-2sig). combining these estimates, andconsidering systematics, it is likely the temperature lies in the range600&lt;teff&lt;700 k. despite the low inferred teff we find no evidence for strongabsorption by nh3 over the wavelength range 1.51-1.56 um. evolutionary modelsimply that the mass and age are in the ranges 15-36 m(jup) and 0.5-8 gyr,respectively. the measured proper motion, of (0.37+/-0.07)arcsec/yr, combinedwith the photometrically estimated distance of 14-22 pc, implies a tangentialvelocity of ~30 km/s. ulas j0034-00 is significantly bluer than 2mass j0415-09in y-j, so future searches should allow for the possibility that cooler tdwarfs are bluer still.

0708.1275	optical spectroscopic classification and membership of young m dwarfs in  star-forming regions	the spectral type is a key parameter in calibrating the temperature which isrequired to estimate the mass of young stars and brown dwarfs. we describe anapproach developed to classify low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the trapeziumcluster using red optical spectra, which can be applied to other star-formingregions. the classification uses two methods for greater accuracy: the use ofnarrowband spectral indices which rely on the variation of the strength ofmolecular lines with spectral type and a comparison with other previouslyclassified young, low-mass objects in the chamaeleon i star-forming region. wehave investigated and compared many different molecular indices and haveidentified a small number of indices which work well for classifying m-typeobjects in nebular regions. the indices are calibrated for young, pre-mainsequence objects whose spectra are affected by their lower surface gravitiescompared with those on the main sequence. spectral types obtained areessentially independent of both reddening and nebular emission lines.confirmation of candidate young stars and brown dwarfs as bona fide clustermembers may be accomplished with moderate resolution spectra in the opticalregion by an analysis of the strength of the gravity-sensitive na doublet. ithas been established that this feature is much weaker in these very youngobjects than in field dwarfs. a sodium spectral index is used to estimate thesurface gravity and to demonstrate quantitatively the difference between young(1-2myr) objects, and dwarf and giant field stars.

0708.1280	an optical spectroscopic h-r diagram for low-mass stars and brown dwarfs  in orion	the masses and temperatures of young low mass stars and brown dwarfs in star-forming regions are not yet well established because of uncertainties in theage of individual objects and the spectral type vs. temperature scaleappropriate for objects with ages of only a few myr. using multi-object opticalspectroscopy, 45 low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the trapezium cluster inorion have been classified and 44 of these confirmed as bona fide clustermembers. the spectral types obtained have been converted to effectivetemperatures using a temperature scale intermediate between those of dwarfs andgiants, which is suitable for young pre-main sequence objects. the objects havebeen placed on an h-r diagram overlaid with theoretical isochrones. the lowmass stars and the higher mass substellar objects are found to be clusteredaround the 1 myr isochrone, while many of the lower mass substellar objects arelocated well above this isochrone. an average age of 1 myr is found for themajority of the objects. assuming coevality of the sources and an average ageof 1 myr, the masses of the objects have been estimated and range from 0.018 to0.44msun. the spectra also allow an investigation of the surface gravity of theobjects by measurement of the sodium doublet equivalent width. with onepossible exception, all objects have low gravities, in line with young ages,and the na indices for the trapezium objects lie systematically below those ofyoung stars and brown dwarfs in chamaeleon, suggesting that the 820 nm na indexmay provide a sensitive means of estimating ages in young clusters.

0712.0384	initial data release from the int photometric h-alpha survey of the  northern galactic plane (iphas)	the int/wfc photometric h-alpha survey of the northern galactic plane (iphas)is an imaging survey being carried out in h-alpha, r' and i' filters, with thewide field camera (wfc) on the 2.5-metre isaac newton telescope (int) to adepth of r'=20 (10 sigma). the survey is aimed at revealing large scalestructure in our local galaxy, and also the properties of key early and latepopulations making up the milky way. mapping emission line objects enables aparticular focus on objects in the young and old stages of stellar evolutionranging from early t-tauri stars to late planetary nebulae. in this paper wepresent the iphas initial data release, primarily a photometric catalogue ofabout 200 million unique objects, coupled with associated image data coveringabout 1600 square degrees in three passbands. we note how access to the primarydata products has been implemented through use of standard virtual observatorypublishing interfaces. simple traditional web access is provided to the mainiphas photometric catalogue, in addition to a number of common catalogues (suchas 2mass) which are of immediate relevance. access through the astrogrid vodesktop opens up the full range of analysis options, and allows fullintegration with the wider range of data and services available through thevirtual observatory. the idr represents the largest dataset published primarilythrough vo interfaces to date, and so stands as an examplar of the future ofsurvey data mining. examples of data access are given, including across-matching of iphas photometry with sources in the ukidss galactic planesurvey that validates the existing calibration of the best data.

1212.1784	the mid-infrared environments of 6.7 ghz methanol masers from the  methanol multi-beam survey	we present a study of the mid-infrared environments and association with starformation tracers of 6.7 ghz methanol masers taken from the methanol multi-beam(mmb) survey. our ultimate goal is to establish the mass of the host star andits evolutionary stage for each maser site. as a first step, the glimpse surveyof the galactic plane is utilised to investigate the environment of 776methanol masers and we find that while the majority of the masers areassociated with mid-infrared counterparts, a significant fraction (17%) are notassociated with any detectable mid-infrared emission. a number of the masercounterparts are clearly extended with respect to the glimpse point spreadfunction and we implement an adaptive non-circular aperture photometry (ancap)technique to determine the fluxes of the maser counterparts. the ancaptechnique doubles the number of masers with flux information at all fourwavelengths compared to the number of the corresponding counterparts obtainedfrom the glimpse point source catalogue. the colours of the maser counterpartsare found to be very similar to the smaller study carried out by ellingsen(2006). the mmb masers are weakly associated with extended green objects (egos)and red msx survey (rms) embedded sources (yso and hii classifications) with18% and 12% of masers associated with these objects respectively. the majorityof mmb masers (60%) have detectable glimpse infrared counterparts but have notbeen identified with previously recognised tracers of massive star formation;this confirms that the mmb survey has the potential to identify massive starforming regions independent of infrared selection.

1304.7246	seventy six t dwarfs from the ukidss las: benchmarks, kinematics and an  updated space density	we report the discovery of 76 new t dwarfs from the ukidss large area survey(las). near-infrared broad and narrow-band photometry and spectroscopy arepresented for the new objects, along with wise and warm-spitzer photometry.proper motions for 128 ukidss t dwarfs are presented from a new two epoch lasproper motion catalogue. we use these motions to identify two new benchmarksystems: lhs 6176ab, a t8+m4 pair and hd118865ab, a t5.5+f8 pair. using ageconstraints from the primaries and evolutionary models to constrain the radiiwe have estimated their physical properties from their bolometric luminosity.we compare the colours and properties of known benchmark t dwarfs to the latestmodel atmospheres and draw two principal conclusions. firstly, it appears thatthe h - [4.5] and j - w2 colours are more sensitive to metallicity than haspreviously been recognised, such that differences in metallicity may dominateover differences in teff when considering relative properties of cool objectsusing these colours. secondly, the previously noted apparent dominance of youngobjects in the late-t dwarf sample is no longer apparent when using the newmodel grids and the expanded sample of late-t dwarfs and benchmarks. this issupported by the apparently similar distribution of late-t dwarfs andearlier-type t dwarfs on reduced proper motion diagrams that we present.finally, we present updated space densities for the late-t dwarfs, and compareour values to simulation predictions and those from wise.

1308.0495	a deep wise search for very late type objects and the discovery of two  halo/thick-disk t dwarfs: wise 0013+0634 and wise 0833+0052	a method is defined for identifying late t and y dwarfs in wise down to lowvalues of signal-to-noise. this requires a wise detection only in the w2-bandand uses the statistical properties of the wise multi-frame measurements andprofile fit photometry to reject contamination resulting from non-point-likeobjects, variables and moving sources. to trace our desired parameter space weuse a control sample of isolated non-moving non-variable point sources from thesdss, and identify a sample of 158 wise w2-only candidates down to asignal-to-noise limit of 8. for signal-to-noise ranges &gt;10 and 8-10respectively, ~45% and ~90% of our sample fall outside the selection criteriapublished by the wise team (kirkpatrick et al. 2012), due mainly to the type ofconstraints placed on the number of individual w2 detections. we presentfollow-up of eight candidates and identify wise 0013+0634 and wise 0833+0052,t8 and t9 dwarfs with high proper motion (~1.3 and ~1.8 arcsec/yr). bothobjects show a mid-infrared/near-infrared excess of ~1-1.5 magnitudes, and arek-band suppressed. distance estimates lead to space motion constraints thatsuggest halo (or at least thick disk) kinematics. we then assess the reducedproper motion diagram of wise ultracool dwarfs, which suggests that late t andy dwarfs may have a higher thick-disk/halo population fraction than earlierobjects.

1309.6525	parallaxes of southern extremely cool objects (parsec) ii: spectroscopic  follow-up and parallaxes of 52 targets	we present near-infrared spectroscopy for 52 ultracool dwarfs, including twonewly discovered late-m dwarfs, one new late-m subdwarf candidate, three new land four new t dwarfs. we also present parallaxes and proper motions for 21 ofthem. four of the targets presented here have previous parallax measurements,while all the others are new values. this allow us to populate further thespectral sequence at early types (l0-l4). combining the astrometric parameterswith the new near-infrared spectroscopy presented here, we are able toinvestigate further the nature of some of the objects. in particular, we findthat the peculiar blue l1 dwarf sdss j133148.92-011651.4 is a metal-poorobject, likely a member of the galactic thick disk. we discover a new msubdwarf candidate, 2mass j20115649-6201127. we confirm the low-gravity natureof eros-mp j0032-4405, denis-p j035726.9-441730, and 2mass j22134491-2136079.we present two new metal-poor dwarfs: the l4pec 2mass j19285196-4356256 and them7pec sips2346-5928. we also determine the effective temperature and bolometricluminosity of the 21 targets with astrometric measurements, and we obtain a newpolynomial relation between effective temperature and near-infrared spectraltype. the new fit suggests a flattening of the sequence at the transitionbetween m and l spectral types. this could be an effect of dust formation, thatcauses a more rapid evolution of the spectral features as a function of theeffective temperature.

1311.1227	a 1500 deg$^2$ near infrared proper motion catalogue from the ukidss  large area survey	the ukidss large area survey (las) began in 2005, with the start of theukidss program as a 7 year effort to survey roughly 4000 deg$^2$ at highgalactic latitudes in y, j, h and k bands. the survey also included asignificant quantity of 2-epoch j band observations, with an epoch baselinegreater than 2 years to calculate proper motions. we present a near infraredproper motion catalogue for the 1500 deg$^2$ of the 2 epoch las data, whichincludes 135,625 stellar sources and a further 88,324 with ambiguousmorphological classifications, all with motions detected above the 5$\sigma$level. we developed a custom proper motion pipeline which we describe here. ourcatalogue agrees well with the proper motion data supplied for a 300 deg$^2$subset in the current wfcam science archive (wsa) tenth data release (dr10)catalogue, and in various optical catalogues, but it benefits from a largermatching radius and hence a larger upper proper motion detection limit. weprovide absolute proper motions, using las galaxies for the relative toabsolute correction. by using local 2nd order polynomial transformations, asopposed to linear transformations in the wsa, we correct better for any localdistortions in the focal plane, not including the radial distortion that isremoved by the ukidss pipeline. we present the results of proper motionsearches for new brown dwarfs and white dwarfs. we discuss 41 sources in thewsa dr10 overlap with our catalogue with proper motions $&gt;$300 $mas yr^{-1}$,several of which are new detections. we present 15 new candidate ultra-cooldwarf binary systems.

1401.0420	the extremely red l dwarf ulas j222711$-$004547 - dominated by dust	we report the discovery of a peculiar l dwarf from the ukidss las, ulasj222711-004547. the very red infrared photometry (mko j-k = 2.79$\pm$0.06, wisew1-w2 = 0.65$\pm$0.05) of ulas j222711-004547 makes it one of the reddest browndwarfs discovered so far. we obtained a moderate resolution spectrum of thistarget, and classify it as l7pec, confirming its very red nature. comparison totheoretical models suggests that the object could be a low-gravity l dwarf witha solar or higher than solar metallicity. nonetheless, the match of such fitsto the spectrum is rather poor and this and other peculiar red l dwarfs posenew challenges for the modeling of ultracool atmospheres. we determined theproper motion of ulas j222711-004547 using the data available in theliterature, and we find that its kinematics do not suggest membership of any ofthe known young associations. we show that applying a simple de-reddening curveto its spectrum allows it to resemble the spectra of the l7 spectroscopicstandards. given the negligible interstellar reddening of the field containingour target, we conclude that the reddening of the spectrum is mostly due to anexcess of dust in the photosphere of the target. de-reddening the spectrumusing extinction curves for different dust species gives surprisingly goodresults and suggests a characteristic grain size of $\sim$0.5 $\mu$m. we showthat by increasing the optical depth, the same extinction curves allow thespectrum of ulas j222711-004547 to resemble the spectra of unusually blue ldwarfs and slightly metal-poor l dwarfs. grains of similar size yield very goodfits when de-reddening other unusually red l dwarfs in the l5 to l7.5 range.these results suggest that the diversity in near infrared colours and spectraseen in late-l dwarfs could be due to differences in the optical thickness ofthe dust cloud deck.

0802.1863	near-infrared imaging polarimetry of young stellar objects in  rho-ophiuchi	the results of a near-infrared (j h k lp) imaging linear polarimetry surveyof 20 young stellar objects (ysos) in rho ophiuchi are presented. the majorityof the sources are unresolved, with k-band polarizations, p_k &lt; 6 per cent.several objects are associated with extended reflection nebulae. these objectshave centrosymmetric vector patterns with polarization discs over their cores;maximum polarizations of p_k &gt; 20 per cent are seen over their envelopes.correlations are observed between the degree of core polarization and theevolutionary status inferred from the spectral energy distribution. k-band corepolarizations &gt;6 per cent are only observed in class i ysos. a 3d monte carlomodel with oblate grains aligned with a magnetic field is used to investigatethe flux distributions and polarization structures of three of the rho oph ysoswith extended nebulae. a rho proportional to r^(-1.5) power law for the densityis applied throughout the envelopes. the large-scale centrosymmetricpolarization structures are due to scattering. however, the polarizationstructure in the bright core of the nebula appears to require dichroicextinction by aligned non-spherical dust grains. the position angle indicates atoroidal magnetic field in the inner part of the envelope. since the measuredpolarizations attributed to dichroic extinction are usually &lt;10 per cent, thegrains must either be nearly spherical or very weakly aligned. the higherpolarizations observed in the outer parts of the reflection nebulae requirethat the dust grains responsible for scattering have maximum grain sizes &lt;=1.05microns.

1401.2336	extreme infrared variables from ukidss - i. a concentration in star  forming regions	we present initial results of the first panoramic search for high-amplitudenear-infrared variability in the galactic plane. we analyse the widelyseparated two-epoch k-band photometry in the 5th and 7th data releases of theukidss galactic plane survey. we find 45 stars with \delta k &gt; 1 mag, including2 previously known oh/ir stars and a nova. even though the mid-plane is not yetincluded in the dataset, we find the majority (66%) of our sample to be withinknown star forming regions (sfrs), with two large concentrations in the serpensob2 association (11 stars) and the cygnus-x complex (12 stars). sources in sfrsshow spectral energy distributions (seds) that support classification as youngstellar objects (ysos). this indicates that ysos dominate the galacticpopulation of high amplitude infrared variable stars at low luminosities andtherefore likely dominate the total high amplitude population. spectroscopicfollow up of the dr5 sample shows at least four stars with clearcharacteristics of eruptive pre-main-sequence variables, two of which aredeeply embedded. our results support the recent concept of eruptive variabilitycomprising a continuum of outburst events with different timescales andluminosities, but triggered by a similar physical mechanism involving unsteadyaccretion. also, we find what appears to be one of the most variable classicalbe stars.

1503.04715	methane and ammonia in the near-infrared spectra of late t dwarfs	analysis of t dwarfs using model atmospheres has been hampered by the absenceof reliable line lists for methane and ammonia. newly computed high temperatureline lists for both of these important molecules are now available, so it istimely to investigate the appearance of the various absorption features in tdwarfs in order to better understand their atmospheres and validate the newline lists. we present high quality r~5000 gemini/nifs 1.0-2.4 microns spectraof the t8 standard 2mass 0415-0935 and the t9 standard ugps 0722-0540. we usethese spectra to identify numerous methane and ammonia features not previouslyseen and we discuss the implications for our understanding of t dwarfatmospheres. among our results, we find that ammonia is the dominant opacitysource between ~1.233-1.266 microns in ugps 0722-0540, and we tentativelyidentify several absorption features in this wavelength range in the t9'sspectrum which may be due entirely to ammonia opacity. our results also suggestthat water rather than methane is the dominant opacity source in the red halfof the j-band of the t8 dwarf. water appears to be the main absorber in thiswavelength region in the t9 dwarf until ~1.31 microns, when methane starts todominate.

1503.05082	a large spectroscopic sample of l and t dwarfs from ukidss las: peculiar  objects, binaries, and space density	we present the spectroscopic analysis of a large sample of late-m, l, and tdwarfs from ukidss. using the yjhk photometry from ulas and the red-opticalphotometry from sdss we selected a sample of 262 brown dwarf candidates and wefollowed-up 196 of them using x-shooter on the vlt. the large wavelengthcoverage (0.30-2.48 $\mu$m) and moderate resolution (r~5000-9000) of x-shooterallowed us to identify peculiar objects including 22 blue l dwarfs, 2 blue tdwarfs, and 2 low gravity m dwarfs. using a spectral indices-based technique weidentified 27 unresolved binary candidates, for which we determined thespectral type of the potential components via spectral deconvolution. thespectra allowed us to measure the equivalent width of the prominent absorptionfeatures and to compare them to atmospheric models. cross-correlating thespectra with a radial velocity standard, we measured the radial velocity forour targets, and we determined the distribution of the sample, which is centredat -1.7$\pm$1.2 km s$^{-1}$ with a dispersion of 31.5 km s$^{-1}$. using ourresults we estimated the space density of field brown dwarfs and compared itwith the results of numerical simulations. depending on the binary fraction, wefound that there are (0.85$\pm$0.55) x 10$^{-3}$ to (1.00$\pm$0.64) x 10$^{-3}$objects per cubic parsec in the l4-l6.5 range, (0.73$\pm$0.47) x 10$^{-3}$ to(0.85$\pm$0.55) x 10$^{-3}$ objects per cubic parsec in the l7-t0.5 range, and(0.74$\pm$0.48) x 10$^{-3}$ to (0.88$\pm$0.56) x 10$^{-3}$ objects per cubicparsec in the t1-t4.5 range. there seem to be an excess of objects in the l/ttransition with respect to the late t dwarfs, a discrepancy that could beexplained assuming a higher binary fraction than expected for the l/ttransition, or that objects in the high-mass end and low-mass end of thisregime form in different environments, i.e. following different imfs.

0806.0067	exploring the substellar temperature regime down to ~550k	we report the discovery of three very late t dwarfs in the ukirt infrareddeep sky survey (ukidss) third data release: ulas j101721.40+011817.9(ulas1017), ulas j123828.51+095351.3 (ulas1238) and ulas j133553.45+113005.2(ulas1335).we detail optical and near-infrared photometry for all threesources, and mid-infrared photometry for ulas1335. we use near-infrared spectraof each source to assign spectral types t8p (ulas1017), t8.5 (ulas1228) and t9(ulas1335) to these objects. we estimate that ulas1017 has 750 &lt; teff &lt; 850k,and 5.0 &lt; log g &lt; 5.5, assuming solar metallicity, an age of 1.6-15 gyr, a massof 33-70 mj and lies at a distance of 31-54 pc. we extend the unified scheme ofburgasser et al.

(2006). seven of the new t dwarfs havespectral types of t2.5-t4.5, five have spectral types of t5-t5.5, one is at6.5p, and two are t7-7.5. we assess spectral morphology and colours toidentify t dwarfs in our sample that may have non-typical physical properties(by comparison to solar neighbourhood populations). the colours of the fullsample of las t dwarfs show a possible trend to bluer y-j with decreasingeffective temperature beyond t8. by accounting for the main sources ofincompleteness (selection, follow-up and spatial) as well as the effects ofunresolved binarity and malmquist bias, we estimate that there are 17+-4 &gt;=t4dwarfs in the j&lt;=19 volume of the las second data release. comparing this totheoretical predictions is most consistent with a sub-stellar mass functionexponent alpha between -1.0 and 0. this is consistent with the latest2mass/sdss constraint (which is based on lower number statistics), and issignificantly lower than the alpha~1.0 suggested by l dwarf field populations,possibly a result of the lower mass range probed by the t dwarf class.

astro-ph;0003061	a population of very young brown dwarfs and free-floating planets in  orion	we describe the results of a very deep imaging survey of the trapeziumcluster in the ijh bands, using the ukirt high resolution camera ufti.approximately 32% of the 515 point sources detected are brown dwarf candidates,including several free floating objects with masses below the deuterium burning(planetary) threshold at 0.013 solar masses, which are detectable because oftheir extreme youth. we have confidence that almost all the sources detectedare cluster members, since foreground contamination is minimal in the 33arcmin^2 area surveyed and the dense backdrop of omc-1 obscures all backgroundstars at these wavelengths. extinction is calculated from the (j-h)colours,permitting accurate luminosity estimates and temperatures are derived from thedereddened (i-j) colours. there is some evidence for a cut-off in theluminosity function below the level corresponding to several jupiter masses,which may represent the bottom end of the imf. since star formation is completein the trapezium this limit could have wide significance, if confirmed.however, it could well be an effect of the dispersal of the molecular cloud bythe central o-type stars, a process whose timescale will vary between starformation regions.

astro-ph;0010410	a high resolution radio survey of class i protostars	we report the results of a survey of low mass class i protostars in the cmcontinuum. in the initial survey, seven sources in the taurus star formationwere observed with the vla at 0``.25 resolution. all seven sources drive cooutflows and display herbig-haro flows in the optical or near infraredwavebands. 4/7 sources were detected, two of which are new discoveries insystems of very low luminosity, one being the lowest luminosity system detectedto date in the cm continuum. notably, three sources were not detected to a3-sigma limit of 0.10 mjy/beam, which indicates that significant cm continuumemission is not a universal feature of class i systems with outflow activity.subsequent observations of hh30, a more evolved class ii system, found noemission to a 3-sigma limit of 0.03 mjy/beam. after comparison with nearinfrared data, we suggest that the discriminating feature of the detectedsystems is a relatively high ionisation fraction in the stellar wind. temporalvariability of the outflow may also play a role. the one relatively brightsource, iras 04016+2610 (l1489 irs), is clearly resolved on a 0``.4 scale at 2cm and 3.5 cm. follow-up imaging with merlin did not detect this source with a0``.04 beam, indicating that the radio emission is generated in a region with aradius of about 25 au, which is broadly similar to the radius of the bipolarcavities inferred from models of near infrared data. interpretation of thissystem is complicated by the existence of a quadrupolar outflow, which weoriginally detected through polarimetric imaging. we present a near infrared h2image in which a bow shock in the secondary outflow is clearly seen. thiscomplicated structure may have been caused by a gravitational interactionbetween two protostars.

astro-ph;0105154	infrared spectroscopy of substellar objects in orion	we present broad band spectra of a sample of 21 low luminosity sources in thetrapezium cluster, with masses in the range 0.008 - 0.10 msun (assuming an ageof 1 myr). these were selected for low extinction in most cases and are locatedwest of the brighter nebulosity. the spectra are in the h bandpass (1.4-1.95um) and k bandpass (1.9-2.5 um) also for most of the brighter sources, with aresolution of 50 nm. they were taken with ukirt using the cgs4 spectrometer.absorption by water vapour bands is detected in all the substellar candidatesexcept one, which is a highly reddened object with strong h2 emission and ananomalously blue (i-j) colour, implying that it is a very young cluster memberwith circumstellar matter. the observation of prominent water vapour bandsconfirms the low effective temperatures implied by our (i-j) colourmeasurements in an earlier paper and would imply late m or l spectral types ifthese were older field dwarfs. however, the profiles of the h bandpass spectraare very different from those of field dwarfs with similar water absorptionstrength, demonstrating that they are not foreground or background objects. inaddition, the co absorption bands at 2.3 um and the nai absorption feature at2.21 um are very weak for such cool sources. all these features are quite wellreproduced by the ames-dusty-1999 model atmospheres of allard etal.(2000,2001), and arise from the low gravities predicted for the trapeziumsources. this represents a new proof of the substellar status of our sources,independent of the statistical arguments for low contamination, which arereexamined here. the very late spectral types of the planetary mass objects andvery low mass brown dwarfs demonstrate that they are cluster members, sincethey are too luminous to be field dwarfs in the background.

astro-ph;0405387	high resolution imaging polarimetry of hl tau and magnetic field  structure	we present high quality near infrared imaging polarimetry of hl tau at 0.4 to0.6 arcsec resolution, obtained with subaru/ciao and ukirt/ircam. 3-d montecarlo modelling with aligned oblate grains is used to probe the structure ofthe circumstellar envelope and the magnetic field, as well as the dustproperties. at j band the source shows a centrosymmetric pattern dominated byscattered light. in the h and k bands the central source becomes visible andits polarisation appears to be dominated by dichroic extinction, with aposition angle inclined by ~40 degrees to the disc axis. the polarisationpattern of the environs on scales up to 200 au is consistent with the samedichroic extinction signature superimposed on the centrosymmetric scatteringpattern. these data can be modelled with a magnetic field which is twisted onscales from tens to hundreds of au, or alternatively by a field which isglobally misaligned with the disc axis. a unique solution to the fieldstructure will require spatially resolved circular polarisation data. the bestfit monte carlo model indicates a shallow near infrared extinction law. whencombined with the observed high polarisation and non-negligible albedo theseconstraints can be fitted with a grain model involving dirty water ice mantlesin which the largest particles have radii slightly in excess of 1 um. the bestfit model has an envelope structure which is slightly flattened on scales up toseveral hundred au. both lobes of the bipolar outflow cavity contain asubstantial optical depth of dust (not just within the cavity walls). curved,approximately parabolic, cavity walls fit the data better than a conicalcavity. the small inner accretion disc observed at millimetre wavelengths isnot seen at this spatial resolution.

astro-ph;0504570	a deep survey of brown dwarfs in orion with gemini	we report the results of a deep near infrared (jhk) survey of the outer partsof the trapezium cluster with gemini south/flamingos. 396 sources were detectedin a 26 arcmin^2 area, including 138 brown dwarf candidates, defined as m&lt;0.075msun for an assumed age of 1 myr. only 33 of the brown dwarf candidates areplanetary mass candidates (pmcs) with estimated masses in the range0.003&lt;m&lt;0.012msun. in an extinction limited sample (a(v)&lt;5) complete toapproximately 0.005 msun (5 mjup) the mass function appears to drop by a factorof 2 at the deuterium burning threshold, i.e. at planetary masses. afterallowing for background contamination it is likely that planetary mass objectsat 3-13 mjup number &lt;10% of the cluster population, with an upper limit of 13%.analysis of the spatial distribution of stars and brown dwarf candidatessuggests that brown dwarfs and very low mass stars (m&lt;0.1 msun) are less likelythan more massive stars to have wide (&gt;150 au) binary companions. this resulthas modest statistical significance (96%) in our data but is supported at 93%confidence by analysis of an completely independent sample taken from thesubaru data of kaifu et al.(2000). there is a statistically very significantexcess of both stars and brown dwarfs with small separations from each other(&lt;6 arcsec or 2600 au). this appears to be due to the presence of small nsubgroups, which are likely to be dynamically unstable in the long term. hencethese results are consistent with the 'ejected stellar embryo' hypothesis forbrown dwarf formation (reipurth &amp; clarke 2001). we also report the discovery oftwo new bipolar nebulae, which are interpreted as class i protostars.

astro-ph;0603320	finding benchmark brown dwarfs to probe the imf as a function of time	using a simulated disk brown dwarf (bd) population, we find that new largearea infrared surveys are expected to identify enough bds covering wide enoughmass--age ranges to potentially measure the mass function down to ~0.03mo, andthe bd formation history out to 10 gyr, at a level capable of establishing ifbd formation follows star formation. we suggest these capabilities are bestrealised by spectroscopic calibration of bd properties (teff, g and [m/h])which, when combined with a measured luminosity and an evolutionary model cangive bd mass and age relatively independent of bd atmosphere models. suchcalibration requires an empirical understanding of how bd spectra are affectedby variations in these properties, and thus the identification and study of"benchmark bds" whose age and composition can be established independently. weidentify the best sources of benchmark bds as young open cluster members,moving group members, and wide (&gt;1000au) bd companions to both subgiant starsand high mass white dwarfs (wds). we have used 2mass to measure a wide l dwarfcompanion fraction of 2.7(+0.7/-0.5)%, which equates to a bd companion fractionof 34(+9/-6)% for an alpha~1 companion mass function. using this value wesimulate populations of wide bd binaries, and estimate that 80(+21/-14)subgiant--bd binaries, and 50(+13/-10) benchmark wd--bd binaries could beidentified using current and new facilities. the wd--bd binaries should all beidentifiable using the large area survey component of ukidss combined withsloan. discovery of the subgiant--bd binaries will require a nir imagingcampaign around a large (~900) sample of hipparcos subgiants. if identified,spectral studies of these benchmark brown dwarfs could reveal the spectralsensitivities across the teff, g and [m/h] space probed by new surveys.

astro-ph;0603608	the ukirt infrared deep sky survey early data release	this paper defines the ukirt infrared deep sky survey (ukidss) early datarelease (edr). ukidss is a set of five large near-infra-red surveys defined bylawrence et al. (2006), being undertaken with the uk infra-red telescope(ukirt) wide field camera (wfcam). the programme began in may 2005 and has anexpected duration of seven years. each survey uses some or all of the broadbandfilter complement zyjhk. the edr is the first public release of data to theeuropean southern observatory (eso) community. all worldwide releases occurafter a delay of 18 months from the eso release. the edr provides a smallsample dataset, ~50 sq.deg (about 1% of the whole of ukidss), that is a lowerlimit to the expected quality of future survey data releases. in addition, anedr+ dataset contains all edr data plus extra data of similar quality, but forareas not observed in all of the required filters (amounting to ~220 sq.deg).the first large data release, dr1, will occur in mid-2006. we provide detailsof the observational implementation, the data reduction, the astrometric andphotometric calibration, and the quality control procedures. we summarise thedata coverage and quality (seeing, ellipticity, photometricity, depth) for eachsurvey and give a brief guide to accessing the images and catalogues from thewfcam science archive.

astro-ph;0610191	the ukirt infrared deep sky survey first data release	the first data release (dr1) of the ukirt infrared deep sky survey (ukidss)took place on 2006 july 21. ukidss is a set of five large near-infraredsurveys, covering a complementary range of areas, depths, and galacticlatitudes. dr1 is the first large release of survey-quality data from ukidssand includes 320 sq degs of multicolour data to (vega) k=18, complete(depending on the survey) in three to five bands from the set zyjhk, togetherwith 4 sq degs of deep jk data to an average depth k=21. in addition therelease includes a similar quantity of data with incomplete filter coverage. injhk, in regions of low extinction, the photometric uniformity of thecalibration is better than 0.02 mag. in each band. the accuracy of thecalibration in zy remains to be quantified, and the same is true of jhk inregions of high extinction. the median image fwhm across the dataset is 0.82arcsec. we describe changes since the early data release in the implementation,pipeline and calibration, quality control, and archive procedures. we providemaps of the areas surveyed, and summarise the contents of each of the fivesurveys in terms of filters, areas, and depths. dr1 marks completion of 7 percent of the ukidss 7-year goals.

astro-ph;0702534	two t dwarfs from the ukidss early data release	we report on the first ultracool dwarf discoveries from the ukirt infrareddeep sky survey (ukidss) large area survey early data release (las edr), inparticular the discovery of t dwarfs which are fainter and more distant thanthose found using the 2mass and sdss surveys. we aim to show that ourmethodologies for searching the ~27 sq degs of the las edr are successful forfinding both l and t dwarfs $via$ cross-correlation with the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) dr4 release. while the area searched so far is small, the numbersof objects found shows great promise for near-future releases of the las andgreat potential for finding large numbers of such dwarfs. ultracool dwarfs areselected by combinations of their yjh(k) ukidss colours and sdss dr4 z-j andi-z colours, or, lower limits on these red optical/infrared colours in the caseof dr4 dropouts. after passing visual inspection tests, candidates have beenfollowed up by methane imaging and spectroscopy at 4m and 8m-class facilities.our main result is the discovery following ch4 imaging and spectroscopy of at4.5 dwarf, ulasj 1452+0655, lying ~80pc distant. a further t dwarf candidate,ulasj 1301+0023, has very similar ch4 colours but has not yet been confirmedspectroscopically. we also report on the identification of a brighter l0 dwarf,and on the selection of a list of las objects designed to probe for t-likedwarfs to the survey j-band limit. our findings indicate that the combinationof the ukidss las and sdss surveys provide an excellent tool for identifying land t dwarfs down to much fainter limits than previously possible. ourdiscovery of one confirmed and one probable t dwarf in the edr is consistentwith expectations from the previously measured t dwarf density on the sky.

0810.3584	infrared spectroscopy and analysis of brown dwarf and planetary mass  objects in the orion nebula cluster	we present near-infrared long slit and multi-slit spectra of low mass browndwarf candidates in the orion nebula cluster. the long slit data were observedin the h- &amp; k-bands using niri on the gemini north telescope. the multi-objectspectroscopic observations were made using iris2 on the anglo australiantelescope at h-band. we develop a spectral typing scheme based on opticallycalibrated, near infrared spectra of young sources in the taurus and ic 348star forming regions with spectral types m3.0 to m9.5. we apply our spectraltyping scheme to 52 sources, including previously published ukirt and gnirsspectra. 40 objects show strong water absorption with spectral types of m3 to&gt;m9.5. the latest type objects are provisionally classified as early l types.we plot our sources on h-r diagrams overlaid with theoretical pre-main-sequenceisochrones. the majority of our objects lie close to or above the 1 myrisochrone, leading to an average cluster age that is &lt;1 myr. we find 38 sourceslie at or below the hydrogen burning limit (0.075 msun). 10 sources potentiallyhave masses below the deuterium burning limit (0.012 msun). we use a montecarlo approach to model the observed luminosity function with a variety ofcluster age and mass distributions. the lowest chi^2 values are produced by anage distribution centred at 1 myr, with a mass function that declines atsub-stellar masses according to an m^alpha power law in the range alpha=0.3 to0.6. we find that truncating the mass function at 0.012 msun producesluminosity functions that are starved of the faintest magnitudes, even whenusing bimodal age populations that contain 10 myr old sources. the results ofthese monte carlo simulations therefore support the existence of a planetarymass population in the onc.
