0903.1369	atlasgal - the apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy at 870  microns	(abridged) studying continuum emission from interstellar dust is essential tolocating and characterizing the highest density regions in the interstellarmedium. in particular, the early stages of massive star formation remain poorlyunderstood. our goal is to produce a large-scale, systematic database ofmassive pre- and proto-stellar clumps in the galaxy, to understand how andunder what conditions star formation takes place. a well characterized sampleof star-forming sites will deliver an evolutionary sequence and a mass functionof high-mass, star-forming clumps. this systematic survey at submm wavelengthsalso represents a preparatory work for herschel and alma. the apex telescope isideally located to observe the inner milky way. the large apex bolometer camera(laboca) is a 295-element bolometer array observing at 870 microns, with a beamsize of 19". taking advantage of its large field of view (11.4') and excellentsensitivity, we started an unbiased survey of the galactic plane, with a noiselevel of 50-70 mjy/beam: the apex telescope large area survey of the galaxy(atlasgal). as a first step, we covered 95 sq. deg. these data reveal 6000compact sources brighter than 0.25 jy, as well as extended structures, many ofthem filamentary. about two thirds of the compact sources have no brightinfrared counterpart, and some of them are likely to correspond to theprecursors of (high-mass) proto-stars or proto-clusters. other compact sourcesharbor hot cores, compact hii regions or young embedded clusters. assuming atypical distance of 5 kpc, most sources are clumps smaller than 1 pc withmasses from a few 10 to a few 100 m_sun. in this introductory paper, we showpreliminary results from these ongoing observations, and discuss theperspectives of the survey.

1001.2106	hi-gal: the herschel infrared galactic plane survey	hi-gal, the herschel infrared galactic plane survey, is an open time keyproject of the herschel space observatory. it will make an unbiased photometricsurvey of the inner galactic plane by mapping a two-degree wide strip in thelongitude range |l|&lt;60 degrees in five wavebands between 70um and 500um. theaim of hi-gal is to detect the earliest phases of the formation of molecularclouds and high-mass stars and to use the optimum combination of herschelwavelength coverage, sensitivity, mapping strategy and speed to deliver ahomogeneous census of star-forming regions and cold structures in theinterstellar medium. the resulting representative samples will yield thevariation of source temperature, luminosity, mass and age in a wide range ofgalactic environments at all scales from massive ysos in protoclusters toentire spiral arms, providing an evolutionary sequence for the formation ofintermediate and high-mass stars. this information is essential to theformulation of a predictive global model of the role of environment andfeedback in regulating the star-formation process. such a model is vital tounderstanding star formation on galactic scales and in the early universe.hi-gal will also provide a science legacy for decades to come with incalculablepotential for systematic and serendipitous science in a wide range ofastronomical fields, enabling the optimum use of future major facilities suchas jwst and alma.

1005.1506	mapping the column density and dust temperature structure of irdcs with  herschel	infrared dark clouds (irdcs) are cold and dense reservoirs of gas potentiallyavailable to form stars. many of these clouds are likely to be pristinestructures representing the initial conditions for star formation. the studypresented here aims to construct and analyze accurate column density and dusttemperature maps of irdcs by using the first herschel data from the hi-galgalactic plane survey. these fundamental quantities, are essential forunderstanding processes such as fragmentation in the early stages of theformation of stars in molecular clouds. we have developed a simplepixel-by-pixel sed fitting method, which accounts for the background emission.by fitting a grey-body function at each position, we recover the spatialvariations in both the dust column density and temperature within the irdcs.this method is applied to a sample of 22 irdcs exhibiting a range of angularsizes and peak column densities. our analysis shows that the dust temperaturedecreases significantly within irdcs, from background temperatures of 20-30 kto minimum temperatures of 8-15 k within the clouds, showing that densemolecular clouds are not isothermal. temperature gradients have most likely animportant impact on the fragmentation of irdcs. local temperature minima arestrongly correlated with column density peaks, which in a few cases reach nh2 =1 x 10^{23} cm^{-2}, identifying these clouds as candidate massive prestellarcores. applying this technique to the full hi-gal data set will provideimportant constraints on the fragmentation and thermal properties of irdcs, andhelp identify hundreds of massive prestellar core candidates.

1005.1565	the physical properties of the dust in the rcw 120 hii region as seen by  herschel	context. rcw 120 is a well-studied, nearby galactic hii region with ongoingstar formation in its surroundings. previous work has shown that it displays abubble morphology at mid-infrared wavelengths and has a massive layer ofcollected neutral material seen at sub-mm wavelengths. given the well-definedphoto-dissociation region (pdr) boundary and collected layer, it is anexcellent laboratory to study the "collect and collapse" process of triggeredstar formation. using herschel space observatory data at 100, 160, 250, 350,and 500 micron, in combination with spitzer and apex-laboca data, we can forthe first time map the entire spectral energy distribution of an hii region athigh angular resolution. aims. we seek a better understanding of rcw120 and itslocal environment by analysing its dust temperature distribution. additionally,we wish to understand how the dust emissivity index, beta, is related to thedust temperature. methods. we determine dust temperatures in selected regionsof the rcw 120 field by fitting their spectral energy distribution (sed),derived using aperture photometry. additionally, we fit the sed extracted froma grid of positions to create a temperature map. results. we find a gradient indust temperature, ranging from &gt;30 k in the interior of rcw 120, to ~20k forthe material collected in the pdr, to ~10k toward local infrared dark cloudsand cold filaments. our results suggest that rcw 120 is in the process ofdestroying the pdr delineating its bubble morphology. the leaked radiation fromits interior may influence the creation of the next generation of stars. wefind support for an anti-correlation between the fitted temperature and beta,in rough agreement with what has been found previously. the extended wavelengthcoverage of the herschel data greatly increases the reliability of this result.

1005.2618	from filamentary clouds to prestellar cores to the stellar imf: initial  highlights from the herschel gould belt survey	we summarize the first results from the gould belt survey, obtained towardthe aquila rift and polaris flare regions during the 'science demonstrationphase' of herschel. our 70-500 micron images taken in parallel mode with thespire and pacs cameras reveal a wealth of filamentary structure, as well asnumerous dense cores embedded in the filaments. between ~ 350 and 500prestellar cores and ~ 45-60 class 0 protostars can be identified in the aquilafield, while ~ unbound starless cores and no protostars are observed in thepolaris field. the prestellar core mass function (cmf) derived for the aquilaregion bears a strong resemblance to the stellar initial mass function (imf),already confirming the close connection between the cmf and the imf with muchbetter statistics than earlier studies. comparing and contrasting our herschelresults in aquila and polaris, we propose an observationally-driven scenariofor core formation according to which complex networks of long, thin filamentsform first within molecular clouds, and then the densest filaments fragmentinto a number of prestellar cores via gravitational instability.

1005.2746	herschel-spire observations of the polaris flare : structure of the  diffuse interstellar medium at the sub-parsec scale	we present a power spectrum analysis of the herschel-spire observations ofthe polaris flare, a high galactic latitude cirrus cloud midway between thediffuse and molecular phases. the spire images of the polaris flare reveal forthe first time the structure of the diffuse interstellar medium down to 0.01parsec over a 10 square degrees region. these exceptional observationshighlight the highly filamentary and clumpy structure of the interstellarmedium even in diffuse regions of the map. the power spectrum analysis showsthat the structure of the interstellar medium is well described by a singlepower law with an exponent of -2.7 +- 0.1 at all scales from 30" to 8 degrees.that the power spectrum slope of the dust emission is constant down to thespire angular resolution is an indication that the inertial range of turbulenceextends down to the 0.01 pc scale. the power spectrum analysis also allows theidentification of a poissonian component at sub-arcminute scales in agreementwith predictions of the cosmic infrared background level at spire wavelengths.finally, the comparison of the spire and iras 100 micron data of the polarisflare clearly assesses the capability of spire in maping diffuse emission overlarge areas.

1005.3076	direct estimate of cirrus noise in herschel hi-gal images	in herschel images of the galactic plane and many star forming regions, amajor factor limiting our ability to extract faint compact sources is cirrusconfusion noise, operationally defined as the "statistical error to be expectedin photometric measurements due to confusion in a background of fluctuatingsurface brightness". the histogram of the flux densities of extracted sourcesshows a distinctive faint-end cutoff below which the catalog suffers fromincompleteness and the flux densities become unreliable. this empirical cutoffshould be closely related to the estimated cirrus noise and we show that thisis the case. we compute the cirrus noise directly, both on herschel images fromwhich the bright sources have been removed and on simulated images of cirruswith statistically similar fluctuations. we connect these direct estimates withthose from power spectrum analysis, which has been used extensively to predictthe cirrus noise and provides insight into how it depends on variousstatistical properties and photometric operational parameters. we reportmulti-wavelength power spectra of diffuse galactic dust emission from hi-galobservations at 70 to 500 microns within galactic plane fields at l= 30 degreesand l= 59 degrees. we find that the exponent of the power spectrum is about -3.at 250 microns, the amplitude of the power spectrum increases roughly as thesquare of the median brightness of the map and so the expected cirrus noisescales linearly with the median brightness. generally, the confusion noise willbe a worse problem at longer wavelengths, because of the combination of lowerangular resolution and the rising power spectrum of cirrus toward lower spatialfrequencies, but the photometric signal to noise will also depend on therelative spectral energy distribution of the source compared to the cirrus.

1005.3924	the herschel view of star formation in the rosette molecular cloud under  the influence of ngc 2244	the rosette molecular cloud is promoted as the archetype of a triggeredstar-formation site. this is mainly due to its morphology, because the centralob cluster ngc 2244 has blown a circular-shaped cavity into the cloud and theexpanding hii-region now interacts with the cloud. studying the spatialdistribution of the different evolutionary states of all star-forming sites inrosette and investigating possible gradients of the dust temperature will helpto test the 'triggered star-formation' scenario in rosette. we use continuumdata obtained with the pacs (70 and 160 micron) and spire instruments (250,350, 500 micron) of the herschel telescope during the science demonstrationphase of hobys. three-color images of rosette impressively show how themolecular gas is heated by the radiative impact of the ngc 2244 cluster. aclear negative temperature gradient and a positive density gradient (runningfrom the hii-region/molecular cloud interface into the cloud) are detected.studying the spatial distribution of the most massive dense cores (size scale0.05 to 0.3 pc), we find an age-sequence (from more evolved to younger) withincreasing distance to the cluster ngc 2244. no clear gradient is found for theclump (size-scale up to 1 pc) distribution. the existence of temperature anddensity gradients and the observed age-sequence imply that star formation inrosette may indeed be influenced by the radiative impact of the central ngc2244 cluster. a more complete overview of the prestellar and protostellarpopulation in rosette is required to obtain a firmer result.

1010.2774	dust in the diffuse emission of the galactic plane - the  herschel/spitzer sed fitting	the first herschel hi-gal images of the galactic plane unveil thefar-infrared diffuse emission of the interstellar medium with an unprecedentedangular resolution and sensitivity. in this paper, we present the firstanalysis of these data in combination with that of spitzer glimpse &amp; mipsgal.we selected a relatively diffuse and low excitation region of thel~59\,^{\circ} hi-gal science demonstration phase field to perform a pixel bypixel fitting of the 8 to 500 microns sed using the dustem dust emission model.we derived maps of the very small grains (vsg) and pah abundances from themodel. our analysis allows us to illustrate that the aromatic infrared bands(aib) intensity does not trace necessarily the pah abundance but rather theproduct of "abundance x column density x intensity of the exciting radiationfield". we show that the spatial structure of pacs70microns map resembles theshorter wavelengths (e.g. irac8microns) maps, because they trace both theintensity of exciting radiation field and column density. we also show that themodeled vsg contribution to pacs70microns (pacs160microns) band intensity canbe up to 50% (7%). the interpretation of diffuse emission spectra at thesewavelengths must take stochastically heated particles into account. finally,this preliminary study emphasizes the potential of analyzing the full dust sedsampled by herschel and spitzer data, with a physical dust model (dustem) toreach the properties of the dust at simultaneously large and small scales.

1011.5419	sio outflows in high-mass star forming regions: a potential chemical  clock?	some theoretical models propose that o-b stars form via accretion, in asimilar fashion to low-mass stars. jet-driven molecular outflows play animportant role in this scenario, and their study can help to understand theprocess of high-mass star formation and the different evolutionary phasesinvolved. observations towards low-mass protostars so far favour anevolutionary picture in which jets are always associated with class 0 objectswhile more evolved class i/ii objects show less evidence of powerful jets. thepresent study aims at checking whether an analogous picture can be found in thehigh-mass case. the iram 30-m telescope (spain) has been used to performsingle-pointing sio(2-1) and (3-2) observations towards a sample of 57high-mass molecular clumps in different evolutionary stages. continuum data atdifferent wavelengths, from mid-ir to 1.2 mm, have been gathered to build thespectral energy distributions of all the clumps and estimate their bolometricluminosities. sio emission at high velocities, characteristic of molecularjets, is detected in 88% of our sources, a very high detection rate indicatingthat there is ongoing star formation activity in most of the sources of oursample. the sio(2-1) luminosity drops with l/m, which suggests that jetactivity declines as time evolves. this represents the first clear evidence ofa decrease of sio outflow luminosity with time in a homogeneous sample ofhigh-mass molecular clumps in different evolutionary stages. the sio(3-2) tosio(2-1) integrated intensity ratio shows only minor changes with evolutionarystate.

1101.3154	the initial conditions of high-mass star formation: radiative transfer  models of irdcs seen in the herschel hi-gal survey	the densest infrared dark clouds (irdcs) may represent the earliestobservable stage of high-mass star formation. these clouds are very cold, hencethey emit mainly at far-infrared and sub-mm wavelengths. for the first time,herschel has provided multi-wavelength, spatially resolved observations ofcores within irdcs, which, when combined with radiative transfer modelling, canconstrain their properties, such as mass, density profile and dust temperature.we use a 3d, multi-wavelength monte carlo radiative transfer code to model indetail the emission from six cores in three typical irdcs seen in the hi-galsurvey (g030.50+00.95, g031.03+00.26 and g031.03+00.76), and thereby todetermine the properties of these cores and compare them with their low-massequivalents. we found masses ranging from 90 to 290 solar masses withtemperatures from 8 to 11k at the centre of each core and 18 to 28k at thesurface. the maximum luminosity of an embedded star within each core wascalculated, and we rule out the possibility of significant high mass starformation having yet occurred in three of our cores.

1101.4654	characterizing precursors to stellar clusters with herschel	context: despite their profound effect on the universe, the formation ofmassive stars and stellar clusters remains elusive. in the past decade,compelling evidence has emerged that suggests infrared dark clouds (irdcs) maybe precursors to stellar clusters. however, the usual method for identifyingirdcs is biased by the requirement that they are seen in absorption againstbright mid-ir emission, whereas dust continuum observations allow cold, densepre-stellar-clusters to be identified anywhere. aims: we aim to understand whatphysical properties characterize irdcs, to explore the population of dustcontinuum sources that are not irdcs, and to roughly characterize the starformation activity in dust continuum sources. results: we present temperatureand column density maps in the hi-gal l=30 and l=59 sdp fields, as well as arobust algorithm for cirrus subtraction and source identification using hi-gal.we report on the fraction of hi-gal sources which are mid-ir-dark, -neutral, or-bright in both fields. we find significant trends in column density andtemperature between mid-ir-dark and -bright pixels; mid-ir-dark pixels areabout 10 k colder and have a factor of 2 higher column density on average thanmid-ir-bright pixels. we find that hi-gal dust continuum sources span a rangeof evolutionary states from pre- to star-forming, and that warmer sources areassociated with more star formation tracers. there is a trend of increasingtemperature with tracer type from mid-ir-dark at the coldest, to outflow/masersources in the middle, and finally to 8 and 24 micron bright sources at thewarmest. finally, we identify five candidate irdc-like sources on the far-sideof the galaxy. these are cold (~ 20 k), high column density (n(h2) &gt; 10^22cm^-2) clouds identified with hi-gal which, despite bright surrounding mid-iremission, show little to no absorption at 8 micron.

1103.0201	characterizing interstellar filaments with herschel in ic5146	we provide a first look at the results of the herschel gould belt surveytoward the ic5146 molecular cloud and present a preliminary analysis of thefilamentary structure in this region. the column density map, derived from our70-500 micron herschel data, reveals a complex network of filaments, andconfirms that these filaments are the main birth sites of prestellar cores. weanalyze the column density profiles of 27 filaments and show that theunderlying radial density profiles fall off as r^{-1.5} to r^{-2.5} at largeradii. our main result is that the filaments seem to be characterized by anarrow distribution of widths having a median value of 0.10 +- 0.03 pc, whichis in stark contrast to a much broader distribution of central jeans lengths.this characteristic width of ~0.1 pc corresponds to within a factor of ~2 tothe sonic scale below which interstellar turbulence becomes subsonic in diffusegas, supporting the argument that the filaments may form as a result of thedissipation of large-scale turbulence.

1104.4808	clustering properties of far-infrared sources in hi-gal science  demonstration phase fields	we use a minimum spanning tree algorithm to characterize the spatialdistribution of galactic far-ir sources and derive their clustering properties.we aim to reveal the spatial imprint of different types of star formingprocesses, e.g. isolated spontaneous fragmentation of dense molecular clouds,or events of triggered star formation around hii regions, and highlight globalproperties of star formation in the galaxy. we plan to exploit the entirehi-gal survey of the inner galactic plane to gather significant statistics onthe clustering properties of star forming regions, and to look for possiblecorrelations with source properties such as mass, temperature or evolutionarystage. in this paper we present a pilot study based on the two 2x2 squaredegree fields centered at longitudes l=30 and l=59 obtained during the sciencedemonstration phase (sdp) of the herschel mission. we find that over half ofthe clustered sources are associated with hii regions and infrared dark clouds.our analysis also reveals a smooth chromatic evolution of the spatialdistribution where sources detected at short-wavelengths, likely proto-starssurrounded by warm circumstellar material emitting in the far-infrared, tend tobe clustered in dense and compact groups around hii regions while sourcesdetected at long-wavelengths, presumably cold and dusty density enhancements ofthe ism emitting in the sub-millimeter, are distributed in larger and loosergroups.

1111.1852	detection and characterization of a 500 mic dust emissivity excess in  the galactic plane using herschel/hi-gal observations	past and recent observations have revealed unexpected variations in thefir-mm dust emissivity. in the herschel spectral range, those are oftenreferred to as a 500{\mu}m emission excess. several dust emission models havebeen developed to interpret astrophysical data in the fir-mm domain. however,these are commonly unable to fully reconcile theoretical predictions withobservations. in contrast, the recently revised two level system (tls) modelseems to provide a promising way of interpreting the existing data. the newlyavailable herschel hi-gal data which covers most of the inner milky-way offersa unique opportunity to investigate possible variations in the dust emissionproperties both with wavelength and environment. by combining the iris 100{\mu}m with the hi-gal 160, 250, 350 and 500 {\mu}m data, we model the dustemission spectra in each pixel of the hi-gal maps, using both the tls modeland, for comparison, a single modified black-body fit. the effect oftemperature mixing along the line of sight is investigated. we find a slightdecrease in the dust temperature with distance from the galactic center. wealso report the detection of a significant 500 {\mu}m emissivity excess in theperipheral regions of the plane (35\circ&lt;|l|&lt;70\circ) of about 13-15% of theemissivity, that can reach up to 20% in some hii regions. we present thespatial distribution of the best-fit values for the two main parameters of thetls model, i.e. the charge correlation length, lc, used to characterize thedisordered charge distribution (dcd) part of the model, and the amplitude a ofthe tls processes, with respect to the dcd effect. they highlight the plausibleexistence of an overall gradient with distance to the galactic center. acomparison with previous findings in the solar neighborhood shows that thelocal value of the excess is less than expected from the galactic gradientobserved here.

1112.2728	echo - exoplanet characterisation observatory	a dedicated mission to investigate exoplanetary atmospheres represents amajor milestone in our quest to understand our place in the universe by placingour solar system in context and by addressing the suitability of planets forthe presence of life. echo -the exoplanet characterisation observatory- is amission concept specifically geared for this purpose. echo will providesimultaneous, multi-wavelength spectroscopic observations on a stable platformthat will allow very long exposures. echo will build on observations by hubble,spitzer and groundbased telescopes, which discovered the first molecules andatoms in exoplanetary atmospheres. echo will simultaneously observe a broadenough spectral region -from the visible to the mid-ir- to constrain from onesingle spectrum the temperature structure of the atmosphere and the abundancesof the major molecular species. the spectral range and resolution are tailoredto separate bands belonging to up to 30 molecules to retrieve the compositionand temperature structure of planetary atmospheres. the target list for echoincludes planets ranging from jupiter-sized with equilibrium temperatures tequp to 2000 k, to those of a few earth masses, with teq ~300 k. we havebaselined a dispersive spectrograph design covering continuously the 0.4-16micron spectral range in 6 channels (1 in the vis, 5 in the ir), which allowsthe spectral resolution to be adapted from several tens to several hundreds,depending on the target brightness. the instrument will be mounted behind a 1.5m class telescope, passively cooled to 50 k, with the instrument structure andoptics passively cooled to ~45 k. echo will be placed in a grand halo orbitaround l2. we have also undertaken a first-order cost and development plananalysis and find that echo is easily compatible with the esa m-class missionframework.

1202.0395	cores in infra-red dark clouds (irdcs) seen in the hi-gal survey between  l = 300{\deg} and l = 330{\deg}	we have used data taken as part of the herschel infrared galactic planesurvey (hi-gal) to study 3171 infrared-dark cloud (irdc) candidates that wereidentified in the mid-infrared (8 {\mu}m) by spitzer (we refer to these as'spitzer-dark' regions). they all lie in the range l=300 - 330 \circ and |b| 61 \circ. of these, only 1205 were seen in emission in the far-infrared (250-500{\mu}m) by herschel (we call these 'herschel-bright' clouds). it is predictedthat a dense cloud will not only be seen in absorption in the mid-infrared, butwill also be seen in emission in the far-infrared at the longest herschelwavebands (250-500 {\mu}m). if a region is dark at all wavelengths throughoutthe mid-infrared and far-infrared, then it is most likely to be simply a regionof lower background infrared emission (a 'hole in the sky'). hence, it appearsthat previous surveys, based on spitzer and other mid-infrared data alone, mayhave over-estimated the total irdc population by a factor of 2. this hasimplications for estimates of the star formation rate in irdcs in the galaxy.westudied the 1205 herschel-bright irdcs at 250 {\mu}m, and found that 972 ofthem had at least one clearly defined 250-{\mu}m peak, indicating that theycontained one or more dense cores. of these, 653 (67 per cent) contained an8-{\mu}m point source somewhere within the cloud, 149 (15 per cent) contained a24-{\mu}m point source but no 8-{\mu}m source, and 170 (18 per cent) containedno 24-{\mu}m or 8-{\mu}m point sources. we use these statistics to makeinferences about the lifetimes of the various evolutionary stages of irdcs.

1202.1413	the herschel view of the on-going star formation in the vela-c molecular  cloud	as part of the herschel guaranteed time key program 'hobys', we present thephotometric survey of the star forming region vela-c, one of the nearest sitesof low-to-high-mass star formation in the galactic plane. vela-c has beenobserved with pacs and spire in parallel mode between 70 um and 500 um over anarea of about 3 square degrees. a photometric catalogue has been extracted fromthe detections in each band, using a threshold of 5 sigma over the localbackground. out of this catalogue we have selected a robust sub-sample of 268sources, of which 75% are cloud clumps and 25% are cores. their spectral energydistributions (seds) have been fitted with a modified black body function. weclassify 48 sources as protostellar and 218 as starless. for two furthersources, we do not provide a secure classification, but suggest they are class0 protostars.  from sed fitting we have derived key physical parameters. protostellarsources are in general warmer and more compact than starless sources. boththese evidences can be ascribed to the presence of an internal source(s) ofmoderate heating, which also causes a temperature gradient and hence a morepeaked intensity distribution. moreover, the reduced dimensions of protostellarsources may indicate that they will not fragment further. a virial analysis ofthe starless sources gives an upper limit of 90% for the sourcesgravitationally bound and therefore prestellar. we fit a power law n(logm) propm^-1.1 to the linear portion of the mass distribution of prestellar sources.this is in between that typical of co clumps and those of cores in nearbystar-forming regions. we interpret this as a result of the inhomogeneity of oursample, which is composed of comparable fractions of clumps and cores.

1206.1243	the spine of the swan: a herschel study of the dr21 ridge and filaments  in cygnus x	in order to characterise the cloud structures responsible for the formationof high-mass stars, we present herschel observations of the dr21 environment.maps of the column density and dust temperature unveil the structure of thedr21 ridge and several connected filaments. the ridge has column densitieslarger than 1e23/cm^2 over a region of 2.3 pc^2. it shows substructured columndensity profiles and branching into two major filaments in the north. themasses in the studied filaments range between 130 and 1400 msun whereas themass in the ridge is 15000 msun. the accretion of these filaments onto the dr21ridge, suggested by a previous molecular line study, could provide a continuousmass inflow to the ridge. in contrast to the striations seen in e.g., thetaurus region, these filaments are gravitationally unstable and form cores andprotostars. these cores formed in the filaments potentially fall into theridge. both inflow and collisions of cores could be important to drive theobserved high-mass star formation. the evolutionary gradient of star formationrunning from dr21 in the south to the northern branching is traced bydecreasing dust temperature. this evolution and the ridge structure can beexplained by two main filamentary components of the ridge that merged first inthe south.

1208.0599	the g305 star-forming complex: embedded massive star formation  discovered by herschel hi-gal	we present a herschel far-infrared study towards the rich massive star-forming complex g305, utilising pacs 70, 160 {\mu}m and spire 250, 350, and 500{\mu}m observations from the hi-gal survey of the galactic plane. the focus ofthis study is to identify the embedded massive star-forming population withing305, by combining far-infrared data with radio continuum, h2o maser, methanolmaser, mips, and red msx source survey data available from previous studies. byapplying a frequentist technique we are able to identify a sample of the mostlikely associations within our multi-wavelength dataset, that can then beidentified from the derived properties obtained from fitted spectral energydistributions (seds). by sed modelling using both a simple modified blackbodyand fitting to a comprehensive grid of model seds, some 16 candidateassociations are identified as embedded massive star-forming regions. we derivea two-selection colour criterion from this sample of log(f70/f500)\geq 1 andlog(f160/f350)\geq 1.6 to identify an additional 31 embedded massive starcandidates with no associated star-formation tracers. using this result we canbuild a picture of the present day star-formation of the complex, and byextrapolating an initial mass function, suggest a current population of \approx2 \times 10^4 young stellar objects (ysos) present, corresponding to a starformation rate (sfr) of 0.01-0.02 m\odot yr^-1. comparing this resolved starformation rate, to extragalactic star formation rate tracers (based on thekennicutt-schmidt relation), we find the star formation activity isunderestimated by a factor of \geq 2 in comparison to the sfr derived from theyso population.

1208.4256	variations in the galactic star formation rate and density thresholds  for star formation	the conversion of gas into stars is a fundamental process in astrophysics andcosmology. stars are known to form from the gravitational collapse of denseclumps in interstellar molecular clouds, and it has been proposed that theresulting star formation rate is proportional to either the amount of massabove a threshold gas surface density, or the gas volume density. thesestar-formation prescriptions appear to hold in nearby molecular clouds in ourmilky way galaxy's disk as well as in distant galaxies where the star formationrates are often much larger. the inner 500 pc of our galaxy, the centralmolecular zone (cmz), contains the largest concentration of dense, high-surfacedensity molecular gas in the milky way, providing an environment where thevalidity of star-formation prescriptions can be tested. here we show that byseveral measures, the current star formation rate in the cmz is anorder-of-magnitude lower than the rates predicted by the currently acceptedprescriptions. in particular, the region 1 deg &lt; l &lt; 3.5 deg, |b| &lt; 0.5 degcontains ~10^7 msun of dense molecular gas -- enough to form 1000 orion-likeclusters -- but the present-day star formation rate within this gas is onlyequivalent to that in orion. in addition to density, another property ofmolecular clouds, such as the amplitude of turbulent motions, must be includedin the star-formation prescription to predict the star formation rate in agiven mass of molecular gas.

1211.6360	herschel view of the taurus b211/3 filament and striations: evidence of  filamentary growth?	we present first results from the herschel gould belt survey for theb211/l1495 region in the taurus molecular cloud. thanks to their highsensitivity and dynamic range, the herschel images reveal the structure of thedense, star-forming filament b211 with unprecedented detail, along with thepresence of striations perpendicular to the filament and generally orientedalong the magnetic field direction as traced by optical polarization vectors.based on the column density and dust temperature maps derived from the herscheldata, we find that the radial density profile of the b211 filament approaches apower-law behavior {\rho} {\propto} r^(-2.0{\pm}0.4) at large radii and thatthe temperature profile exhibits a marked drop at small radii. the observeddensity and temperature profiles of the b211 filament are in good agreementwith a theoretical model of a cylindrical filament undergoing gravitationalcontraction with a polytropic equation of state: p {\propto} {\rho}^{\gamma}and t {\propto} {\rho}^({\gamma}-1), with {\gamma}=0.97{\pm}0.01&lt;1 (i.e. notstrictly isothermal). the morphology of the column density map, where some ofthe perpendicular striations are apparently connected to the b211 filament,further suggests that the material may be accreting along the striations ontothe main filament. the typical velocities expected for the infalling materialin this picture are ~0.5-1 km/s, which are consistent with the existingkinematical constraints from previous co observations.

1304.2397	candidate super star cluster progenitor gas clouds possibly triggered by  close passage to sgr a*	super star clusters are the end product of star formation under the mostextreme conditions. as such, studying how their final stellar populations areassembled from their natal progenitor gas clouds can provide strong constraintson star formation theories. an obvious place to look for the initial conditionsof such extreme stellar clusters are gas clouds of comparable mass and density,with no star formation activity. we present a method to identify suchprogenitor gas clouds and demonstrate the technique for the gas in the innerfew hundred pc of our galaxy. the method highlights three clouds in the regionwith similar global physical properties to the previously identified extremecloud, g0.253+0.016, as potential young massive cluster (ymc) precursors. thefact that four potential ymc progenitor clouds have been identified in theinner 100 pc of the galaxy, but no clouds with similar properties have beenfound in the whole first quadrant despite extensive observational efforts, hasimplications for cluster formation/destruction rates across the galaxy. we putforward a scenario to explain how such dense gas clouds can arise in thegalactic centre environment, in which ymc formation is triggered by gas streamspassing close to the minimum of the global galactic gravitational potential atthe location of the central supermassive black hole, sgr a*. if this triggeringmechanism can be verified, we can use the known time interval since closestapproach to sgr a* to study the physics of stellar mass assembly in an extremeenvironment as a function of absolute time.

1305.3471	evolution and excitation conditions of outflows in high-mass  star-forming regions	theoretical models suggest that massive stars form via disk-mediatedaccretion, with bipolar outflows playing a fundamental role. a recent studytoward massive molecular outflows has revealed a decrease of the sio lineintensity as the object evolves. the present study aims at characterizing thevariation of the molecular outflow properties with time, and at studying thesio excitation conditions in outflows associated with massive ysos. we used theiram30m telescope to map 14 massive star-forming regions in the sio(2-1),sio(5-4) and hco+(1-0) outflow lines, and in several dense gas and hot coretracers. hi-gal data was used to improve the spectral energy distributions andthe l/m ratio, which is believed to be a good indicator of the evolutionarystage of the yso. we detect sio and hco+ outflow emission in all the sources,and bipolar structures in six of them. the outflow parameters are similar tothose found toward other massive ysos. we find an increase of the hco+ outflowenergetics as the object evolve, and a decrease of the sio abundance with time,from 10^(-8) to 10^(-9). the sio(5-4) to (2-1) line ratio is found to be low atthe ambient gas velocity, and increases as we move to high velocities,indicating that the excitation conditions of the sio change with the velocityof the gas (with larger densities and/or temperatures for the high-velocity gascomponent). the properties of the sio and hco+ outflow emission suggest ascenario in which sio is largely enhanced in the first evolutionary stages,probably due to strong shocks produced by the protostellar jet. as the objectevolves, the power of the jet would decrease and so does the sio abundance.during this process, however, the material surrounding the protostar would havebeen been swept up by the jet, and the outflow activity, traced by entrainedmolecular material (hco+), would increase with time.

1307.0335	herschel observations of the sgr b2 cores: hydrides, warm co, and cold  dust	sagittarius b2 (sgr b2) is one of the most massive and luminous star-formingregions in the galaxy and shows chemical and physical conditions similar tothose in distant extragalactic starbursts. we present large-scale far-ir/submmphotometric images and spectroscopic maps taken with the pacs and spireinstruments onboard herschel. the spectra towards the sgr b2 star-formingcores, b2(m) and b2(n), are characterized by strong co line emission, emissionlines from high-density tracers (hcn, hco+, and h2s), [n ii] 205 um emissionfrom ionized gas, and absorption lines from hydride molecules (oh+, h2o+, h2o,ch+, ch, sh+, hf, nh, nh2, and nh3). the rotational population diagrams of cosuggest the presence of two gas temperature components: an extended warmcomponent, which is associated with the extended envelope, and a hottercomponent, which is seen towards the b2(m) and b2(n) cores. as observed inother galactic center clouds, the gas temperatures are significantly higherthan the dust temperatures inferred from photometric images. we determinedfar-ir and total dust masses in the cores. non-local thermodynamic equilibriummodels of the co excitation were used to constrain the averaged gas density inthe cores. a uniform luminosity ratio is measured along the extended envelope,suggesting that the same mechanism dominates the heating of the molecular gasat large scales. the detection of high-density molecular tracers and of strong[n ii] 205 um line emission towards the cores suggests that their morphologymust be clumpy to allow uv radiation to escape from the inner hii regions.together with shocks, the strong uv radiation field is likely responsible forthe heating of the hot co component. at larger scales, photodissociationregions models can explain both the observed co line ratios and the uniforml(co)/lfir luminosity ratios.

1307.2590	global collapse of molecular clouds as a formation mechanism for the  most massive stars	the relative importance of primordial molecular cloud fragmentation versuslarge-scale accretion still remains to be assessed in the context of massivecore/star formation. studying the kinematics of the dense gas surroundingmassive-star progenitors can tell us the extent to which large-scale flow ofmaterial impacts the growth in mass of star-forming cores. here we present acomprehensive dataset of the 5500(+/-800) msun infrared dark cloudsdc335.579-0.272 (hereafter sdc335) which exhibits a network of cold, dense,parsec-long filaments. atacama large millimeter array (alma) cycle 0observations reveal two massive star-forming cores, mm1 and mm2, sitting at thecentre of sdc335 where the filaments intersect. with a gas mass of545(+770,-385) msun contained within a source diameter of 0.05pc, mm1 is one ofthe most massive, compact protostellar cores ever observed in the galaxy. as awhole, sdc335 could potentially form an ob cluster similar to the trapeziumcluster in orion. alma and mopra single-dish observations of the sdc335 densegas furthermore reveal that the kinematics of this hub-filament system areconsistent with a global collapse of the cloud. these molecular-line data pointtowards an infall velocity v_{inf} =0.7(+/-0.2) km/s, and a total mass infallrate \dot{m}_{inf} = 2.5(+/-1.0) x 10^{-3} msun/yr towards the central pc-sizeregion of sdc335. this infall rate brings 750(+/-300) msun of gas to the centreof the cloud per free-fall time (t_{ff}=3x10^5 yr). this is enough to doublethe mass already present in the central pc-size region in 3.5(+2.2,-1.0) xt_{ff}. these values suggest that the global collapse of sdc335 over the pastmillion year resulted in the formation of an early o-type star progenitor atthe centre of the cloud's gravitational potential well.

1311.0771	discovery of weak 6.7-ghz ch3oh masers in a sample of high-mass hi-gal  sources	maser lines from different molecular species, including water, hydroxyl, andmethanol, are common observational phenomena associated with massive starforming regions. in particular, the methanol maser appears as an ideal tool tostudy the early phases of massive star formation. however, it is difficult toestablish the exact start of the methanol maser phase, and it would then beinteresting to detect and study low-flux density methanol masers (i.e., &lt; 0.1jy or even &lt;&lt; 0.1 jy), in order to determine if they can effectively be used tomark a specific evolutionary phase in high-mass star formation. past surveyshave been unable to systematically detect many low-flux density methanolmasers, and thus we do not yet know how many such masers exist in the galaxyand what is their physical nature. out of a sample of 107 observed hi-galsources we detected a total of 32 methanol masers, with 22 sources being newand weak (median peak flux density 0.07 jy) detections, in the galacticlongitude range [32.0, 59.8]deg. we also detected 12 6.035-ghz oh maser, with 9objects being new detections. our survey covers a similar range of sourcedistances as the "arecibo methanol maser galactic plane survey", but themethanol masers detected by us are clearly shifted towards lower integratedflux densities. the newly detected methanol masers are mostly of low-luminosityand, except for some sources, their weakness is not due to distance effects orpositional offsets. no specific correlation is found with the physicalparameters of the hi-gal clumps, except for sources with both ch3oh and ohmasers which tend to have higher mass and luminosity. the intensity of themethanol masers correlates well with the velocity range of the maser emission,which suggests that the low brightness of these masers is related to the numberof maser spots in the emitting region and their evolution with time.

1406.4443	the identification of filaments on far infrared and submillimiter  images. morphology, physical conditions and relation with star formation of  filamentary structure	observations of molecular clouds reveal a complex structure, with gas anddust often arranged in filamentary rather than spherical geometries. theassociations of pre- and proto- stellar cores with the filaments suggest adirect link with the process of star formation. any study of the properties ofsuch filaments requires a representative samples from different enviroments andso an unbiased detection method. we developed such an approach using thehessian matrix of a surface-brightness distribution to identify filaments anddetermine their physical and morphological properties. after testing the methodon simulated, but realistic filaments, we apply the algorithms tocolumn-density maps computed from herschel observations of the galactic planeobtained by the hi-gal project. we identified ~500 filaments, in the longituderange of l=216.5 to l=225.5, with lengths from ~1 pc up to ~30 pc and widthsbetween 0.1 pc and 2.5 pc. average column densities are between 10^20 cm^-2 and10^22 cm^-2. filaments include the majority of dense material with n_h_2 &gt;6x10^21cm^-2. we find that the pre- and proto-stellar compact sources alreadyidentified in the same region are mostly associated with filaments. however,surface densities in excess of the expected critical values for high-mass starformation are only found on the filaments, indicating that these structures arenecessary to channel material into the clumps. furthermore, we analyze thegravitational stability of filaments and discuss their relationship with starformation.

1506.05472	the initial conditions of stellar protocluster formation. ii. a  catalogue of starless and protostellar clumps embedded in irdcs in the  galactic longitude range 15&lt;l&lt;55	we present a catalogue of starless and protostellar clumps associated withinfrared dark clouds (irdcs) in a 40 degrees wide region of the inner galacticplane (b&lt;1). we have extracted the far-infrared (fir) counterparts of 3493irdcs with known distance in the galactic longitude range 15&lt;l&lt;55 and searchedfor the young clumps using hi-gal, the survey of the galactic plane carried outwith the herschel satellite. each clump is identified as a compact sourcedetected at 160, 250 and 350 mum. the clumps have been classified asprotostellar or starless, based on their emission (or lack of emission) at 70mum. we identify 1723 clumps, 1056 (61%) of which are protostellar and 667(39%) starless. these clumps are found within 764 different irdcs, 375 (49%) ofwhich are only associated with protostellar clumps, 178 (23%) only withstarless clumps, and 211 (28%) with both categories of clumps. the clumps havea median mass of 250 m_sun and range up to &gt;10^4$ m_sun in mass and up to 10^5l_sun in luminosity. the mass-radius distribution shows that almost 30% of thestarless clumps identified in this survey could form high-mass stars, howeverthese massive clumps are confined in only ~4% of the irdcs. assuming a minimummass surface density threshold for the formation of high-mass stars, thecomparison of the numbers of massive starless clumps and those alreadycontaining embedded sources suggests an upper limit lifetime for the starlessphase of 10^5 years for clumps with a mass m&gt;500 m_sun.

1507.00215	bipolar hii regions - morphology and star formation in their vicinity -  i - g319.88$+$00.79 and g010.32$-$00.15	our goal is to identify bipolar hii regions and to understand theirmorphology, their evolution, and the role they play in the formation of newgenerations of stars. we use the spitzer and herschel hi-gal surveys toidentify bipolar hii regions. we search for their exciting star(s) and estimatetheir distances using near-ir data. dense clumps are detected usingherschel-spire data. malt90 observations allow us to ascertain theirassociation with the central hii region. we identify class 0/i ysos using theirspitzer and herschel-pacs emissions. these methods will be applied to theentire sample of candidate bipolar hii regions. this paper focuses on twobipolar hii regions, one interesting in terms of its morphology,g319.88$+$00.79, and one in terms of its star formation, g010.32$-$00.15. theirexciting clusters are identified and their photometric distances estimated tobe 2.6 kpc and 1.75 kpc, respectively. we suggest that these regions formed indense and flat structures that contain filaments. they have a central ionizedregion and ionized lobes perpendicular to the parental cloud. the remains ofthe parental cloud appear as dense (more than 10^4 per cm^3) and cold (14-17 k)condensations. the dust in the pdr is warm (19-25 k). dense massive clumps arepresent around the central ionized region. g010.32-00.14 is especiallyremarkable because five clumps of several hundred solar masses surround thecentral hii region; their peak column density is a few 10^23 per cm^2, and themean density in their central regions reaches several 10^5 per cm^3. four ofthem contain at least one massive yso; these clumps also contain extended greenobjects and class ii methanol masers. this morphology suggests that theformation of a second generation of massive stars has been triggered by thecentral bipolar hii region. it occurs in the compressed material of theparental cloud.

0805.2928	the pre-zams nature of mol160/iras23385+6053 confirmed by spitzer	determining the timeline for the formation of massive ysos requires theidentification and characterisation of all the phases that a massive formingyso undergoes. it is of particular interest to verify the observability of thephase in which the object is rapidly accreting while not yet igniting thefusion of hydrogen that marks the arrival on the zams. one of the candidateprototypical objects for this phase is mol160/iras23385+6053, which previousstudies suggest it could be in a pre-hot core stage. we further investigatethis issue by means of spitzer imaging and spectroscopy in the 5-70 micronrange. the dense core of mol160/iras23385+6053, which up to now had only beendetected at submm and mm wavelenghts has been revealed for the first time at 24and 70 micron by spitzer. the complete 24 micron -3.4 mm continuum cannot befitted with a standard model of a zero-age main-sequence (zams) star embeddedin an envelope. a simple greybody fit yields a mass of 220 solar masses. theluminosity is slightly in excess of 3000 solar luminosities, which is a factorof 5 less than previous estimates when only iras fluxes were available between20 and 100 micron. the source is under-luminous by the same factor with respectto uchii regions or hot-cores of similar circumstellar mass, and simple modelsshow that this is compatible with an earlier evolutionary stage. spectroscopybetween 5 and 40 microns revelas typical pdr/pir conditions, where the requireduv illumination may be provided by other sources revealed at 24 microns in thesame region, and which can be plausibly modeled as moderately embeddedintermediate-mass zams stars. our results strengthen the suggestion that thecentral core in mol160/iras23385+6053 is a massive yso actively accreting fromits circumstellar envelope and which did not yet begin hydrogen fusion.

1509.03931	the askap/emu source finding data challenge	the evolutionary map of the universe (emu) is a proposed radio continuumsurvey of the southern hemisphere up to declination +30 deg., with theaustralian square kilometre array pathfinder (askap). emu will use an automatedsource identification and measurement approach that is demonstrably optimal, tomaximise the reliability, utility and robustness of the resulting radio sourcecatalogues. as part of the process of achieving this aim, a "data challenge"has been conducted, providing international teams the opportunity to test avariety of source finders on a set of simulated images. the aim is to quantifythe accuracy of existing automated source finding and measurement approaches,and to identify potential limitations. the challenge attracted nine independentteams, who tested eleven different source finding tools. in addition, thechallenge initiators also tested the current askapsoft source-finding tool toestablish how it could benefit from incorporating successful features of theother tools. here we present the results of the data challenge, identifying thesuccesses and limitations for this broad variety of the current generation ofradio source finding tools. as expected, most finders demonstrate completenesslevels close to 100% at 10sigma dropping to levels around 10% by 5sigma. thereliability is typically close to 100% at 10sigma, with performance to lowersensitivities varying greatly between finders. all finders demonstrate theusual trade-off between completeness and reliability, whereby maintaining ahigh completeness at low signal-to-noise comes at the expense of reducedreliability, and vice-versa. we conclude with a series of recommendations forimproving the performance of the askapsoft source-finding tool.

1511.03670	gravity as the main driver of non-thermal motions in massive star  formation	the origin of non-thermal motions in massive star forming regions can beascribed to turbulence acting against the gravitational collapse, or to theself-gravity itself driving the rapid global collapse. the dependence betweenvelocity dispersion, radius and clouds surface density found by heyer et al.(2009), $\sigma/r^{1/2}\propto \sigma^{1/2}$, has been interpreted in terms ofglobal collapse of clouds. in this work we demonstrate that this relation is anexpression of a more general relation between accelerations. we introduce thegravo-turbulent acceleration, a$_k$, which describe the non-thermal motions ineach region, and the acceleration generated by the gravitational field a$_g$,which is proportional to $\sigma$. we also introduce a new coefficient, theforce partition coefficient $\alpha_{for}$ which is equivalent to the virialparameter but does not distinguish between collapsing and non-collapsingregions. in this work we use the a$_k$ - a$_g$ formalism in the analysis of anew sample of 16 massive starless clumps (mscls) combined with data from theliterature. we show that a$_k$ and a$_g$ are not independent. the non-thermalmotions in each region can originate from both local turbulence andself-gravity but overall the data in the a$_k$ vs. a$_g$ diagram demonstratethat the majority of the non-thermal motions originate from self-gravity. wefurther show that all the mscls with $\sigma\geq 0.1$ g cm$^{-2}$ show signs ofinfall motions, a strong indication that the denser regions are the first tocollapse. finally, we include in the formalism the contribution of an externalpressure and the magnetic fields.

astro-ph;0003031	iso spectroscopy of the hh 7-11 flow and its red-shifted counterpart	we have used the two spectrometers on the infrared space observatory toobserve the hh 7-11 flow, its red-shifted counterpart, and the candidateexciting source svs 13, in the star formation region ngc 1333. we detect atomic([oi]63um and 145um, [siii]34.8um, [cii]158um) and molecular (h_2, co, h_2o)lines at various positions along the bipolar flow.  most of the observed lines can be explained in terms of shock-excitedemission. in particular, our analysis shows that dissociative (j-type) andnon-dissociative (c-type) shocks are simultaneously present everywhere alongboth lobes of the flow. we confirm the low-excitation nature of the herbig-haronebulosities, with shock velocities &lt;40-50 km/s. toward both lobes of theoutflow we find pre-shock densities of n_0~10^4 cm-3 for both the j and ccomponents, implying b_0~100ug. in the central region of the flow, close to theexciting source, the pre-shock density deduced for the c-shock component isn_0~10^5 cm-3, suggesting a magnetic field ~3 times stronger. we propose thatthe deficiency of gas-phase water in the post c-shock regions is due tofreezing onto warm grains processed through the j-shock front and travelingalong the magnetic field lines. the total observed cooling from thedissociative shock components is consistent with the power lost by a slowmolecular outflow accelerated by a fast neutral hi wind.  finally, the skin of the cloud seen in projection toward the flow appears tobe weakly photo-ionised by bd +30 549, the dominant illuminating source of thengc 1333 reflection nebula.

astro-ph;0007319	the iso-lws map of the serpens cloud core: i. the seds of the ir/smm  sources	iso-lws mapping observations of the serpens molecular cloud core arepresented. the spectral range is 50 - 200 micron and the map size is 8' x 8'.these observations suffer from severe source confusion at fir wavelengths andwe employ a maximum likelihood method for the spectro-spatial deconvolution.the strong and fairly isolated source smm1 firs1 presented a test case, whosemodelled spectral energy distribution (sed), within observational errors, isidentical to the observed one. the model results for the other infrared andsubmillimetre sources are therefore likely to represent their correct seds.simulations demonstrating the reliability and potential of the developed methodsupport this view. for the majority of sources the peak of the seds is foundwithin the spectral range of the lws and derived temperatures are generallyhigher (&gt;30k) than have been found by earlier deconvolution attempts using irasdata. smm sizes are found to be only a few arcsec in diameter. in addition, thesmms are generally optically thick even at lws wavelengths. self-consistentradiative transfer calculations indicates that the smms are optically thick outto even longer wavelengths. models were calculated for five sources, for whichsufficient data were available, viz. smm 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9. these models areoptically thick out to millimetre wavelengths (wavelength of unit optical depth900 to 1400 micron). envelope masses for these smms are in the range 2-6 msun,which is of course considerably more massive than estimates based on theoptically thin assumption. the luminosities are in the range 10-70 lsun,suggesting the formation of low-mass to intermediate mass stars, so that theexistence of such massive envelopes argues for extreme youth of the smms in theserpens cloud core.

astro-ph;0103065	infrared and millimetric study of the young outflow cepheus e	the cepheus e outflow has been studied in the mid and far infrared using theiso cam and lws instruments, and at millimetric wavelengths using ovro. in thenear and mid-ir, its morphology is similar to that expected for a jet drivenoutflow, where the leading bow shocks entrain and accelerate the surroundingmolecular gas. as expected, fine structure atomic/ionic emission lines arisefrom the bow shocks, at both the mach disk and the stagnation tip, wherej-shocks are dominant. the h2, h2o and co molecular emission could arisefurther `downstream' at the bow shock wings where the shocks (v = 8-35 km/s)are oblique and more likely to be c-type. the 13co emission arises fromentrained molecular gas and a compact high velocity emission is observed,together with an extended low velocity component that almost coincidesspatially with the h2 near-ir emission. the millimetric continuum emissionshows two sources. we identify one of them with iras 23011+6126, postulating isthe driver of the cepheus e outflow; the other, also an embedded source, islikely to be driving one of other outflows observed in the region.

astro-ph;0103223	a molecular-line study of clumps with embedded high-mass protostar  candidates	we present molecular line observations made with the iram 30-m telescope ofthe immediate surroundings of a sample of 11 candidate high-mass protostars.these observations are part of an effort to clarify the evolutionary status ofa set of objects which we consider to be precursors of uc hii regions. we findthat the present data are consistent with such an interpretation. the sourceshave fir luminosities indicating the presence of b2.5 to o8.5v0 stars, areassociated with dense gas and dust, have (sub-)mm continuum spectra indicatingtemperatures of ca. 30k, and have no detectable radio continuum emission. allobserved sources are associated with well-defined molecular clumps. masses,sizes, and other parameters depend on the tracer used, but typically the coreshave average diameters of ca. 0.5-1 pc, and masses of a few tens to a fewthousand solar masses. compared to a similar analysis of sources which aremostly identifyable with uc hii regions, the present sample has molecularclumps that are more massive, larger, cooler, and less turbulent. they alsotend to have a smaller ratio of virial-to-luminous mass, indicating they areless dynamically stable than their counterparts embedded in the uc hii-likesources. the large sizes suggest these clumps should still undergo substantialcontraction. the lower temperatures and small linewidths are also expected inobjects in an earlier evolutionary state. we find that the masses of themolecular clumps associated with our objects increase with lfir [m(clump)propto lfir^(1.17)], and that there is a (weak) relation between the clump massand the mass of the embedded protostellar object m(proto) proptom(clump)^(0.30).

astro-ph;0310420	iras 23385+6053: a candidate protostellar massive object	we present the results of a multi-line and continuum study towards the sourceiras 23385+6053,performed with the iram-30m telescope, the plateau de bureinterferometer, the very large array interferometer and the james clerk maxwelltelescope. the new results confirm our earlier findings, namely that iras23385+6053 is a good candidate high-mass protostellar object, precursor of anultracompact h$_{ii}$ region. the source is roughly composed of two regions: amolecular core $\sim0.03\div0.04$ pc in size, with a temperature of $\sim40$ kand an h$_{2}$ volume density of the order of 10$^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$, and anextended halo of diameter $\leq$0.4 pc, with an average kinetic temperature of$\sim 15$ k and h$_{2}$ volume density of the order of 10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$. thecore temperature is much smaller than what is typically found in molecularcores of the same diameter surrounding massive zams stars. we deduce that thecore luminosity is between 150 and $1.6\times10^{4}l_{\odot}$, and we believethat the upper limit is near the ``true'' source luminosity. moreover, bycomparing the h$_{2}$ volume density obtained at different radii from the irassource, we find that the halo has a density profile of the type $n_{\rmh_{2}}\propto r^{-2.3}$. this suggests that the source is gravitationallyunstable. finally, we demonstrate that the temperature at the core surface isconsistent with a core luminosity of $10^3 l_{\odot}$ and conclude that wemight be observing a protostar still accreting material from its parentalcloud, whose mass at present is $\sim 6 m_{\odot}$.

astro-ph;0608702	searching for massive pre--stellar cores through observations of n2h+  and n2d+	we have measured the deuterium fractionation (through the column densityratio n(n2d+)/n(n2h+)) and the co depletion factor (ratio between expected andobserved co abundance) in a sample of 10 high-mass protostellar candidates, inorder to understand whether the earliest evolutionary stages of high-mass starshave chemical characteristics similar to those of low-mass ones. theobservations were carried out with the iram-30m telescope and the jcmt. we havedetected n2d+ emission in 7 of the 10 sources of our sample, and found anaverage value n(n2d+)/n(n2h+)~0.015. this value is 3 orders of magnitude largerthan the interstellar d/h ratio, indicating the presence of cold and dense gas,in which the physical-chemical conditions are similar to those observed inlow-mass pre-stellar cores. also, the integrated co depletion factors show thatin the majority of the sources the expected co abundances are larger than theobserved values, with a median ratio of 3.2. in principle, the cold gas thatgives origin to the n2d+ emission can be the remnant of the massive molecularcore in which the high-mass (proto-)star was born, not yet heated up by thecentral object. if so, our results indicate that the chemical properties of theclouds in which high-mass stars are born are similar to their low-masscounterparts. alternatively, this cold gas can be located into one (or more)starless core (cores) near the protostellar object. due to the poor angularresolution of our data, we cannot decide which is the correct scenario.
