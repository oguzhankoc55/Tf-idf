0903.3700	history of galaxy interactions and their impact on star formation over  the last 7 gyr from gems	we perform a comprehensive estimate of the frequency of galaxy mergers andtheir impact on star formation over z~0.24--0.80 (lookback time t_b~3--7 gyr)using 3698 (m*&gt;=1e9 msun) galaxies with gems hst, combo-17, and spitzer data.our results are: (1) among 790 high mass (m*&gt;=2.5e10 msun) galaxies, thevisually-based merger fraction over z~0.24--0.80, ranges from 9%+-5% to 8%+-2%.lower limits on the major and minor merger fractions over this interval rangefrom 1.1% to 3.5%, and 3.6% to 7.5%, respectively. this is the firstapproximate empirical estimate of the frequency of minor mergers at z&lt;1. for avisibility timescale of ~0.5 gyr, it follows that over t_b~3--7 gyr, ~68% ofhigh mass systems have undergone a merger of mass ratio &gt;1/10, with ~16%, 45%,and 7% of these corresponding respectively to major, minor, and ambiguous`major or minor' mergers. the mean merger rate is a few x 1e-4 gyr-1 mpc-3. (2)we compare the empirical merger fraction and rate for high mass galaxies to asuite of lambda cdm-based models: halo occupation distribution models,semi-analytic models, and hydrodynamic sph simulations. we find qualitativeagreement between observations and models such that the (major+minor) mergerfraction or rate from different models bracket the observations, and show afactor of five dispersion. near-future improvements can now start to rule outcertain merger scenarios. (3) among ~3698 m*&gt;=1e9 msun galaxies, we find thatthe mean sfr of visibly merging systems is only modestly enhanced compared tonon-interacting galaxies over z~0.24--0.80. visibly merging systems onlyaccount for less than 30% of the cosmic sfr density over t_b~3--7 gyr. thissuggests that the behavior of the cosmic sfr density over the last 7 gyr ispredominantly shaped by non-interacting galaxies.

0907.3728	less than 10 percent of star formation in z=0.6 massive galaxies is  triggered by major interactions	both observations and simulations show that major tidal interactions ormergers between gas-rich galaxies can lead to intense bursts of starformation.yet, the average enhancement in star formation rate (sfr) in major mergers andthe contribution of such events to the cosmic sfr are not well estimated. herewe use photometric redshifts, stellar masses and uv sfrs from combo-17, 24micron sfrs from spitzer and morphologies from two deep hst cosmological surveyfields (ecdfs/gems and a901/stages) to study the enhancement in sfr as afunction of projected galaxy separation. we apply two-point projectedcorrelation function techniques, which we augment with morphologically-selectedvery close pairs (separation &lt;2 arcsec) and merger remnants from the hstimaging. our analysis confirms that the most intensely star-forming systems areindeed interacting or merging. yet, for massive (m* &gt; 10^10 msun) star-forminggalaxies at 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8, we find that the sfrs of galaxies undergoing a majorinteraction (mass ratios &lt;1:4 and separations &lt; 40 kpc) are only 1.80 +/- 0.30times higher than the sfrs of non-interacting galaxies when averaged over allinteractions and all stages of the interaction, in good agreement with otherobservational works.  we demonstrate that these results imply that &lt;10% of star formation at 0.4 &lt;z &lt; 0.8 is triggered directly by major mergers and interactions; these eventsare not important factors in the build-up of stellar mass since z=1.

0908.0945	results of the great08 challenge: an image analysis competition for  cosmological lensing	we present the results of the great08 challenge, a blind analysis challengeto infer weak gravitational lensing shear distortions from images. the primarygoal was to stimulate new ideas by presenting the problem to researchersoutside the shear measurement community. six great08 team methods werepresented at the launch of the challenge and five additional groups submittedresults during the 6 month competition. participants analyzed 30 millionsimulated galaxies with a range in signal to noise ratio, point-spread functionellipticity, galaxy size, and galaxy type. the large quantity of simulationsallowed shear measurement methods to be assessed at a level of accuracysuitable for currently planned future cosmic shear observations for the firsttime. different methods perform well in different parts of simulation parameterspace and come close to the target level of accuracy in several of these. anumber of fresh ideas have emerged as a result of the challenge including are-examination of the process of combining information from different galaxies,which reduces the dependence on realistic galaxy modelling. the imagesimulations will become increasingly sophisticated in future great challenges,meanwhile the great08 simulations remain as a benchmark for additionaldevelopments in shear measurement algorithms.

1009.0779	gravitational lensing accuracy testing 2010 (great10) challenge handbook	gravitational lensing accuracy testing 2010 (great10) is a public imageanalysis challenge aimed at the development of algorithms to analyzeastronomical images. specifically, the challenge is to measure varying imagedistortions in the presence of a variable convolution kernel, pixelization andnoise. this is the second in a series of challenges set to the astronomy,computer science and statistics communities, providing a structured environmentin which methods can be improved and tested in preparation for plannedastronomical surveys. great10 extends upon previous work by introducingvariable fields into the challenge. the "galaxy challenge" involves the precisemeasurement of galaxy shape distortions, quantified locally by two parameterscalled shear, in the presence of a known convolution kernel. crucially, theconvolution kernel and the simulated gravitational lensing shape distortionboth now vary as a function of position within the images, as is the case forreal data. in addition, we introduce the "star challenge" that concerns thereconstruction of a variable convolution kernel, similar to that in a typicalastronomical observation. this document details the great10 challenge forpotential participants. continually updated information is also available fromhttp://www.greatchallenges.info.

0704.2601	gems: galaxy fitting catalogues and testing parametric galaxy fitting  codes	in the context of measuring structure and morphology of intermediate redshiftgalaxies with recent hst/acs surveys, we tune, test, and compare two widelyused fitting codes (galfit and gim2d) for fitting single-component sersicmodels to the light profiles of both simulated and real galaxy data. we findthat fitting accuracy depends sensitively on galaxy profile shape. exponentialdisks are well fit with sersic models and have small measurement errors,whereas fits to de vaucouleurs profiles show larger uncertainties owing to thelarge amount of light at large radii. we find that both codes provide reliablefits and little systematic error, when the effective surface brightness isabove that of the sky. moreover, both codes return errors that significantlyunderestimate the true fitting uncertainties, which are best estimated withsimulations. we find that gim2d suffers significant systematic errors forspheroids with close companions owing to the difficulty of effectively maskingout neighboring galaxy light; there appears to be no work around to thisimportant systematic in gim2d's current implementation. while this crowdingerror affects only a small fraction of galaxies in gems, it must be accountedfor in the analysis of deeper cosmological images or of more crowded fieldswith gim2d. in contrast, galfit results are robust to the presence of neighborsbecause it can simultaneously fit the profiles of multiple companions therebydeblending their effect on the fit to the galaxy of interest. we find galfit'srobustness to nearby companions and factor of &gt;~20 faster runtime speed areimportant advantages over gim2d for analyzing large hst/acs datasets. finallywe include our final catalog of fit results for all 41,495 objects detected ingems.

1110.4913	the impact of high spatial frequency atmospheric distortions on weak  lensing measurements	high precision cosmology with weak gravitational lensing requires a precisemeasure of the point spread function across the imaging data where the accuracyto which high spatial frequency variation can be modelled is limited by thestellar number density across the field. we analyse dense stellar fields imagedat the canada-france-hawaii telescope to quantify the degree of high spatialfrequency variation in ground-based imaging point spread functions and compareour results to models of atmospheric turbulence. the data shows an anisotropicturbulence pattern with an orientation independent of the wind direction andwind speed. we find the amplitude of the high spatial frequencies to decreasewith increasing exposure time as $t^{-1/2}$, and find a negligibly smallatmospheric contribution to the point spread function ellipticity variation forexposure times $t&gt;180$ seconds. for future surveys analysing shorter exposuredata, this anisotropic turbulence will need to be taken into account as theamplitude of the correlated atmospheric distortions becomes comparable to acosmological lensing signal on scales less than $\sim 10$ arcminutes. thiseffect could be mitigated, however, by correlating galaxy shear measured onexposures imaged with a time separation greater than 50 seconds, for which wefind the spatial turbulence patterns to be uncorrelated.

0711.3418	realistic simulations of gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters:  extracting arc parameters from mock dune images	we present a newly developed code that allows simulations of opticalobservations of galaxy fields with a variety of instruments. the codeincorporates gravitational lensing effects and is targetted at simulatinglensing by galaxy clusters. our goal is to create the tools required forcomparing theoretical expectations with observations to obtain a betterunderstanding of how observational noise affects lensing applications such asmass estimates, studies on the internal properties of galaxy clusters and arcstatistics. starting from a set of input parameters, characterizing both theinstruments and the observational conditions, the simulator provides a virtualobservation of a patch of the sky. it includes several sources of noise such asphoton-noise, sky background, seeing, and instrumental noise. ray-tracingthrough simulated mass distributions accounts for gravitational lensing. sourcemorphologies are realistically simulated based on shapelet decompositions ofgalaxy images retrieved from the goods-acs archive. according to theirmorphological class, spectral-energy-distributions are assigned to the sourcegalaxies in order to reproduce observations of each galaxy in arbitraryphotometric bands. we illustrate our techniques showing virtual observations ofa galaxy-cluster core as it would be observed with the space telescope dune,which was recently proposed to esa within its "cosmic vision" programme.(abridged)

1210.6214	agn host galaxies at redshift z~0.7: peculiar or not?	we perform a quantitative morphological comparison between the hosts ofactive galactic nuclei (agn) and quiescent galaxies at intermediate redshifts(z~0.7). the imaging data are taken from the large hst/acs mosaics of the gemsand stages surveys. our main aim is to test whether nuclear activity at thiscosmic epoch is triggered by major mergers. using images of quiescent galaxiesand stars, we create synthetic agn images to investigate the impact of anoptical nucleus on the morphological analysis of agn hosts. galaxy morphologiesare parameterized using the asymmetry index a, concentration index c, ginicoefficient g and m20 index. a sample of ~200 synthetic agn is matched to 21real agn in terms of redshift, host brightness and host-to-nucleus ratio toensure a reliable comparison between active and quiescent galaxies. the opticalnuclei strongly affect the morphological parameters of the underlying hostgalaxy. taking these effects into account, we find that the morphologies of theagn hosts are clearly distinct from galaxies undergoing violent gravitationalinteractions. in fact, the host galaxies' distributions in morphologicaldescriptor space are more similar to undisturbed galaxies than major mergers.intermediate-luminosity (lx &lt; 10^44 erg/s) agn hosts at z~0.7 show morphologiessimilar to the general population of massive galaxies with significant bulgesat the same redshifts. if major mergers are the driver of nuclear activity atthis epoch, the signatures of gravitational interactions fade rapidly beforethe optical agn phase starts, making them undetectable on single-orbit hstimages, at least with usual morphological descriptors. this could beinvestigated in future synthetic observations created from numericalsimulations of galaxy-galaxy interactions.

1211.0966	flexion measurement in simulations of hubble space telescope data	we present a simulation analysis of weak gravitational lensing flexion andshear measurement using shapelet decomposition, and identify differencesbetween flexion and shear measurement noise in deep survey data. taking modelsof galaxies from the hubble space telescope ultra deep field (hudf) andapplying a correction for the hudf point spread function we generate lensedsimulations of deep, optical imaging data from hubble's advanced camera forsurveys (acs), with realistic galaxy morphologies. we find that flexion andshear estimates differ in our measurement pipeline: whereas intrinsic galaxyshape is typically the dominant contribution to noise in shear estimates, pixelnoise due to finite photon counts and detector read noise is a majorcontributor to uncertainty in flexion estimates, across a broad range of galaxysignal-to-noise. this pixel noise also increases more rapidly as galaxysignal-to-noise decreases than is found for shear estimates. we provide simplepower law fitting functions for this behaviour, for both flexion and shear,allowing the effect to be properly accounted for in future forecasts forflexion measurement. using the simulations we also quantify the systematicbiases of our shapelet flexion and shear measurement pipeline for deep hubbledata sets such as galaxy evolution from morphology and seds, space telescopea901/902 galaxy evolution survey or the cosmic evolution survey. flexionmeasurement biases are found to be significant but consistent with previousstudies.

1212.3338	cfhtlens: combined probe cosmological model comparison using 2d weak  gravitational lensing	we present cosmological constraints from 2d weak gravitational lensing by thelarge-scale structure in the canada-france hawaii telescope lensing survey(cfhtlens) which spans 154 square degrees in five optical bands. using accuratephotometric redshifts and measured shapes for 4.2 million galaxies betweenredshifts of 0.2 and 1.3, we compute the 2d cosmic shear correlation functionover angular scales ranging between 0.8 and 350 arcmin. using non-linear modelsof the dark-matter power spectrum, we constrain cosmological parameters byexploring the parameter space with population monte carlo sampling. the bestconstraints from lensing alone are obtained for the small-scaledensity-fluctuations amplitude sigma_8 scaled with the total matter densityomega_m. for a flat lambdacdm model we obtain sigma_8(omega_m/0.27)^0.6 =0.79+-0.03.  we combine the cfhtlens data with wmap7, boss and an hst distance-ladderprior on the hubble constant to get joint constraints. for a flat lambdacdmmodel, we find omega_m = 0.283+-0.010 and sigma_8 = 0.813+-0.014. in the caseof a curved wcdm universe, we obtain omega_m = 0.27+-0.03, sigma_8 =0.83+-0.04, w_0 = -1.10+-0.15 and omega_k = 0.006+0.006-0.004.  we calculate the bayesian evidence to compare flat and curved lambdacdm anddark-energy cdm models. from the combination of all four probes, we find modelswith curvature to be at moderately disfavoured with respect to the flat case. asimple dark-energy model is indistinguishable from lambdacdm. our resultstherefore do not necessitate any deviations from the standard cosmologicalmodel.

1301.7421	cfhtlens: the environmental dependence of galaxy halo masses from weak  lensing	we use weak gravitational lensing to analyse the dark matter halos aroundsatellite galaxies in galaxy groups in the cfhtlens dataset. this dataset isderived from the cfhtls-wide survey, and encompasses 154 sq. deg ofhigh-quality shape data. using the photometric redshifts, we divide the sampleof lens galaxies with stellar masses in the range 10^9 msun to 10^10.5 msuninto those likely to lie in high-density environments (hde) and those likely tolie in low-density environments (lde). through comparison with galaxycatalogues extracted from the millennium simulation, we show that the sample ofhde galaxies should primarily (~61%) consist of satellite galaxies in groups,while the sample of lde galaxies should consist of mostly (~87%) non-satellite(field and central) galaxies. comparing the lensing signals around samples ofhde and lde galaxies matched in stellar mass, the lensing signal around hdegalaxies clearly shows a positive contribution from their host groups on theirlensing signals at radii of ~500--1000 kpc, the typical separation betweensatellites and group centres. more importantly, the subhalos of hde galaxiesare less massive than those around lde galaxies by a factor 0.65 +/- 0.12,significant at the 2.9 sigma level. a natural explanation is that the halos ofsatellite galaxies are stripped through tidal effects in the group environment.our results are consistent with a typical tidal truncation radius of ~40 kpc.

1303.1806	cfhtlens: mapping the large scale structure with gravitational lensing	we present a quantitative analysis of the largest contiguous maps ofprojected mass density obtained from gravitational lensing shear. we use datafrom the 154 deg2 covered by the canada-france-hawaii telescope lensing survey.our study is the first attempt to quantitatively characterize the scientificvalue of lensing maps, which could serve in the future as a complementaryapproach to the study of the dark universe with gravitational lensing. we showthat mass maps contain unique cosmological information beyond that oftraditional two-points statistical analysis techniques. using a series ofnumerical simulations, we first show how, reproducing the cfhtlens observingconditions, gravitational lensing inversion provides a reliable estimate of theprojected matter distribution of large scale structure. we validate ouranalysis by quantifying the robustness of the maps with various statisticalestimators. we then apply the same process to the cfhtlens data. we find thatthe 2-points correlation function of the projected mass is consistent with thecosmological analysis performed on the shear correlation function discussed inthe cfhtlens companion papers. the maps also lead to a significant measurementof the third order moment of the projected mass, which is in agreement withanalytic predictions, and to a marginal detection of the fourth order moment.tests for residual systematics are found to be consistent with zero for thestatistical estimators we used. a new approach for the comparison of thereconstructed mass map to that predicted from the galaxy distribution revealsthe existence of giant voids in the dark matter maps as large as 3 degrees onthe sky. our analysis shows that lensing mass maps can be used for newtechniques such as peak statistics and the morphological analysis of theprojected dark matter distribution.

1304.4265	cfhtlens: the relation between galaxy dark matter haloes and baryons  from weak gravitational lensing	we present a study of the relation between dark matter halo mass and thebaryonic content of host galaxies, quantified via luminosity and stellar mass.our investigation uses 154 deg2 of canada-france-hawaii telescope lensingsurvey (cfhtlens) lensing and photometric data, obtained from the cfht legacysurvey. we employ a galaxy-galaxy lensing halo model which allows us toconstrain the halo mass and the satellite fraction. our analysis is limited tolenses at redshifts between 0.2 and 0.4. we express the relationship betweenhalo mass and baryonic observable as a power law. for the luminosity-halo massrelation we find a slope of 1.32+/-0.06 and a normalisation of1.19+0.06-0.07x10^13 h70^-1 msun for red galaxies, while for blue galaxies thebest-fit slope is 1.09+0.20-0.13 and the normalisation is 0.18+0.04-0.05x10^13h70^-1 msun. similarly, we find a best-fit slope of 1.36+0.06-0.07 and anormalisation of 1.43+0.11-0.08x10^13 h70^-1 msun for the stellar mass-halomass relation of red galaxies, while for blue galaxies the corresponding valuesare 0.98+0.08-0.07 and 0.84+0.20-0.16x10^13 h70^-1 msun. for red lenses, thefraction which are satellites tends to decrease with luminosity and stellarmass, with the sample being nearly all satellites for a stellar mass of 2x10^9h70^-2 msun. the satellite fractions are generally close to zero for bluelenses, irrespective of luminosity or stellar mass. this, together with theshallower relation between halo mass and baryonic tracer, is a directconfirmation from galaxy-galaxy lensing that blue galaxies reside in lessclustered environments than red galaxies. we also find that the halo model,while matching the lensing signal around red lenses well, is prone toover-predicting the large-scale signal for faint and less massive blue lenses.this could be a further indication that these galaxies tend to be more isolatedthan assumed.

1306.6870	on the complementarity of galaxy clustering with cosmic shear and flux  magnification	in this paper, we motivate the use of galaxy clustering measurements usingphotometric redshift information, including a contribution from fluxmagnification, as a probe of cosmology. we present cosmological forecasts whenclustering data alone is used, and when clustering is combined with a cosmicshear analysis. we consider two types of clustering analysis: firstly,clustering with only redshift auto-correlations in tomographic redshift bins;secondly, using all available redshift bin correlations. finally, we considerhow inferred cosmological parameters may be biased using each analysis whenflux magnification is neglected. results are presented for a stage iiiground-based survey, and a stage iv space-based survey modelled withphotometric redshift errors, and values for the slope of the luminosityfunction inferred from cfhtlens catalogues. we find that combining clusteringinformation with shear can improve constraints on cosmological parameters,giving an improvement to a dark energy task force-like figure of merit by afactor of 1.33 when only auto-correlations in redshift are used for theclustering analysis, rising to 1.52 when cross-correlations in redshift arealso included. the addition of galaxy-galaxy lensing gives further improvement,with increases in figure of merit by a factor of 2.82 and 3.7 for each type ofclustering analysis respectively. the presence of flux magnification in aclustering analysis does not significantly affect the precision of cosmologicalconstraints when combined with cosmic shear and galaxy-galaxy lensing. howeverif magnification is neglected, inferred cosmological parameter values arebiased, with biases in some cosmological parameters larger than statisticalerrors.

1310.6784	cfhtlens: co-evolution of galaxies and their dark matter haloes	galaxy-galaxy weak lensing is a direct probe of the mean matter distributionaround galaxies. the depth and sky coverage of the cfht legacy survey yieldstatistically significant galaxy halo mass measurements over a much wider rangeof stellar masses ($10^{8.75}$ to $10^{11.3} m_{\odot}$) and redshifts ($0.2 &lt;z &lt; 0.8$) than previous weak lensing studies. at redshift $z \sim 0.5$, thestellar-to-halo mass ratio (shmr) reaches a maximum of $4.0\pm0.2$ percent as afunction of halo mass at $\sim 10^{12.25} m_{\odot}$. we find, for the firsttime from weak lensing alone, evidence for significant evolution in the shmr:the peak ratio falls as a function of cosmic time from $4.5 \pm 0.3$ percent at$z \sim 0.7$ to $3.4 \pm 0.2$ percent at $z \sim 0.3$, and shifts to lowerstellar mass haloes. these evolutionary trends are dominated by red galaxies,and are consistent with a model in which the stellar mass above which starformation is quenched "downsizes" with cosmic time. in contrast, the shmr ofblue, star-forming galaxies is well-fit by a power law that does not evolvewith time. this suggests that blue galaxies form stars at a rate that isbalanced with their dark matter accretion in such a way that they evolve alongthe shmr locus. the redshift dependence of the shmr can be used to constrainthe evolution of the galaxy population over cosmic time.

0802.1214	handbook for the great08 challenge: an image analysis competition for  cosmological lensing	the gravitational lensing accuracy testing 2008 (great08) challenge focuseson a problem that is of crucial importance for future observations incosmology. the shapes of distant galaxies can be used to determine theproperties of dark energy and the nature of gravity, because light from thosegalaxies is bent by gravity from the intervening dark matter. the observedgalaxy images appear distorted, although only slightly, and their shapes mustbe precisely disentangled from the effects of pixelisation, convolution andnoise. the worldwide gravitational lensing community has made significantprogress in techniques to measure these distortions via the shear testingprogram (step). via step, we have run challenges within our own community, andcome to recognise that this particular image analysis problem is ideallymatched to experts in statistical inference, inverse problems and computationallearning. thus, in order to continue the progress seen in recent years, we areseeking an infusion of new ideas from these communities. this document detailsthe great08 challenge for potential participants. please visithttp://www.great08challenge.info for the latest information.

0802.3978	sources of contamination to weak lensing three-point statistics:  constraints from n-body simulations	we investigate the impact of the observed correlation between a galaxiesshape and its surrounding density field on the measurement of third order weaklensing shear statistics. using numerical simulations, we estimate thesystematic error contribution to a measurement of the third order moment of theaperture mass statistic (ggg) from three-point intrinsic ellipticitycorrelations (iii), and the three-point coupling between the weak lensing shearexperienced by distant galaxies and the shape of foreground galaxies (ggi andgii). we find that third-order weak lensing statistics are typically morestrongly contaminated by these physical systematics compared to second-ordershear measurements, contaminating the measured three-point signal formoderately deep surveys with a median redshift z_m ~ 0.7 by ~ 15%. it has beenshown that accurate photometric redshifts will be crucial to correct for thiseffect, once a model and the redshift dependence of the effect can beaccurately constrained. to this end we provide redshift-dependent fittingfunctions to our results and propose a new tool for the observational study ofintrinsic galaxy alignments. for a shallow survey with z_m ~ 0.4 we find iii tobe an order of magnitude larger than the expected cosmological ggg shearsignal. compared to the two-point intrinsic ellipticity correlation which issimilar in amplitude to the two-point shear signal at these survey depths,third order statistics therefore offer a promising new way to constrain modelsof intrinsic galaxy alignments. early shallow data from the next generation ofvery wide weak lensing surveys will be optimal for this type of study.

1404.5469	cfhtlens: cosmological constraints from a combination of cosmic shear  two-point and three-point correlations	higher-order, non-gaussian aspects of the large-scale structure carryvaluable information on structure formation and cosmology, which iscomplementary to second-order statistics. in this work we measure second- andthird-order weak-lensing aperture-mass moments from cfhtlens and combine thosewith cmb anisotropy probes. the third moment is measured with a significance of$2\sigma$. the combined constraint on $\sigma_8 = \sigma_8 (\omega_{\rmm}/0.27)^\alpha$ is improved by 10%, in comparison to the second-order only,and the allowed ranges for $\omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$ are substantiallyreduced. including general triangles of the lensing bispectrum yields tighterconstraints compared to probing mainly equilateral triangles. second- andthird-order cfhtlens lensing measurements improve planck cmb constraints on$\omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$ by 26% for flat $\lambda$cdm. for a model withfree curvature, the joint cfhtlens-planck result is $\omega_{\rm m} = 0.28 \pm0.02$ (68% confidence), which is an improvement of 43% compared to planckalone. we test how our results are potentially subject to three astrophysicalsources of contamination: source-lens clustering, the intrinsic alignment ofgalaxy shapes, and baryonic effects. we explore future limitations of thecosmological use of third-order weak lensing, such as the nonlinear model andthe gaussianity of the likelihood function.

1407.4301	baryons, neutrinos, feedback and weak gravitational lensing	(abridged) the effect of baryonic feedback on the dark matter massdistribution is generally considered to be a nuisance to weak gravitationallensing. measurements of cosmological parameters are affected as feedbackalters the cosmic shear signal on angular scales smaller than a few arcminutes.recent progress on the numerical modelling of baryon physics has shown thatthis effect could be so large that, rather than being a nuisance, the effectcan be constrained with current weak lensing surveys, hence providing analternative astrophysical insight on one of the most challenging questions ofgalaxy formation. in order to perform our analysis, we construct an analyticfitting formula that describes the effect of the baryons on the mass powerspectrum. this fitting formula is based on three scenarios of the owlhydrodynamical simulations. it is specifically calibrated for $z&lt;1.5$, where itmodels the simulations to an accuracy that is better than $2\%$ for scales$k&lt;10 h\mbox{mpc}^{-1}$ and better than $5\%$ for $10 &lt; k &lt; 100h\mbox{mpc}^{-1}$. equipped with this precise tool, this paper presents thefirst constraint on baryonic feedback models using gravitational lensing data,from the canada france hawaii telescope lensing survey (cfhtlens). in thisanalysis, we show that the effect of neutrino mass on the mass power spectrumis degenerate with the baryonic feedback at small angular scales and cannot beignored. assuming a cosmology precision fixed by wmap9, we find that a universewith no baryon feedback and massless neutrinos is rejected by the cfhtlenslensing data with 96\% confidence. our study shows that ongoing weakgravitational lensing surveys (kids, hsc and des) will offer a uniqueopportunity to probe the physics of baryons at galactic scales, in addition tothe expected constraints on the total neutrino mass.

1507.03086	rcslens: testing gravitational physics through the cross-correlation of  weak lensing and large-scale structure	the unknown nature of dark energy motivates continued cosmological tests oflarge-scale gravitational physics. we present a new consistency check based onthe relative amplitude of non-relativistic galaxy peculiar motions, measuredvia redshift-space distortion, and the relativistic deflection of light bythose same galaxies traced by galaxy-galaxy lensing. we take advantage of thelatest generation of deep, overlapping imaging and spectroscopic datasets,combining the red cluster sequence lensing survey (rcslens), thecanada-france-hawaii telescope lensing survey (cfhtlens), the wigglez darkenergy survey and the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss). wequantify the results using the "gravitational slip" statistic e_g, which weestimate as 0.48 +/- 0.10 at z=0.32 and 0.30 +/- 0.07 at z=0.57, the latterconstituting the highest redshift at which this quantity has been determined.these measurements are consistent with the predictions of general relativity,for a perturbed friedmann-robertson-walker metric in a universe dominated by acosmological constant, which are e_g = 0.41 and 0.36 at these respectiveredshifts. the combination of redshift-space distortion and gravitationallensing data from current and future galaxy surveys will offer increasinglystringent tests of fundamental cosmology.

1507.04301	cfhtlens: weak lensing constraints on the ellipticity of galaxy-scale  matter haloes and the galaxy-halo misalignment	we present weak lensing constraints on the ellipticity of galaxy-scale matterhaloes and the galaxy-halo misalignment. using data from thecanada-france-hawaii telescope lensing survey (cfhtlens), we measure theweighted-average ratio of the aligned projected ellipticity components ofgalaxy matter haloes and their embedded galaxies, $f_\mathrm{h}$, split bygalaxy type. we then compare our observations to measurements taken from themillennium simulation, assuming different models of galaxy-halo misalignment.using the millennium simulation we verify that the statistical estimator usedremoves contamination from cosmic shear. we also detect an additional signal inthe simulation, which we interpret as the impact of intrinsic shape-shearalignments between the lenses and their large-scale structure environment.these alignments are likely to have caused some of the previous observationalconstraints on $f_\mathrm{h}$ to be biased high. from cfhtlens we find$f_\mathrm{h}=-0.04 \pm 0.25$ for early-type galaxies, which is consistent withcurrent models for the galaxy-halo misalignment predicting $f_\mathrm{h}\simeq0.20$. for late-type galaxies we measure $f_\mathrm{h}=0.69_{-0.36}^{+0.37}$from cfhtlens. this can be compared to the simulated results which yield$f_\mathrm{h}\simeq 0.02$ for misaligned late-type models.

1512.03626	cfhtlens and rcslens: testing photometric redshift distributions using  angular cross-correlations with spectroscopic galaxy surveys	we determine the accuracy of galaxy redshift distributions as estimated fromphotometric redshift probability distributions $p(z)$. our method utilisesmeasurements of the angular cross-correlation between photometric galaxies andan overlapping sample of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts. we describe theredshift leakage from a galaxy photometric redshift bin $j$ into aspectroscopic redshift bin $i$ using the sum of the $p(z)$ for the galaxiesresiding in bin $j$. we can then predict the angular cross-correlation betweenphotometric and spectroscopic galaxies due to intrinsic galaxy clustering when$i \neq j$ as a function of the measured angular cross-correlation when $i=j$.we also account for enhanced clustering arising from lensing magnificationusing a halo model. the comparison of this prediction with the measured signalprovides a consistency check on the validity of using the summed $p(z)$ todetermine galaxy redshift distributions in cosmological analyses, as advocatedby the canada-france-hawaii telescope lensing survey (cfhtlens).  we present an analysis of the photometric redshifts measured by cfhtlens,which overlaps the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss). we alsoanalyse the red-sequence cluster lensing survey (rcslens), which overlaps bothboss and the wigglez dark energy survey. we find that the summed $p(z)$ fromboth surveys are generally biased with respect to the true underlyingdistributions. if unaccounted for, this bias would lead to errors incosmological parameter estimation from cfhtlens by less than $\sim 4\%$. forphotometric redshift bins which spatially overlap in 3-d with our spectroscopicsample, we determine redshift bias corrections which can be used in futurecosmological analyses that rely on accurate galaxy redshift distributions.

astro-ph;0005269	intrinsic correlation of galaxy shapes: implications for weak lensing  measurements	weak gravitational lensing is now established as a powerful method to measuremass fluctuations in the universe. it relies on the measurement of smallcoherent distortions of the images of background galaxies. even low-levelcorrelations in the intrinsic shapes of galaxies could however produce asignificant spurious lensing signal. these correlations are also interesting intheir own right, since their detection would constrain models of galaxyformation. using $3\times 10^{4} - 10^5$ halos found in n-body simulations, wecompute the correlation functions of the intrinsic ellipticity of spiralgalaxies assuming that the disk is perpendicular to the angular momentum of thedark matter halo. we also consider a simple model for elliptical galaxies, inwhich the shape of the dark matter halo is assumed to be the same as that ofthe light. for deep lensing surveys with median redshifts $\sim 1$, we findthat intrinsic correlations of $\sim 10^{-4}$ on angular scales $\theta \sim0.1-10'$ are generally below the expected lensing signal, and contribute only asmall fraction of the excess signals reported on these scales. on larger scaleswe find limits to the intrinsic correlation function at a level $\sim 10^{-5}$,which gives a (model-dependent) range of separations for which the intrinsicsignal is about an order of magnitude below the ellipticity correlationfunction expected from weak lensing. intrinsic correlations are thus negligibleon these scales for dedicated weak lensing surveys. for wider but shallowersurveys such as supercosmos, apm and sdss, we cannot exclude the possibilitythat intrinsic correlations could dominate the lensing signal. we discuss howsuch surveys could be used to calibrate the importance of this effect, as wellas study spin-spin correlations of spiral galaxies.

astro-ph;0208220	weak gravitational lensing: reducing the contamination by intrinsic  alignments	intrinsic alignments of galaxies can mimic to an extent the effects of shearcaused by weak gravitational lensing. previous studies have shown that forshallow surveys with median redshifts z_m = 0.1, the intrinsic alignmentdominates the lensing signal. for deep surveys with z_m = 1, intrinsicalignments are believed to be a significant contaminant of the lensing signal,preventing high-precision measurements of the matter power spectrum. in thispaper we show how distance information, either spectroscopic or photometricredshifts, can be used to down-weight nearby pairs in an optimised way, toreduce the errors in the shear signal arising from intrinsic alignments.provided a conservatively large intrinsic alignment is assumed, the optimisedweights will essentially remove all traces of contamination. for the sloanspectroscopic galaxy sample, residual shot noise continues to render itunsuitable for weak lensing studies. however, a dramatic improvement for theslightly deeper sloan photometric survey is found, whereby the intrinsiccontribution, at angular scales greater than 1 arcminute, is reduced from about80 times the lensing signal to a 10% effect. for deeper surveys such as thecombo-17 survey with z_m = 0.6, the optimisation reduces the error from alargely systematic 220% error at small angular scales to a much smaller andlargely statistical error of only 17% of the expected lensing signal. wetherefore propose that future weak lensing surveys be accompanied by theacquisition of photometric redshifts, in order to remove fully the unknownintrinsic alignment errors from weak lensing detections.

astro-ph;0310174	weak lensing with combo-17: estimation and removal of intrinsic  alignments	we estimate and remove the contamination of weak gravitational lensingmeasurements by the intrinsic alignment of close pairs of galaxies. we do thisby investigating both the aperture mass b mode statistic, and the shearcorrelations of close and distant pairs of galaxies. we re-analyse the combo-17survey, and study published results from the rcs and the virmos-descart survey,concluding that the intrinsic alignment effect is at the lower end of the rangeof theoretical predictions. we also revisit this theoretical issue, and showthat misalignment of baryon and halo angular momenta may be an important effectwhich can reduce the intrinsic ellipticity correlations estimated fromnumerical simulations to the level that we and the supercosmos survey observe.we re-examine the cosmological parameter estimation from the combo-17 survey,now marginalising over the hubble constant. assuming no evolution in galaxyclustering, and marginalising over the intrinsic alignment signal, we find themass clustering amplitude is reduced by 0.03 to sigma_8(omega_m / 0.27)^0.6 =0.71 +/- 0.11. we consider the forthcoming snap wide weak lensing survey, andthe cfhtls wide synoptic survey, and expect them to be contaminated on scales&gt;1 arcmin by intrinsic alignments at the level of ~1% and ~2% respectively.division of the snap survey for lensing tomography significantly increases thecontamination in the lowest redshift bin to ~7% and possibly higher. removal ofthe intrinsic alignment effect by the downweighting of nearby galaxy pairs willtherefore be vital for snap, (abridged).

astro-ph;0411772	the evolution of early-type red galaxies with the gems survey:  luminosity-size and stellar mass-size relations since z=1	we combine hst/acs imaging from the gems survey with redshifts and rest-framequantities from combo-17 to study the evolution of morphologically early-typegalaxies with red colors since z=1. we use a new large sample of 728 galaxieswith centrally-concentrated radial profiles (sersic n&gt;2.5) and rest-frame u-vcolors on the red sequence. by appropriate comparison with the local relationsfrom sdss, we find that the luminosity-size (l-r) and stellar mass-size (m-r)relations evolve in a manner that is consistent with the passive aging ofancient stars. by itself, this result is consistent with a completely passiveevolution of the red early-type galaxy population. if instead, as demonstratedby a number of recent surveys, the early-type galaxy population builds up inmass by a factor of 2 since z=1, our results imply that new additions to theearly-type galaxy population follow similar l-r and m-r correlations, comparedto the older subset of early-type galaxies. adding early-type galaxies to thered sequence through disk fading appears to be consistent with the data.through comparison with models, the role of dissipationless merging is limitedto &lt;1 major merger on average since z=1 for the most massive galaxies.predictions from models of gas-rich mergers are not yet mature enough to allowa detailed comparison to our observations. we find tentative evidence that theamount of luminosity evolution depends on galaxy stellar mass, such that theleast massive galaxies show stronger luminosity evolution compared to moremassive early types. this could reflect a different origin of low-massearly-type galaxies and/or younger stellar populations; the present data isinsufficient to discriminate between these possibilities.

astro-ph;0603696	redshift and shear calibration: impact on cosmic shear studies and  survey design	the cosmological interpretation of weak lensing by large-scale structuresrequires knowledge of the redshift distribution of the source galaxies. currentlensing surveys are often calibrated using external redshift samples which spana significantly smaller sky area in comparison to the lensing survey, and arethus subject to sample variance. some future lensing surveys are expected to becalibrated in the same way, in particular the fainter galaxy populations wherethe entire color coverage, and hence photometric redshift estimate, could bechallenging to obtain. using n-body simulations, we study the impact of thissample variance on cosmic shear analysis and show that, to first approximation,it behaves like a shear calibration error 1+/-epsilon. using the hubble deepfield as a redshift calibration survey could therefore be a problem for currentlensing surveys. we discuss the impact of the redshift distribution samplingerror and a shear calibration error on the design of future lensing surveys,and find that a lensing survey of area theta square degrees and limitingmagnitude m_lim}, has a minimum shear and redshift calibration accuracyrequirements given by epsilon = epsilon_0 10^{beta(m_lim-24.5)} / sqrt(theta/200). above that limit, lensing surveys would not reach their full potential.using the galaxy number counts from the hubble ultra-deep field, we find(epsilon_0,beta)=(0.015,-0.18) and (epsilon_0,beta)=(0.011,-0.23) for groundand space based surveys respectively. lensing surveys with no or limitedredshift information and/or poor shear calibration accuracy will loose theirpotential to analyse the cosmic shear signal in the sub-degree angular scales,and therefore complete photometric redshift coverage should be a top priorityfor future lensing surveys.

astro-ph;0604001	potential sources of contamination to weak lensing measurements:  constraints from n-body simulations	we investigate the expected correlation between the weak gravitational shearof distant galaxies and the orientation of foreground galaxies, through the useof numerical simulations. this shear-ellipticity correlation can mimic acosmological weak lensing signal, and is potentially the limiting physicalsystematic effect for cosmology with future high-precision weak lensingsurveys. we find that, if uncorrected, the shear-ellipticity correlation couldcontribute up to 10% of the weak lensing signal on scales up to 20 arcminutes,for lensing surveys with a median depth z=1. the most massive foregroundgalaxies are expected to cause the largest correlations, a result also seen inthe sloan digital sky survey. we find that the redshift dependence of theeffect is proportional to the lensing efficiency of the foreground, and thisoffers prospects for removal to high precision, although with some modeldependence. the contamination is characterised by a weakly negative b-mode,which can be used as a diagnostic of systematic errors. we also provide moreaccurate predictions for a second potential source of error, the intrinsicalignment of nearby galaxies. this source of contamination is less important,however, as it can be easily removed with distance information.

astro-ph;0606648	cosmic variance of weak lensing surveys in the non-gaussian regime	the results from weak gravitational lensing analyses are subject to a cosmicvariance error term that has previously been estimated assuming gaussianstatistics. in this letter we address the issue of estimating cosmic varianceerrors for weak lensing surveys in the non-gaussian regime. using standard colddark matter model ray-tracing simulations characterized by omega_m=0.3,omega_lambda=0.7, h=0.7, sigma_8=1.0 for different survey redshifts z_s, wedetermine the variance of the two-point shear correlation function measuredacross 64 independent lines of sight. we compare the measured variance to thevariance expected from a random gaussian field and derive a redshift-dependentnon-gaussian calibration relation. we find that the ratio can be as high as ~30for a survey with source redshift z_s ~ 0.5 and ~10 for z_s ~ 1. the transitionscale theta_c above which the ratio is consistent with unity, is found to betheta_c ~ 20 arcmin for z_s ~ 0.5 and theta_c ~ 10 arcmin for z_s ~ 1. weprovide fitting formula to our results permitting the estimation ofnon-gaussian cosmic variance errors for any weak lensing analysis, and discussthe impact on current and future surveys. a more extensive set of simulationswill however be required to investigate the dependence of our results oncosmology, specifically on the amplitude of clustering.

astro-ph;0608643	the shear testing programme 2: factors affecting high precision weak  lensing analyses	the shear testing programme (step) is a collaborative project to improve theaccuracy and reliability of weak lensing measurement, in preparation for thenext generation of wide-field surveys. we review sixteen current and emergingshear measurement methods in a common language, and assess their performance byrunning them (blindly) on simulated images that contain a known shear signal.we determine the common features of algorithms that most successfully recoverthe input parameters. we achieve previously unattained discriminatory precisionin our analysis, via a combination of more extensive simulations, and pairs ofgalaxy images that have been rotated with respect to each other, thus removingnoise from their intrinsic ellipticities. the robustness of our simulationapproach is also confirmed by testing the relative calibration of methods onreal data.  weak lensing measurement has improved since the first step paper. severalmethods now consistently achieve better than 2% precision, and are still beingdeveloped. however, the simulations can now distinguish all methods fromperfect performance. our main concern continues to be the potential for amultiplicative shear calibration bias: not least because this can not beinternally calibrated with real data. we determine which galaxy populations areresponsible and, by adjusting the simulated observing conditions, we alsoinvestigate the effects of instrumental and atmospheric parameters. we haveisolated several previously unrecognised aspects of galaxy shape measurement,in which focussed development could provide further progress towards thesub-percent level of precision desired for future surveys.

astro-ph;0612428	an explanation for the observed weak size evolution of disk galaxies	surveys of distant galaxies with the hubble space telescope and from theground have shown that there is only mild evolution in the relationship betweenradial size and stellar mass for galactic disks from z~1 to the present day.using a sample of nearby disk-dominated galaxies from the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss), and high redshift data from the gems (galaxy evolution frommorphology and seds) survey, we investigate whether this result is consistentwith theoretical expectations within the hierarchical paradigm of structureformation. the relationship between virial radius and mass for dark matterhalos in the lcdm model evolves by about a factor of two over this interval.however, n-body simulations have shown that halos of a given mass have lesscentrally concentrated mass profiles at high redshift. when we compute theexpected disk size-stellar mass distribution, accounting for this evolution inthe internal structure of dark matter halos and the adiabatic contraction ofthe dark matter by the self-gravity of the collapsing baryons, we find that thepredicted evolution in the mean size at fixed stellar mass since z~1 is about15-20 percent, in good agreement with the observational constraints from gems.at redshift z~2, the model predicts that disks at fixed stellar mass were onaverage only 60% as large as they are today. similarly, we predict that therotation velocity at a given stellar mass (essentially the zero-point of thetully-fisher relation) is only about 10 percent larger at z~1 (20 percent atz~2) than at the present day.

astro-ph;0701480	cosmos: 3d weak lensing and the growth of structure	we present a three dimensional cosmic shear analysis of the hubble spacetelescope cosmos survey, the largest ever optical imaging program performed inspace. we have measured the shapes of galaxies for the tell-tale distortionscaused by weak gravitational lensing, and traced the growth of that signal as afunction of redshift. using both 2d and 3d analyses, we measure cosmologicalparameters omega_m, the density of matter in the universe, and sigma_8, thenormalization of the matter power spectrum. the introduction of redshiftinformation tightens the constraints by a factor of three, and also reduces therelative sampling (or "cosmic") variance compared to recent surveys that may belarger but are only two dimensional. from the 3d analysis, we findsigma_8*(omega_m/0.3)^0.44=0.866+^0.085_-0.068 at 68% confidence limits,including both statistical and potential systematic sources of error in thetotal budget. indeed, the absolute calibration of shear measurement methods isnow the dominant source of uncertainty. assuming instead a baseline cosmologyto fix the geometry of the universe, we have measured the growth of structureon both linear and non-linear physical scales. our results thus demonstrate aproof of concept for tomographic analysis techniques that have been proposedfor future weak lensing surveys by a dedicated wide-field telescope in space.

astro-ph;0702140	the stability of the point spread function of the advanced camera for  surveys on the hubble space telescope and implications for weak gravitational  lensing	(abridged) we examine the spatial and temporal stability of the hst acs widefield camera (wfc) point spread function (psf) using the two square degreecosmos survey. we show that stochastic aliasing of the psf necessarily occursduring `drizzling'. this aliasing is maximal if the output pixel scale is equalto the input pixel scale of 0.05''. we show that this source of psf variationcan be significantly reduced by choosing a gaussian drizzle kernel and bysetting the output pixel size to 0.03''. we show that the psf is temporallyunstable, most likely due to thermal fluctuations in the telescope's focus. wefind that the primary manifestation of this thermal drift in cosmos images isan overall slow periodic focus change. using a modified version of tinytim, wecreate undistorted stars in a 30x30 grid across the acs wfc ccds. these psfmodels are created for telescope focus values in the range -10 microns to +5microns, thus spanning the allowed range of telescope focus values. we then usethe approximately ten well measured stars in each cosmos field to pick thebest-fit focus value for each field. the tinytim model stars are then used toperform psf corrections for weak lensing allowing systematics due toincorrectly modeled psfs to be greatly reduced. we have made the software forpsf modeling using our modified version of tinytim available to theastronomical community. we show the effects of charge transfer efficiency (cte)degradation, which distorts the object in the readout direction, mimicking aweak lensing signal. we derive a parametric correction for the effect of cte onthe shapes of objects in the cosmos field as a function of observation date,position within the acs wfc field, and object flux.

astro-ph;0703570	cosmological constraints from the 100 square degree weak lensing survey	we present a cosmic shear analysis of the 100 square degree weak lensingsurvey, combining data from the cfhtls-wide, rcs, virmos-descart and gabodssurveys. spanning ~100 square degrees, with a median source redshift z~0.78,this combined survey allows us to place tight joint constraints on the matterdensity parameter omega_m, and the amplitude of the matter power spectrumsigma_8, finding sigma_8*(omega_m/0.24)^0.59 = 0.84+/-0.05. tables of themeasured shear correlation function and the calculated covariance matrix foreach survey are included.  the accuracy of our results is a marked improvement on previous work owing tothree important differences in our analysis; we correctly account for cosmicvariance errors by including a non-gaussian contribution estimated fromnumerical simulations; we correct the measured shear for a calibration bias asestimated from simulated data; we model the redshift distribution, n(z), ofeach survey from the largest deep photometric redshift catalogue currentlyavailable from the cfhtls-deep. this catalogue is randomly sampled to reproducethe magnitude distribution of each survey with the resulting survey dependentn(z) parametrised using two different models. while our results are consistentfor the n(z) models tested, we find that our cosmological parameter constraintsdepend weakly (at the 5% level) on the inclusion or exclusion of galaxies withlow confidence photometric redshift estimates (z&gt;1.5). these high redshiftgalaxies are relatively few in number but contribute a significant weak lensingsignal. it will therefore be important for future weak lensing surveys toobtain near-infra-red data to reliably determine the number of high redshiftgalaxies in cosmic shear analyses.

0811.3873	the stages view of red spirals and dusty red galaxies: mass-dependent  quenching of star-formation in cluster infall	we investigate the properties of optically passive spirals and dusty redgalaxies in the a901/2 cluster complex at redshift ~0.17 using restframenear-uv-optical seds, 24 micron ir data and hst morphologies from the stagesdataset. the cluster sample is based on combo-17 redshifts with an rmsprecision of sigma_cz~2000 km/sec. we find that 'dusty red galaxies' and'optically passive spirals' in a901/2 are largely the same phenomenon, and thatthey form stars at a substantial rate, which is only 4x lower than that in bluespirals at fixed mass. this star formation is more obscured than in bluegalaxies and its optical signatures are weak. they appear predominantly in thestellar mass range of log m*/msol=[10,11] where they constitute over half ofthe star-forming galaxies in the cluster; they are thus a vital ingredient forunderstanding the overall picture of star formation quenching in clusters. wefind that the mean specific sfr of star-forming galaxies in the cluster isclearly lower than in the field, in contrast to the specific sfr properties ofblue galaxies alone, which appear similar in cluster and field. such a rich redspiral population is best explained if quenching is a slow process andmorphological transformation is delayed even more. at log m*/msol&lt;10, suchgalaxies are rare, suggesting that their quenching is fast and accompanied bymorphological change. we note, that edge-on spirals play a minor role; despitebeing dust-reddened they form only a small fraction of spirals independent ofenvironment.

0811.3890	stages: the space telescope a901/2 galaxy evolution survey	we present an overview of the space telescope a901/2 galaxy evolution survey(stages). stages is a multiwavelength project designed to probe physicaldrivers of galaxy evolution across a wide range of environments and luminosity.a complex multi-cluster system at z~0.165 has been the subject of an 80-orbitf606w hst/acs mosaic covering the full 0.5x0.5 (~5x5 mpc^2) span of thesupercluster. extensive multiwavelength observations with xmm-newton, galex,spitzer, 2df, gmrt, and the 17-band combo-17 photometric redshift surveycomplement the hst imaging. our survey goals include simultaneously linkinggalaxy morphology with other observables such as age, star-formation rate,nuclear activity, and stellar mass. in addition, with the multiwavelengthdataset and new high resolution mass maps from gravitational lensing, we areable to disentangle the large-scale structure of the system. by examining allaspects of environment we will be able to evaluate the relative importance ofthe dark matter halos, the local galaxy density, and the hot x-ray gas indriving galaxy transformation. this paper describes the hst imaging, datareduction, and creation of a master catalogue. we perform sersic fitting on thehst images and conduct associated simulations to quantify completeness. inaddition, we present the combo-17 photometric redshift catalogue and estimatesof stellar masses and star-formation rates for this field. we define galaxy andcluster sample selection criteria which will be the basis for forthcomingscience analyses, and present a compilation of notable objects in the field.finally, we describe the further multiwavelength observations and announcepublic access to the data and catalogues.

0812.1881	sources of contamination to weak lensing tomography: redshift-dependent  shear measurement bias	the current methods available to estimate gravitational shear fromastronomical images of galaxies introduce systematic errors which can affectthe accuracy of weak lensing cosmological constraints. we study the impact ofksb shape measurement bias on the cosmological interpretation of tomographictwo-point weak lensing shear statistics.  we use a set of realistic image simulations produced by the stepcollaboration to derive shape measurement bias as a function of redshift. wedefine biased two-point weak lensing statistics and perform a likelihoodanalysis for two fiducial surveys. we present a derivation of the covariancematrix for tomography in real space and a fitting formula to calibrate it fornon-gaussianity.  we find the biased aperture mass dispersion is reduced by ~20% at redshift~1, and has a shallower scaling with redshift. this effect, if ignored in dataanalyses, biases sigma_8 and w_0 estimates by a few percent. the power oftomography is significantly reduced when marginalising over a range ofrealistic shape measurement biases. for a cfhtls-wide-like survey, [omega_m,sigma_8] confidence regions are degraded by a factor of 2, whereas for akids-like survey the factor is 3.5. our results are strictly valid only for ksbmethods but they demonstrate the need to marginalise over a redshift-dependentshape measurement bias in all future cosmological analyses.
