0903.1123	the global gas and dust budget of the large magellanic cloud: agb stars  and supernovae, and the impact on the ism evolution	we report on an analysis of the gas and dust budget in the the interstellarmedium (ism) of the large magellanic cloud (lmc). recent observations from thespitzer space telescope enable us to study the mid-infrared dust excess ofasymptotic giant branch (agb) stars in the lmc. this is the first time we canquantitatively assess the gas and dust input from agb stars over a completegalaxy, fully based on observations. the integrated mass-loss rate over allintermediate and high mass-loss rate carbon-rich agb candidates in the lmc is8.5x10^-3 solar mass per year, up to 2.1x10^-2 solar mass per year. this numbercould be increased up to 2.7x10^-2 solar mass per year, if oxygen-rich starsare included. this is overall consistent with theoretical expectations,considering the star formation rate when these low- and intermediate-mass starswhere formed, and the initial mass functions. agb stars are one of the mostimportant gas sources in the lmc, with supernovae (sne), which produces about2-4x10^-2 solar mass per year. at the moment, the star formation rate exceedsthe gas feedback from agb stars and sne in the lmc, and the current starformation depends on gas already present in the ism. this suggests that as thegas in the ism is exhausted, the star formation rate will eventually decline inthe lmc, unless gas is supplied externally. our estimates suggest `a missingdust-mass problem' in the lmc, which is similarly found in high-z galaxies: theaccumulated dust mass from agb stars and possibly sne over the dust life time(400--800 myrs) is significant less than the dust mass in the ism. another dustsource is required, possibly related to star-forming regions.

0903.2280	a vlt vimos study of the anomalous bcd mrk 996: mapping the ionised gas  kinematics and abundances	a study of the blue compact dwarf (bcd) galaxy mrk 996 based on highresolution optical vlt vimos integral field unit spectroscopy is presented. mrk996 displays multi-component line emission, with most line profiles consistingof a narrow, central gaussian with an underlying broad component. the broad hibalmer component splits into two separate broad components inside a 1".5 radiusfrom the nucleus; these are attributed to a two-armed mini-spiral. the rotationcurve of mrk 996 derived from the h\alpha narrow component yields a total massof 5x10^8 msol within a radius of 3 kpc.  the high excitation energy, high critical density [o iii] 4363 and [n ii]5755 lines are only detected from the inner region and exist purely in broadcomponent form, implying unusual excitation conditions. surface brightness,radial velocity, and fwhm maps for several emission components are presented. aseparate physical analysis of the broad and narrow emission line regions isundertaken. we derive an upper limit of 10,000 k for the electron temperatureof the narrow line gas, together with an electron density of 170 cm^-3, typicalof normal h ii regions. for the broad line component, we estimate a temperatureof 11,000 k and an electron density of 10^7 cm^-3. the broad line emissionregions show a n/h enrichment factor of ~20 relative to the narrow lineregions, but no he/h, o/h, s/h, or ar/h enrichment is inferred. the dominantline excitation mechanism is photoionisation by the ~3000 wr stars and ~150,000o-type stars estimated to be present in the core. this is indeed a peculiarbcd, with extremely dense zones of gas in the core, through which stellaroutflows and possible shock fronts permeate contributing to the excitation ofthe broad line emission.

0907.0246	the destruction and survival of dust in the shell around sn 2008s	sn 2008s erupted in early 2008 in the grand design spiral galaxy ngc 6946.the progenitor was detected by prieto et al. in spitzer space telescope imagestaken over the four years prior to the explosion, but was not detected in deepoptical images, from which they inferred a self-obscured object with a mass ofabout 10 msun. we obtained spitzer observations of sn 2008s five days after itsdiscovery, as well as coordinated gemini and spitzer optical and infraredobservations six months after its outburst.  we have constructed radiative transfer dust models for the object before andafter the outburst, using the same r^-2 density distribution of pre-existingamorphous carbon grains for all epochs and taking light-travel time effectsinto account for the early post-outburst epoch. we rule out silicate grains asa significant component of the dust around sn 2008s. the inner radius of thedust shell moved outwards from its pre-outburst value of 85 au to apost-outburst value of 1250 au, attributable to grain vaporisation by the lightflash from sn 2008s. although this caused the circumstellar extinction todecrease from av = 15 before the outburst to 0.8 after the outburst, weestimate that less than 2% of the overall circumstellar dust mass wasdestroyed.  the total mass-loss rate from the progenitor star is estimated to have been(0.5-1.0)x10^-4 msun yr^-1. the derived dust mass-loss rate of 5x10^-7 msunyr^-1 implies a total dust injection into the ism of up to 0.01 msun over thesuggested duration of the self-obscured phase. we consider the potentialcontribution of objects like sn 2008s to the dust enrichment of galaxies.

0707.1619	an extremely bright echo associated with sn 2002hh	we present new, very late-time optical photometry and spectroscopy of theinteresting type ii-p supernova, sn 2002hh, in ngc 6946. gemini/gmos-n has beenused to acquire visible spectra at six epochs between 2004 august and 2006july, following the evolution of the sn from age 661 to 1358 days. few opticalspectra of type ii supernovae with ages greater than one year exist. inaddition, g'r'i' images were acquired at all six epochs. the spectral andphotometric evolution of sn 2002hh has been very unusual. measures of thebrightness of this sn, both in the r and i bands as well as in the h-alphaemission flux, show no significant fading over an interval of nearly two years.the most straightforward explanation for this behavior is that the light beingmeasured comes not only from the sn itself but also from an echo off of nearbydust. echoes have been detected previously around several sne but these echoes,at their brightest, were ~8 mag below the maximum brightness of the sn. at v~21mag, the putative echo dominates the light of sn 2002hh and is only ~4 magbelow the outburst's peak brightness. there is an estimated 6 magnitudes oftotal extinction in v towards sn 2002hh. the proposed explanation of adifferential echo/sn absorption is inconsistent with the observed bvri colors.

1001.2098	870 um observations of evolved stars with laboca	during their evolution, asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars experience a highmass-loss which leads to the formation of a circumstellar envelope (cse) ofdust and gas. the mass-loss process is the most important phenomenon duringthis evolutionary stage. in order to understand it, it is important to studythe physical parameters of the cse. the emission of the cse in the(sub)millimetre range is dominated by the dust continuum. this means that(sub)millimetre observations are a key tool in tracing the dust and improvingour knowledge of the mass-loss process.  in this paper we analyse new sub-millimetre observations of 9 evolved starsin order to constrain the cse physical parameters. the data were taken by thenew apex bolometer laboca.  the fluxes at 870 um are derived and the extended emission is investigated.  we compute the spectral energy distribution (seds) using a 1d radiativetransfer code, dusty which we compared to literature data. grain properties arecalculated using both spherical grains distribution and a continuousdistribution of ellipsoids (cde) and a comparison between the two is drawn.synthetic surface brightness maps have been derived from the modelling and werecompared to the laboca brightness maps.  we detected the presence of extended emission around four stars. physicalparameters of the circumstellar envelope are derived from sed modelling, suchas the dust chemical composition, the dust condensation temperature and thetotal mass of the envelope. it proves difficult however to fit the sed and theintensity profile simultaneously.

1001.4035	testing pdr models against iso fine structure line data for  extragalactic sources	far-infrared [c ii] 158 micron, [o i] 145 micron and [o i] 63 micron finestructure emission line fluxes were measured from archival infrared spaceobservatory long wavelength spectrometer spectra of 46 extragalactic sources,with 28 sources providing detections in all three lines. for 12 of the sources,the contribution to the [c ii] 158 micron line flux from h ii regions could beestimated from their detected [n ii] 122 micron line fluxes. the measured [cii]/[o i] and [o i] 63/145 micron line flux ratios were compared with thosefrom a grid of pdr models previously computed using the ucl pdr code.persistent offsets between the observed and modelled line ratios could bepartly attributed to the effects of [o i] 63 micron self-absorption. using thesmmol code, we calculated model [o i] line profiles and found that the strengthof the [o i] 63 micron line was reduced by 20-80%, depending on the pdrparameters. we conclude that high pdr densities and radiation field strengths,coupled with the effects of [o i] 63 micron self-absorption, are likely toprovide the best match to the observed line flux ratios.

1002.2111	chemical and radiative transfer modeling of the iso-lws fabry-perot  spectra of orion-kl water lines	we present chemical and radiative transfer models for the many far-ir ortho-and para-h2o lines that were observed from the orion-kl region in highresolution fabry-perot (fp) mode by the long wavelength spectrometer (lws) onboard the infrared space observatory (iso). the chemistry of the region wasfirst studied by simulating the conditions in the different known components oforion-kl: chemical models for a hot core, a plateau and a ridge were coupledwith an accelerated lambda$-iteration (ali) radiative transfer model to predicth2o line fluxes and profiles. our models include the first 45 energy levels ofortho- and para-h2o. we find that lines arising from energy levels below 560 kwere best reproduced by a gas of density 3x10^5 cm^-3 at a temperature of 70-90k, expanding at a velocity of 30 km s^-1 and with a h2o/h2 abundance ratio ofthe order of 2 - 3 x 10^-5, similar to the abundance derived by cernicharo etal. (2006). however, the model that best reproduces the fluxes and profiles ofh2o lines arising from energy levels above 560 k has a significantly higherh2o/h2 abundance, 1 - 5 x 10^-4, originating from gas of similar density, inthe plateau region, that has been heated to 300 k, relaxing to 90-100 k. weconclude that the observed water lines do not originate from high temperatureshocks.

1008.1199	a high resolution line survey of irc+10216 with herschel. first results:  detection of warm silicon dicarbide sic2	we present the first results of a high-spectral-resolution survey of thecarbon-rich evolved star irc+10216 that was carried out with the hifispectrometer onboard herschel. this survey covers all hifi bands, with aspectral range from 488 to 1901ghz. in this letter we focus on the band-1bspectrum, in a spectral range 554.5-636.5ghz, where we identified 130 spectralfeatures with intensities above 0.03 k and a signal-to-noise ratio &gt;5. detectedlines arise from hcn, sio, sis, cs, co, metal-bearing species and,surprisingly, silicon dicarbide (sic2). we identified 55 sic2 transitionsinvolving energy levels between 300 and 900 k. by analysing these rotationallines, we conclude that sic2 is produced in the inner dust formation zone, withan abundance of ~2x10^-7 relative to molecular hydrogen. these sic2 lines havebeen observed for the first time in space and have been used to derive an sic2rotational temperature of ~204 k and a source-averaged column density of~6.4x10^15 cm^-2. furthermore, the high quality of the hifi data set was usedto improve the spectroscopic rotational constants of sic2.

1010.4770	on the origin of m81 group extended dust emission	galactic cirrus emission at far-infrared wavelengths affects manyextragalactic observations. separating this emission from that associated withextragalactic objects is both important and difficult. in this paper we discussa particular case, the m81 group, and the identification of diffuse structuresprominent in the infrared, but also detected at optical wavelengths. the originof these structures has previously been controversial, ranging from them beingthe result of a past interaction between m81 and m82 or due to more localgalactic emission. we show that over of order a few arcminute scales thefar-infrared (herschel 250 &amp;\mu&amp;m) emission correlates spatially very well witha particular narrow velocity (2-3 km/s) component of the galactic hi. we findno evidence that any of the far-infrared emission associated with thesefeatures actually originates in the m81 group. thus we infer that theassociated diffuse optical emission must be due to galactic light backscattered off dust in our galaxy. ultra-violet observations pick out youngstellar associations around m81, but no detectable far-infrared emission. weconsider in detail one of the galactic cirrus features, finding that thefar-infrared hi relation breaks down below arc minute scales and that atsmaller scales there can be quite large dust temperature variations.

0709.2122	3d photoionisation modelling of ngc 6302	we present a three-dimensional photoionisation and dust radiative transfermodel of ngc 6302, an extreme, high-excitation planetary nebula. we use the 3dphotoionisation code mocassin} to model the emission from the gas and dust. wehave produced a good fit to the optical emission-line spectrum, from which wederived a density distribution for the nebula. a fit to the infrared coronallines places strong constraints on the properties of the unseen ionisingsource. we find the best fit comes from using a 220,000 k hydrogen-deficientcentral star model atmosphere, indicating that the central star of this pn mayhave undergone a late thermal pulse.  we have also fitted the overall shape of the iso spectrum of ngc 6302 using adust model with a shallow power-law size distribution and grains up to 1.0micron in size. to obtain a good fit to the infrared sed the dust must besufficiently recessed within the circumstellar disk to prevent large amounts ofhot dust at short wavelengths, a region where the iso spectrum is particularlylacking. these and other discoveries are helping to unveil many properties ofthis extreme object and trace it's evolutionary history.

1104.2316	warm water vapour in the sooty outflow from a luminous carbon star	in 2001, the discovery of circumstellar water vapour around the ageing carbonstar irc+10216 was announced. this detection challenged the currentunderstanding of chemistry in old stars, since water vapour was predicted to beabsent in carbon-rich stars. several explanations for the occurrence of watervapour were postulated, including the vaporization of icy bodies (comets ordwarf planets) in orbit around the star, grain surface reactions, andphotochemistry in the outer circumstellar envelope. however, the only waterline detected so far from one carbon-rich evolved star can not discriminate, byitself, between the different mechanisms proposed. here we report on thedetection by the herschel satellite of dozens of water vapour lines in thefar-infrared and sub-millimetre spectrum of irc+10216, including somehigh-excitation lines with energies corresponding to ~1000 k. the emission ofthese high-excitation water lines can only be explained if water vapour ispresent in the warm inner region of the envelope. a plausible explanation forthe formation of warm water vapour appears to be the penetration of ultraviolet(uv) photons deep into a clumpy circumstellar envelope. this mechanism triggersalso the formation of other molecules such as ammonia, whose observedabundances are much higher than hitherto predicted.

1106.0537	evidence for pre-existing dust in the bright type iin sn 2010jl	sn 2010jl was an extremely bright, type iin sne which showed a significant irexcess no later than 90 days after explosion. we have obtained spitzer 3.6 and4.5 \mum and jhk observations of sn 2010jl \sim90 days post explosion. littleto no reddening in the host galaxy indicated that the circumstellar materiallost from the progenitor must lie in a torus inclined out of the plane of thesky. the likely cause of the high mid-ir flux is the reprocessing of theinitial flash of the sn by pre-existing circumstellar dust. using a 3d montecarlo radiative transfer code, we have estimated that between 0.03-0.35 msun ofdust exists in a circumstellar torus around the sn located 6 \times 10 ^17 cmaway from the sn and inclined between 60-80\cdot to the plane of the sky. onday 90, we are only seeing the illumination of approximately 5% of this torus,and expect to see an elevated ir flux from this material up until day \sim 450.it is likely this dust was created in an lbv-like mass loss event of more than3 msun, which is large but consistent with other lbv progenitors such as {\eta}carinae.

1111.6627	dust in historical galactic type ia supernova remnants with herschel	the origin of interstellar dust in galaxies is poorly understood,particularly the relative contributions from supernovae and the cool stellarwinds of low-intermediate mass stars. here, we present herschel pacs and spirephotometry at 70-500um of the historical young supernova remnants: kepler andtycho; both thought to be the remnants of type ia explosion events. we detect awarm dust component in kepler's remnant with t = 82k and mass 0.0031msun; thisis spatially coincident with thermal x-ray emission optical knots andfilaments, consistent with the warm dust originating in the circumstellarmaterial swept up by the primary blast wave of the remnant. similarly fortycho's remnant, we detect warm dust at 90k with mass 0.0086msun. comparing thespatial distribution of the warm dust with x-rays from the ejecta and swept-upmedium, and ha emission arising from the post-shock edge, we show that the warmdust is swept up interstellar material. we find no evidence of a cool (25-50 k)component of dust with mass &gt;0.07msun as observed in core-collapse remnants ofmassive stars. neither the warm or cold dust components detected here arespatially coincident with supernova ejecta material. we compare the lack ofobserved supernova dust with a theoretical model of dust formation in type iaremnants which predicts dust masses of 0.088(0.017)msun for ejecta expandinginto surrounding densities of 1(5)cm-3. the model predicts that silicon- andcarbon-rich dust grains will encounter the interior edge of the observed dustemission at 400 years confirming that the majority of the warm dust originatesfrom swept up circumstellar or interstellar grains (for kepler and tychorespectively). the lack of cold dust grains in the ejecta suggests that type iaremnants do not produce substantial quantities of iron-rich dust grains and hasimportant consequences for the 'missing' iron mass observed in ejecta.

1204.5037	herschel images of fomalhaut. an extrasolar kuiper belt at the height of  its dynamical activity	fomalhaut is a young, nearby star that is suspected to harbor an infantplanetary system, interspersed with one or more belts of dusty debris. wepresent far-infrared images obtained with the herschel space observatory withan angular resolution between 5.7 and 36.7 arcsec at wavelengths between 70 and500 micrometer. the images show the main debris belt in great detail. even athigh spatial resolution, the belt appears smooth. the region in between thebelt and the central star is not devoid of material; thermal emission isobserved here as well. also at the location of the star, excess emission isdetected.  we use a dynamical model together with radiative-transfer tools to derive theparameters of the debris disk. we include detailed models of the interaction ofthe dust grains with radiation, for both the radiation pressure and thetemperature determination. comparing these models to the spatially resolvedtemperature information contained in the images allows us to place strongconstraints on the presence of grains that will be blown out of the system byradiation pressure. we use this to derive the dynamical parameters of thesystem.  the appearance of the belt points towards a remarkably active system in whichdust grains are produced at a very high rate by a collisional cascade in anarrow region filled with dynamically excited planetesimals. dust particleswith sizes below the blow-out size are abundantly present. the equivalent of2000 one-km-sized comets are destroyed every day, out of a cometary reservoiramounting to 110 earth masses. from comparison of their scattering and thermalproperties, we find evidence that the dust grains are fluffy aggregates, whichindicates a cometary origin. the excess emission at the location of the starmay be produced by hot dust with a range of temperatures, but may also be dueto gaseous free-free emission from a stellar wind.

1209.5677	a cool dust factory in the crab nebula: a herschel study of the  filaments	whether supernovae are major sources of dust in galaxies is a long-standingdebate. we present infrared and submillimeter photometry and spectroscopy fromthe herschel space observatory of the crab nebula between 51 and 670 micron aspart of the mass loss from evolved stars program. we compare the emissiondetected with herschel with multiwavelength data including millimeter, radio,mid-infrared and archive optical images. we carefully remove the synchrotroncomponent using the herschel and planck fluxes measured in the same epoch. thecontribution from line emission is removed using herschel spectroscopy combinedwith infrared space observatory archive data. several forbidden lines ofcarbon, oxygen and nitrogen are detected where multiple velocity components areresolved, deduced to be from the nitrogen-depleted, carbon-rich ejecta. nospectral lines are detected in the spire wavebands; in the pacs bands, the linecontribution is 5% and 10% at 70 and 100 micron and negligible at 160 micron.after subtracting the synchrotron and line emission, the remaining far-infraredcontinuum can be fit with two dust components. assuming standard interstellarsilicates, the mass of the cooler component is 0.24(+0.32)(-0.08) msolar for t= 28.1(+5.5)(-3.2)k. amorphous carbon grains require 0.11 +/- 0.01 msolar ofdust with t = 33.8(+2.3)(-1.8) k. a single temperature modified-blackbody with0.14msolar and 0.08msolar for silicate and carbon dust respectively, providesan adequate fit to the far- infrared region of the spectral energy distributionbut is a poor fit at 24-500 micron. the crab nebula has condensed most of therelevant refractory elements into dust, suggesting the formation of dust incore-collapse supernova ejecta is efficient.

1210.3483	discovery of multiple dust shells beyond 1 arcmin in the circumstellar  envelope of irc+10216 using herschel/pacs	we present new herschel/pacs images at 70, 100, and 160 micron of thewell-known, nearby, carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch star irc+10216revealing multiple dust shells in its circumstellar envelope. for the firsttime, dust shells (or arcs) are detected until 320 arcsec. the almost sphericalshells are non-concentric and have an angular extent between 40 deg and 200deg. the shells have a typical width of 5 arcsec - 8 arcsec, and the shellseparation varies in the range of 10 arcsec - 35 arcsec, corresponding to500-1700 yr. local density variations within one arc are visible. theshell/intershell density contrast is typically 4, and the arcs contain some 50%more dust mass than the smooth envelope. the observed (nested) arcs record themass-loss history over the past 16 000 yr, but rayleigh-taylor andkelvin-helmholtz instabilities in the turbulent astropause and astrosheath willerase any signature of the mass-loss history for at least the first 200 000 yrof mass loss. accounting for the bowshock structure, the envelope mass aroundirc+10216 contains &gt;2msun of gas and dust mass. it is argued that the origin ofthe shells is related to non-isotropic mass-loss events and clumpy dustformation.

1211.2626	comet-like mineralogy of olivine crystals in an extrasolar proto-kuiper  belt	some planetary systems harbour debris disks containing planetesimals such asasteroids and comets. collisions between such bodies produce small dustparticles, the spectral features of which reveal their composition and, hence,that of their parent bodies. a measurement of the composition of olivinecrystals has been done for the protoplanetary disk hd100546 and for olivinecrystals in the warm inner parts of planetary systems. the latter compares wellwith the iron-rich olivine in asteroids (x&lt;0.29). in the cold outskirts of thebeta pictoris system, an analogue to the young solar system, olivine crystalswere detected but their composition remained undetermined, leaving unknown howthe composition of the bulk of solar system cometary olivine grains compareswith that of extrasolar comets. here we report the detection of the69-micrometre-wavelength band of olivine crystals in the spectrum of betapictoris. because the disk is optically thin, we can associate the crystalswith an extrasolar proto-kuiper belt a distance of 15-45 astronomical unitsfrom the star (one astronomical unit is the sun-earth distance), determinetheir magnesium-rich composition (x=0.01+/-0.001) and show that they make up3.6+/-1.0 per cent of the total dust mass. these values are strikingly similarto those for the dust emitted by the most primitive comets in the solar system,even though beta pictoris is more massive and more luminous and has a differentplanetary system architecture.

1301.1288	the lyman break analogue haro 11: spatially resolved chemodynamics with  vlt flames	using vlt/flames optical integral field unit observations, we present thefirst spatially resolved spectroscopic study of the well known blue compactgalaxy haro11, thought to be a local analogue to high redshift lyman breakgalaxies. haro11 displays complex emission line profiles, consisting of narrow(fwhm&lt;200 km/s) and broad (fwhm 200-300 km/s) components. we identify threedistinct emission knots kinematically connected to one another. achemodynamical analysis is presented, revealing that spatially resolved ionicand elemental abundances do not agree with those derived from integratedspectra across the galaxy. we conclude that this is almost certainly due to thesurface-brightness-weighting of electron temperature in integrated spectra,leading to higher derived abundances. we find that the eastern knot has a lowgas density, but a higher temperature (by ~4,000 k) and consequently an oxygenabundance ~0.4 dex lower than the neighbouring regions. a region of enhancedn/o is found specifically in knot c, confirming previous studies that foundanomalously high n/o ratios in this system. maps of the wolf-rayet feature at4686a reveal large wr populations (~900-1500 stars) in knots a and b. the lackof wr stars in knot c, combined with an age of ~7.4 myr suggest that a recentlycompleted wr phase may be responsible for the observed n/o excess. conversely,the absence of n-enriched gas and strong wr emission in knots a and b suggestswe are observing these regions at an epoch where stellar ejecta has yet to cooland mix with the ism.

1302.5430	a multiwavelength study of the magellanic-type galaxy ngc 4449 - i.  modelling the spectral energy distribution, the ionization structure and the  star formation history	[abridged] we present an integrated photometric spectral energy distribution(sed) of the magellanic-type galaxy ngc 4449 from the far-ultraviolet (uv) tothe submillimetre, including new observations acquired by the herschel spaceobservatory. we include integrated uv photometry from the swift ultraviolet andoptical telescope using a measurement technique which is appropriate forextended sources with coincidence loss. in this paper, we examine the availablemultiwavelength data to infer a range of ages, metallicities and star formationrates for the underlying stellar populations, as well as the composition andthe total mass of dust in ngc 4449.  we present an iterative scheme, which allows us to build an in-depth andmulticomponent representation of ngc 4449 `bottom-up', taking advantage of thebroad capabilities of the photoionization and radiative transfer code mocassin(monte carlo simulations of ionized nebulae). we fit the observed sed, theglobal ionization structure and the emission line intensities, and infer arecent sfr of 0.4 msolar/yr and a total stellar mass of approximately 1e9msolar emitting with a bolometric luminosity of 5.7e9 lsolar. our fits yield atotal dust mass of 2.9e6 msolar including 2 per cent attributed to polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons. we deduce a dust to gas mass ratio of 1/190 within themodelled region. while we do not consider possible additional contributionsfrom even colder dust, we note that including the extended hi envelope and themolecular gas is likely to bring the ratio down to as low as ~ 1/800.

1309.1371	revealing the cold dust in low-metallicity environments: i - photometry  analysis of the dwarf galaxy survey with herschel	we present new photometric data from our herschel key programme, the dwarfgalaxy survey (dgs), dedicated to the observation of the gas and dust in 48low-metallicity environments. they were observed with pacs and spire onboardherschel at 70,100,160,250,350, and 500 microns. we focus on a systematiccomparison of the derived fir properties (fir luminosity, dust mass, dusttemperature and emissivity index) with more metal-rich galaxies and investigatethe detection of a potential submm excess. the data reduction method is adaptedfor each galaxy to derive the most reliable photometry from the final maps.pacs flux densities are compared with the mips 70 and 160 microns bands. we usecolour-colour diagrams and modified blackbody fitting procedures to determinethe dust properties of the dgs galaxies. we also include galaxies from theherschel kingfish sample, containing more metal-rich environments, totalling109 galaxies. the location of the dgs galaxies on herschel colour-colourdiagrams highlights the differences in global environments of low-metallicitygalaxies. the dust in dgs galaxies is generally warmer than in kingfishgalaxies (t_dgs~32 k, t_kingfish~23 k). the emissivity index, beta, is ~1.7 inthe dgs, but metallicity does not make a strong effect on beta. thedust-to-stellar mass ratio is lower in low-metallicity galaxies:m_dust/m_star~0.02% for the dgs vs 0.1% for kingfish. per unit dust mass, dwarfgalaxies emit ~6 times more in the fir than higher metallicity galaxies. out ofthe 22 dgs galaxies detected at 500 micron, 41% present an excess in the submmnot explained by our dust sed model. the excess mainly appears in lowermetallicity galaxies (12+log(o/h) &lt; 8.3), and the strongest excesses aredetected in the most metal-poor galaxies. we stress the need for observationslongwards of the herschel wavelengths to detect any submm excess appearingbeyond 500 micron.

1404.2597	herschel-pacs measurements of nitrogen enrichment in nebulae around  wolf-rayet stars	for three nebulae that have early-wn wolf-rayet exciting stars, ngc 6888, wr8 and abell 48, we have obtained herschel-pacs line scans of the [n iii] 57 umand [o iii] 88 micron lines, along with the 122 and 205 micron lines of [n ii].from the former two lines we have derived n$^{2+}$/o$^{2+}$ abundance ratios,equal to the overall n/o ratio under a wide range of nebular conditions. wefind that all of the nebulae observed possess significant nitrogen enrichment,with derived n/o ratios greater than solar. the two nebulae with massivewolf-rayet exciting stars, ngc 6888 and wr8 are found to have n/o ratios thatare enhanced by factors of 7 - 10 relative to the solar n/o ratio, consistentwith an origin as material ejected just before the onset of the wolf-rayetphase. the other nebula, abell 48, has recently been reclassified as a memberof the rare class of three planetary nebulae that have early-wn central starsand are not of peimbert type i. we derive a nebular n/o ratio for it that is afactor of 4 enhanced relative to solar and slightly above the range of n/ovalues that have been measured for the other three members of its [wn]planetary nebula class.

1406.1797	a photodissociation region study of ngc 4038	we present a model of the photodissociation regions of ngc 4038, which ispart of the antennae galaxies. we have considered one-dimensional slabs ofuniform density all having a maximum $a_v=10\,{\rm mag}$, interacting withplane-parallel radiation. the density range in our simulations spans fourorders of magnitude ($100\le n\le 10^6\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$) and the uv fieldstrength spans more than three orders of magnitude ($10\le\chi\le10^{4.5}$multiples of the ${\rm draine}$ field), from which we generated a grid of about1400 simulations. we compare our results with herschel spire-fts, cso andiso-lws observations of eight co transition lines ($j=1-0$ to $8-7$) and the[ci] 609\mu m and [oi] 146\mu m fine structure lines. we find that themolecular and atomic emission lines trace different gas components of ngc 4038,thus single emission models are insufficient to reproduce the observed values.in general, low-$j$ co transition lines correspond to either low densityregions interacting with low uv field strengths, or high density regionsinteracting with high uv field strengths. higher $j$ co transition lines areless dependent on the uv field strength and are fitted by gas with density$n\sim10^{4.5}-10^{5.2}\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$. we find that the observed finestructure line ratio of [ci] 609\mu m/[oi] 146\mu m is reproduced by cloudssubject to weaker uv fields compared to the co lines. we make estimates of the$x_{\rm co}$ factor which relates the co emission with the column density ofmolecular hydrogen, and find that it is less than the canonical milky wayvalue.

1410.7386	the timing and location of dust formation in the remnant of sn 1987a	the discovery with the {\it herschel space observatory} of bright farinfrared and submm emission from the ejecta of the core collapse supernovasn\,1987a has been interpreted as indicating the presence of some0.4--0.7\,m$_\odot$ of dust. we have constructed radiative transfer models ofthe ejecta to fit optical to far-infrared observations from the literature atepochs between 615 days and 24 years after the explosion, to determine when andwhere this unexpectedly large amount of dust formed.  we find that the observations by day 1153 are consistent with the presence of3$\times$10$^{-3}$m$_\odot$ of dust. although this is a larger amount than haspreviously been considered possible at this epoch, it is still very smallcompared to the amount present in the remnant after 24 years, and significantlyhigher dust masses at the earlier epochs are firmly ruled out by theobservations, indicating that the majority of the dust must have formed at verylate times. by 8515-9200 days after the explosion, 0.6--0.8\,m$_\odot$ of dustis present, and dust grains with radii greater than 2\,$\mu$m are required toobtain a fit to the observed sed. this suggests that the dust mass increase atlate times was caused by accretion onto and coagulation of the dust grainsformed at earlier epochs.  these findings provide further confirmation that core collapse supernovae cancreate large quantities of dust, and indicate that the reason for small dustmasses being estimated in many cases is that the vast majority of the dustforms long after most supernovae have been detectable at mid-infraredwavelengths.

1411.4429	herschel imaging of the dust in the helix nebula (ngc 7293)	in our series of papers presenting the herschel imaging of evolved planetarynebulae, we present images of the dust distribution in the helix nebula (ngc7293). images at 70, 160, 250, 350, and 500 micron were obtained with the pacsand spire instruments on board the herschel satellite. the broadband maps showthe dust distribution over the main helix nebula to be clumpy and predominantlypresent in the barrel wall. we determined the spectral energy distribution ofthe main nebula in a consistent way using herschel, iras, and planck fluxvalues. the emissivity index of 0.99 +/- 0.09, in combination with the carbonrich molecular chemistry of the nebula, indicates that the dust consists mainlyof amorphous carbon. the dust excess emission from the central star disk isdetected at 70 micron and the flux measurement agree with previous measurement.we present the temperature and dust column density maps. the total dust massacross the helix nebula (without its halo) is determined to be 0.0035 solarmass at a distance of 216 pc. the temperature map shows dust temperaturesbetween 22 and 42 k, which is similar to the kinetic temperature of themolecular gas, strengthening the fact that the dust and gas co-exist in highdensity clumps. archived images are used to compare the location of the dustemission in the far infrared (herschel) with the ionized (galex, hbeta) andmolecular hydrogen component. the different emission components are consistentwith the helix consisting of a thick walled barrel-like structure inclined tothe line of sight. the radiation field decreases rapidly through the barrelwall.

1411.7381	a stubbornly large mass of cold dust in the ejecta of supernova 1987a	we present new herschel photometric and spectroscopic observations ofsupernova 1987a, carried out in 2012. our dedicated photometric measurementsprovide new 70 micron data and improved imaging quality at 100 and 160 microncompared to previous observations in 2010. our herschel spectra show only weakco line emission, and provide an upper limit for the 63 micron [o i] line flux,eliminating the possibility that line contaminations distort the previouslyestimated dust mass. the far-infrared spectral energy distribution (sed) iswell fitted by thermal emission from cold dust. the newly measured 70 micronflux constrains the dust temperature, limiting it to nearly a singletemperature. the far-infrared emission can be fitted by 0.5+-0.1 msun ofamorphous carbon, about a factor of two larger than the current nucleosyntheticmass prediction for carbon. the observation of sio molecules at early and latephases suggests that silicates may also have formed and we could fit the sedwith a combination of 0.3 msun of amorphous carbon and 0.5 msun of silicates,totalling 0.8 msun of dust. our analysis thus supports the presence of a largedust reservoir in the ejecta of sn 1987a. the inferred dust mass suggests thatsupernovae can be an important source of dust in the interstellar medium, fromlocal to high-redshift galaxies.

1501.01510	the dust and gas content of the crab nebula	we have constructed mocassin photoionization plus dust radiative transfermodels for the crab nebula core-collapse supernova (ccsn) remnant, using eithersmooth or clumped mass distributions, in order to determine the chemicalcomposition and masses of the nebular gas and dust. we computed models forseveral different geometries suggested for the nebular matter distribution butfound that the observed gas and dust spectra are relatively insensitive tothese geometries, being determined mainly by the spectrum of the pulsar windnebula which ionizes and heats the nebula. smooth distribution models are ruledout since they require 16-49 msun of gas to fit the integrated optical nebularline fluxes, whereas our clumped models re quire 7.0 msun of gas. a globalgas-phase c/o ratio of 1.65 by number is derived, along with a he/h numberratio of 1.85, neither of which can be matched by current ccsn yieldpredictions. a carbonaceous dust composition is favoured by the observedgas-phase c/o ratio: amorphous carbon clumped model fits to the crab's herscheland spitzer infrared spectral energy distribution imply the presence of0.18-0.27 msun of dust, corresponding to a gas to dust mass ratio of 26-39.mixed dust chemistry models can also be accommodated, comprising 0.11-0.13 msunof amorphous carbon and 0.39-0.47 msun of silicates. power-law grain sizedistributions with mass distributions that are weighted towards the largestgrain radii are derived, favouring their longer-term survival when theyeventually interact with the interstellar medium. the total mass of gas plusdust in the crab nebula is 7.2 +/- 0.5 msun, consistent with a progenitor starmass of 9 msun.

1505.05750	herschel observations of extreme oh/ir stars - the isotopic ratios of  oxygen as a sign-post for the stellar mass	aim: the late stages of stellar evolution are mainly governed by the mass ofthe stars. low- and intermediate-mass stars lose copious amounts of mass duringthe asymptotic giant branch (agb) which obscure the central star making itdifficult to study the stellar spectra and determine the stellar mass. in thisstudy, we present observational data that can be used to determine lower limitsto the stellar mass. method: spectra of nine heavily reddened agb stars takenby the herschel space observatory display numerous molecular emission lines.the strongest emission lines are due to h2o. we search for the presence ofisotopologues of h2o in these objects. result: we detected the 16o and 17oisotopologues of water in these stars, but lines due to h2^{18}o are absent.the lack of 18o is predicted by a scenario where the star has undergonehot-bottom burning which preferentially destroys 18o relative to 16o and 17o.from stellar evolution calculations, this process is thought to occur when thestellar mass is above 5 msun for solar metallicity. hence, observations ofdifferent isotopologues of h2o can be used to help determine the lower limit tothe initial stellar mass. conclusion: from our observations, we deduce thatthese extreme oh/ir stars are intermediate-mass stars with masses of &gt;= 5 msun.their high mass-loss rates of ~ 1.0e-4 msun/yr may affect the enrichment of theinterstellar medium and the overall chemical evolution of our galaxy.

1509.00858	modelling supernova line profile asymmetries to determine ejecta dust  masses: sn 1987a from days 714 to 3604	the late time optical and near-ir line profiles of many core-collapsesupernovae exhibit a red-blue asymmetry as a result of greater extinction byinternal dust of radiation emitted from the receding parts of the supernovaejecta. we present here a new code, damocles, that models the effects of duston the line profiles of core-collapse supernovae in order to determine themasses of newly formed dust. as noted by lucy et al. (1989), the presence of anextended red scattering wing in late-time line profiles can also indicate dustformation. we find that dust-affected line profiles need not necessarily beflux-biased towards to the blue, although the profile peak will always beblue-shifted. we have collated optical spectra of sn 1987a from a variety ofarchival sources and have modelled the evolution of the h$\alpha$ line fromdays 714 to 3604, as well as that of the [oi] 6300,6363a doublet between days714 and 1478. a variety of evidence points to the presence of clumping and wefind that our clumped dust models require significantly higher dust masses thansmoothly distributed dust models. our line profile fits imply day 714 dustmasses of &lt;3 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$ m$_{\odot}$ for all grain types apart from veryhigh albedo pure magnesium silicates, for which up to 0.07m$_{\odot}$ can beaccommodated. large grain radii (&gt;0.6$\mu$m) are generally required to fit theline profiles even at the earlier epochs. we find that a large dust mass(&gt;0.1m$_{\odot}$) had formed by day 3604 and infer that the majority of thepresent dust mass must have formed after this epoch. our findings agree withrecent estimates from sed fits for the dust mass evolution of sn 1987a andsupport the inference that the majority of sn 1987a's dust formed many yearsafter the initial explosion.

astro-ph;0201303	crystalline silicate dust around evolved stars i. the sample stars	this is the first paper in a series of three where we present the firstcomprehensive inventory of solid state emission bands observed in a sample of17 oxygen-rich circumstellar dust shells surrounding evolved stars. the datawere taken with the short and long wavelength spectrographs on board of theinfrared space observatory (iso) and cover the 2.4 to 195 micron wavelengthrange. the spectra show the presence of broad 10 and 18 micron bands that canbe attributed to amorphous silicates. in addition, at least 49 narrow bands arefound whose position and width indicate they can be attributed to crystallinesilicates. almost all of these bands were not known before iso. we havemeasured the peak positions, widths and strengths of the individual, continuumsubtracted bands. based on these measurements, we were able to order thespectra in sequence of decreasing crystalline silicate band strength. we foundthat the strength of the emission bands correlates with the geometry of thecircumstellar shell, as derived from direct imaging or inferred from the shapeof the spectral energy distribution. this naturally divides the sample intoobjects that show a disk-like geometry (strong crystalline silicate bands), andobjects whose dust shell is characteristic of an outflow (weak crystallinesilicate bands). all stars with the 33.6 micron forsterite band stronger than20 percent over continuum are disk sources. we define spectral regions (calledcomplexes) where a concentration of emission bands is evident, at 10, 18, 23,28, 33, 40 and 60 micron. we derive average shapes for these complexes andcompare these to the individual band shapes of the programme stars.

astro-ph;0209378	mocassin: a fully three-dimensional monte carlo photoionization code	the study of photoionized environments is fundamental to many astrophysicalproblems. up to the present most photoionization codes have numerically solvedthe equations of radiative transfer by making the extreme simplifyingassumption of spherical symmetry. unfortunately very few real astronomicalnebulae satisfy this requirement. to remedy these shortcomings, aself-consistent, three-dimensional radiative transfer code has been developedusing monte carlo techniques. the code, mocassin, is designed to buildrealistic models of photoionized nebulae having arbitraries geometry anddensity distributions with both the stellar and diffuse radiation fieldstreated self-consistently. in addition, the code is capable of tretating on ormore exciting stars located at non-central locations. the gaseous region isapproximated by a cuboidal cartesian grid composed of numerous cells. thephysical conditions within each grid cell are determined by solving the thermalequilibrium and ionization balance equations this requires a knowledge of thelocal primary and secondary radiation fields, which are calculatedself-consistently by locally simulating the individual processes of ionizationand recombination. the main structure and computational methods used in themocassin code are described in this paper. mocassin has been benchmarkedagainst established one-dimensional spherically symmetric codes for a number ofstandard cases, as defined by the lexington/meudon photoionization workshops(pequignot et al., 1986; ferland et al., 1995; pequignot et al.,2001)\citep{pequignot86,ferland95, pequignot01}. the results obtained for thebenchmark cases are satisfactory and are presented in this paper. a performanceanalysis has also been carried out and is discussed here.

astro-ph;0209417	three-dimensional photoionization modelling of the planetary nebula ngc  3918	the three-dimensional monte carlo photoionization code mocassin has beenapplied to construct a realistic model of the planetary nebula ngc 3918. threedifferent geometric models were tried.  the effects of the interaction of the diffuse fields coming from two adjacentregions of different densities were investigated. these are found to benon-negligible, even for the relatively uncomplicated case of a biconicalgeometry. we found that the ionization structure of low ionization species nearthe boundaries is particularly affected.  it is found that all three models provided acceptable matches to theintegrated nebular optical and ultraviolet spectrum. large discrepancies werefound between all of the model predictions of infrared fine-structure linefluxes and iso sws measurements. this was found to be largely due to an offsetof ~14 arcsec from the centre of the nebula that affected all of the isoobservations of ngc 3918.  for each model, we also produced projected emission-line maps andposition-velocity diagrams from synthetic long-slit spectra, which could becompared to recent hst images and ground-based long-slit echelle spectra. thiscomparison showed that spindle-like model b provided the best match to theobservations. we have therefore shown that although the integrated emissionline spectrum of ngc 3918 can be reproduced by all three of thethree-dimensional models investigated in this work, the capability of creatingprojected emission-line maps and position-velocity diagrams from syntheticlong-slit spectra was crucial in allowing us to constrain the structure of thisobject.

astro-ph;0209534	heavy elements in galactic and magellanic cloud hii regions:  recombination-line versus forbidden-line abundances	we have obtained deep optical, long-slit spectrophotometry of the galactichii regions m 17, ngc 3576 and of the magellanic cloud hii regions 30 doradus,lmc n11b and smc n66, recording the optical recombination lines (orls) of cii,nii and oii. temperature-insensitive orl c2+/o2+ and n2+/o2 ratios are obtainedfor all nebulae except smc n66. the orl c2+/o2+ ratios show remarkableagreement within each galactic system, while also being in agreement with thecorresponding cel ratios. for all five nebulae, the o2+/h+ abundance derivedfrom multiple oii orls is found to be higher than the corresponding valuederived from the strong [oiii] 4959, 5007a cels, by factors of 1.8--2.7 forfour of the nebulae. the lmc n11b nebula exhibits a more extreme discrepancyfactor for the o2+ ion, ~5. thus these hii regions exhibit orl/cel abundancediscrepancy factors that are similar to those previously encountered amongstplanetary nebulae.  our optical cel o2+/h+ abundances agree to within 20-30 per cent withpublished o2+/h+ abundances that were obtained from observations of infraredfine-structure lines. since the low excitation energies of the latter make theminsensitive to variations about typical nebular temperatures, fluctuations intemperature are ruled out as the cause of the observed orl/cel o2+ abundancediscrepancies. we present evidence that the observed oii orls from these hiiregions originate from gas of very similar density (&lt;3500 cm-3) to thatemitting the observed heavy-element optical and infrared cels, ruling outmodels that employ high-density ionized inclusions in order to explain theabundance discrepancy. we consider a scenario whereby much of the heavy-elementorl emission originates from cold (&lt;=500 k) metal-rich ionized regions.

astro-ph;0301119	physical conditions in the planetary nebula abell 30	we have analysed optical spectra of two of the hydrogen-deficient knots (j1 &amp;j3) in the born-again planetary nebula abell 30, together with uv spectra ofknots j3 &amp; j4. we determine electron temperatures in the knots based on severaldiagnostics. the [o iii] nebular-to-auroral transition ratio yieldstemperatures of the order of 17 000 k. the weak temperature dependence of theratios of helium lines at 4471, 5876 and 6678 angstroms is used to derive atemperature of 8850 k for knot j3 and 4600 k for knot j1. ratios of o iirecombination lines, which directly measure the temperature in the coldestregions of the knots, are used to derive temperatures of 2500 k for knot j3,and just 500 k for knot j1.  we calculate abundances both from collisionally excited lines and from thewell-observed recombination spectra of c, n, o and ne ions. the forbidden lineabundances agree well with previous determinations, but the recombination lineabundances are several hundred times higher. these results confirm the scenarioproposed by harrington and feibelman (1984) in which the knots contain a coldcore highly enriched in heavy elements. forbidden lines are almost entirelyemitted by the hot outer part of the knot, while recombination lines areemitted predominantly from the cold core. the c/o ratios we derive imply thatthe knots are oxygen-rich, contrary to theoretical predictions for born-againnebulae (iben et al 1983).

astro-ph;0305469	a deep survey of heavy element lines in planetary nebulae - i.  observations and forbidden-line densities, temperatures and abundances	we present spectrophotometry of 12 galactic and 3 magellanic cloud planetarynebulae (pne). nine of the galactic pne were observed by scanning the slitacross the pn. we use the fluxes of collisionally excited lines (cels) toderive electron densities (d's) and temperatures (t's), and ionic abundances.we find that the d's derived from optical cel ratios are systematically higherthan those derived from the ratios of the ir fine-structure (fs) lines of[oiii], indicating the presence of significant density variations within thepne. we also compare t's obtained from the ratio of optical nebular to auroral[oiii] lines with those obtained from the ratio of [oiii] optical to ir fslines. we find that when the latter are derived using d's based on the [oiii]52um/88um ratio, they yield values that are significantly higher than theoptical [oiii] t's. contrasting this, [oiii] optical/ir t's derived using thehigher d's obtained from [cliii] 5517a/5537a ratios show much closer agreementwith optical [oiii] t's, implying that the observed [oiii] optical/ir ratiosare significantly weighted by d's in excess of the critical densities of both[oiii] fs lines. consistent with this, ionic abundances derived from [oiii] and[niii] fs lines using d's from optical cels show much better agreement withabundances derived for the same ions from optical and uv cels than doabundances derived from the fs lines using the lower d's obtained from the52um/88um ratios. the behaviour of t's obtained making use of the t-insensitiveir fs lines provides no support for significant t-fluctuations within the pnethat could be responsible for derived balmer jump t's being lower than thoseobtained from the much more t-sensitive [oiii] optical lines.

astro-ph;0306230	three-dimensional photoionisation modelling of the hydrogen-deficient  knots in the planetary nebula abell 30	we have constructed a photoionization model, using the 3-d monte carlo codemocassin for one of the hydrogen-deficient knots (j3) of the born-againplanetary nebula abell 30. the model consists of spherical knots, comprising acold, dense, hydrogen-deficient core with very high metal abundances. the innercore is surrounded by a less dense hydrogen-deficient and metal-enriched gasenvelope, with less extreme abundances. the envelope of the knot might havebeen formed by the mixing of the knot material with the surrounding nebulargas. this bi-chemistry, bi-density model did not produce enough heating tomatch the fluxes of the collisionally excited emission lines (cels) and of theoptical recombination lines (orls) observed in the spectrum of the knot. wetherefore included heating by photoelectric emission from dust grains in thethermal equilibrium calculations, and found that dust-to-gas ratios of 0.077and 0.107 by mass for the central core and the envelope of the knot,respectively, are sufficient to fit the spectrum. surprisingly, photoelectricemission from grains is the dominant source of heating in the hot envelope ofthe knot, while heating by photoionization of helium and heavy elementsdominates in the cold core. the chemical abundances inferred from our modellingindicate, in agreement with the empirical analysis of wesson et al. (2003),that the c/o ratio in the two regions of the knot is less than unity, contraryto theoretical predictions for born-again nebulae.

astro-ph;0404280	a deep survey of heavy element lines in planetary nebulae -- ii.  recombination line abundances and evidence for ultra-cold plasma	[abridged] deep optical observations of the spectra of 12 galactic planetarynebulae (pne) and 3 magellanic cloud pne were presented in paper i by tsamis etal. (2003b), who carried out an abundance analysis using the collisionallyexcited forbidden lines. here, the relative intensities of faint opticalrecombination lines (orls) from ions of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen areanalysed in order to derive the abundances of these ions relative to hydrogen.we define an abundance discrepancy factor (adf) as the ratio of the abundancederived for a heavy element ion from its recombination lines to that derivedfor the same ion from its ultraviolet, optical or infrared collisionallyexcited lines (cels). all of the pne in our sample are found to have adf's thatexceed unity. there is no dependence of the magnitude of the adf upon theexcitation energy of the uv, optical or ir cel transition used, indicating thatclassical nebular temperature fluctuations--i.e. in a chemically homogeneousmedium--are not the cause of the observed abundance discrepancies. instead, weconclude that the main cause of the discrepancy is enhanced orl emission fromcold ionized gas located in hydrogen-deficient clumps inside the main body ofthe nebulae. we have developed a new electron temperature diagnostic, basedupon the relative intensities of the oii 4f-3d 4089a and 3p-3s 4649arecombination transitions. for six out of eight pne for which both transitionsare detected, we derive o2+ orl electron temperatures of &lt;300 k, very much lessthan the o2+ forbidden-line and balmer jump temperatures derived for the samenebulae. these results provide direct observational evidence for the presenceof h-deficient, cold plasma regions within the nebulae, consistent with gascooled largely by infrared fine structure and recombination transitions.

astro-ph;0407230	observations and 3d photoionisation modelling of the wolf-rayet  planetary nebula ngc 1501	deep optical spectra of the high excitation planetary nebula ngc 1501 and itsw04 central star are presented. a recombination line abundance analysis of thecentral star's emission-line spectrum yields he:c:o mass fractions of0.36:0.48:0.16, similar to those of pg1159 stars. a detailed empirical analysisof the nebular collisionally excited line (cel) and optical recombination line(orl) spectrum is presented, together with fully three-dimensionalphotoionisation modelling of the nebula. we found very large orl-cel abundancediscrepancy factors (adfs) for o^2+ (32) and ne^2+ (33). the mean value of5100k for the t_e derived from hei recombination lines ratios is 6000k lowerthan the value of 11100k implied by the [oiii] line ratio.  a three-dimensional photoionisation model of ngc 1501 was constructed usingthe photoionisation code mocassin, based on our new spectroscopic data andusing the three-dimensional electron density distribution determined fromlong-slit echellograms of the nebula by ragazzoni et al. (2001). the initialmodels showed higher degrees of ionisation of heavy elements than indicated byobservations. we investigated the importance of the missing low-temperaturedielectronic recombination rates for third-row elements and have estimatedupper limits to their rate coefficients.  our model heavily under-predicts the optical recombination line emission. weconclude that the presence of a hydrogen-deficient, metal-rich component isnecessary to explain the observed orl spectrum of this object. the existence ofsuch knots could also provide a softening of the radiation field, via theremoval of ionising photons by absorption in the knots, thereby helping toalleviate the over-ionisation of the heavy elements in our models.

astro-ph;0408040	a reexamination of electron density diagnostics for ionized gaseous  nebulae	we present a comparison of electron densities derived from optical forbiddenline diagnostic ratios for a sample of over a hundred nebulae. we consider fourdensity indicators, the [o ii] $\lambda3729/\lambda3726$, [s ii]$\lambda6716/\lambda6731$, [cl iii] $\lambda5517/\lambda5537$ and [ar iv]$\lambda4711/\lambda4740$ doublet ratios. except for a few h ii regions forwhich data from the literature were used, diagnostic line ratios were derivedfrom our own high quality spectra. for the [o ii] doublet ratio, we find thatour default atomic data set, consisting of transition probabilities (aij) fromzeippen (1982} and collision strengths from pradhan (1976), fit theobservations well, although at high electron densities, the [o ii]doublet ratioyields densities systematically lower than those given by the [s ii] doubletratio, suggesting that the ratio of aij of the [o ii]doublet,$a(\lambda3729)/a(\lambda3726)$, given by zeippen (1982) may need to berevised upwards by ~6%. our analysis also shows that the more recentcalculations of [o ii] a value by zeippen (1987a) and collision strengths bymclaughlin &amp; bell (1998) are inconsistent with the observations at the high andlow density limits, respectively, and can therefore be ruled out. we confirmthe earlier result of copetti &amp; writzl (2002) that the [o ii] a valuescalculated by wiese et al. (1996) yield electron densities systematically lowerthan those deduced from the [s ii] doublet ratio and that the discrepancy ismost likely caused by errors in the a values calculated by wiese et al. usingour default atomic data set for [\ion{o}{ii}], we find that $n_{\rme}([\ion{o}{ii}]) \la n_{\rm e}([\ion{s}{ii}]) \approx n_{\rme}([\ion{cl}{iii}])&lt; n_{\rm e}([\ion{ar} {iv}])$.

astro-ph;0605342	three-dimensional ionisation, dust rt and chemical modelling of  planetary nebulae	the assumption of spherical symmetry is not justified for the vast majorityof pne. the interpretation of spatially-resolved observations cannot relysolely on the application of 1d codes, which may yield incorrect abundancesdeterminations resulting in misleading conclusions. the 3d photoionisation codemocassin (monte caarlo simulations of ionised nebulae) is designed to remedythese shortcomings. the 3d transfer of both primary and secondary radiation istreated self-consistently without the need of approximations. the code wasbenchmarked and has been applied to the study of several pne. the currentversion includes a fully self-consistent radiative transfer treatment for dustgrains mixed within the gas, taking into account the microphysics of dust-gasinteractions within the geometry-independent monte carlo transfer. the new codeprovides an excellent tool for the self-consistent analysis of dusty ionisedregions showing asymmetries and/or density and chemical inhomogeneities. workis currently in progress to incorporate the processes that dominate the thermalbalance of photo-dissociation regions (pdrs), as well as the formation anddestruction processes for all the main molecular species.

astro-ph;9803342	atomic and molecular interstellar absorption lines toward the high  galactic latitude stars hd~141569 and hd~157841 at ultra-high resolution	we present ultra-high resolution (0.32 km/s) spectra obtained with the 3.9manglo-australian telescope (aat) and ultra-high-resolution facility (uhrf), ofinterstellar nai d1, d2, ca ii k, k i and ch absorption toward two highgalactic latitude stars hd141569 and hd157841. we have compared our data with21-cm observations obtained from the leiden/dwingeloo hi survey. we derive thevelocity structure, column densities of the clouds represented by the variouscomponents and identify the clouds with ism structures seen in the region atother wavelengths. we further derive abundances, linear depletions and h2fractional abundances for these clouds, wherever possible. toward hd141569, wedetect two components in our uhrf spectra : a weak, broad component at - 15km/s, seen only in caii k absorption and another component at 0 km/s, seen innai d1, d2, ca ii k, ki and ch absorption. in the case of the hd157841sightline, a total of 6 components are seen on our uhrf spectra in nai d1, d2ca ii k, k i and ch absorption. 2 of these 6 components are seen only in asingle species.

astro-ph;9806389	hubble space telescope images of magellanic cloud planetary nebulae:  data and correlations across morphological classes	the morphology of planetary nebulae (pne) provides an essential tool forunderstanding their origin and evolution, as it reflects both the dynamics ofthe gas ejected during the tp-agb phase, and the central star energetics. herewe study the morphology of 27 magellanic cloud planetary nebulae (mcpne) andpresent an analysis of their physical characteristics across morphologicalclasses. similar studies have been successfully carried out for galactic pne,but were compromised by the uncertainty of individual pn distances. we presentour own hst/foc images of 15 magellanic cloud pne (mcpne) acquired through anarrow-band lambda 5007 [o iii] filter. we use the richardson-lucydeconvolution technique on these pre-costar images to achieve post-costarquality. three pne imaged before and after costar confirm the high reliabilityof our deconvolution procedure. we derive morphological classes, dimensions,and surface photometry for all these pne. we have combined this sample withhst/pc1 images of 15 mcpne, three of which are in common with the foc set,acquired by dopita et al. (1996), to obtain the largest mcpn sample everexamined from the morphological viewpoint. by using the whole database,supplemented with published data from the literature, we have analyzed theproperties of the mcpne and compared them to a typical, complete galacticsample. morphology of the mcpne is then correlated with pn density, chemistry,and evolution.

astro-ph;9901119	the sic problem: astronomical and meteoritic evidence	pre-solar grains of silicon carbide found in meteorites and interpreted ashaving had an origin around carbon stars from their isotopic composition, haveall been found to be of the beta-sic polytype. yet to date fits to the 11.3microns sic emission band of carbon stars had been obtained only for alpha-sicgrains. we present thin film infrared (ir) absorption spectra measured in adiamond anvil cell for both the alpha- and beta- polymorphs of synthetic sicand compare the results with previously published spectra taken using the kbrmatrix method. we find that our thin film spectra have positions nearlyidentical to those obtained previously from finely ground samples in kbr.hence, we show that this discrepancy has arisen from inappropriate `kbrcorrections' having been made to laboratory spectra of sic particles dispersedin kbr matrices. we re-fit a sample of carbon star mid-ir spectra, usinglaboratory data with no kbr correction applied, and show that beta-sic grainsfit the observations, while alpha-sic grains do not. the discrepancy betweenmeteoritic and astronomical identifications of the sic-type is thereforeremoved. this work shows that the diamond anvil cell thin film method can beused to produce mineral spectra applicable to cosmic environments withoutfurther manipulation.

astro-ph;9910368	2.4 - 197 micron spectroscopy of oh/ir stars: the ir characteristics of  circumstellar dust in o-rich environments	infrared spectra of a number of evolved o-rich stars have been obtained withthe short- and long- wavelength spectrometers on board the infrared spaceobservatory. the very broad wavelength coverage (2.4-197 micron) obtained bycombining observations made with the two spectrometers includes practically allof the flux emitted by the sources, and allows us to determine the emission andabsorption features of the dense circumstellar dust shells. agreement betweenthe fluxes obtained by the two instruments is generally very good; the largestdiscrepancies are probably due to source variability. our sample of oxygen-richagb stars exhibits a wealth of spectral features due to crystalline silicatesand crystalline water ice in emission and absorption. in this study aqualitative overview of all features due to crystalline silicates and water icein these high mass loss rate objects is presented. it seems that there is acertain onset value for the mass loss rate above which these features appear inthe spectrum. moreover, crystalline silicate emission features have beendetected for the first time at wavelengths where the amorphous silicates arestill in absorption, implying different spatial distributions for the twomaterials. a spherically symmetric and an axi-symmetric geometry are proposed.

0810.0401	a planetary nebula around nova v458 vul undergoing flash ionization	nova v458 vul erupted on 2007 august 8th and reached a visual magnitude of8.1 a few days later. h$\alpha$ images obtained six weeks before the outburstas part of the iphas galactic plane survey reveal an 18th magnitude progenitorsurrounded by an extended nebula. subsequent images and spectroscopy of thenebula reveal an inner nebular knot increasing rapidly in brightness due toflash ionization by the nova event. we derive a distance of 13 kpc based onlight travel time considerations, which is supported by two other distanceestimation methods. the nebula has an ionized mass of 0.2 m$_{\odot}$ and a lowexpansion velocity: this rules it out as ejecta from a previous nova eruption,and is consistent with it being a ~14,000 year old planetary nebula, probablythe product of a prior common envelope (ce) phase of evolution of the binarysystem. the large derived distance means that the mass of the erupting wdcomponent of the binary is high. we identify two possible evolutionaryscenarios, in at least one of which the system is massive enough to produce atype ia supernova on merging.
