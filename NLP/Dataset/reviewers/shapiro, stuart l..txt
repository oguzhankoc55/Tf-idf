0901.4399	testing gravitational-wave searches with numerical relativity waveforms:  results from the first numerical injection analysis (ninja) project	the numerical injection analysis (ninja) project is a collaborative effortbetween members of the numerical relativity and gravitational-wave dataanalysis communities. the purpose of ninja is to study the sensitivity ofexisting gravitational-wave search algorithms using numerically generatedwaveforms and to foster closer collaboration between the numerical relativityand data analysis communities. we describe the results of the first ninjaanalysis which focused on gravitational waveforms from binary black holecoalescence. ten numerical relativity groups contributed numerical data whichwere used to generate a set of gravitational-wave signals. these signals wereinjected into a simulated data set, designed to mimic the response of theinitial ligo and virgo gravitational-wave detectors. nine groups analysed thisdata using search and parameter-estimation pipelines. matched filteralgorithms, un-modelled-burst searches and bayesian parameter-estimation andmodel-selection algorithms were applied to the data. we report the efficiencyof these search methods in detecting the numerical waveforms and measuringtheir parameters. we describe preliminary comparisons between the differentsearch methods and suggest improvements for future ninja analyses.

0706.2360	magnetorotational collapse of very massive stars to black holes in full  general relativity	we perform axisymmetric simulations of the magnetorotational collapse of verymassive stars in full general relativity. our simulations are applicable to thecollapse of supermassive stars (m &gt; 10^3m_sun) and to very massive pop iiistars. we model our initial configurations by n=3 polytropes. the ratio ofmagnetic to rotational kinetic energy in these configurations is chosen to besmall (1% and 10%). we find that such magnetic fields do not affect the initialcollapse significantly. the core collapses to a black hole, after which blackhole excision is employed to continue the evolution long enough for the hole toreach a quasi-stationary state. we find that the black hole mass is m_h = 0.95mand its spin parameter is j_h/m_h^2 = 0.7, with the remaining matter forming atorus around the black hole. we freeze the spacetime metric ("cowlingapproximation") and continue to follow the evolution of the torus after theblack hole has relaxed to quasi-stationary equilibrium. in the absence ofmagnetic fields, the torus settles down following ejection of a small amount ofmatter due to shock heating. when magnetic fields are present, the field linesgradually collimate along the hole's rotation axis. mhd shocks and the mrigenerate mhd turbulence in the torus and stochastic accretion onto the centralblack hole. when the magnetic field is strong, a wind is generated in thetorus, and the torus undergoes radial oscillations that drive episodicaccretion onto the hole. these oscillations produce long-wavelengthgravitational waves potentially detectable by lisa. the final state of themagnetorotational collapse always consists of a central black hole surroundedby a collimated magnetic field and a hot, thick accretion torus. this system isa viable candidate for the central engine of a long-soft gamma-ray burst.

0910.5719	merger of white dwarf-neutron star binaries: prelude to hydrodynamic  simulations in general relativity	white dwarf-neutron star binaries generate detectable gravitationalradiation. we construct newtonian equilibrium models of corotational whitedwarf-neutron star (wdns) binaries in circular orbit and find that these modelsterminate at the roche limit. at this point the binary will undergo eitherstable mass transfer (smt) and evolve on a secular time scale, or unstable masstransfer (umt), which results in the tidal disruption of the wd. the path agiven binary will follow depends primarily on its mass ratio. we analyze thefate of known wdns binaries and use population synthesis results to estimatethe number of lisa-resolved galactic binaries that will undergo either smt orumt. we model the quasistationary smt epoch by solving a set of simple ordinarydifferential equations and compute the corresponding gravitational waveforms.finally, we discuss in general terms the possible fate of binaries that undergoumt and construct approximate newtonian equilibrium configurations of mergedwdns remnants. we use these configurations to assess plausible outcomes of ourfuture, fully relativistic simulations of these systems. if sufficient wddebris lands on the ns, the remnant may collapse, whereby the gravitationalwaves from the inspiral, merger, and collapse phases will sweep from lisathrough ligo frequency bands. if the debris forms a disk about the ns, it mayfragment and form planets.

0912.2096	binary black hole mergers in gaseous environments: "binary bondi" and  "binary bondi-hoyle-lyttleton" accretion	merging supermassive black hole-black hole (bhbh) binaries produced in galaxymergers are promising sources of detectable gravitational waves. if such amerger takes place in a gaseous environment, there is a possibility of asimultaneous detection of electromagnetic and gravitational radiation, as thestirring, shock heating and accretion of the gas may produce variability andenhancements in the electromagnetic flux. such a simultaneous detection canprovide a wealth of opportunities to study gravitational physics, accretionphysics, and cosmology. we investigate this scenario by performing fullygeneral relativistic, hydrodynamic simulations of merging, equal-mass,nonspinning bhbh binaries embedded in gas clouds. we evolve the metric usingthe bssn formulation with standard moving puncture gauge conditions and handlethe hydrodynamics via a high-resolution shock-capturing (hrsc) scheme. weconsider both "binary bondi accretion" in which the binary is at rest relativeto the ambient gas cloud, as well as "binary bondi-hoyle-lyttleton accretion"in which the binary moves relative to the gas cloud. the gas cloud is assumedto be homogeneous far from the binary and governed by a \gamma-law equation ofstate. we vary \gamma between 4/3 and 5/3. for each simulation, we compute thegas flow and accretion rate and estimate the electromagnetic luminosity due tobremsstrahlung and synchrotron emission. we find evidence for significantenhancements in both the accretion rate and luminosity over values for a singleblack hole of the same mass as the binary. we estimate that this luminosityenhancement should be detectable by lsst for a 10^6 m_sun binary in a hot gascloud of density n~10/cm^3 and temperature t~10^6 k at z=1, reaching a maximumof l~3x10^43 erg/s, with the emission peaking in the visible band.

0912.2345	filling the disk hollow following binary black hole merger: the  transient accretion afterglow	tidal torques from a binary black hole (bhbh) empty out the central regionsin any circumbinary gaseous accretion disk. the balance between tidal torquesand viscosity maintain the inner edge of the disk at a radius r ~ 1.5a -- 2a,where a is the binary semimajor axis. eventually, the inspiraling binarydecouples from disk and merges, leaving behind a central hollow ("donut hole")in the disk orbiting the remnant black hole. we present a simple,time-dependent, newtonian calculation that follows the secular (viscous)evolution of the disk as it fills up the hollow down to the black holeinnermost stable circular orbit and then relaxes to stationary equilibrium. weuse our model to calculate the electromagnetic radiation ("afterglow") spectrumemitted during this transient accretion epoch. observing the temporal increasein the total electromagnetic flux and the hardening of the spectrum as thedonut hole fills may help confirm a bhbh merger detected by a gravitationalwave interferometer. we show how the very existence of the initial hollow canlead to super-eddington accretion during this secular phase if the rate is notvery far below eddington prior to decoupling. our model, though highlyidealized, may be useful in establishing some of the key parameters, thermalemission features and scalings that characterize this transient. it can serveas a guide in the design and calibration of futureradiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations in general relativity.

1009.4932	head-on collisions of binary white dwarf--neutron stars: simulations in  full general relativity	we simulate head-on collisions from rest at large separation of binary whitedwarf -- neutron stars (wdnss) in full general relativity. our study serves asa prelude to our analysis of the circular binary wdns problem. we focus oncompact binaries whose total mass exceeds the maximum mass that a colddegenerate star can support, and our goal is to determine the fate of suchsystems. a fully general relativistic hydrodynamic computation of a realisticwdns head-on collision is prohibitive due to the large range of dynamical timescales and length scales involved. for this reason, we construct an equation ofstate (eos) which captures the main physical features of nss while, at the sametime, scales down the size of wds. we call these scaled-down wd models"pseudo-wds (pwds)". using pwds, we can study these systems via a sequence ofsimulations where the size of the pwd gradually increases toward the realisticcase. we perform two sets of simulations; one set studies the effects of the nsmass on the final outcome, when the pwd is kept fixed. the other set studiesthe effect of the pwd compaction on the final outcome, when the pwd mass andthe ns are kept fixed. all simulations show that 14%-18% of the initial totalrest mass escapes to infinity. all remnant masses still exceed the maximum restmass that our cold eos can support (1.92 solar masses), but no case leads toprompt collapse to a black hole. this outcome arises because the finalconfigurations are hot. all cases settle into spherical, quasiequilibriumconfigurations consisting of a cold ns core surrounded by a hot mantle,resembling thorne-zytkow objects. extrapolating our results to realistic wdcompactions, we predict that the likely outcome of a head-on collision of arealistic, massive wdns system will be the formation of a quasiequilibriumthorne-zytkow-like object.

1011.0002	accretion disks around binary black holes: a quasistationary model	tidal torques acting on a gaseous accretion disk around a binary black holecan create a gap in the disk near the orbital radius. at late times, when thebinary inspiral timescale due to gravitational wave emission becomes shorterthan the viscous timescale in the disk, the binary decouples from the disk andeventually merges. prior to decoupling the balance between tidal and viscoustorques drives the disk to a quasistationary equilibrium state, perturbedslightly by small amplitude, spiral density waves emanating from the edges ofthe gap. we consider a black hole binary with a companion of smaller mass andconstruct a simple newtonian model for a geometrically thin, keplerian disk inthe orbital plane of the binary. we solve the disk evolution equations insteady state to determine the quasistationary, (orbit-averaged) surface densityprofile prior to decoupling. we use our solution, which is analytic up tosimple quadratures, to compute the electromagnetic flux and approximateradiation spectrum during this epoch. a single nondimensional parametertd/tvis, equal to the ratio of the tidal to viscous torque at the orbitalradius, determines the disk structure, including the surface density profile,the extent of the gap, the existence of an inner disk, and the accretion rate.the solution reduces to the shakura-sunyaev profile for a stationary accretiondisk around a single black hole in the limit of small td/tvis. our solution maybe useful for choosing physical parameters and setting up quasistationary diskinitial data for detailed numerical simulations that begin prior to decouplingand track the subsequent evolution of a black hole binary-disk system.

1105.2821	binary black hole mergers in gaseous disks: simulations in general  relativity	simultaneous gravitational and electromagnetic wave observations of mergingblack hole binaries (bhbhs) can provide unique opportunities to studygravitation physics, accretion and cosmology. here we perform fully generalrelativistic, hydrodynamic simulations of equal-mass, nonspinning bhbhscoalescing in a circumbinary disk. we evolve the metric using thebaumgarte-shapiro-shibata-nakamura (bssn) formulation of einstein's fieldequations with standard moving puncture gauge conditions. we handle thehydrodynamics via a high-resolution shock-capturing (hrsc) scheme. we track theinspiral starting from a binary separation of 10m, where m is the total binarymass. we take the disks to have an inner radius at r_in~15m to account for thehollow created by the binary torques. our disks extend to r=65m and have aninitial scale height of h/r=0.03-0.11. the gas is governed by a gamma-law eos,with gamma equal to 5/3, 4/3, and 1.1. disks are allowed to relax in the "earlyinspiral" epoch to provide quasistationary realistic initial data. we thenevolve the metric and matter during the "late inspiral and merger" epoch. thelater simulations are designed to track bhbh inspiral following disk-binarydecoupling, through merger and ringdown, terminating before viscosity has timeto fill the hollow about the remnant. we compute the gas flow and accretionrate and estimate the electromagnetic luminosity due to bremsstrahlung andsynchrotron emission as a perturbation for optically thin disks. thesynchrotron component of the luminosity peaks in the infrared band and shouldbe detectable by wfirst and possibly the lsst for a 10^8 m_sun binary embeddedin a disk with a density n~10^12/cm^3 at z=1, beginning with a maximum value of$l~10^46 n_12^2 m_8^3 erg/s at decoupling, and decreasing steadily over atimescale of ~100 m_8 hours to a value of l~10^45 n_12^2 m_8^3 erg/s at merger.

1109.5177	the merger of binary white dwarf-neutron stars: simulations in full  general relativity	we present fully general relativistic (gr) simulations of binary whitedwarf-neutron star (wdns) inspiral and merger. the initial binary is in acircular orbit at the roche critical separation. the goal is to determine theultimate fate of such systems. we focus on binaries whose total mass exceedsthe maximum mass (mmax) a cold, degenerate eos can support againstgravitational collapse. the time and length scales span many orders ofmagnitude, making fully general relativistic hydrodynamic (grhd) simulationscomputationally prohibitive. for this reason, we model the wd as a"pseudo-white dwarf" (pwd) as in our binary wdns head-on collisions study[prd83:064002,2011]. our grhd simulations of a pwdns system with a0.98-solar-mass wd and a 1.4-solar-mass ns show that the merger remnant is aspinning thorne-zytkow-like object (tzlo) surrounded by a massive disk. thefinal total rest mass exceeds mmax, but the remnant does not collapse promptly.to assess whether the object will ultimately collapse after cooling, weintroduce radiative thermal cooling. we first apply our cooling algorithm totzlos formed in wdns head-on collisions, and show that these objects collapseand form black holes on the cooling time scale, as expected. however, when wecool the spinning tzlo formed in the merger of a circular-orbit wdns binary,the remnant does not collapse, demonstrating that differential rotationalsupport is sufficient to prevent collapse. given that the final total massexceeds mmax, magnetic fields and/or viscosity may redistribute angularmomentum and ultimately lead to delayed collapse to a bh. we infer that themerger of realistic massive wdns binaries likely will lead to the formation ofspinning tzlos that undergo delayed collapse.

1110.4633	relativistic mhd in dynamical spacetimes: improved em gauge condition  for amr grids	we recently developed a new general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic codewith adaptive mesh refinement that evolves the electromagnetic (em) vectorpotential (a) instead of the magnetic fields directly. evolving a enables oneto use any interpolation scheme on refinement level boundaries and stillguarantee that the magnetic field remains divergenceless. as in classical em, agauge choice must be made when evolving a, and we chose a straightforward"algebraic" gauge condition to simplify the a evolution equation. however,magnetized black hole-neutron star (bhns) simulations in this gauge exhibitunphysical behavior, including the spurious appearance of strong magneticfields on refinement level boundaries. this spurious behavior is exacerbatedwhen matter crosses refinement boundaries during tidal disruption of the ns.applying kreiss-oliger dissipation to the evolution of the magnetic vectorpotential a slightly weakens this spurious magnetic effect, but with undesiredconsequences. we demonstrate via an eigenvalue analysis and a numerical studythat zero-speed modes in the algebraic gauge, coupled with the frequencyfiltering that occurs on refinement level boundaries, are responsible for thecreation of spurious magnetic fields. we show that the em lorenz gauge exhibitsno zero-speed modes, and as a consequence, spurious magnetic effects arequickly propagated away, allowing for long-term, stable magnetized bhnsevolutions. our study demonstrates how the em gauge degree of freedom can bechosen to one's advantage, and that for magnetized bhns simulations the lorenzgauge constitutes a major improvement over the algebraic gauge.

1208.5487	importance of cooling in triggering the collapse of hypermassive neutron  stars	the inspiral and merger of a binary neutron star (nsns) can lead to theformation of a hypermassive neutron star (hmns). as the hmns loses thermalpressure due to neutrino cooling and/or centrifugal support due togravitational wave (gw) emission, and/or magnetic breaking of differentialrotation it will collapse to a black hole. to assess the importance ofshock-induced thermal pressure and cooling, we adopt an idealized equation ofstate and perform nsns simulations in full gr through late inspiral, merger,and hmns formation, accounting for cooling. we show that thermal pressurecontributes significantly to the support of the hmns against collapse and thatthermal cooling accelerates its "delayed" collapse. our simulations demonstrateexplicitly that cooling can induce the catastrophic collapse of a hothypermassive neutron star formed following the merger of binary neutron stars.thus, cooling physics is important to include in nsns merger calculations toaccurately determine the lifetime of the hmns remnant and to extractinformation about the ns equation of state, cooling mechanisms, barinstabilities and b-fields from the gws emitted during the transient phaseprior to bh formation.

1402.0005	self-interacting dark matter cusps around massive black holes	we adopt the conduction fluid approximation to model the steady-statedistribution of matter around a massive black hole at the center of a weaklycollisional cluster of particles. by "`weakly collisional" we mean a cluster inwhich the mean free time between particle collisions is much longer than thecharacteristic particle crossing (dynamical) time scale, but shorter than thecluster lifetime. when applied to a star cluster, we reproduce the familiarbahcall-wolf power-law cusp solution for the stars bound to the black hole.here the star density scales with radius as $r^{-7/4}$ and the velocitydispersion as $r^{-1/2}$ throughout most of the gravitational well of the blackhole. when applied to a relaxed, self-interacting dark matter (sidm) halo witha velocity-dependent cross section $\sigma \sim v^{-a}$, the gas again forms apower-law cusp, but now the sidm density scales as $r^{-\beta}$, where $\beta =(a+3)/4$, while its velocity dispersion again varies as $r^{-1/2}$. results areobtained first in newtonian theory and then in full general relativity.although the conduction fluid model is a simplification, it provides areasonable first approximation to the matter profiles and is much easier toimplement than a full fokker-planck treatment or an $n$-body simulation of theboltzmann equation with collisional perturbations.

0802.3210	relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics in dynamical spacetimes:  numerical methods and tests	many systems of current interest in relativistic astrophysics require aknowledge of radiative transfer in a magnetized gas flowing in astrongly-curved, dynamical spacetime. such systems include coalescing compactbinaries containing neutron stars or white dwarfs, disks around merging blackholes, core collapse supernovae, collapsars, and gamma-ray burst sources. tomodel these phenomena, all of which involve general relativity, radiation(photon and/or neutrino), and magnetohydrodynamics, we have developed a generalrelativistic code capable of evolving mhd fluids and radiation in dynamicalspacetimes. our code solves the coupled einstein-maxwell-mhd-radiation systemof equations both in axisymmetry and in full 3+1 dimensions. we evolve themetric by integrating the bssn equations, and use a conservative,high-resolution shock-capturing scheme to evolve both the mhd and radiationmoment equations. in this paper, we implement our scheme for optically thickgases and grey-body opacities. our code gives accurate results in a suite oftests involving radiating shocks and nonlinear waves propagating in minkowskispacetime. in addition, to test our code's ability to evolve the relativisticradiation-mhd equations in strong-field dynamical spacetimes, we study "thermaloppenheimer-snyder collapse" to a black hole, and find good agreement betweenanalytic and numerical solutions.

1404.6523	improved moving puncture gauge conditions for compact binary evolutions	robust gauge conditions are critically important to the stability andaccuracy of numerical relativity (nr) simulations involving compact objects.most of the nr community use the highly robust---thoughdecade-old---moving-puncture (mp) gauge conditions for such simulations. it hasbeen argued that in binary black hole (bbh) evolutions adopting this gauge,noise generated near adaptive-mesh-refinement (amr) boundaries does notconverge away cleanly with increasing resolution, severely limitinggravitational waveform accuracy at computationally feasible resolutions. welink this noise to a sharp (short-wavelength), initial outgoing gauge wavecrossing into progressively lower resolution amr grids, and presentimprovements to the standard mp gauge conditions that focus on stretching,smoothing, and more rapidly settling this outgoing wave. our best gauge choicegreatly reduces gravitational waveform noise during inspiral, yielding lessfluctuation in convergence order and $\sim 40%$ lower waveform phase andamplitude errors at typical resolutions. noise in other physical quantities ofinterest is also reduced, and constraint violations drop by more than an orderof magnitude. we expect these improvements will carry over to simulations ofall types of compact binary systems, as well as other $n$+1 formulations ofgravity for which mp-like gauge conditions can be chosen.

1410.1543	accretion disks around binary black holes of unequal mass: grmhd  simulations of postdecoupling and merger	we report results from simulations in general relativity of magnetized disksaccreting onto merging black hole binaries, starting from relaxed disk initialdata. the simulations feature an effective, rapid radiative cooling scheme as alimiting case of future treatments with radiative transfer. here we evolve thesystems after binary-disk decoupling through inspiral and merger, and analyzethe dependence on the binary mass ratio with $q\equiv m_{\rm bh}/m_{\rmbh}=1,1/2,$ and $1/4$. we find that the luminosity associated with localcooling is larger than the luminosity associated with matter kinetic outflows,while the electromagnetic (poynting) luminosity associated with bulk transportof magnetic field energy is the smallest. the cooling luminosity around mergeris only marginally smaller than that of a single, non-spinning black hole.incipient jets are launched independently of the mass ratio, while the sameinitial disk accreting on a single non-spinning black hole does not lead to ajet, as expected. for all mass ratios we see a transient behavior in thecollimated, magnetized outflows lasting $2-5 ( m/10^8m_\odot ) \rm days$ aftermerger: the outflows become increasingly magnetically dominated and acceleratedto higher velocities, boosting the poynting luminosity. these sudden changescan alter the electromagnetic emission across the jet and potentially helpdistinguish mergers of black holes in agns from single accreting black holesbased on jet morphology alone.

1410.7392	relativistic simulations of black hole-neutron star coalescence: the jet  emerges	we perform magnetohydrodynamic simulations in full general relativity (grmhd)of a binary black hole-neutron star on a quasicircular orbit that undergoesmerger. the binary mass ratio is 3:1, the black hole initial spin parameter$a/m=0.75$ ($m$ is the black hole christodoulou mass) aligned with the orbitalangular momentum, and the neutron star is an irrotational $\gamma=2$ polytrope.about two orbits prior to merger (at time $t=t_b$), we seed the neutron starwith a dynamically weak interior dipole magnetic field that extends into thestellar exterior. at $t=t_b$ the exterior has a low-density atmosphere withconstant plasma parameter $\beta\equiv p_{\rm gas}/p_{\rm  mag}$. varying $\beta$ at $t_b$ in the exterior from $0.1$ to $0.01$, we findthat at a time $\sim 4000{\rm m} \sim 100(m_{\rm  ns}/1.4m_\odot)$ms [m is the total (adm) mass] following the onset ofaccretion of tidally disrupted debris, magnetic winding above the remnant blackhole poles builds up the magnetic field sufficiently to launch a mildlyrelativistic, collimated outflow - an incipient jet. the duration of theaccretion and the lifetime of the jet is $\delta t\sim 0.5(m_{\rmns}/1.4m_\odot)$s. our simulations furnish the first explicit examples in grmhdwhich show that a jet can emerge following a black hole - neutron star merger.

astro-ph;0004234	black hole emergence in supernovae	if a black hole formed in a core-collapse supernova is accreting materialfrom the base of the envelope, the accretion luminosity could be observable inthe supernova light curve. here we continue the study of matter fall back ontoa black hole in the wake of a supernova and examine realistic supernovae modelswhich allow for an early emergence of the accretion luminosity. such cases mayprovide a direct observational identification of the black hole formed in theaftermath of the explosion. our approach combines analytic estimates and fullyrelativistic, radiation-hydrodynamic numerical computations. we employ anumerical hydrodynamical scaling technique to accommodate the diverse range ofdynamical time scales in a single simulation. we find that while in typicaltype ii supernovae heating by radioactive decays dominates the late-time lightcurve, low-energy explosions of more massive stars should provide an importantexception where the accretion luminosity will emerge while it is stillrelatively large. our main focus is on the only current candidate for such anobservation, the very unusual sn1997d. due to the low energy of the explosionand the very small ($2\times10^{-3} m_\sun$) inferred mass of co56 in theejected envelope, we find that accretion should become the dominant source ofits luminosity during the year 2000. the total luminosity at emergence isexpected to lie in the range $0.5-3\times10^{36} $ ergs/s, potentiallydetectable with hst. we also discuss the more favorable case of explosionswhich eject negligible amounts of radioactive isotopes and find that the blackhole is likely to emerge a few tens of days after the explosion, with aluminosity of $\sim 10^{37} $\ergss.

astro-ph;0005378	the bar-mode instability in differentially rotating neutron stars:  simulations in full general relativity	we study the dynamical stability against bar-mode deformation of rapidlyspinning neutron stars with differential rotation. we perform fullyrelativistic 3d simulations of compact stars with $m/r \geq 0.1$, where $m$ isthe total gravitational mass and $r$ the equatorial circumferential radius. weadopt an adiabatic equation of state with adiabatic index $\gamma=2$. as innewtonian theory, we find that stars above a critical value of $\beta \equivt/w$ (where $t$ is the rotational kinetic energy and $w$ the gravitationalbinding energy) are dynamically unstable to bar formation. for our adoptedchoices of stellar compaction and rotation profile, the critical value of$\beta = \beta_{dgr}$ is $\sim 0.24-0.25$, only slightly smaller than thewell-known newtonian value $\sim 0.27$ for incompressible maclaurin spheroids.the critical value depends only very weakly on the degree of differentialrotation for the moderate range we surveyed. all unstable stars form bars on adynamical timescale. models with sufficiently large $\beta$ subsequently formspiral arms and eject mass, driving the remnant to a dynamically stable state.models with moderately large $\beta \gtrsim \beta_{dgr}$ do not develop spiralarms or eject mass but adjust to form dynamically stable ellipsoidal-likeconfigurations. if the bar-mode instability is triggered in supernovae collapseor binary neutron star mergers, it could be a strong and observable source ofgravitational waves. we determine characteristic wave amplitudes andfrequencies.

astro-ph;0009095	the formation of supermassive black holes and the evolution of  supermassive stars	the existence of supermassive black holes is supported by a growing body ofobservations. supermassive black holes and their formation events are likelycandidates for detection by proposed long-wavelength, space-based gravitationalwave interferometers like lisa. however, the nature of the progenitors ofsupermassive black holes is rather uncertain. supermassive black hole formationscenarios that involve either the stellar dynamical evolution of dense clustersor the hydrodynamical evolution of supermassive stars have been proposed. eachof these formation scenarios is reviewed and the evolution of supermassivestars is then examined in some detail. supermassive stars that rotate uniformlyduring their secular cooling phase will spin up to the mass-shedding limit andeventually contract to the point of relativistic collapse. supermassive starsthat rotate differentially as they cool will likely encounter the dynamical barmode instability prior to the onset of relativistic collapse. a supermassivestar that undergoes this bar distortion, prior to or during collapse, may be astrong source of quasiperiodic, long-wavelength gravitational radiation.

astro-ph;0010201	dynamical bar instability in rotating stars: effect of general  relativity	we study the dynamical stability against bar-mode deformation of rapidly anddifferentially rotating stars in the first post-newtonian approximation ofgeneral relativity. we vary the compaction of the star $m/r$ (where $m$ is thegravitational mass and $r$ the equatorial circumferential radius) between 0.01and 0.05 to isolate the influence of relativistic gravitation on theinstability. for compactions in this moderate range, the critical value of$\beta \equiv t/w$ for the onset of the dynamical instability (where $t$ is therotational kinetic energy and $w$ the gravitational binding energy) slightlydecreases from $\sim 0.26$ to $\sim 0.25$ with increasing compaction for ourchoice of the differential rotational law. combined with our earlier findingsbased on simulations in full general relativity for stars with highercompaction, we conclude that relativistic gravitation {\em enhances} thedynamical bar-mode instability, i.e. the onset of instability sets in forsmaller values of $\beta$ in relativistic gravity than in newtonian gravity. wealso find that once a triaxial structure forms after the bar-mode perturbationsaturates in dynamically unstable stars, the triaxial shape is maintained, atleast for several rotational periods. to check the reliability of our numericalintegrations, we verify that the general relativistic kelvin-helmholtzcirculation is well-conserved, in addition to rest-mass energy, totalmass-energy, linear and angular momentum. conservation of circulation indicatesthat our code is not seriously affected by numerical viscosity. we determinethe amplitude and frequency of the quasi-periodic gravitational waves emittedduring the bar formation process using the quadrupole formula.

astro-ph;0010493	differential rotation in neutron stars: magnetic braking and viscous  damping	diffferentially rotating stars can support significantly more mass inequilibrium than nonrotating or uniformly rotating stars, according to generalrelativity. the remnant of a binary neutron star merger may give rise to such a``hypermassive'' object. while such a star may be dynamically stable againstgravitational collapse and bar formation, the radial stabilization due todifferential rotation is likely to be temporary. magnetic braking and viscositycombine to drive the star to uniform rotation, even if the seed magnetic fieldand the viscosity are small. this process inevitably leads to delayed collapse,which will be accompanied by a delayed gravitational wave burst and, possibly,a gamma-ray burst. we provide a simple, newtonian, mhd calculation of thebraking of differential rotation by magnetic fields and viscosity. the star isidealized as a differentially rotating, infinite cylinder consisting of ahomogeneous, incompressible conducting gas. we solve analytically the simplestcase in which the gas has no viscosity and the star resides in an exteriorvacuum. we treat numerically cases in which the gas has internal viscosity andthe star is embedded in an exterior, low-density, conducting medium. ourevolution calculations are presented to stimulate more realistic mhdsimulations in full 3+1 general relativity. they serve to identify some of thekey physical and numerical parameters, scaling behavior and competingtimescales that characterize this important process.

astro-ph;0104215	rates of observable black hole emergence in supernovae	a newly formed black hole may be directly identified if late-time accretionof material from the base of the ejected envelope generates a luminosity thatis observable in the tail of the supernova light curve. in this work weestimate the rate at which events where the black hole ``emerges'' in thesupernova light curve can be detected with present capabilities. ourinvestigation is based on an analytical model of the accretion luminosity atemergence as a function of progenitor mass, coupled to the inferred rate ofobserved type ii supernovae in nearby galaxies. we find through a parametersurvey that under optimistic assumptions the potential rate of observableevents can be as high as several per year. however, supernovae which produceblack holes are also likely to be low energy explosions and thereforesubluminous, as was the case for the best candidate to date, sn1997d. if blackhole-forming supernovae are underdetected owing to lower luminosities, the rateof observing black hole emergence is probably not larger than once every fewyears. we therefore emphasize the importance of dedicated searches for nearbysupernovae as well as faint supernovae projects for improving the prospects ofobservationally certifying the supernova--black hole connection.

astro-ph;0104408	equilibrium and stability of supermassive stars in binary systems	we investigate the equilibrium and stability of supermassive stars of mass $m\agt 10^5m_{\odot}$ in binary systems. we find that corotating binaries aresecularly unstable for close, circular orbits with $r \alt4r(m/10^6m_{\odot})^{1/6}$ where $r$ is the orbital separation and $r$ thestellar radius. we also show that corotation cannot be achieved for distantorbits with $r \agt 12 r (m/10^6m_{\odot})^{-11/24}$, since the timescale forviscous angular momentum transfer associated with tidal torques is longer thanthe evolution timescale due to emission of thermal radiation. these factssuggest that the allowed mass range and orbital separation for corotatingsupermassive binary stars is severely restricted. in particular, forsupermassive binary stars of large mass $m \agt 6\times 10^6m_{\odot}$,corotation cannot be achieved, as viscosity is not adequate to mediate thetransfer between orbital and spin angular momentum. one possible outcome forbinary supermassive stars is the onset of quasi-radial, relativisticinstability which drives each star to collapse prior to merger: we discussalternative outcomes of collapse and possible spin states of the resultingblack holes. we estimate the frequency and amplitude of gravitational wavesemitted during several inspiral and collapse scenarios.

astro-ph;0110561	self-interacting dark matter halos and the gravothermal catastrophe	we study the evolution of an isolated, spherical halo of self-interactingdark matter (sidm) in the gravothermal fluid formalism. we show that thethermal relaxation time, $t_r$, of a sidm halo with a central density andvelocity dispersion of a typical dwarf galaxy is significantly shorter than itsage. we find a self-similar solution for the evolution of a sidm halo in thelimit where the mean free path between collisions, $\lambda$, is everywherelonger than the gravitational scale height, $h$. typical halos formed in thislong mean free path regime relax to a quasistationary gravothermal densityprofile characterized by a nearly homogeneous core and a power-law halo where$\rho \propto r^{-2.19}$. we solve the more general time-dependent problem andshow that the contracting core evolves to sufficiently high density that$\lambda$ inevitably becomes smaller than $h$ in the innermost region. the coreundergoes secular collapse to a singular state (the ``gravothermalcatastrophe'') in a time $t_{coll} \approx 290 t_r$, which is longer than thehubble time for a typical dark matter-dominated galaxy core at the presentepoch. our model calculations are consistent with previous, more detailed,n-body simulations for sidm, providing a simple physical interpretation oftheir results and extending them to higher spatial resolution and longerevolution times. at late times, mass loss from the contracting, dense innercore to the ambient halo is significantly moderated, so that the final mass ofthe inner core may be appreciable when it becomes relativistic and radiallyunstable to dynamical collapse to a black hole.

astro-ph;0202112	collapse of a rotating supermassive star to a supermassive black hole:  post-newtonian simulations	we study the gravitational collapse of a rotating supermassive star (sms) bymeans of a (3+1) hydrodynamical simulation in a post-newtonian (pn) approxi-mation of general relativity. this problem is particularly challenging becauseof the vast dynamical range in space which must be covered in the course ofcol- lapse. we evolve a uniformly rotating sms from the onset of radialinstability at r_{p}/m=411, where r_{p} is the proper polar radius of the starand m is the total mass-energy, to the point at which the pn approximationbreaks down. we introduce a scale factor and a "comoving" coordinate to handlethe large varia- tion in radius during the collapse and focus on the centralcore. since t/w, the ratio of the rotational kinetic energy to thegravitational binding energy, is nearly proportional to 1/r_{p} throughout thecollapse, the imploding star may ultimately exceed the critical value of t/wfor dynamical instability to bar-mode formation. however, for stars rotatinguniformly at the onset of col- lapse, we do not find any unstable growth ofbars prior to the termination of our simulation. we do find that the collapseis likely to form a supermassive black hole (bh) coherently, with almost all ofthe matter falling into the hole, leaving very little ejected matter to form adisk. in the absence of nonaxi- symmetric bar formation, the collapse of auniformly rotating sms does not lead to appreciable quasi-periodicgravitational wave (gw) emission by the time our integrations terminate.however, the coherent nature of the implosion suggests that rotating smscollapse will be a promising source of gw bursts. we also expect that,following bh formation, long wavelength quasi-periodic waves will result fromquasi-normal ringing. these waves may be detectable by lisa.

astro-ph;0310304	magnetic braking and viscous damping of differential rotation in  cylindrical stars	differential rotation in stars generates toroidal magnetic fields whenever aninitial seed poloidal field is present. the resulting magnetic stresses, alongwith viscosity, drive the star toward uniform rotation. this magnetic brakinghas important dynamical consequences in many astrophysical contexts. forexample, merging binary neutron stars can form "hypermassive" remnantssupported against collapse by differential rotation. the removal of thissupport by magnetic braking induces radial fluid motion, which can lead todelayed collapse of the remnant to a black hole. we explore the effects ofmagnetic braking and viscosity on the structure of a differentially rotating,compressible star, generalizing our earlier calculations for incompressibleconfigurations. the star is idealized as a differentially rotating, infinitecylinder supported initially by a polytropic equation of state. the gas isassumed to be infinitely conducting and our calculations are performed innewtonian gravitation. though highly idealized, our model allows for theincorporation of magnetic fields, viscosity, compressibility, and shocks withminimal computational resources in a 1+1 dimensional lagrangian mhd code. ourevolution calculations show that magnetic braking can lead to significantstructural changes in a star, including quasistatic contraction of the core andejection of matter in the outermost regions to form a wind or an ambient disk.these calculations serve as a prelude and a guide to more realistic mhdsimulations in full 3+1 general relativity.

astro-ph;0312038	magnetic braking in differentially rotating, relativistic stars	we study the magnetic braking and viscous damping of differential rotation inincompressible, uniform density stars in general relativity. differentiallyrotating stars can support significantly more mass in equilibrium thannonrotating or uniformly rotating stars. the remnant of a binary neutron starmerger or supernova core collapse may produce such a "hypermassive" neutronstar. although a hypermassive neutron star may be stable on a dynamicaltimescale, magnetic braking and viscous damping of differential rotation willultimately alter the equilibrium structure, possibly leading to delayedcatastrophic collapse. here we consider the slow-rotation, weak-magnetic fieldlimit in which e_rot &lt;&lt; e_mag &lt;&lt; w, where e_rot is the rotational kineticenergy, e_mag is the magnetic energy, and w is the gravitational binding energyof the star. we assume the system to be axisymmetric and solve the mhdequations in both newtonian gravitation and general relativity. toroidalmagnetic fields are generated whenever the angular velocity varies along theinitial poloidal field lines. we find that the toroidal fields and angularvelocities oscillate independently along each poloidal field line, whichenables us to transform the original 2+1 equations into 1+1 form and solve themalong each field line independently. the incoherent oscillations on differentfield lines stir up turbulent-like motion in tens of alfven timescales ("phasemixing"). in the presence of viscosity, the stars eventually are driven touniform rotation, with the energy contained in the initial differentialrotation going into heat. our evolution calculations serve as qualitativeguides and benchmarks for future, more realistic mhd simulations in full 3+1general relativity.

astro-ph;0401581	effect of differential rotation on the maximum mass of neutron stars:  realistic nuclear equations of state	the merger of binary neutron stars is likely to lead to differentiallyrotating remnants. in this paper, we survey several cold nuclear equations ofstate (eoss) and numerically construct models of differentially rotatingneutron stars in general relativity. for each eos we tabulate maximum allowedmasses as a function of the degree of differential rotation. we also determineeffective polytropic indices, and compare the maximum allowed masses with thosefor the corresponding polytropes. we consistently find larger mass increasesfor the polytropes, but even for the nuclear eoss we typically find maximummasses 50% higher than the corresponding values for nonrotating (tov) stars. weevaluate our findings for the six observed binary neutron star (pulsar)systems, including the recently discovered binary pulsar j0737-3039. for eacheos we determine whether their merger will automatically lead to promptcollapse to a black hole, or whether the remnant can be supported againstcollapse by uniform rotation (possibly as a supramassive star) or differentialrotation (possibly as a hypermassive star). for hypermassive stars, delayedcollapse to a black hole is likely. for the most recent eoss we survey themerger remnants can all be supported by rotation against prompt collapse, buttheir actual fate will depend on the nonequilibrium dynamics of the coalescenceevent. gravitational wave observations of coalescing binary neutron stars maybe able to distinguish these outcomes -- no, delayed or prompt collapse -- andthereby constrain possible eoss.

astro-ph;0402502	general relativistic hydrodynamics with viscosity: contraction,  catastrophic collapse, and disk formation in hypermassive neutron stars	viscosity and magnetic fields drive differentially rotating stars towarduniform rotation, which has important consequences in many astrophysicalcontexts. for example, merging binary neutron stars can form a "hypermassive"remnant, i.e. a differentially rotating star with a mass greater than themaximum allowed by uniform rotation. the removal of the centrifugal supportprovided by differential rotation can lead to delayed collapse of the remnantto a black hole, accompanied by a burst of gravitational radiation. bothmagnetic fields and viscosity alter the structure of differentially rotatingstars on secular timescales, making numerical tracking of the evolutiondifficult. here, we present the first simulations of rapidly rotating starswith shear viscosity in full general relativity. we self-consistently includeviscosity in our relativistic hydrodynamic code to solve the relativisticnavier-stokes equations both in axisymmetry and in full 3+1 dimensions. inaxisymmetry, we follow secular evolution with high resolution over dozens ofrotation periods (thousands of m). we find that viscosity operating in ahypermassive star generically leads to the formation of a compact, uniformlyrotating core surrounded by a low-density disk. these uniformly rotating coresare often, but not always, unstable to gravitational collapse. in the unstablecases, we follow the collapse and determine the mass and the spin of the finalblack hole and ambient disk. in all cases studied, the rest mass of theresulting disk is found to be 10-20% of the original star, whether surroundinga uniformly rotating core or a rotating black hole. this study foreshadows moredetailed, future simulations of secular processes, including magnetic effects,in relativistic stars.

astro-ph;0404338	collapse of uniformly rotating stars to black holes and the formation of  disks	simulations in general relativity show that the outcome of collapse of amarginally unstable, uniformly rotating star spinning at the mass-sheddinglimit depends critically on the equation of state. for a very stiff equation ofstate, which is likely to characterize a neutron star, essentially all of themass and angular momentum of the progenitor are swallowed by the kerr blackhole formed during the collapse, leaving nearly no residual gas to form a disk.for a soft equation of state with an adiabatic index \gamma - 4/3 &lt;&lt; 1, whichcharacterizes a very massive or supermassive star supported predominantly bythermal radiation pressure, as much as 10% of the mass of the progenitor avoidscapture and goes into a disk about the central hole. we present a semi-analyticcalculation that corroborates these numerical findings and shows how the finaloutcome of such a collapse may be determined from simple physicalconsiderations. in particular, we employ a simple energy variational principlewith an approximate, post-newtonian energy functional to determine thestructure of a uniformly rotating, polytropic star at the onset of collapse asa function of polytropic index n, where \gamma = 1+1/n. we then use this datato calculate the mass and spin of the final black hole and ambient disk. weshow that the fraction of the total mass that remains in the disk falls offsharply as 3-n (equivalently, \gamma - 4/3) increases.

astro-ph;0409442	the secular bar-mode instability in rapidly rotating stars revisited	uniformly rotating, homogeneous, incompressible maclaurin spheroids that spinsufficiently rapidly are secularly unstable to nonaxisymmetric, bar-modeperturbations when viscosity is present. the intuitive explanation is thatenergy dissipation by viscosity can drive an unstable spheroid to a stable,triaxial configuration of lower energy - a jacobi ellipsoid. but what aboutrapidly rotating compressible stars? unlike incompressible stars, which containno internal energy and therefore immediately liberate all the energy dissipatedby viscosity, compressible stars have internal energy and can retain thedissipated energy as internal heat. now compressible stars that rotatesufficiently rapidly and also manage to liberate this dissipated energy veryquickly are known to be unstable to bar-mode perturbations, like theirincompressible counterparts. but what is the situation for rapidly rotatingcompressible stars that have very long cooling timescales, so that all theenergy dissipated by viscosity is retained as heat, whereby the total energy ofthe star remains constant on a secular (viscous) evolution timescale? are suchstars also unstable to the nonlinear growth of bar modes, or is the viscousheating sufficient to cause them to expand, drive down the ratio of rotationalkinetic to gravitational potential energy t/|w| ~ 1/r, where r is theequatorial radius, and turn off the instability before it gets underway? if theinstability still arises in such stars, at what rotation rate do they becomeunstable, and to what final state do they evolve? we provide answers to thesequestions in the context of the compressible ellipsoid model for rotatingstars. the results should serve as useful guides for numerical simulations in3+1 dimensions for rotating stars containing viscosity.

astro-ph;0511366	the dynamical evolution of black hole-neutron star binaries in general  relativity: simulations of tidal disruption	we calculate the first dynamical evolutions of merging black hole-neutronstar binaries that construct the combined black hole-neutron star spacetime ina general relativistic framework. we treat the metric in the conformal flatnessapproximation, and assume that the black hole mass is sufficiently largecompared to that of the neutron star so that the black hole remains fixed inspace. using a spheroidal spectral methods solver, we solve the resulting fieldequations for a neutron star orbiting a schwarzschild black hole. the matter isevolved using a relativistic, lagrangian, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph)treatment. we take as our initial data recent quasiequilibrium models forsynchronized neutron star polytropes generated as solutions of the conformalthin-sandwich (cts) decomposition of the einstein field equations. we are ableto construct from these models relaxed sph configurations whose profiles showgood agreement with cts solutions. our adiabatic evolution calculations forneutron stars with low compactness show that mass transfer, when it beginswhile the neutron star orbit is still outside the innermost stable circularorbit, is more unstable than is typically predicted by analytical formalisms.this dynamical mass loss is found to be the driving force in determining thesubsequent evolution of the binary orbit and the neutron star, which typicallydisrupts completely within a few orbital periods. the majority of the masstransferred onto the black hole is accreted promptly; a significant fraction(~30%) of the mass is shed outward as well, some of which will becomegravitationally unbound and ejected completely from the system. the remainingportion forms an accretion disk around the black hole, and could provide theenergy source for short-duration gamma ray bursts.

astro-ph;0605331	evolution of magnetized, differentially rotating neutron stars:  simulations in full general relativity	we study the effects of magnetic fields on the evolution of differentiallyrotating neutron stars, which can form in stellar core collapse or binaryneutron star coalescence. magnetic braking and the magnetorotationalinstability (mri) both redistribute angular momentum; the outcome of theevolution depends on the star's mass and spin. simulations are carried out inaxisymmetry using our recently developed codes which integrate the coupledeinstein-maxwell-mhd equations. for initial data, we consider three categoriesof differentially rotating, equilibrium configurations, which we label normal,hypermassive and ultraspinning. hypermassive stars have rest masses exceedingthe mass limit for uniform rotation. ultraspinning stars are not hypermassive,but have angular momentum exceeding the maximum for uniform rotation at thesame rest mass. we show that a normal star will evolve to a uniformly rotatingequilibrium configuration. an ultraspinning star evolves to an equilibriumstate consisting of a nearly uniformly rotating central core, surrounded by adifferentially rotating torus with constant angular velocity along magneticfield lines, so that differential rotation ceases to wind the magnetic field.in addition, the final state is stable against the mri, although it hasdifferential rotation. for a hypermassive neutron star, the mhd-driven angularmomentum transport leads to catastrophic collapse of the core. the resultingrotating black hole is surrounded by a hot, massive, magnetized torusundergoing quasistationary accretion, and a magnetic field collimated along thespin axis--a promising candidate for the central engine of a short gamma-rayburst.

astro-ph;0610840	magnetorotational collapse of massive stellar cores to neutron stars:  simulations in full general relativity	we study magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) effects arising in the collapse ofmagnetized, rotating, massive stellar cores to proto-neutron stars (pnss). weperform axisymmetric numerical simulations in full general relativity with ahybrid equation of state. the formation and early evolution of a pns arefollowed with a grid of 2500 x 2500 zones, which provides better resolutionthan in previous (newtonian) studies. we confirm that significant differentialrotation results even when the rotation of the progenitor is initially uniform.consequently, the magnetic field is amplified both by magnetic winding and themagnetorotational instability (mri). even if the magnetic energy e_em is muchsmaller than the rotational kinetic energy t_rot at the time of pns formation,the ratio e_em/t_rot increases to 0.1-0.2 by the magnetic winding. followingpns formation, mhd outflows lead to losses of rest mass, energy, and angularmomentum from the system. the earliest outflow is produced primarily by theincreasing magnetic stress caused by magnetic winding. the mri amplifies thepoloidal field and increases the magnetic stress, causing further angularmomentum transport and helping to drive the outflow. after the magnetic fieldsaturates, a nearly stationary, collimated magnetic field forms near therotation axis and a blandford-payne type outflow develops along the fieldlines. these outflows remove angular momentum from the pns at a rate given by\dot{j} \sim \eta e_em c_b, where \eta is a constant of order 0.1 and c_b is atypical ratio of poloidal to toroidal field strength. as a result, the rotationperiod quickly increases for a strongly magnetized pns until the degree ofdifferential rotation decreases. our simulations suggest that rapidly rotating,magnetized pnss may not give rise to rapidly rotating neutron stars.

gr-qc;0312036	dynamical determination of the innermost stable circular orbit of binary  neutron stars	we determine the innermost stable circular orbit (isco) of binary neutronstars (bnss) by performing dynamical simulations in full general relativity.evolving quasiequilibrium (qe) binaries that begin at different separations, webracket the location of the isco by distinguishing stable circular orbits fromunstable plunges. we study gamma=2 polytropes of varying compactions in bothcorotational and irrotational equal-mass binaries. for corotatonal binaries wefind an isco orbital angular frequency somewhat smaller than that determined byapplying turning-point methods to qe initial data. for the irrotationalbinaries the initial data sequences terminate before reaching a turning point,but we find that the isco frequency is reached prior to the termination point.our findings suggest that the isco frequency varies with compaction but doesnot depend strongly on the stellar spin. since the observed gravitational wavesignal undergoes a transition from a nearly periodic ``chirp'' to a burst atroughly twice the isco frequency, the measurement of its value by laserinterferometers (e.g ligo) will be important for determining some of thephysical properites of the underlying stars

gr-qc;0401076	relativistic hydrodynamic evolutions with black hole excision	we present a numerical code designed to study astrophysical phenomenainvolving dynamical spacetimes containing black holes in the presence ofrelativistic hydrodynamic matter. we present evolutions of the collapse of afluid star from the onset of collapse to the settling of the resulting blackhole to a final stationary state. in order to evolve stably after the blackhole forms, we excise a region inside the hole before a singularity isencountered. this excision region is introduced after the appearance of anapparent horizon, but while a significant amount of matter remains outside thehole. we test our code by evolving accurately a vacuum schwarzschild blackhole, a relativistic bondi accretion flow onto a black hole, oppenheimer-snyderdust collapse, and the collapse of nonrotating and rotating stars. thesesystems are tracked reliably for hundreds of m following excision, where m isthe mass of the black hole. we perform these tests both in axisymmetry and infull 3+1 dimensions. we then apply our code to study the effect of the stellarspin parameter j/m^2 on the final outcome of gravitational collapse of rapidlyrotating n = 1 polytropes. we find that a black hole forms only if j/m^2&lt;1, inagreement with previous simulations. when j/m^2&gt;1, the collapsing star forms atorus which fragments into nonaxisymmetric clumps, capable of generatingappreciable ``splash'' gravitational radiation.

gr-qc;0610103	collapse and black hole formation in magnetized, differentially rotating  neutron stars	the capacity to model magnetohydrodynamical (mhd) flows in dynamical,strongly curved spacetimes significantly extends the reach of numericalrelativity in addressing many problems at the forefront of theoreticalastrophysics. we have developed and tested an evolution code for the coupledeinstein-maxwell-mhd equations which combines a bssn solver with a highresolution shock capturing scheme. as one application, we evolve magnetized,differentially rotating neutron stars under the influence of a small seedmagnetic field. of particular significance is the behavior found forhypermassive neutron stars (hmnss), which have rest masses greater the masslimit allowed by uniform rotation for a given equation of state. the remnant ofa binary neutron star merger is likely to be a hmns. we find that magneticbraking and the magnetorotational instability lead to the collapse of hmnss andthe formation of rotating black holes surrounded by massive, hot accretion toriand collimated magnetic field lines. such tori radiate strongly in neutrinos,and the resulting neutrino-antineutrino annihilation (possibly in concert withenergy extraction by mhd effects) could provide enough energy to powershort-hard gamma-ray bursts. to explore the range of outcomes, we also evolvedifferentially rotating neutron stars with lower masses and angular momentathan the hmns models. instead of collapsing, the non-hypermassive models formnearly uniformly rotating central objects which, in cases with significantangular momentum, are surrounded by massive tori.

gr-qc;0701110	quasiequilibrium black hole-neutron star binaries in general relativity	we construct quasiequilibrium sequences of black hole-neutron star binariesin general relativity. we solve einstein's constraint equations in theconformal thin-sandwich formalism, subject to black hole boundary conditionsimposed on the surface of an excised sphere, together with the relativisticequations of hydrostatic equilibrium. in contrast to our previous calculationswe adopt a flat spatial background geometry and do not assume extreme massratios. we adopt a gamma=2 polytropic equation of state and focus onirrotational neutron star configurations as well as approximately nonspinningblack holes. we present numerical results for ratios of the black hole'sirreducible mass to the neutron star's adm mass in isolation ofm_{irr}^{bh}/m_{adm,0}^{ns} = 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10. we consider neutron stars ofbaryon rest mass m_b^{ns}/m_b^{max} = 83% and 56%, where m_b^{max} is themaximum allowed rest mass of a spherical star in isolation for our equation ofstate. for these sequences, we locate the onset of tidal disruption and, incases with sufficiently large mass ratios and neutron star compactions, theinnermost stable circular orbit. we compare with previous results for blackhole-neutron star binaries and find excellent agreement with third-orderpost-newtonian results, especially for large binary separations. we also useour results to estimate the energy spectrum of the outgoing gravitationalradiation emitted during the inspiral phase for these binaries.

0812.2245	relativistic simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers: effects of  black-hole spin	black hole-neutron star (bhns) binary mergers are candidate engines forgenerating both short-hard gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) and detectablegravitational waves. using our most recent conformal thin-sandwich bhns initialdata and our fully general relativistic hydrodynamics code, which is nowamr-capable, we are able to efficiently and accurately simulate these binariesfrom large separations through inspiral, merger, and ringdown. we evolve themetric using the bssn formulation with the standard moving puncture gaugeconditions and handle the hydrodynamics with a high-resolution shock-capturingscheme. we explore the effects of bh spin (aligned and anti-aligned with theorbital angular momentum) by evolving three sets of initial data with bh:nsmass ratio q=3: the data sets are nearly identical, except the bh spin isvaried between a/m = -0.5 (anti-aligned), 0.0, and 0.75. the number of orbitsbefore merger increases with a/m, as expected. we also study the nonspinning bhcase in more detail, varying q between 1, 3, and 5. we calculate gravitationalwaveforms for the cases we simulate and compare them to binary black-holewaveforms. only a small disk (&lt; 0.01 m_sun) forms for the anti-aligned spincase (a/m = -0.5) and for the most extreme mass ratio case (q=5). by contrast,a massive (m_disk is about 0.2 m_sun), hot disk forms in the rapidly spinning(a/m = 0.75) aligned bh case. such a disk could drive a sgrb,possibly by, e.g.,producing a copious flux of neutrino-antineutino pairs.
