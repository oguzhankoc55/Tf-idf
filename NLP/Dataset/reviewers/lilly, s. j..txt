0901.0550	the dependence of star formation activity on stellar mass surface  density and sersic index in zcosmos galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;0.9 compared with sdss  galaxies at 0.04&lt;z&lt;0.08	one of the key unanswered questions in the study of galaxy evolution is whatphysical processes inside galaxies drive the changes in the sfrs in individualgalaxies that, taken together, produce the large decline in the globalstar-formation rate density (sfrd) to redshifts since z~2. many studies of thesfr at intermediate redshifts have been made as a function of the integratedstellar mass of galaxies but these did not use information on the internalstructural properties of the galaxies. in this paper we present a comparativestudy of the dependence of sfrs on the average surface mass densities (sigmam)of galaxies of different morphological types up to z~1 using the zcosmos andsdss surveys. the main findings about the evolution of these relatively massivegalaxies are: 1) there is evidence that, for both sdss ans zcosmos galaxies,the mean specific sfr within a given population (either disk-dominated orbulge-dominated) is independent of sigmam; 2) the observed ssfr - sigmamstep-function relation is due, at all investigated redshifts, to the changingmix of disk-dominated and bulge-dominated galaxies as surface density increasesand the strong difference in the average ssfr between disks and bulges. we alsofind a modest differential evolution in the size-mass relations of disk andspheroid galaxies; 3) the shape of the median ssfr - sigmam relation issimilar, but with median ssfr values that are about 5-6 times higher in zcosmosgalaxies than for sdss, across the whole range of sigmam, and in both spheroidand disk galaxies. this increase matches that of the global sfrd of theuniverse as a whole, emphasizing that galaxies of all types are contributing,proportionally, to the global increase in sfrd in the universe back to theseredshifts (abridged).

0706.2653	the udf05 follow-up of the hudf: i. the faint-end slope of the  lyman-break galaxy population at z~5	we present the udf05 project, a hst large program of deep acs (f606w, f775w,f850lp) and nicmos (f110w, f160w) imaging of three fields, two of whichcoincide with the nicp1-4 nicmos parallel observations of the hubble ultra deepfield (hudf). in this first paper we use the acs data for the nicp12 field, aswell as the original hudf acs data, to measure the uv luminosity function (lf)of z~5 lyman break galaxies (lbgs) down to very faint levels. specifically,based on a v-i, i-z selection criterion, we identify a sample of 101 and 133candidate z~5 galaxies down to z_{850}=28.5 and 29.25 magnitudes in the nicp12and in the hudf fields, respectively. using an extensive set of monte carlosimulations we derive corrections for observational biases and selectioneffects, and construct the rest-frame 1400 a lbg lf over the rangem_{1400}=[-21.4, -17.1], i.e. down to ~0.04 l* at z~5, and complement it withdata from the subaru deep field (sdf) from yoshida et al. (2006) to extend itto the brighter end (m_{1400}&gt;-22.2). we show that: (i) different assumptionsregarding the sed distribution of the lbg population, dust properties andintergalactic absorption result in a 25% variation in the number density oflbgs at z~5; (ii) under consistent assumptions for dust properties andintergalactic absorption, the hudf is about 30% under-dense in z~5 lbgsrelative to the nicp12 field, a variation which is well explained by cosmicvariance; (iii) the faint-end slope of the lf is independent of the specificassumptions for the input physical parameters, and has a value of alpha ~ -1.6,similar to the faint-end slope of the lf that has been measured for lbgs at z~3and z~6.

0903.3409	the density field of the 10k zcosmos galaxies	we use the current sample of ~10,000 zcosmos spectra of sources selected withi(ab) &lt; 22.5 to define the density field out to z~1, with much greaterresolution in the radial dimension than has been possible with eitherphotometric redshifts or weak lensing. we apply new algorithms that we havedeveloped (zade) to incorporate objects not yet observed spectroscopically bymodifying their photometric redshift probability distributions using thespectroscopic redshifts of nearby galaxies. this strategy allows us to probe abroader range of galaxy environments and reduce the poisson noise in thedensity field. the reconstructed overdensity field of the 10k zcosmos galaxiesconsists of cluster-like patterns surrounded by void-like regions, extending upto z~1. some of these structures are very large, spanning the ~50 mpc/htransverse direction of the cosmos field and extending up to delta z~0.05 inredshift. we present the three dimensional overdensity maps and compare thereconstructed overdensity field to the independently identified virialisedgroups of galaxies and clusters detected in the visible and in x-rays. thedistribution of the overdense structures is in general well traced by thesevirialised structures. a comparison of the large scale structures in thezcosmos data and in the mock catalogues reveals an excellent agreement betweenthe fractions of the volume enclosed in structures of all sizes above a givenoverdensity between the data and the mocks in 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.

0903.3411	an optical group catalogue to z = 1 from the zcosmos 10k sample	we present a galaxy group catalogue spanning the redshift range 0.1 &lt;~ z &lt;~ 1in the ~1.7 deg^2 cosmos field, based on the first ~10,000 zcosmos spectra. theperformance of both the friends-of-friends (fof) and voronoi-delaunay-method(vdm) approaches to group identification has been extensively explored andcompared using realistic mock catalogues. we find that the performance improvessubstantially if groups are found by progressively optimizing the group-findingparameters for successively smaller groups, and that the highest fidelitycatalogue, in terms of completeness and purity, is obtained by combining theindependently created fof and vdm catalogues. the final completeness and purityof this catalogue, both in terms of the groups and of individual members,compares favorably with recent results in the literature. the current groupcatalogue contains 102 groups with n &gt;= 5 spectroscopically confirmed members,with a further ~700 groups with 2 &lt;= n &lt;= 4. most of the groups can be assigneda velocity dispersion and a dark-matter mass derived from the mock catalogues,with quantifiable uncertainties. the fraction of zcosmos galaxies in groups isabout 25% at low redshift and decreases toward ~15% at z ~ 0.8. the zcosmosgroup catalogue is broadly consistent with that expected from the semi-analyticevolution model underlying the mock catalogues. not least, we show that thenumber density of groups with a given intrinsic richness increases fromredshift z ~ 0.8 to the present, consistent with the hierarchical growth ofstructure.

0904.0448	stellar and total baryon mass fractions in groups and clusters since  redshift 1	we investigate if the discrepancy between estimates of the total baryon massfraction obtained from observations of the cosmic microwave background (cmb)and of galaxy groups/clusters persists when a large sample of groups isconsidered.  to this purpose, 91 candidate x-ray groups/poor clusters at redshift 0.1 &lt; z&lt; 1 are selected from the cosmos 2 deg^2 survey, based only on their x-rayluminosity and extent. this sample is complemented by 27 nearby clusters with arobust, analogous determination of the total and stellar mass inside r_500. thetotal sample of 118 groups and clusters with z &lt; 1 spans a range in m_500 of~10^13--10^15 m_sun. we find that the stellar mass fraction associated withgalaxies at r_500 decreases with increasing total mass as (m_500)^-0.37 \pm0.04, independent of redshift. estimating the total gas mass fraction from arecently derived, high quality scaling relation, the total baryon mass fraction(f_500^stars+gas=f_500^stars+f_500^gas) is found to increase by ~ 25% whenm_500 increases from &lt;m&gt;=5 x 10^13 m_sun to &lt;m&gt; = 7 x 10^14 m_sun. afterconsideration of a plausible contribution due to intra--cluster light (11--22%of the total stellar mass), and gas depletion through the hierarchical assemblyprocess (10% of the gas mass), the estimated values of the total baryon massfraction are still lower than the latest cmb measure of the same quantity(wmap5), at a significance level of 3.3\sigma for groups of &lt;m&gt;=5 x10^13~m_sun. the discrepancy decreases towards higher total masses, such thatit is 1\sigma at &lt;m&gt;= 7 x 10^14~m_sun. we discuss this result in terms ofnon--gravitational processes such as feedback and filamentary heating.

0906.4556	the zcosmos redshift survey: the role of environment and stellar mass in  shaping the rise of the morphology-density relation from z~1	for more than two decades we have known that galaxy morphological segregationis present in the local universe. it is important to see how this relationevolves with cosmic time. to investigate how galaxy assembly took place withcosmic time, we explore the evolution of the morphology-density relation up toredshift z~1 using about 10000 galaxies drawn from the zcosmos galaxy redshiftsurvey. taking advantage of accurate hst/acs morphologies from the cosmossurvey, of the well-characterised zcosmos 3d environment, and of a large sampleof galaxies with spectroscopic redshift, we want to study here the evolution ofthe morphology-density relation up to z~1 and its dependence on galaxyluminosity and stellar mass. the multi-wavelength coverage of the field alsoallows a first study of the galaxy morphological segregation dependence oncolour. we further attempt to disentangle between processes that occurred earlyin the history of the universe or late in the life of galaxies. the zcosmosfield benefits of high-resolution imaging in the f814w filter from the advancedcamera for survey (acs). we use standard morphology classifiers, optimised forbeing robust against band-shifting and surface brightness dimming, and a new,objective, and automated method to convert morphological parameters into early,spiral, and irregular types. we use about 10000 galaxies down to i_ab=22.5 witha spectroscopic sampling rate of 33% to characterise the environment ofgalaxies up to z~1 from the 100 kpc scales of galaxy groups up to the 100 mpcscales of the cosmic web. abridged

0907.0013	tracking the impact of environment on the galaxy stellar mass function  up to z~1 in the 10k zcosmos sample	we study the impact of the environment on the evolution of galaxies in thezcosmos 10k sample in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.0 over an area of ~1.5 deg2.the considered sample of secure spectroscopic redshifts contains about 8500galaxies, with their stellar masses estimated by sed fitting of themultiwavelength optical to nir photometry. the evolution of the galaxy stellarmass function (gsmf) in high and low density regions provides a tool to studythe mass assembly evolution in different environments; moreover, thecontributions to the gsmf from different galaxy types, as defined by their sedsand their morphologies, can be quantified. at redshift z~1, the gsmf is onlyslightly dependent on environment, but at lower redshifts the shapes of thegsmfs in high- and low-density environments become extremely different, withhigh density regions exhibiting a marked bimodality. as a result, we infer thatgalaxy evolution depends on both the stellar mass and the environment, thelatter setting the probability of a galaxy to have a given mass: all the galaxyproperties related to the stellar mass show a dependence on environment,reflecting the difference observed in the mass functions. the shapes of thegsmfs of early- and late-type galaxies are almost identical for the extremes ofthe density contrast we consider. the evolution toward z=0 of the mass at whichthe early- and late-type gsmfs match each other is more rapid in high densityenvironments. the comparison of the observed gsmfs to the same quantitiesderived from a set of mock catalogues shows that blue galaxies in sparseenvironments are overproduced in the semi-analytical models at intermediate andhigh masses, because of a deficit of star formation suppression, while at z&lt;0.5an excess of red galaxies is present in dense environments at intermediate andlow masses, because of the overquenching of satellites. abridged

0909.1968	k+a galaxies in the zcosmos survey: physical properties of systems in  their post-starburst phase	the identities of the main processes triggering and quenching star-formationin galaxies remain unclear. a key stage in evolution, however, appears to berepresented by post-starburst galaxies. to investigate their impact on galaxyevolution, we initiated a multiwavelength study of galaxies with k+a spectralfeatures in the cosmos field. we examine a mass-selected sample of k+a galaxiesat z=0.48-1.2 using the spectroscopic zcosmos sample. k+a galaxies occupy thebrightest tail of the luminosity distribution. they are as massive as quiescentgalaxies and populate the green valley in the colour versus luminosity (orstellar mass) distribution. a small percentage (&lt;8%) of these galaxies haveradio and/or x-ray counterparts (implying an upper limit to the sfr of~8msun/yr). over the entire redshift range explored, the class of k+a galaxiesis morphologically a heterogeneous population with a similar incidence ofbulge-dominated and disky galaxies. this distribution does not vary with thestrength of the hdelta absorption line but instead with stellar mass in a wayreminiscent of the well-known mass-morphology relation. although k+a galaxiesare also found in underdense regions, they appear to reside typically in asimilarly rich environment as quiescent galaxies on a physical scale of~2-8mpc, and in groups they show a morphological early-to-late type ratiosimilar to the quiescent galaxy class. with the current data set, we do notfind evidence of statistical significant evolution in either the number/massdensity of k+a galaxies at intermediate redshift with respect to the localvalues, or the spectral properties. those galaxies, which are affected by asudden quenching of their star-formation activity, may increase the stellarmass of the red-sequence by up to a non-negligible level of ~10%.

0909.2032	the 10k zcosmos: morphological transformation of galaxies in the group  environment since z~1	we study the evolution of galaxies inside and outside of the groupenvironment since z=1 using a large well defined set of groups and galaxiesfrom the zcosmos-bright redshift survey in the cosmos field. the fraction ofgalaxies with early-type morphologies increases monotonically with m_bluminosity and stellar mass and with cosmic epoch. it is higher in the groupsthan elsewhere, especially at later epochs. the emerging environmental effectis superposed on a strong global mass-driven evolution, and at z~0.5 andlog(m*/msol)~10.2, the "effect" of group environment is equivalent to (only)about 0.2 dex in stellar mass or 2 gyr in time. the stellar mass function ofgalaxies in groups is enriched in massive galaxies. we directly determine thetransformation rates from late to early morphologies, and for transformationsinvolving colour and star formation indicators. the transformation rates aresystematically about twice as high in the groups as outside, or up to 3-4 timeshigher correcting for infall and the appearance of new groups. the rates reachvalues, for masses around the crossing mass 10^10.5 msol, as high as(0.3-0.7)/gyr in the groups, implying transformation timescales of 1.4-3 gyr,compared with less than 0.2/gyr, i.e. timescales &gt;5 gyr, outside of groups. allthree transformation rates decrease at higher stellar masses, and must decreasealso at the lower masses below 10^10 msol which we cannot well probe. the ratesinvolving colour and star formation are consistently higher than those formorphology, by a factor of about 50%. our conclusion is that thetransformations which drive the evolution of the overall galaxy populationsince z~1 must occur at a rate 2-4 times higher in groups than outside of them.

0910.0004	the nonlinear biasing of the 10k zcosmos galaxies up to z~1	we use the overdensity field reconstructed in the volume of the cosmos areato study the nonlinear biasing of the zcosmos galaxies. the galaxy overdensityfield is reconstructed using the current sample of ~8500 accurate zcosmosredshifts at i(ab)&lt;22.5 out to z~1 on scales r from 8 to 12 mpc/h. by comparingthe probability distribution function (pdf) of galaxy density contrast delta_gto the lognormal approximation of the pdf of the mass density contrast delta,we obtain the mean biasing function b(delta,z,r) between the galaxy and matteroverdensity field and its second moments b(hat) and b(tilde) up to z~1. overthe redshift interval 0.4&lt;z&lt;1 the conditional mean function &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; =b(delta,z,r) delta is of the following characteristic shape. the functionvanishes in the most underdense regions and then sharply rises in a nonlinearway towards the mean densities. &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; is almost a linear tracer ofthe matter in the overdense regions, up to the most overdense regions in whichit is nonlinear again and the local effective slope of &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; vs.delta is smaller than unity. the &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; function is evolving onlyslightly over the redshift interval 0.4&lt;z&lt;1. the linear biasing parameterincreases from b(hat)=1.24+/-0.11 at z=0.4 to b(hat)=1.64+/-0.15 at z=1 for them_b&lt;-20-z sample of galaxies. b(hat) does not show any dependence on thesmoothing scale from 8 to 12 mpc/h, but increases with luminosity. the measurednonlinearity parameter b(tilde)/b(hat) is of the order of a few percent (but itcan be consistent with 0) and it does not change with redshift, the smoothingscale or the luminosity. by matching the linear bias of galaxies to the halobias, we infer that the m_b&lt;-20-z galaxies reside in dark matter haloes with acharacteristic mass of about 3-6 x 10^12 msol, depending on the halo bias fit.

0910.4970	on the cosmic evolution of the scaling relations between black holes and  their host galaxies: broad line agn in the zcosmos survey	(abriged) we report on the measurement of the rest frame k-band luminosityand total stellar mass of the hosts of 89 broad line active galactic nucleidetected in the zcosmos survey in the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;2.2. the unprecedentedmultiwavelength coverage of the survey field allows us to disentangle theemission of the host galaxy from that of the nuclear black hole in theirspectral energy distributions. we derive an estimate of black hole massesthrough the analysis of the broad mg ii emission lines observed in themedium-resolution spectra taken with vimos/vlt as part of the zcosmos project.we found that, as compared to the local value, the average black hole to hostgalaxy mass ratio appears to evolve positively with redshift, with a best fitevolution of the form (1+z)^{0.68 \pm0.12 +0.6 -0.3}, where the largeasymmetric systematic errors stem from the uncertainties in the choice of imf,in the calibration of the virial relation used to estimate bh masses and in themean qso sed adopted. a thorough analysis of observational biases induced byintrinsic scatter in the scaling relations reinforces the conclusion that anevolution of the mbh-m* relation must ensue for actively growing black holes atearly times: either its overall normalization, or its intrinsic scatter (orboth) appear to increase with redshift. this can be interpreted as signature ofeither a more rapid growth of supermassive black holes at high redshift, achange of structural properties of agn hosts at earlier times, or a significantmismatch between the typical growth times of nuclear black holes and hostgalaxies.

0910.5824	the optical spectra of spitzer 24 micron galaxies in the cosmos field:  ii. faint infrared sources in the zcosmos-bright 10k catalogue	we have used the zcosmos-bright 10k sample to identify 3244 spitzer/mips24-micron-selected galaxies with 0.06&lt; s(24um)&lt; 0.50 mjy and i(ab)&lt;22.5, over1.5 deg^2 of the cosmos field, and studied different spectral properties,depending on redshift. at 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.3, we found that different reddening laws ofcommon use in the literature explain the dust extinction properties of around80% of our infrared (ir) sources, within the error bars. for up to 16% ofobjects, instead, the halpha/hbeta ratios are too high for their ir/uvattenuations, which is probably a consequence of inhomogenous dustdistributions. in only a few of our galaxies at 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.3 the ir emission couldbe mainly produced by dust heated by old rather than young stars. besides, theline ratios of ~22% of our galaxies suggest that they might bestar-formation/nuclear-activity composite systems. at 0.5&lt;z&lt;0.7, we estimatedgalaxy metallicities for 301 galaxies: at least 12% of them are securely belowthe upper-branch mass-metallicity trend, which is consistent with the localrelation. finally, we performed a combined analysis of the hdeltaequivalent-width versus dn(4000) diagram for 1722 faint and bright 24umgalaxies at 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.0, spanning two decades in mid-ir luminosity. we foundthat, while secondary bursts of star formation are necessary to explain theposition of the most luminous ir galaxies in that diagram, quiescent,exponentially-declining star formation histories can well reproduce thespectral properties of ~40% of the less luminous sources. our results suggest atransition in the possible modes of star formation at total ir luminositiesl(tir)=(3 +/-2)x10^11 lsun.

0911.1126	the build-up of the hubble sequence in the cosmos field	we use ~8,600 &gt;5e10 msol cosmos galaxies to study how the morphological mixof massive ellipticals, bulge-dominated disks, intermediate-bulge disks,bulge-less disks and irregular galaxies evolves from z=0.2 to z=1. themorphological evolution depends strongly on mass. at m&gt;3e11 msol, no evolutionis detected in the morphological mix: ellipticals dominate since z=1, and thehubble sequence has quantitatively settled down by this epoch. at the 1e11 msolmass scale, little evolution is detected, which can be entirely explained withmajor mergers. most of the morphological evolution from z=1 to z=0.2 takesplace at masses 5e10 - 1e11 msol, where: (i) the fraction of spiralssubstantially drops and the contribution of early-types increases. thisincrease is mostly produced by the growth of bulge-dominated disks, which varytheir contribution from ~10% at z=1 to &gt;30% at z=0.2 (cf. the ellipticalfraction grows from ~15% to ~20%). thus, at these masses, transformations fromlate- to early-types result in disk-less elliptical morphologies with astatistical frequency of only 30% - 40%. otherwise, the processes which areresponsible for the transformations either retain or produce a non-negligibledisk component. (ii) the bulge-less disk galaxies, which contribute ~15% to theintermediate-mass galaxy population at z=1, virtually disappear by z=0.2. themerger rate since z=1 is too low to account for the disappearance of thesemassive bulge-less disks, which most likely grow a bulge via secular evolution.

0911.2252	the zcosmos-bright survey: the clustering of early and late galaxy  morphological types since z~1	we measure the spatial clustering of galaxies as a function of theirmorphological type at z~0.8, for the first time in a deep redshift survey withfull morphological information. this is obtained by combining high-resolutionhst imaging and vlt spectroscopy for about 8,500 galaxies to i_ab=22.5 withaccurate spectroscopic redshifts from the zcosmos-bright redshift survey. atthis epoch, early-type galaxies already show a significantly strongerclustering than late-type galaxies on all probed scales. a comparison to thesdss at z~0.1, shows that the relative clustering strength between early andlate morphological classes tends to increase with cosmic time at smallseparations, while on large scales it shows no significant evolution sincez~0.8. this suggests that most early-type galaxies had already formed inintermediate and dense environments at this epoch. our results are consistentwith a picture in which the relative clustering of different morphologicaltypes between z~1 and z~0, reflects the evolving role of environment in themorphological transformation of galaxies, on top of the global mass-drivenevolution.

0911.3914	the [oiii] emission line luminosity function of optically selected  type-2 agn from zcosmos	we present a catalog of 213 type-2 agn selected from the zcosmos survey. theselected sample covers a wide redshift range (0.15&lt;z&lt;0.92) and is deeper thanany other previous study, encompassing the luminosity range 10^{5.5} &lt; lsun&lt;l[oiii] &lt; 10^{9.1} lsun. we explore the intrinsic properties of these agn andthe relation to their x-ray emission (derived from the xmm-cosmosobservations). we study their evolution by computing the [oiii]5007a lineluminosity function (lf) and we constrain the fraction of obscured agn as afunction of luminosity and redshift. the sample was selected on the basis ofthe optical emission line ratios, after applying a cut to the signal-to-noiseratio (s/n) of the relevant lines. we used the standard diagnostic diagrams[oiii]/hbeta versus [nii]/halpha and ([oiii]/hbeta versus [sii]/halpha) toisolate agn in the redshift range 0.15&lt;z&lt;0.45 and the diagnostic diagram[oiii]/hbeta versus [oii]/hbeta to extend the selection to higher redshift(0.5&lt;z&lt;0.92). combining our sample with one drawn from sdss, we found that thebest description of the evolution of type-2 agn is a luminosity-dependentdensity evolution model. moreover, using the type-1 agn lf we were able toconstrain the fraction of type-2 agn to the total (type-1 + type-2) agnpopulation. we found that the type-2 fraction decreases with luminosity, inagreement with the most recent results, and shows signs of a slight increasewith redshift. however, the trend with luminosity is visible only aftercombining the sdss+zcosmos samples. from the cosmos data points alone, thetype-2 fraction seems to be quite constant with luminosity.

1001.1354	the vla-cosmos perspective on the ir-radio relation. i. new constraints  on selection biases and the non-evolution of the ir/radio properties of star  forming and agn galaxies at intermediate and high redshift	vla 1.4 ghz (rms noise ~0.012 mjy) and mips 24 and 70 micron (rms noise ~0.02and ~1.7 mjy, respectively) observations covering the 2 square degree cosmosfield are combined with an extensive multi-wavelength data set to study theevolution of the ir-radio relation at intermediate and high redshift. with~4500 sources -- of which ~30% have spectroscopic redshifts -- the currentsample is significantly larger than previous ones used for the same purpose.both monochromatic ir/radio flux ratios (q24 &amp; q70), as well as the ratio ofthe total ir and the 1.4 ghz luminosity (qtir) are used as indicators for their/radio properties of star forming galaxies and agn.  using a sample jointly selected at ir and radio wavelengths in order toreduce selection biases, we provide firm support for previous findings that their-radio relation remains unchanged out to at least z~1.4. moreover, based ondata from ~150 objects we also find that the local relation likely still holdsat 2.5&lt;z&lt;5. at redshift z&lt;1.4 we observe that radio-quiet agn populate thelocus of the ir-radio relation in similar numbers as star forming sources. inour analysis we employ the methods of survival analysis in order to ensure astatistically sound treatment of flux limits arising from non-detections. wedetermine the observed shift in average ir/radio properties of ir- and radio-selected populations and show that it can reconcile apparently discrepantmeasurements presented in the literature. finally, we also investigatevariations of the ir/radio ratio with ir and radio luminosity and find that ithardly varies with ir luminosity but is a decreasing function of radioluminosity.

1001.1736	bars in early- and late-type disks in cosmos	we investigate the (large-scale) bar fraction in a mass-complete sample of m&gt; 10^10.5 msun disk galaxies at 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 in the cosmos field. the fractionof barred disks strongly depends on mass, disk morphology, and specific starformation rate (ssfr). at intermediate stellar mass (10^10.5 &lt; m &lt; 10^11 msun)the bar fraction in early-type disks is much higher, at all redshifts, by afactor ~2, than that in late-type disks. this trend is reversed at higherstellar mass (m &gt; 10^11 msun), where the fraction of bars in early-type disksbecomes significantly lower, at all redshifts, than that in late-type disks.the bar fractions for galaxies with low and high ssfrs closely follow those ofthe morphologically-selected early-type and late-type populations,respectively. this indicates a close correspondence between morphology and ssfrin disk galaxies at these earlier epochs. interestingly, the total bar fractionin 10^10.5 &lt; m &lt; 10^11 msun disks is built up by a factor of ~2 over theredshift interval explored, while for m &gt; 10^11 msun disks it remains roughlyconstant. this indicates that, already by z ~ 0.6, spectral and morphologicaltransformations in the most massive disk galaxies have largely converged to thefamiliar hubble sequence that we observe in the local universe, while forintermediate mass disks this convergence is ongoing until at least z ~ 0.2.moreover, these results highlight the importance of employing mass-limitedsamples for quantifying the evolution of barred galaxies. finally, theevolution of the barred galaxy populations investigated does not depend on thelarge-scale environmental density (at least, on the scales which can be probedwith the available photometric redshifts).

1001.2311	mgii absorption systems with w_0 &gt; 0.1 \aa for a radio selected sample  of 77 qsos and their associated magnetic fields at high redshifts	we present a catalogue of mgii absorption systems obtained from highresolution uves/vlt data of 77 qsos in the redshift range 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 2.0, anddown to an equivalent width w_0 &gt; 0.1 \aa. the statistical properties of oursample are found to be in agreement with those from previous work in theliterature. however, we point out that the previously observed increase withredshift of dn/dz for weak absorbers, pertains exclusively to very weakabsorbers with w_0 &lt; 0.1 \aa. instead, dn/dz for absorbers with w_0 in therange 0.1-0.3 \aa actually decreases with redshift, similarly to the case ofstrong absorbers. we then use this catalogue to extend our earlier analysis ofthe links between the faraday rotation measure of the quasars and the presenceof intervening mgii absorbing systems in their spectra. in contrast to the casewith strong mgii absorption systems w_0 &gt; 0.3 \aa, the weaker systems do notcontribute significantly to the observed rotation measure of the backgroundquasars. this is possibly due to the higher impact parameters of the weaksystems compared to strong ones, suggesting that the high column densitymagnetized material that is responsible for the faraday rotation is locatedwithin about 50 kpc of the galaxies. finally, we show that this result alsorules out the possibility that some unexpected secondary correlation betweenthe quasar redshift and its intrinsic rotation measure is responsible for theassociation of high rotation measure and strong intervening mgii absorptionthat we have presented elsewhere, since this would have produced an equaleffect for the weak absorption line systems, which exhibit a very similardistribution of quasar redshifts.

1003.0020	a runaway black hole in cosmos: gravitational wave or slingshot recoil?	we present a detailed study of a peculiar source in the cosmos survey atz=0.359. source cxocj100043.1+020637 (cid-42) presents two compact opticalsources embedded in the same galaxy. the distance between the 2, measured inthe hst/acs image, is 0.495" that, at the redshift of the source, correspondsto a projected separation of 2.46 kpc. a large (~1200 km/s) velocity offsetbetween the narrow and broad components of hbeta has been measured in threedifferent optical spectra from the vlt/vimos and magellan/imacs instruments.cid-42 is also the only x-ray source having in its x-ray spectra a strongredshifted broad absorption iron line, and an iron emission line, drawing aninverted p-cygni profile. the chandra and xmm data show that the absorptionline is variable in energy by 500 ev over 4 years and that the absorber has tobe highly ionized, in order not to leave a signature in the soft x-rayspectrum. that these features occur in the same source is unlikely to be acoincidence. we envisage two possible explanations: (1) a gravitational waverecoiling black hole (bh), caught 1-10 myr after merging, (2) a type 1/ type 2system in the same galaxy where the type 1 is recoiling due to slingshot effectproduced by a triple bh system. the first possibility gives us a candidategravitational waves recoiling bh with both spectroscopic and imagingsignatures. in the second case, the x-ray absorption line can be explained as abal-like outflow from the foreground nucleus (a type 2 agn) at the rearer one(a type 1 agn), which illuminates the otherwise undetectable wind, giving usthe first opportunity to show that fast winds are present in obscured agn.

1003.4747	mass and environment as drivers of galaxy evolution in sdss and zcosmos  and the origin of the schechter function	we explore the inter-relationships between mass, star-formation rate andenvironment in the sdss, zcosmos and other surveys. the differential effects ofmass and environment are completely separable to z ~ 1, indicating that twodistinct processes are operating, "mass-quenching" and "environment-quenching".environment-quenching, at fixed over-density, evidently does not change withepoch to z ~ 1, suggesting that it occurs as large-scale structure develops inthe universe. the observed constancy of the mass-function shape forstar-forming galaxies, demands that the mass-quenching of galaxies around andabove m*, must be proportional to their star-formation rates at all z &lt; 2. wepostulate that this simple mass-quenching law also holds over a much broaderrange of stellar mass and epoch. these two simple quenching processes, plussome additional quenching due to merging, then naturally produce (a) aquasi-static schechter mass function for star-forming galaxies with a value ofm* that is set by the proportionality between the star-formation andmass-quenching rates, (b) a double schechter function for passive galaxies withtwo components: the dominant one is produced by mass-quenching and has exactlythe same m* as the star-forming galaxies but an alpha shallower by +1, whilethe other is produced by environment effects and has the same m* and alpha asthe star-forming galaxies, and is larger in high density environments.subsequent merging of quenched galaxies modifies these predictions somewhat inthe denser environments, slightly increasing m* and making alpha more negative.all of these detailed quantitative relationships between the schechterparameters are indeed seen in the sdss, lending strong support to our simpleempirically-based model. the model naturally produces for passive galaxies the"anti-hierarchical" run of mean ages and alpha-element abundances with mass.

1004.2790	the xmm-newton wide-field survey in the cosmos field (xmm-cosmos):  demography and multiwavelength properties of obscured and unobscured luminous  agn	we report the final optical identifications of the medium-depth (~60 ksec),contiguous (2 deg^2) xmm-newton survey of the cosmos field. xmm-newton hasdetected ~800 x-ray sources down to limiting fluxes of ~5x10^{-16},~3x10^{-15}, and ~7x10^{-15} erg/cm2/s in the 0.5-2 kev, 2-10 kev and 5-10 kevbands, respectively. the work is complemented by an extensive collection ofmulti-wavelength data from 24 micron to uv, available from the cosmos survey,for each of the x-ray sources, including spectroscopic redshifts for ~50% ofthe sample, and high-quality photometric redshifts for the rest. the xmm andmultiwavelength flux limits are well matched: 1760 (98%) of the x-ray sourceshave optical counterparts, 1711 (~95%) have irac counterparts, and 1394 (~78%)have mips 24micron detections. thanks to the redshift completeness (almost100%) we were able to constrain the high-luminosity tail of the x-rayluminosity function confirming that the peak of the number density oflogl_x&gt;44.5 agn is at z~2. spectroscopically-identified obscured and unobscuredagn, as well as normal and starforming galaxies, present well-defined opticaland infrared properties. we devised a robust method to identify a sample of~150 high redshift (z&gt;1), obscured agn candidates for which opticalspectroscopy is not available. we were able to determine that the fraction ofthe obscured agn population at the highest (l_x&gt;10^{44} erg s^{-1}) x-rayluminosity is ~15-30% when selection effects are taken into account, providingan important observational constraint for x-ray background synthesis. westudied in detail the optical spectrum and the overall spectral energydistribution of a prototypical type 2 qso, caught in a stage transitioning frombeing starburst dominated to agn dominated, which was possible to isolate onlythanks to the combination of x-ray and infrared observations.

1007.1984	understanding the shape of the galaxy two-point correlation function at  z~1 in the cosmos field	we investigate how the shape of the galaxy two-point correlation function asmeasured in the zcosmos survey depends on local environment, quantified interms of the density contrast on scales of 5 mpc/h. we show that the flat shapepreviously observed at redshifts between z=0.6 and z=1 can be explained by thisvolume being simply 10% over-abundant in high-density environments, withrespect to a universal density probability distribution function. when galaxiescorresponding to the top 10% tail of the distribution are excluded, themeasured w_p(r_p) steepens and becomes indistinguishable from lcdm predictionson all scales. this is the same effect recognised by abbas &amp; sheth in the sdssdata at z~0 and explained as a natural consequence of halo-environmentcorrelations in a hierarchical scenario. galaxies living in high-densityregions trace dark matter halos with typically higher masses, which are morecorrelated. if the density probability distribution function of the sample isparticularly rich in high-density regions because of the variance introduced byits finite size, this produces a distorted two-point correlation function. weargue that this is the dominant effect responsible for the observed "peculiar"clustering in the cosmos field.

1007.3841	the zcosmos 10k-sample: the role of galaxy stellar mass in the  colour-density relation up to z=1	[abridged] with the first 10000 spectra of the flux limited zcosmos sample(i&lt;=22.5) we study the evolution of environmental effects on galaxy propertiessince z=1.0, and disentangle the dependence among galaxy colour, stellar massand local density (3d local density contrast `delta', computed with the 5thnearest neighbour approach). we confirm that within a luminosity-limited sample(m_b&lt;=-20.5-z) the fraction of red (u-b&gt;=1) galaxies 'f_red' depends on deltaat least up to z=1, with red galaxies residing mainly in high densities. thistrend weakens for increasing z, and it is mirrored by the behaviour of thefraction of galaxies with d4000a break &gt;=1.4. we also find that up to z=1 thefraction of galaxies with log(ew[oii]) &gt;=1.15 is higher for lower delta, andalso this dependence weakens for increasing z. given the triple dependenceamong galaxy colours, stellar mass and delta, the colour-delta relation foundin the luminosity-selected sample can be due to the broad range of stellarmasses. thus, we fix the stellar mass and we find that in this case thecolour-delta relation is flat up to z=1 for galaxies with log(m/m_sun)&gt;=10.7.this means that for these masses the colour-delta relation found in aluminosity-selected sample is the result of the combined colour-mass andmass-delta relations. in contrast, we find that for 0.1&lt;=z&lt;=0.5 andlog(m/m_sun)&lt;=10.7 'f_red' depends on delta even at fixed mass. in these massand z ranges, environment affects directly also galaxy colours. we suggest ascenario in which the colour depends primarily on stellar mass, but forrelatively low mass galaxies the local density modulates this dependence. thesegalaxies formed more recently, in an epoch when evolved structures were alreadyin place, and their longer sfh allowed environment-driven physical processes tooperate during longer periods of time.

1009.0723	the bimodality of the 10k zcosmos-bright galaxies up to z ~ 1: a new  statistical and portable classification based on the optical galaxy  properties	our goal is to develop a new and reliable statistical method to classifygalaxies from large surveys. we probe the reliability of the method bycomparing it with a three-dimensional classification cube, using the same setof spectral, photometric and morphological parameters.we applied two differentmethods of classification to a sample of galaxies extracted from the zcosmosredshift survey, in the redshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.3. the first method is thecombination of three independent classification schemes, while the secondmethod exploits an entirely new approach based on statistical analyses likeprincipal component analysis (pca) and unsupervised fuzzy partition (ufp)clustering method. the pca+ufp method has been applied also to a lower redshiftsample (z &lt; 0.5), exploiting the same set of data but the spectral ones,replaced by the equivalent width of h$\alpha$. the comparison between the twomethods shows fairly good agreement on the definition on the two main clusters,the early-type and the late-type galaxies ones. our pca-ufp method ofclassification is robust, flexible and capable of identifying the two mainpopulations of galaxies as well as the intermediate population. theintermediate galaxy population shows many of the properties of the green valleygalaxies, and constitutes a more coherent and homogeneous population. thefairly large redshift range of the studied sample allows us to behold thedownsizing effect: galaxies with masses of the order of $3\cdot 10^{10}$ msunmainly are found in transition from the late type to the early type group at$z&gt;0.5$, while galaxies with lower masses - of the order of $10^{10}$ msun -are in transition at later epochs; galaxies with $m &lt;10^{10}$ msun did notbegin their transition yet, while galaxies with very large masses ($m &gt; 5\cdot10^{10}$ msun) mostly completed their transition before $z\sim 1$.

1011.5360	the sins survey of z~2 galaxy kinematics: properties of the giant star  forming clumps	we have studied the properties of giant star forming clumps in five z~2star-forming disks with deep sinfoni ao spectroscopy at the eso vlt. the clumpsreside in disk regions where the toomre q-parameter is below unity, consistentwith their being bound and having formed from gravitational instability. broadh{\alpha}/[nii] line wings demonstrate that the clumps are launching sites ofpowerful outflows. the inferred outflow rates are comparable to or exceed thestar formation rates, in one case by a factor of eight. typical clumps may losea fraction of their original gas by feedback in a few hundred million years,allowing them to migrate into the center. the most active clumps may lose muchof their mass and disrupt in the disk. the clumps leave a modest imprint on thegas kinematics. velocity gradients across the clumps are 10-40 km/s/kpc,similar to the galactic rotation gradients. given beam smearing and clumpsizes, these gradients may be consistent with significant rotational support intypical clumps. extreme clumps may not be rotationally supported; either theyare not virialized, or they are predominantly pressure supported. the velocitydispersion is spatially rather constant and increases only weakly with starformation surface density. the large velocity dispersions may be driven by therelease of gravitational energy, either at the outer disk/accreting streamsinterface, and/or by the clump migration within the disk. spatial variations inthe inferred gas phase oxygen abundance are broadly consistent with inside-outgrowing disks, and/or with inward migration of the clumps.

0709.1692	precision photometric redshift calibration for galaxy-galaxy weak  lensing	accurate photometric redshifts are among the key requirements for precisionweak lensing measurements. both the large size of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) and the existence of large spectroscopic redshift samples that areflux-limited beyond its depth have made it the optimal data source fordeveloping methods to properly calibrate photometric redshifts for lensing.here, we focus on galaxy-galaxy lensing in a survey with spectroscopic lensredshifts, as in the sdss. we develop statistics that quantify the effect ofsource redshift errors on the lensing calibration and on the weighting scheme,and show how they can be used in the presence of redshift failure and samplingvariance. we then demonstrate their use with 2838 source galaxies withspectroscopy from deep2 and zcosmos, evaluating several public photometricredshift algorithms, in two cases including a full p(z) for each object, andfind lensing calibration biases as low as 1% (due to fortuitous cancellation oftwo types of bias) or as high as 20% for methods in active use (despite thesmall mean photoz bias of these algorithms). our work demonstrates thatlensing-specific statistics must be used to reliably calibrate the lensingsignal, due to asymmetric effects of (frequently non-gaussian) photoz errors.we also demonstrate that large-scale structure (lss) can strongly impact thephotoz calibration and its error estimation, due to a correlation between thelss and the photoz errors, and argue that at least two independent degree-scalespectroscopic samples are needed to suppress its effects. given the size of ourspectroscopic sample, we can reduce the galaxy-galaxy lensing calibration errorwell below current sdss statistical errors.

1104.5237	a low escape fraction of ionizing photons of l&gt;l* lyman break galaxies  at z=3.3	we present an upper limit for the relative escape fraction (f_{esc}^{rel}) ofionizing radiation at z~3.3 using a sample of 11 lyman break galaxies (lbgs)with deep imaging in the u band obtained with the large binocular camera,mounted on the prime focus of the large binocular telescope. we selected 11lbgs with secure redshift in the range 3.27&lt;z&lt;3.35, from 3 independent fields.we stacked the images of our sources in the r and u band, which correspond toan effective rest-frame wavelength of 1500\aa and 900\aa respectively,obtaining a limit in the u band image of &gt;=30.7(ab)mag at 1 sigma. we derive a1 sigma upper limit of f_{esc}^{rel}~5%, which is one of the lowest valuesfound in the literature so far at z~3.3. assuming that the upper limit for theescape fraction that we derived from our sample holds for all galaxies at thisredshift, the hydrogen ionization rate that we obtain (gamma_{-12}&lt;0.3 s^{-1})is not enough to keep the igm ionized and a substantial contribution to the uvbackground by faint agns is required. since our sample is clearly still limitedin size, larger z~3 lbg samples, at similar or even greater depths arenecessary to confirm these results on a more firm statistical basis.

1104.5470	the zcosmos redshift survey : influence of luminosity, mass and  environment on the galaxy merger rate	the contribution of major mergers to galaxy mass assembly along cosmic timeis an important ingredient to the galaxy evolution scenario. we aim to measurethe evolution of the merger rate for both luminosity/mass selected galaxysamples and investigate its dependence with the local environment. we use asample of 10644 spectroscopically observed galaxies from the zcosmos redshiftsurvey to identify pairs of galaxies destined to merge, using only pairs forwhich the velocity difference and projected separation of both components witha confirmed spectroscopic redshift indicate a high probability of merging. wehave identified 263 spectroscopically confirmed pairs with r_p^{max} = 100h^{-1} kpc. we find that the density of mergers depends on luminosity/mass,being higher for fainter/less massive galaxies, while the number of mergers agalaxy will experience does not depends significantly on its intrinsicluminosity but rather on its stellar mass. we find that the pair fraction andmerger rate increase with local galaxy density, a property observed up toredshift z=1. we find that the dependence of the merger rate on the luminosityor mass of galaxies is already present up to redshifts z=1, and that theevolution of the volumetric merger rate of bright (massive) galaxies isrelatively flat with redshift with a mean value of 3*10^{-4} (8*10^{-5}respectively) mergers h^3 mpc^{-3} gyr^{-1}. the dependence of the merger ratewith environment indicates that dense environments favors major merger eventsas can be expected from the hierarchical scenario. the environment thereforehas a direct impact in shapping-up the mass function and its evolutiontherefore plays an important role on the mass growth of galaxies along cosmictime.

1112.4842	environmental effects in the interaction and merging of galaxies in  zcosmos	(abridged) we analyze the environments and galactic properties (morphologiesand star-formation histories) of a sample of 153 close kinematic pairs in theredshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1 identified in the zcosmos-bright 10k spectroscopicsample of galaxies. correcting for projection effects, the fraction of closekinematic pairs is three times higher in the top density quartile than in thelowest one. this translates to a three times higher merger rate because themerger timescales are shown, from mock catalogues based on the millenniumsimulation, to be largely independent of environment once the same correctionsfor projection is applied. we then examine the morphologies and stellarpopulations of galaxies in the pairs, comparing them to control samples thatare carefully matched in environment so as to remove as much as possible thewell-known effects of environment on the properties of the parent population ofgalaxies. once the environment is properly taken into account in this way, wefind that the early-late morphology mix is the same as for the parentpopulation, but that the fraction of irregular galaxies is boosted by 50-75%,with a disproportionate increase in the number of irregular-irregular pairs(factor of 4-8 times), due to the disturbance of disk galaxies. futuredry-mergers, involving elliptical galaxies comprise less than 5% of all closekinematic pairs. in the closest pairs, there is a boost in the specificstar-formation rates of star-forming galaxies of a factor of 2-4, and there isalso evidence for an increased incidence of post star-burst galaxies. althoughsignificant for the galaxies involved, the "excess" star-formation associatedwith pairs represents only about 5% of the integrated star-formation activityin the parent sample. although most pair galaxies are in dense environments,the effects of interaction appear to be largest in the lower densityenvironments.

1201.0995	photo-z performance for precision cosmology ii : empirical verification	the success of future large scale weak lensing surveys will critically dependon the accurate estimation of photometric redshifts of very large samples ofgalaxies. this in turn depends on both the quality of the photometric data andthe photo-z estimators. in a previous study, (bordoloi et al. 2010) we focussedprimarily on the impact of photometric quality on photo-z estimates and on thedevelopment of novel techniques to construct the n(z) of tomographic bins atthe high level of precision required for precision cosmology, as well as thecorrection of issues such as imprecise corrections for galactic reddening. weused the same set of templates to generate the simulated photometry as werethen used in the photo-z code, thereby removing any effects of "templateerror". in this work we now include the effects of "template error" bygenerating simulated photometric data set from actual cosmos photometry. we usethe trick of simulating redder photometry of galaxies at higher redshifts byusing a bluer set of passbands on low z galaxies with known redshifts. we findthat "template error" is a rather small factor in photo-z performance, at thephotometric precision and filter complement expected for all-sky surveys. withonly a small sub-set of training galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, it isin principle possible to construct tomographic redshift bins whose meanredshift is known, from photo-z alone, to the required accuracy of 0.002(1+z).

1206.4043	environmental effects in the interaction and merging of galaxies in  zcosmos survey	the zcosmos-bright 10k spectroscopic sample reveals a strong environmentaldependence of close kinematic galaxy pair fractions in the redshift range 0.2 &lt;z &lt; 1. the fraction of close pairs is three times higher in the top densityquartile than in the lowest one. this environmental variation in pair fractionswill translate into merger fractions since merger timescales are shown, basedon millennium simulation catalogs, to be largely independent of environment.while galactic properties of close kinematic pairs (morphologies and starformation rates) may seem to be non-representative of an underlying galaxypopulation, they can be explained by taking into account well-known effects ofenvironment, and changes caused by interactions. the latter is responsible foran increase of irregular galaxies in pairs by a factor of 50-75%, with adisproportionate increase in the number of irregular-irregular pairs (4-8times), due to disturbance of about 15% of the disk galaxies in pairs. anothersign of interaction is an observed boost in specific star formation rate(factor 2-4) for the closest pairs. while significant for paired galaxies, thistriggered star-formation due to interactions represents only about 5% of theintegrated star-formation activity in our volume-limited sample. althoughmajority of close kinematic pairs are in dense environments, the effects ofinteractions appear to be strongest in the lower density environments. this mayintroduce strong biases into observational studies of mergers, especially thosebased on morphological criteria. relative excess of post-starburst galaxiesobserved in paired galaxies (factor \sim2) as well as excess of agns (factor ofover 2), linked with environmental dependence of the pair fractions couldindicate that early phases of interactions and merging are plausible candidatesfor environmental quenching, observed in the global galaxy populations.

1206.5807	the zurich environmental study (zens) of galaxies in groups along the  cosmic web. i. which environment affects galaxy evolution?	the zurich environmental study (zens) is based on a sample of ~1500 galaxymembers of 141 groups in the mass range ~10^12.5-14.5 m_sun within the narrowredshift range 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.0585. zens adopts novel approaches, here described, toquantify four different galactic environments, namely: (1) the mass of the hostgroup halo; (2) the projected halo-centric distance; (3) the rank of galaxiesas central or satellites within their group halos; and (4) the filamentarylarge-scale structure (lss) density. no self-consistent identification of acentral galaxy is found in ~40% of &lt;10^13.5 m_sun groups, from which weestimate that ~15% of groups at these masses are dynamically unrelaxed systems.central galaxies in relaxed and unrelaxed groups have in general similarproperties, suggesting that centrals are regulated by their mass and not bytheir environment. centrals in relaxed groups have however ~30% larger sizesthan in unrelaxed groups, possibly due accretion of small satellites invirialized group halos. at m&gt;10^10 m_sun, satellite galaxies in relaxed andunrelaxed groups have similar size, color and (specific) star formation ratedistributions; at lower galaxy masses, satellites are marginally redder inrelaxed relative to unrelaxed groups, suggesting quenching of star formation inlow-mass satellites by physical processes active in relaxed halos. finally,relaxed and unrelated groups show similar stellar mass conversion efficiencies,peaking at halo masses around 10^12.5 m_sun. in the enclosed zens catalogue wepublish all environmental diagnostics as well as the galaxy structural andphotometric measurements described in companion zens papers ii and iii.

1206.6108	the zurich environmental study (zens) of galaxies in groups along the  cosmic web. ii. galaxy structural measurements and the concentration of  morphologically classified satellites in diverse environments	we present structural measurements for the galaxies in the 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.0585groups of the zurich environmental study, aimed at establishing how galaxyproperties depend on four environmental parameters: group halo mass m_group,group-centric distance r/r_200, ranking into central or satellite, andlarge-scale structure density delta_lss. global galaxy structure is quantifiedboth parametrically and non-parametrically. we correct all these measurementsfor observational biases due to psf blurring and surface brightness effects asa function of galaxy size, magnitude, steepness of light profile andellipticity. structural parameters are derived also for bulges, disks and bars.we use the galaxy bulge-to-total ratios (b/t), together with the calibratednon-parametric structural estimators, to implement a quantitative morphologicalclassification that maximizes purity in the resulting morphological samples. weinvestigate how the concentration c of satellite galaxies depends on galaxymass for each hubble type, and on m_group, r/r_200 and delta_lss. at galaxymasses m&gt;10^10 m_sun, the concentration of disk satellites increases withincreasing stellar mass, separately within each morphological bin of b/t. theknown increase in concentration with stellar mass for disk satellites is thusdue, at least in part, to an increase in galaxy central stellar density atconstant b/t. the correlation between concentration and galaxy stellar massbecomes progressively steeper for later morphological types. the concentrationof disk satellites shows a barely significant dependence on delta_lss orr/r_200. the strongest environmental effect is found with group mass form&gt;10^10 m_sun disk-dominated satellites, which are ~10% more concentrated inhigh mass groups than in lower mass groups.

1206.6496	the zurich environmental study of galaxies in groups along the cosmic  web. iii. galaxy photometric measurements and the spatially-resolved color  properties of early- and late-type satellites in diverse environments	we present photometric measurements for the galaxies - and when possibletheir bulges and disks - in the 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.0585 groups of the zurichenvironmental study (zens); these measurements include (b-i) colors, colorgradients and maps, color dispersions, as well as stellar masses andstar-formation rates. the zens galaxies are classified into quenched,moderately star-forming, and strongly star-forming using a combination ofspectral features and fuv-to-optical colors; this approach optimallydistinguishes quenched systems from dust-reddened star-forming galaxies. thelatter contribute up to 50% to the (b-i) "red sequence" at ~10^10msun. at fixedmorphological or spectral type, we find that galaxy stellar masses are largelyindependent of environment, and especially of halo mass. as a first utilizationof our photometric database, we study, at fixed stellar mass and hubble type,how (b-i) colors, color gradients and color dispersion of disk satellitesdepend on group mass (m_group), group-centric distance (r/r_200) andlarge-scale structure overdensity. the strongest environmental trend is foundfor disk-dominated satellites with m_group and r/r_200. at m&lt;10^10 msun,disk-dominated satellites are redder in the inner regions of the groups than inthe outer parts. at m&gt;10^10 msun, these satellites have shallower colorgradients in higher mass groups and in the cores of groups compared with lowermass groups and the outskirts of groups. stellar population analyses andsemi-analytic models suggest that disk-dominated satellites undergo quenchingof star formation in their outer disks, on timescales ~2 gyr, as theyprogressively move inside the group potential.

1207.0002	the zcosmos 20k group catalog	we present an optical group catalog between 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1 based on 16,500high-quality spectroscopic redshifts in the completed zcosmos-bright survey.the catalog published herein contains 1498 groups in total and 192 groups withmore than five observed members. the catalog includes both group properties andthe identification of the member galaxies. based on mock catalogs, thecompleteness and purity of groups with three and more members should be bothabout 83% with respect to all groups that should have been detectable withinthe survey, and more than 75% of the groups should exhibit a one-to-onecorrespondence to the "real" groups. particularly at high redshift, there areapparently more galaxies in groups in the cosmos field than expected from mockcatalogs. we detect clear evidence for the growth of cosmic structure over thelast seven billion years in the sense that the fraction of galaxies that arefound in groups (in volume-limited samples) increases significantly with cosmictime. in the second part of the paper, we develop a method for associatinggalaxies that only have photo-z to our spectroscopically identified groups. weshow that this leads to improved definition of group centers, improvedidentification of the most massive galaxies in the groups, and improvedidentification of central and satellite galaxies, where we define the former tobe galaxies at the minimum of the gravitational potential wells. subsamples ofcentrals and satellites in the groups can be defined with purities up to 80%,while a straight binary classification of all group and non-group galaxies intocentrals and satellites achieves purities of 85% and 75%, respectively, for thespectroscopic sample.

1207.0005	a group-galaxy cross-correlation function analysis in zcosmos	we present a group-galaxy cross-correlation analysis using a group catalogproduced from the 16,500 spectra from the optical zcosmos galaxy survey. ouraim is to perform a consistency test in the redshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.8between the clustering strength of the groups and mass estimates that are basedon the richness of the groups. we measure the linear bias of the groups bymeans of a group-galaxy cross-correlation analysis and convert it into massusing the bias-mass relation for a given cosmology, checking the systematicerrors using realistic group and galaxy mock catalogs. the measured bias forthe zcosmos groups increases with group richness as expected by the theory ofcosmic structure formation and yields masses that are reasonably consistentwith the masses estimated from the richness directly, considering the scatterthat is obtained from the 24 mock catalogs. an exception are the richest groupsat high redshift (estimated to be more massive than 10^13.5 m_sun), for whichthe measured bias is significantly larger than for any of the 24 mock catalogs(corresponding to a 3-sigma effect), which is attributed to the extremely largestructure that is present in the cosmos field at z ~ 0.7. our results are ingeneral agreement with previous studies that reported unusually strongclustering in the cosmos field.

1209.1478	spectral energy distributions of type 1 agn in the cosmos survey i - the  xmm-cosmos sample	the "cosmic evolution survey" (cosmos) enables the study of the spectralenergy distributions (seds) of active galactic nuclei (agn) because of the deepcoverage and rich sampling of frequencies from x-ray to radio. here we presenta sed catalog of 413 x-ray (\xmm) selected type 1 (emission line fwhm$&gt;2000$ kms$^{-1}$) agn with magellan, sdss or vlt spectrum. the seds are corrected forthe galactic extinction, for broad emission line contributions, constrainedvariability, and for host galaxy contribution. we present the mean sed and thedispersion seds after the above corrections in the rest frame 1.4 ghz to 40kev, and show examples of the variety of seds encountered. in the near-infraredto optical (rest frame $\sim 8\mu m$-- 4000\aa), the photometry is complete forthe whole sample and the mean sed is derived from detections only. reddeningand host galaxy contamination could account for a large fraction of theobserved sed variety. the seds are all available on-line.

1209.2410	the interpretation of rotation measures in the presence of inhomogeneous  foreground screens	we analyze the redshift evolution of the rotation measure (rm) in taylor etal. (2009) dataset, which is based on nvss radio data at 21 cm, and comparewith results from our previous work (kronberg et al. (2008), bernet et al.(2008),(2010)), based on rms determined at lower wavelengths, e.g. 6 cm. wefind that, in spite of the same analysis, taylor's dataset produces neither anincrease of the rm dispersion with redshift as found in kronberg et al. (2008),nor the correlation of rm strength with mgii absorption lines found in bernetet al. (2008). we develop a simple model to understand the discrepancy. themodel assumes that the faraday rotators, namely the qso's host galaxy and theintervening mgii host galaxies along the line of sight, contain partiallyinhomogeneous rm screens. we find that this leads to an increasingdepolarization towards longer wavelengths and to wavelength dependent rmvalues. in particular, due to cosmological redshift, observations at fixedwavelength of sources at different redshift are affected differently bydepolarization and are sensitive to different faraday active components. forexample, at 21 cm the polarized signal is averaged out by inhomogeneous faradayscreens and the measured rm mostly reflects the milky way contributions for lowredshift qsos, while polarization is relatively unaffected for high redshiftqsos. similar effects are produced by intervening galaxies acting asinhomogeneous screens. finally, we assess the performance of rotation measuresynthesis on our synthetic models and conclude that the study of magneticfields in galaxies as a function of cosmic time will benefit considerably fromthe application of such a technique, provided enough instrumental bandwidth.for this purpose, high frequency channels appear preferable but not strictlynecessary.

1210.2723	proto-groups at 1.8&lt;z&lt;3 in the zcosmos-deep sample	we identify 42 candidate groups lying between 1.8&lt;z&lt;3.0 from a sample of 3502galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the zcosmos-deep redshift surveywithin the same redshift interval. these systems contain three to fivespectroscopic galaxies that lie within 500kpc in projected distance (inphysical space) and within 700km/s in velocity. based on extensive analysis ofmock catalogues that have been generated from the millennium simulation, weexamine the likely nature of these systems at the time of observation, and whatthey will evolve into down to the present epoch. although few of the "member"galaxies are likely to reside in the same halo at the epoch we observe them,50% of the systems will eventually bring them all into the same halo, andalmost all (93%) will have at least part of the member galaxies in the samehalo by the present epoch. most of the candidate groups can therefore bedescribed as "proto-groups". an estimate of the overdensities is alsoconsistent with the idea that these systems are being seen at the start of theassembly process. we also examine present-day haloes and ask whether theirprogenitors would have been seen amongst our candidate groups. for present-dayhaloes between 10^14-10^15msun/h, 35% should have appeared amongst ourcandidate groups, and this would have risen to 70% if our survey had beenfully-sampled, so we can conclude that our sample can be taken asrepresentative of a large fraction of such systems. there is a clear excess ofmassive galaxies above 10^10msun around the locations of the candidate groupsin a large independent cosmos photo-z sample, but we see no evidence in thislatter data for any colour differentiation with respect to the field. this ishowever consistent with the idea that such differentiation arises in satellitegalaxies, as indicated at z&lt;1, if the candidate groups are indeed only startingto be assembled.

0712.0435	a global probe of cosmic magnetic fields to high redshifts	faraday rotation (rm) probes of magnetic fields in the universe are sensitiveto cosmological and evolutionary effects as $z$ increases beyond $\sim $1because of the scalings of electron density and magnetic fields, and the growthin the number of expected intersections with galaxy-scale intervenors,$d$n/$dz$. in this new global analysis of an unprecedented large sample of rm'sof high latitude quasars extending out to $z\sim $3.7 we find that thedistribution of rm broadens with redshift in the 20 $-$ 80 rad m$^{-2}$ rangerange, despite the (1 +$z$)$^{-2}$ wavelength dilution expected in the observedfaraday rotation. our results indicate that the universe becomes increasingly``faraday-opaque'' to sources beyond $z \sim$ 2, that is, as $z$ increasesprogressively fewer sources are found with a ``small'' rm in the observer'sframe. this is in contrast to sources at $z \la$1. they suggest that theenvironments of galaxies were significantly magnetized at high redshifts, withmagnetic field strengths that were at least as strong within a few gyr of thebig bang as at the current epoch. we separately investigate a simple unevolvingtoy model in which the rm is produced by mgii absorber systems, and find thatit can approximately reproduce the observed trend with redshift. an additionalpossibility is that the intrinsic rm associated with the radio sources was muchhigher in the past, and we show that this is not a trivial consequence of thehigher radio luminosities of the high redshift sources.

1211.3774	modeling the distribution of mg ii absorbers around galaxies using  background galaxies &amp; quasars	we present joint constraints on the distribution of mgii absorption aroundgalaxies, by combining the mgii absorption seen in stacked background galaxyspectra and the distribution of host galaxies of strong mgii systems from thespectra of background quasars. we present a suite of models that predict, thedependence of mgii absorption on a galaxy's apparent inclination, impactparameter(b) and azimuthal angle. the variations in the absorption strengthwith azimuthal angles provide much stronger constraints on the intrinsicgeometry of the mgii absorption than the dependence on the galaxy'sinclination. strong mgii absorbers (w_r(2796)&gt;0.3) are asymmetricallydistributed in azimuth around their host galaxies:72% of the absorbers studiedand 100% of the close-in absorbers within b&lt;35 kpc, are located within 50deg ofthe host galaxy's projected minor axis. composite models consisting either of asimple bipolar component plus a spherical or disk component, or a single highlysoftened bipolar distribution, can well represent the azimuthal dependenciesobserved in both the datasets. simultaneously fitting both datasets to thecomposite model, bipolar cone is confined to 50deg of the minor axis andcontains 2/3 of the total mgii absorption. the single softened cone model hasan exponential fall off with azimuth with an exponential scale-length inopening angle of 45deg. we conclude that the distribution of mgii gas at lowimpact parameters is not the same as that found at high impact parameters. mgiiabsorption within 40 kpc primarily arises from cool mgii gas entrained inwinds. beyond 40 kpc, there is evidence for a more symmetric distribution,significantly different from that closer into the galaxies. here a significantcomponent appears aligned more with the disk and is possibly inflowing, perhapsas part of a galactic fountain or the inflow of material from further out inthe system.

1211.5607	the colors of central and satellite galaxies in zcosmos out to z ~ 0.8  and implications for quenching	we examine the red fraction of central and satellite galaxies in the largezcosmos group catalog out to z ~ 0.8 correcting for both the incompleteness instellar mass and for the less than perfect purities of the central andsatellite samples. we show that, at all masses and at all redshifts, thefraction of satellite galaxies that have been quenched, i.e., are red, issystematically higher than that of centrals, as seen locally in the sloandigital sky survey (sdss). the satellite quenching efficiency, which is theprobability that a satellite is quenched because it is a satellite rather thana central, is, as locally, independent of stellar mass. furthermore, theaverage value is about 0.5, which is also very similar to that seen in thesdss. we also construct the mass functions of blue and red centrals andsatellites and show that these broadly follow the predictions of the peng etal. analysis of the sdss groups. together, these results indicate that theeffect of the group environment in quenching satellite galaxies was verysimilar when the universe was about a half its present age, as it is today.

1303.6689	evolution of galaxies and their environments at z = 0.1 to 3 in cosmos	large-scale structures (lss) out to z $&lt; 3.0$ are measured in the cosmicevolution survey (cosmos) using extremely accurate photometric redshifts(photoz). the ks-band selected sample (from ultra-vista) is comprised of155,954 galaxies. two techniques -- adaptive smoothing and voronoi tessellation-- are used to estimate the environmental densities within 127 redshift slices.approximately 250 statistically significant overdense structures are identifiedout to z $= 3.0$ with shapes varying from elongated filamentary structures tomore circularly symmetric concentrations. we also compare the densities derivedfor cosmos with those based on semi-analytic predictions for a $\lambda$cdmsimulation and find excellent overall agreement between the mean densities as afunction of redshift and the range of densities. the galaxy properties (stellarmass, spectral energy distributions (seds) and star formation rates (sfrs)) arestrongly correlated with environmental density and redshift, particularly at z$&lt; 1.0 - 1.2$. classifying the spectral type of each galaxy using therest-frame b-i color (from the photoz sed fitting), we find a strongcorrelation of early type galaxies (e-sa) with high density environments, whilethe degree of environmental segregation varies systematically with redshift outto z $\sim 1.3$. in the highest density regions, 80% of the galaxies are earlytypes at z=0.2 compared to only 20% at z = 1.5. the sfrs and the star formationtimescales exhibit clear environmental correlations. at z $&gt; 0.8$, the starformation rate density (sfrd) is uniformly distributed over all environmentaldensity percentiles, while at lower redshifts the dominant contribution isshifted to galaxies in lower density environments.

1304.2776	investigating the relationship between agn activity and stellar mass in  zcosmos galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;1 using emission line diagnostic diagrams	we investigate the link between agn activity, star-formation and stellar massof the host galaxy at 0&lt;z&lt;1, looking for spectroscopic traces of agn and agingof the host. this work provides an extension of the existing studies at z&lt;0.1and contributes to shed light on galaxy evolution at intermediate redshifts. weused the zcosmos 20k data to create a sample of galaxies at z&lt;1. we divided thesample in several mass-redshift bins to obtain stacked galaxy spectra with animproved s/n. we exploited emission-line diagnostic diagrams to separate agnfrom star-forming galaxies. we found indication of a role for the total galaxystellar mass in leading galaxy classification. stacked spectra show agnsignatures above the log m_*/m_sun&gt;10.2 threshold. moreover, the stellarpopulations of agn hosts are found to be older with respect to star-forming andcomposites galaxies. this could be due to the the tendency of agn to reside inmassive hosts. the dependence of the agn classification on the stellar mass isin agreement with what has been already found in previous studies. it isconsistent with, together with the evidence of older stellar populationsinhabiting the agn-like galaxies, the downsizing scenario. in particular, ourevidence points to an evolutionary scenario where the agn-feedback is capableof quenching the star formation in the most massive galaxies. therefore, theagn-feedback is the best candidate for initiating the passive evolutionaryphase of galaxies.

1305.1308	spot the difference. impact of different selection criteria on observed  properties of passive galaxies in zcosmos 20-k sample	we present the analysis of photometric, spectroscopic, and morphologicalproperties for differently selected samples of passive galaxies up to z=1extracted from the zcosmos-20k spectroscopic survey. this analysis intends toexplore the dependence of galaxy properties on the selection criterion adopted,study the degree of contamination due to star-forming outliers, and provide acomparison between different commonly used selection criteria. we extractedfrom the zcosmos-20k catalog six different samples of passive galaxies, basedon morphology, optical colors, specific star-formation rate, a best fit to theobserved spectral energy distribution, and a criterion that combinesmorphological, spectroscopic, and photometric information. the morphologicalsample has the higher percentage of contamination in colors, specific starformation rate and presence of emission lines, while the red &amp; passive etgssample is the purest, with properties mostly compatible with no star formationactivity; however, it is also the less economic criterion in terms ofinformation used. the best performing among the other criteria are the red sedand the quiescent ones, providing a percentage of contamination only slightlyhigher than the red &amp; passive etgs criterion (on average of a factor of ~2) butwith absolute values of the properties of contaminants still compatible with ared, passively evolving population. we also provided two revised definitions ofearly type galaxies based on restframe color-color and color-mass criteria,that better reproduce the observed bimodalities. the analysis of the numberdensities shows evidences of mass-assembly downsizing, with galaxies at10.25&lt;log(m/msun)&lt;10.75 increasing their number by a factor ~2-4 from z=0.6 toz=0.2, by a factor ~2-3 from z=1 to z=0.2 at 10.75&lt;log(m/msun)&lt;11, and by only~10-50% from z=1 to z=0.2 at 11&lt;log(m/msun)&lt;11.5.

1305.6167	obscured agn at z~1 from the zcosmos-bright survey i. selection and  optical properties of a [ne v]-selected sample	a sample of 94 narrow line agn with 0.65&lt;z&lt;1.20 has been selected from the20k-bright zcosmos galaxy sample by detection of the high-ionization [nev]3426line. taking advantage of the large amount of data available in the cosmosfield, the properties of the [nev]-selected type-2 agn have been investigated,focusing on their host galaxies, x-ray emission, and optical line flux ratios.finally, the diagnostic developed by gilli et al. (2010), based on the x-ray to[nev] luminosity ratio, has been exploited to search for the more heavilyobscured agn. we found that [ne v]-selected narrow line agn have seyfert 2-likeoptical spectra, although with emission line ratios diluted by a star-formingcomponent. the acs morphologies and stellar component in the optical spectraindicate a preference for our type-2 agn to be hosted in early-spirals withstellar masses greater than 10^(9.5-10)msun, on average higher than those ofthe galaxy parent sample. the fraction of galaxies hosting [nev]-selectedobscured agn increases with the stellar mass, reaching a maximum of about 3% at2x10^11 msun. a comparison with other selection techniques at z~1 shows thatthe detection of the [ne v] line is an effective method to select agn in theoptical band, in particular the most heavily obscured ones, but can not provideby itself a complete census of agn2. finally, the high fraction of[nev]-selected type-2 agn not detected in medium-deep chandra observations(67%) is suggestive of the inclusion of compton-thick sources in our sample.the presence of a population of heavily obscured agn is corroborated by thex-ray to [nev] ratio; we estimated, by mean of x-ray stacking technique andsimulations, that the compton-thick fraction in our sample of type-2 agn is43+-4%, in good agreement with standard assumptions by the xrb synthesismodels.

1307.2250	the extent of magnetic fields around galaxies out to z ~ 1	radio quasar sightlines with strong mgii absorption lines displaystatistically enhanced faraday rotation measures (rm) indicating the presenceof additional magneto-active plasma with respect to sightlines free of suchabsorption. in this letter, we use multi-color optical imaging to identify thelikely galaxies hosting the magneto-active plasma, and to constrain thelocation of the latter with respect to the putative parent halo. we find thatall of the sightlines with high |rm| pass within 50 kpc of a galaxy and thatthe |rm| distribution for low impact parameters, d &lt; 50 kpc, is significantlydifferent than for larger impact parameters. in addition, we find a decrease inthe ratio of the polarization at 21 cm and 1.5 cm, p_{21}/p_{1.5}, towardslower d. these two effects are most likely related, strengthen the associationof excess |rm| with intervening galaxies, and suggest that intervening galaxiesoperate as inhomogeneous faraday screens. these results are difficult toreconciliate with only a disk model for the magnetic field but are consistentwith highly magnetized winds associated with mgii systems. we infer strongmagnetic fields of a few tens of mikro gauss, consistent with values requiredby the lack of evolution of the fir-radio correlation at high redshifts.finally, these findings lends support to the idea that the small scale helicitybottleneck of alpha-omega galactic dynamos can be significantly alleviated viagalatic winds.

1307.4402	zcosmos 20k: satellite galaxies are the main drivers of environmental  effects in the galaxy population at least to z~0.7	we explore the role of environment in the evolution of galaxies over0.1&lt;z&lt;0.7 using the final zcosmos-bright data set. using the red fraction ofgalaxies as a proxy for the quenched population, we find that the fraction ofred galaxies increases with the environmental overdensity and with the stellarmass, consistent with previous works. as at lower redshift, the red fractionappears to be separable in mass and environment, suggesting the action of twoprocesses: mass and environmental quenching. the parameters describing theseappear to be essentially the same at z~0.7 as locally. we explore the relationbetween red fraction, mass and environment also for the central and satellitegalaxies separately, paying close attention to the effects of impurities in thecentral-satellite classification and using carefully constructed samplesmatched in stellar mass. there is little evidence for a dependence of the redfraction of centrals on overdensity. satellites are consistently redder at alloverdensities, and the satellite quenching efficiency increases withoverdensity at 0.1&lt;z&lt;0.4. this is less marked at higher redshift, but both arenevertheless consistent with the equivalent local measurements. at a givenstellar mass, the fraction of galaxies that are satellites also increases withthe overdensity. at a given overdensity and mass, the obtained relation betweenthe environmental quenching and the satellite fraction agrees well with thesatellite quenching efficiency, demonstrating that the environmental quenchingin the overall population is consistent with being entirely produced throughthe satellite quenching process at least up to z=0.7. however, despite theunprecedented size of our high redshift samples, the associated statisticaluncertainties are still significant and our statements should be understood asapproximations to physical reality, rather than physically exact formulae.

1309.4774	the fmos-cosmos survey of star-forming galaxies at z ~ 1.6. i. h\alpha  -based star formation rates and dust extinction	we present the first results from a near-ir spectroscopic survey of thecosmos field, using the fiber multi-object spectrograph on the subarutelescope, designed to characterize the star-forming galaxy population at$1.4&lt;z&lt;1.7$. the high-resolution mode is implemented to detect h$\alpha$ inemission between $1.6{\rm -}1.8 \mathrm{\mu m}$ with $f_{\rmh\alpha}\gtrsim4\times10^{-17}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. here, we specificallyfocus on 271 sbzk-selected galaxies that yield a h$\alpha$ detection thusproviding a redshift and emission line luminosity to establish the relationbetween star formation rate and stellar mass. with further $j$-bandspectroscopy for 89 of these, the level of dust extinction is assessed bymeasuring the balmer decrement using co-added spectra. we find that theextinction ($0.6\lesssim a_\mathrm{h\alpha} \lesssim 2.5$) rises with stellarmass and is elevated at high masses compared to low-redshift galaxies. usingthis subset of the spectroscopic sample, we further find that the differentialextinction between stellar and nebular emission\hbox{$e_\mathrm{star}(b-v)/e_\mathrm{neb}(b-v)$} is 0.7--0.8, dissimilar tothat typically seen at low redshift. after correcting for extinction, we derivean h$\alpha$-based main sequence with a slope ($0.81\pm0.04$) and normalizationsimilar to previous studies at these redshifts.

1310.3051	the x-ray zurich environmental study (x-zens). i. chandra and xmm-newton  observations of agns in galaxies in nearby groups	we describe x-ray observations with chandra and xmm-newton of 18 galaxygroups (m_group ~ 1-6x10^13 msolar, z~0.05) from the zurich environmental study(zens). we aim to establish the frequency and properties, unaffected by hostgalaxy dilution and obscuration, of agns in central and satellite galaxymembers, also as a function of halo-centric distance. x-ray point-sourcedetections are reported for 22 of 177 observed galaxies, down to a limit off_(0.5-8 kev) ~ 5x10^-15 erg cm^-2 s^-1, corresponding to a limiting luminosityof l_(0.5-8 kev)~3x10^40 erg s^-1. with the majority of the x-ray sourcesattributed to agns of low-to-moderate levels (l/l_edd&gt;~10^-4), we discuss thedetection rate in the context of the occupation of agns to halos of this massscale and redshift, and compare the structural/morphological properties betweenagn-active and non-active galaxies of different rank and location within thegroup halos. we see a slight tendency for agn hosts to have either relativelybrighter/denser disks (or relatively fainter/diffuse bulges) than non-activegalaxies of similar mass. at galaxy mass scales &lt;10^11 msolar, central galaxiesappear to be a factor ~4 more likely to host agns than satellite galaxies ofsimilar mass. this effect, coupled with the tendency for agns to reside inmassive galaxies, explains the (weak) trend for agns to be preferentially foundin the inner regions of groups, with no detectable trend with halo-centricdistance in the frequency of agns within the satellite population. finally, ourdata support other analyses in finding that the rate of decline with redshiftof agn activity in groups matches that of the global agn population, indicatingthat either agns occur preferentially in groups, or that the evolution rate isindependent of halo mass. these trends are of potential importance, and requirex-ray coverage of a larger sample to be solidly confirmed.

1310.3838	the sins/zc-sinf survey of z~2 galaxy kinematics: evidence for  gravitational quenching	as part of the sins/zc-sinf surveys of high-z galaxy kinematics, we derivethe radial distributions of h-alpha surface brightness, stellar mass surfacedensity, and dynamical mass at ~2 kpc resolution in 19 z~2 star-forming diskswith deep sinfoni ao spectroscopy at the eso vlt. from these data we infer theradial distribution of the toomre q-parameter for these main-sequence starforming galaxies (sfgs), covering almost two decades of stellar mass (10^9.6 to10^11.5 solar masses). in more than half of our sfgs, the h-alpha distributionscannot be fit by a centrally peaked distribution, such as an exponential, butare better described by a ring, or the combination of a ring and anexponential. at the same time the kinematic data indicate the presence of amass distribution more centrally concentrated than a single exponentialdistribution for 5 of the 19 galaxies. the resulting q-distributions arecentrally peaked for all, and significantly exceed unity there for threequarters of the sfgs. the occurrence of h-alpha rings and of large nuclearq-values is strongly correlated, and is more common for the more massive sfgs.while our sample is small and there remain substantial uncertainties andcaveats, our observations are consistent with a scenario in which cloudfragmentation and global star formation are secularly suppressed in gas richhigh-z disks from the inside out, as the central stellar mass density of thedisks grows.

1310.4950	the fmos-cosmos survey of star-forming galaxies at z~1.6 ii. the  mass-metallicity relation and the dependence on star formation rate and dust  extinction	we investigate the relationships between stellar mass, gas-phase oxygenabundance (metallicity), star formation rate, and dust content of star-forminggalaxies at z$\sim$1.6 using subaru/fmos spectroscopy in the cosmos field. themass-metallicity relation at $z\sim1.6$ is steeper than the relation observedin the local universe. the steeper mz relation at $z\sim1.6$ is mainly due toevolution in the stellar mass where the mz relation begins to turnover andflatten. this turnover mass is 1.2 dex larger at $z\sim1.6$. the most massivegalaxies at $z\sim1.6$ ($\sim 10^{11}m_\odot$) are enriched to the levelobserved in massive galaxies in the local universe. the mass-metallicityrelation we measure at $z\sim1.6$ supports the suggestion of an empirical uppermetallicity limit that does not significantly evolve with redshift. we find ananti-correlation between metallicity and star formation rate for galaxies at afixed stellar mass at $z\sim1.6$ which is similar to trends observed in thelocal universe. we do not find a relation between stellar mass, metallicity andstar formation rate that is independent of redshift; our data suggest thatthere is redshift evolution in this relation. we examine the relation betweenstellar mass, metallicity and dust extinction. we find that at a fixed stellarmass dustier galaxies tend to be more metal rich. from examination of thestellar masses, metallicities, sfrs and dust extinctions we conclude thatstellar mass is most closely related to dust extinction.

1311.2596	the sins/zc-sinf survey of z~2 galaxy kinematics: evidence for powerful  agn-driven nuclear outflows in massive star-forming galaxies	we report the detection of ubiquitous powerful nuclear outflows in massive (&gt;10^11 msun) z~2 star-forming galaxies (sfgs), which are plausibly driven by anactive galactic nucleus (agn). the sample consists of the eight most massivesfgs from our sins/zc-sinf survey of galaxy kinematics with the imagingspectrometer sinfoni, six of which have sensitive high-resolution adaptiveoptics (ao) assisted observations. all of the objects are disks hosting asignificant stellar bulge. the spectra in their central regions exhibit a broadcomponent in halpha and forbidden [nii] and [sii] line emission, with typicalvelocity fwhm ~ 1500 km/s, [nii]/halpha ratio ~ 0.6, and intrinsic extent of 2- 3 kpc. these properties are consistent with warm ionized gas outflowsassociated with type 2 agn, the presence of which is confirmed via independentdiagnostics in half the galaxies. the data imply a median ionized gas massoutflow rate of ~ 60 msun/yr and mass loading of ~ 3. at larger radii, a weakerbroad component is detected but with lower fwhm ~ 485 km/s and [nii]/halpha ~0.35, characteristic for star formation-driven outflows as found in thelower-mass sins/zc-sinf galaxies. the high inferred mass outflow rates andfrequent occurrence suggest the nuclear outflows efficiently expel gas out ofthe centers of the galaxies with high duty cycles, and may thus contribute tothe process of star formation quenching in massive galaxies. larger samples athigh masses will be crucial to confirm the importance and energetics of thenuclear outflow phenomenon, and its connection to agn activity and bulgegrowth.

1402.1172	zens iv. similar morphological changes associated with mass- and  environment-quenching, and the relative importance of bulge growth versus the  fading of disks	we use zens data at low redshift to study the dependence of the quenchedsatellite fraction and of the morphological mix of these quenched satellites,on three different environmental parameters: group halo mass, halo-centricdistance and large-scale structure over-density. the fraction of quenchedsatellites is independent of halo mass and the surrounding large-scaleoverdensity, but increases towards the centres of the haloes, as previouslyfound. the morphological mix is, however, constant with radial position,indicating that the well-known morphology-density relation results from theincreasing fraction of quenched galaxies towards the centres of haloes. theconstancy of the morphological outcome suggests that mass-quenching andsatellite quenching have the same effect on the morphologies of the galaxies.the quenched satellites have larger b/t and smaller half-light radii than thestar-forming satellites. these are mostly due to differences in the disks. thebulges in quenched satellites have very similar luminosities and surfacebrightness profiles, and any mass growth of the bulges associated withquenching cannot greatly change these quantities. the quenched disks arefainter and have smaller scale lengths than in star-forming satellites. thiscan be explained either by a differential fading of the disks or if disks weregenerally smaller in the past, both of which are expected in an inside-outgrowth of disks. at least at low redshifts, the structure of massive quenchedsatellites is produced by processes that operate before quenching takes place.a comparison with semi-analytic models argues for a reduction in the efficiencyof group halos in quenching their disk satellites and for mechanisms toincrease the b/t of low mass quenched satellites.

1403.6146	on the relation between ssfr and metallicity	in this paper we present an exact general analytic expression$z(ssfr)=y/\lambda(ssfr)+i(ssfr)$ linking the gas metallicity z to the specificstar formation rate (ssfr), that validates and extends the approximate relationput forward by lilly et al. (2013, l13), where $y$ is the yield per stellargeneration, $\lambda(ssfr)$ is the instantaneous ratio between inflow and starformation rate expressed as a function of the ssfr, and $i$ is the integral ofthe past enrichment history, respectively. we then demonstrate that theinstantaneous metallicity of a self-regulating system, such that its ssfrdecreases with decreasing redshift, can be well approximated by the first termon the right-hand side in the above formula, which provides an upper bound tothe metallicity. the metallicity is well approximated also by the l13 idealregulator case, which provides a lower bound to the actual metallicity. wecompare these approximate analytic formulae to numerical results and infer adiscrepancy &lt;0.1 dex in a range of metallicities and almost three orders ofmagnitude in the ssfr. we explore the consequences of the l13 model on themass-weighted metallicity in the stellar component of the galaxies. we findthat the stellar average metallicity lags 0.1-0.2 dex behind the gas-phasemetallicity relation, in agreement with the data.

1403.7203	the zcosmos redshift survey: evolution of the light in bulges and discs  since z~0.8	we studied the chronology of galactic bulge and disc formation by analysingthe relative contributions of these components to the b-band rest-frameluminosity density at different epochs. we present the first estimate of theevolution of the fraction of rest-frame b-band light in galactic bulges anddiscs since redshift z~0.8. we performed a bulge-to-disc decomposition ofhst/acs images of 3266 galaxies in the zcosmos-bright survey with spectroscopicredshifts in the range 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 0.9. we find that the fraction of b-band lightin bulges and discs is $(26 \pm 4)%$ and $(74 \pm 4)%$, respectively. whencompared with rest-frame b-band measurements of galaxies in the local universein the same mass range ($10^{9} m_{\odot}\lessapprox m \lessapprox 10^{11.5}m_{\odot}$), we find that the b-band light in discs decreases by ~30% fromz~0.7-0.9 to z~0, while the light from the bulge increases by ~30% over thesame period of time. we interpret this evolution as the consequence of starformation and mass assembly processes, as well as morphological transformation,which gradually shift stars formed at half the age of the universe fromstar-forming late-type/irregular galaxies toearlier types and ultimately intospheroids.

1406.0183	evidence for wide-spread agn driven outflows in the most massive z~1-2  star forming galaxies	in this paper we follow up on our previous detection of nuclear ionizedoutflows in the most massive (log(m*/msun) &gt;= 10.9) z~1-3 star-forming galaxies(forster schreiber et al.), by increasing the sample size by a factor of six(to 44 galaxies above log(m*/msun) &gt;= 10.9) from a combination of thesins/zc-sinf, luci, gnirs, and kmos^3d spectroscopic surveys. we find a fairlysharp onset of the incidence of broad nuclear emission (fwhm in the ha, [nii],and [sii] lines ~ 450-5300 km/s), with large [nii]/ha ratios, abovelog(m*/msun) ~ 10.9, with about two thirds of the galaxies in this mass rangeexhibiting this component. broad nuclear components near and above theschechter mass are similarly prevalent above and below the main sequence ofstar-forming galaxies, and at z~1 and ~2. the line ratios of the nuclearcomponent are fit by excitation from active galactic nuclei (agn), or by acombination of shocks and photoionization. the incidence of the most massivegalaxies with broad nuclear components is at least as large as that of agnsidentified by x-ray, optical, infrared or radio indicators. the mass loading ofthe nuclear outflows is near unity. our findings provide compelling evidencefor powerful, high-duty cycle, agn-driven outflows near the schechter mass, andacting across the peak of cosmic galaxy formation.

1406.6069	the mass-metallicity and fundamental metallicity relations at z&gt;2 using  vlt and subaru near-infrared spectroscopy of zcosmos galaxies	in the local universe, there is good evidence that, at a given stellar massm, the gas-phase metallicity z is anti-correlated with the star formation rate(sfr) of the galaxies. it has also been claimed that the resulting z(m,sfr)relation is invariant with redshift - the so-called fundamental metallicityrelation (fmr). given a number of difficulties in determining metallicities,especially at higher redshifts, the form of the z(m,sfr) relation and whetherit is really independent of redshift is still very controversial. to explorethis issue at z&gt;2, we used vlt-sinfoni and subaru-moircs near-infraredspectroscopy of 20 zcosmos-deep galaxies at 2.1&lt;z&lt;2.5 to measure the strengthsof up to five emission lines: [oii], hbeta, [oiii], halpha, and [nii]. thisnear-infrared spectroscopy enables us to derive o/h metallicities, and alsosfrs from extinction corrected halpha measurements. we find that themass-metallicity relation (mzr) of these star-forming galaxies at z~2.3 islower than the local sdss mzr by a factor of three to five, a larger changethan found by erb et al. (2006) using [nii]/halpha-based metallicities fromstacked spectra. we discuss how the different selections of the samples andmetallicity calibrations used may be responsible for this discrepancy. thegalaxies show direct evidence that the sfr is still a second parameter in themass-metallicity relation at these redshifts. however, determining whether thez(m,sfr) relation is invariant with epoch depends on the choice ofextrapolation used from local samples, because z&gt;2 galaxies of a given masshave much higher sfrs than the local sdss galaxies. we find that the zcosmosgalaxies are consistent with a non-evolving fmr if we use thephysically-motivated formulation of the z(m,sfr) relation from lilly et al.(2003), but not if we use the empirical formulation of mannucci et al. (2010).

1408.5896	oxygen abundances of zcosmos galaxies at z~1.4 based on five lines and  implications for the fundamental metallicity relation	a relation between the stellar mass m and the gas-phase metallicity z ofgalaxies, the mzr, is observed up to higher redshifts. it is a matter ofdebate, however, if the sfr is a second parameter in the mzr. to explore thisissue at z &gt; 1, we used vlt-sinfoni near-infrared (nir) spectroscopy of eightzcosmos galaxies at 1.3 &lt; z &lt; 1.4 to measure the strengths of four emissionlines: hbeta, [oiii]lambda5007, halpha, and [nii]lambda6584, additional to[oii]lambda3727 measured from vimos. we derive reliable o/h metallicities basedon five lines, and also sfrs from extinction corrected halpha measurements. wefind that the mzr of these star-forming galaxies at z~1.4 is lower than thelocal sdss mzr by a factor of three to five, a larger change than reported inthe literature using [nii]/halpha-based metallicities from individual andstacked spectra. correcting n2-based o/hs using recent results by newman et al.(2014), also the larger fmos sample at z~1.4 of zahid et al. (2014) shows asimilar evolution of the mzr like the zcosmos objects. these observations seemalso in agreement with a non-evolving fmr using the physically motivatedformulation of the fmr from lilly et al.

1410.7389	the mass-metallicity relation of zcosmos galaxies at z ~ 0.7, its  dependence on sfr, and the existence of massive low-metallicity galaxies	(abridged) the knowledge of the number and of the physical nature oflow-metallicity massive galaxies is crucial for the determination andinterpretation of the mass-metallicity relation (mzr). using vlt-isaacnear-infrared (nir) spectroscopy of 39 zcosmos z~0.7 galaxies, we have measuredhalpha and [nii] emission line fluxes for galaxies with [oii], hbeta and [oiii]available from vimos optical spectroscopy. the nir spectroscopy enables us tobreak the degeneracy of the r23 method to derive unambiguously o/h gasmetallicities, and also sfrs from extinction corrected halpha. using, as abenchmark, the position in the d4000 vs. [oiii]/hbeta diagram of galaxies withreliable o/hs from nir spectroscopy, we were able to break the lower/upperbranch r23 degeneracy of additional 900 zcosmos z~0.7 galaxies. additionally,the halpha-based sfr measurements were used to find the best sfr calibrationbased on [oii] for the zcosmos z~0.7 galaxies without halpha measurements. wefind a fraction of 19% of lower mass 9.5&lt;logm/msun&lt;10.3 zcosmos galaxies whichshows a larger evolution of the mzr relation, compared to higher mass galaxies,being more metal poor at a given mass by a factor of 2-3 compared to sdss. thisindicates that the low-mass mzr slope is getting steeper at z~0.7 compared tolocal galaxies. the existence of these metal-poor galaxies at z~0.7 can beinterpreted as the chemical version of galaxy downsizing. moreover, the sampleof zcosmos galaxies shows direct evidence that sfr influences the mzr at theseredshifts. the comparison of the measured metallicities for the zcosmos samplewith the values expected for a non-evolving fundamental metallicity relation(fmr) shows broadly agreement, and reveals that also galaxies with lowermetallicities and typically higher (specific) sfrs, as found in our zcosmossample at z~0.7, are in agreement with the predictions of a non-evolvingz(m,sfr).

0804.4874	the udf05 follow-up of the hudf: ii. constraints on reionization from  z-dropout galaxies	[abridged] we detect three (plus one less certain) z-dropout sources in twoseparate fields of our udf05 hst nicmos images. these z~7 lyman-break galaxy(lbg) candidates allow us to constrain the luminosity function (lf) of the starforming galaxy population at those epochs. by assuming a change in only m* andadopting a linear evolution in redshift, anchored to the measured values atz~6, the best fit evolution coefficient is found to be 0.43+-0.19 mag per unitredshift (0.36+-0.18, if including all four candidates), which provides a valueof m*(z=7.2)=-19.7+-0.3. this implies a steady evolution for the lbg lf out toz~7, at the same rate that is observed throughout the z~3 to 6 period. thisputs a strong constraint on the star-formation histories of z~6 galaxies, whoseensemble star-formation rate density must be lower by a factor 2 at ~170 myrbefore the epoch at which they are observed. in particular, a large fraction ofstars in the z~6 lbg population must form at redshifts well above z~7.extrapolating this steady evolution of the lf out to higher redshifts, weestimate that galaxies would be able to reionize the universe by z~6, providedthat the faint-end slope of the z&gt;7 lf steepens to alpha~-1.9, and that faintgalaxies, with luminosities below the current detection limits, contribute asubstantial fraction of the required ionizing photons. this scenario giveshowever an integrated optical depth to electron scattering that is ~2sigmabelow the wmap-5 measurement. therefore, altogether, our results indicate that,should galaxies be the primary contributors to reionization, either thecurrently detected evolution of the galaxy population slows down at z&gt;7, or thelf evolution must be compensated by a decrease in metallicity and acorresponding increase in ionization efficiency at these early epochs.

1509.05143	extended lyman alpha haloes around individual high-redshift galaxies  revealed by muse	we report the detection of extended ly alpha emission around individualstar-forming galaxies at redshifts z = 3-6 in an ultradeep exposure of thehubble deep field south obtained with muse on the eso-vlt. the data reach alimiting surface brightness (1sigma) of ~1 x 10^-19 erg s^-1 cm^-2 arcsec^-2 inazimuthally averaged radial profiles, an order of magnitude improvement overprevious narrowband imaging. our sample consists of 26 spectroscopicallyconfirmed ly alpha-emitting, but mostly continuum-faint (m_ab &gt;~ 27) galaxies.in most objects the ly alpha emission is considerably more extended than the uvcontinuum light. while 5 of the faintest galaxies in the sample show nosignificantly detected ly alpha haloes, the derived upper limits suggest thatthis is just due to insufficient s/n. ly alpha haloes therefore appear to be(nearly) ubiquitous even for low-mass (~10^8-10^9 m_sun) star-forming galaxiesat z&gt;3. we decompose the ly alpha emission of each object into a compact`continuum-like' and an extended halo component, and infer sizes andluminosities of the haloes. the extended ly alpha emission approximatelyfollows an exponential surface brightness distribution with a scale length of afew kpc. while these haloes are thus quite modest in terms of their absolutesizes, they are larger by a factor of 5-15 than the corresponding rest-frame uvcontinuum sources as seen by hst. they are also much more extended, by a factor~5, than ly alpha haloes around low-redshift star-forming galaxies. between~40% and &gt;90% of the observed ly alpha flux comes from the extended halocomponent, with no obvious correlation of this fraction with either theabsolute or the relative size of the ly alpha halo. our observations providedirect insights into the spatial distribution of at least partly neutral gasresiding in the circumgalactic medium of low to intermediate mass galaxies at z&gt; 3.

0807.1184	from rings to bulges: evidence for rapid secular galaxy evolution at z~2  from integral field spectroscopy in the sins survey	we present ha integral field spectroscopy of well resolved, uv/opticallyselected z~2 star-forming galaxies as part of the sins survey with sinfoni onthe eso vlt. our laser guide star adaptive optics and good seeing data show thepresence of turbulent rotating star forming rings/disks, plus centralbulge/inner disk components, whose mass fractions relative to total dynamicalmass appears to scale with [nii]/ha flux ratio and star formation age. wepropose that the buildup of the central disks and bulges of massive galaxies atz~2 can be driven by the early secular evolution of gas-rich proto-disks. highredshift disks exhibit large random motions. this turbulence may in part bestirred up by the release of gravitational energy in the rapid cold accretionflows along the filaments of the cosmic web. as a result dynamical friction andviscous processes proceed on a time scale of &lt;1 gyr, at least an order ofmagnitude faster than in z~0 disk galaxies. early secular evolution thus drivesgas and stars into the central regions and can build up exponential disks andmassive bulges, even without major mergers. secular evolution along withincreased efficiency of star formation at high surface densities may also helpto account for the short time scales of the stellar buildup observed in massivegalaxies at z~2.

(iii) there is a constancy in the numberdensity of large bulgeless disks out to z~1; the deficit of large disks atearly epochs seems to arise from a smaller number of bulged disks. our resultsindicate that the bulk of the large disk galaxy population has completed itsgrowth by z~1, and support the hypothesis that secular evolution processesproduce - or at least add stellar mass to - the bulge components of diskgalaxies.

astro-ph;0609044	the zurich extragalactic bayesian redshift analyzer (zebra) and its  first application: cosmos	we present zebra, the zurich extragalactic bayesian redshift analyzer. thecurrent version of zebra combines and extends several of the classicalapproaches to produce accurate photometric redshifts down to faint magnitudes.in particular, zebra uses the template-fitting approach to produce maximumlikelihood and bayesian redshift estimates based on: (1.) an automaticiterative technique to correct the original set of galaxy templates to bestrepresent the seds of real galaxies at different redshifts; (2.) a training setof spectroscopic redshifts for a small fraction of the photometric sample; and(3.) an iterative technique for bayesian redshift estimates, which extracts thefull two-dimensional redshift and template probability function for eachgalaxy. we demonstrate the performance of zebra by applying it to a sample of866 i_ab &lt;= 22.5 cosmos galaxies with available u*, b, v, g', r', i', z' andk_s photometry and zcosmos spectroscopic redshifts in the range 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.3.adopting a 5-sigma-clipping that excludes less than 10 galaxies, both themaximum likelihood and bayesian estimates for this sample have an accuracydz/1+z better than 0.03. similar accuracies are recovered using mock galaxies.

(1996). the zest classification breaks most of the degeneracy betweendifferent galaxy populations that affects morphological classifications basedon only some of the diagnostics included in zest. as a first application, wepresent the evolution since z~1 of the luminosity functions of cosmos galaxiesof early, disk and irregular galaxies and, for disk galaxies, of differentbulge-to-disk ratios. overall, we find that the lf up to a redshift z=1 isconsistent with a pure-luminosity evolution (of about 0.95 magnitudes at z\~0.7). we highlight however two trends, that are in general agreement with adown-sizing scenario for galaxy formation: (1.) a deficit of a factor of abouttwo at z~0.7 of mb&gt;-20.5 structurally--classified early--type galaxies; and(2.) an excess of a factor of about three, at a similar redshift, of irregulargalaxies.

(1992) local luminosity function is seen at low redshifts z &lt; 0.2 aroundm(b) ~ -18$ and these galaxies may possibly represent the descendants of theevolving blue population seen at higher redshifts. the changes seen in theluminosity function are also apparent in color-magnitude diagrams constructedat different epochs and in the v/v_max statistic computed as a function ofspectral type. finally, it is argued that the picture of galaxy evolutionpresented here is consistent with the very much smaller samples of fieldgalaxies that have been selected in other wavebands, and with the results ofstudies of galaxies selected on the basis of mg ii 2799 absorption.

astro-ph;9906171	hubble space telescope imaging of the cfrs and ldss redshift  surveys---iii. field elliptical galaxies at 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.0	surface photometry has been performed on a sample of 46 field ellipticalgalaxies. these galaxies are described well by a devaucouleurs r^{1/4} profile.the sample was selected from the combined canada-france and ldss redshiftsurveys and spans the range 0.20 &lt; z &lt; 1.00. the relationship between galaxyhalf-light radius and luminosity evolves such that a galaxy of a given size ismore luminous by delta m_b=-0.97 \pm 0.14 mag at z=0.92 and the mean rest-framecolor shifts blueward by delta (u-v) =-0.68 \pm 0.11 at z=0.92 relative to thelocal cluster relations. approximately 1/3 of these elliptical galaxies exhibit[oii] 3727 emission lines with equivalent widths &gt; 15 angstroms indicatingongoing star formation. estimated star-formation rates imply that \le 5% of thestellar mass in the elliptical galaxy population has been formed since z=1. wesee no evidence for a decline in the space density of early-type galaxies withlook-back time. the &lt;v/v_{max}&gt; statistics and a comparison with localluminosity functions are both consistent with the view that the population ofmassive early-type galaxies was largely in place by z~1. this implies thatmerging is not required since that time to produce the present-day spacedensity of elliptical galaxies.

astro-ph;9909211	hubble space telescope imaging of the cfrs and ldss redshift surveys -  iv. influence of mergers in the evolution of faint field galaxies from z~1	hst images of a sample of 285 galaxies with measured z from the cfrs andautofib-ldss redshift surveys are analysed to derive the evolution of themerger fraction out to z~1. we have performed visual and machine-based mergeridentifications, as well as counts of bright pairs of galaxies with magnitudedifferences less than 1.5 mag. we find that the pair fraction increases with z,with up to ~20% of the galaxies being in physical pairs at z~0.75-1. we derivea merger fraction varying with z as (1+z)^{3.2 +/- 0.6}, after correction forline-of-sight contamination, in excellent agreement with the merger fractionderived from the visual classification of mergers for which m = 3.4 +/- 0.6.after correcting for seeing effects on the ground-based selection of surveygalaxies, we conclude that the pair fraction evolves as (1+z)^{2.7 +/- 0.6}.this implies that an average l* galaxy will have undergone 0.8 to 1.8 mergerevents from z=1 to 0, with 0.5 to 1.2 merger events occuring in a 2 gyr timespan at z~0.9. this result is consistent with predictions from semi-analyticalmodels of galaxy formation. from the simple co-addition of the observedluminosities of the galaxies in pairs, physical mergers are computed to lead toa brightening of 0.5 mag for each pair on average, and a boost in starformation rate of a factor of 2, as derived from the average [o ii] equivalentwidths. mergers of galaxies are therefore contributing significantly to theevolution of both the luminosity function and luminosity density of theuniverse out to z~1.

0810.2245	the zcosmos redshift survey: the three-dimensional classification cube  and bimodality in galaxy physical properties	aims. we investigate the relationships between three main optical galaxyobservables (spectral properties, colours, and morphology), exploiting the dataset provided by the cosmos/zcosmos survey. the purpose of this paper is todefine a simple galaxy classification cube, using a carefully selected sampleof around 1000 galaxies. methods. using medium resolution spectra of the first1k zcosmos-bright sample, optical photometry from the subaru/cosmosobservations, and morphological measurements derived from acs imaging, weanalyze the properties of the galaxy population out to z~1. applying threestraightforward classification schemes (spectral, photometric, andmorphological), we identify two main galaxy types, which appear to be linked tothe bimodality of galaxy population. the three parametric classificationsconstitute the axes of a "classification cube". results. a very good agreementexists between the classification from spectral data (quiescent/star-forminggalaxies) and that based on colours (red/blue galaxies). the third parameter(morphology) is less well correlated with the first two: in fact a goodcorrelation between the spectral classification and that based on morphologicalanalysis (early-/late-type galaxies) is achieved only after partiallycomplementing the morphological classification with additional colourinformation. finally, analyzing the 3d-distribution of all galaxies in thesample, we find that about 85% of the galaxies show a fully concordantclassification, being either quiescent, red, bulge-dominated galaxies (~20%) orstar-forming, blue, disk-dominated galaxies (~65%). these results imply thatthe galaxy bimodality is a consistent behaviour both in morphology, colour anddominant stellar population, at least out to z~1.
