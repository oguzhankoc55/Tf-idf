0901.4111	the effects of gas on morphological transformation in mergers:  implications for bulge and disk demographics	transformation of disks into spheroids via mergers is a well-accepted elementof galaxy formation models. however, recent simulations have shown that bulgeformation is suppressed in increasingly gas-rich mergers. we investigate theglobal implications of these results in a cosmological framework, usingindependent approaches: empirical halo-occupation models (where galaxies arepopulated in halos according to observations) and semi-analytic models. inboth, ignoring the effects of gas in mergers leads to the over-production ofspheroids: low and intermediate-mass galaxies are predicted to bebulge-dominated (b/t~0.5 at &lt;10^10 m_sun), with almost no bulgeless systems),even if they have avoided major mergers. including the different physicalbehavior of gas in mergers immediately leads to a dramatic change: bulgeformation is suppressed in low-mass galaxies, observed to be gas-rich (givingb/t~0.1 at &lt;10^10 m_sun, with a number of bulgeless galaxies in good agreementwith observations). simulations and analytic models which neglect thesimilarity-breaking behavior of gas have difficulty reproducing the strongobserved morphology-mass relation. however, the observed dependence of gasfractions on mass, combined with suppression of bulge formation in gas-richmergers, naturally leads to the observed trends. discrepancies betweenobservations and models that ignore the role of gas increase with redshift; inmodels that treat gas properly, galaxies are predicted to be lessbulge-dominated at high redshifts, in agreement with the observations. wediscuss implications for the global bulge mass density and future observationaltests.

0901.4337	recovering stellar population properties and redshifts from broad-band  photometry of simulated galaxies: lessons for sed modeling	we present a detailed analysis of our ability to determine stellar masses,ages, reddening and extinction values, and star formation rates ofhigh-redshift galaxies by modeling broad-band seds with stellar populationsynthesis. in order to do so, we computed synthetic optical-to-nir seds formodel galaxies taken from hydrodynamical merger simulations placed at redshifts1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3. viewed under different angles and during different evolutionaryphases, the simulations represent a wide variety of galaxy types (disks,mergers, spheroids). we show that simulated galaxies span a wide range in sedsand color, comparable to these of observed galaxies. in all star-formingphases, dust attenuation has a large effect on colors, seds, and fluxes. thebroad-band seds were then fed to a standard sed modeling procedure andresulting stellar population parameters were compared to their true values.disk galaxies generally show a decent median correspondence between the trueand estimated mass and age, but suffer from large uncertainties. during themerger itself, we find larger offsets (e.g., log m_recovered - log m_true =-0.13^{+0.10}_{-0.14}). e(b-v) values are generally recovered well, but theestimated total visual absorption av is consistently too low, increasingly sofor larger optical depths. since the largest optical depths occur during thephases of most intense star formation, it is for the highest sfrs that we findthe largest underestimates. the masses, ages, e(b-v), av, and sfr of mergerremnants (spheroids) are very well reproduced. we discuss possible biases insed modeling results caused by mismatch between the true and template starformation history, dust distribution, metallicity variations and agncontribution.

0903.3064	the imprint of dissipation on the shapes of merger remnant losvds	the properties of elliptical galaxies are broadly consistent with simulatedremnants of gas-rich mergers between spirals, motivating more detailed studiesof the imprint of this formation mechanism on the remnant distributionfunction. gas has a strong impact on the non-gaussian shapes of theline-of-sight velocity distributions (losvds) of the merger remnant, owing tothe embedded disk that forms out of the gas that retains its angular momentumduring the merger, and the strong central mass concentration from the gas thatfalls to the center. the deviations from gaussianity are parametrized by thegauss-hermite moments h_3 and h_4, which are related to the skewness andkurtosis of the losvds. we quantify the dependence of the (h_3,h_4)-v/sigmarelations on the initial gas fraction of the progenitor disks in 1:1 mergers,using gadget-2 simulations including star formation, radiative cooling, andfeedback from supernovae and agn. for gas fractions f_gas &lt; ~15% the overallcorrelation between h_3 and v/sigma is weak, consisting of a flat negativelycorrelated component arising from edge-on viewing angles plus a steeppositively correlated part from face-on projections. the spread in v/sigmavalues decreases toward high positive h_4, and there is a trend toward lowerh_4 as the gas fraction increases from 0 to 15%. for f_gas &gt; ~20% the (h_3,4)-v/sigma distributions look quite different - there is a tight negative h_3-v/sigma correlation, and a wide spread in v/sigma values at all h_4, in betteragreement with observations. re-mergers of the high-f_gas remnants (drymergers) produce slowly rotating systems with nearly gaussian losvds. weexplain all of these trends in terms of the underlying orbit structure of theremnants, as molded by their dissipative formation histories.

0904.0004	the formation of high redshift submillimeter galaxies	we describe a model for the formation of \zsim 2 submillimeter galaxies(smgs) which simultaneously accounts for both average and bright smgs whileproviding a reasonable match to their mean observed spectral energydistributions (seds). by coupling hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy mergerswith the high resolution 3d polychromatic radiative transfer code sunrise, wefind that a mass sequence of merger models which use observational constraintsas physical input naturally yield objects which exhibit black hole, bulge, andh2 gas masses similar to those observed in smgs. the dominant drivers behindthe 850 micron flux are the masses of the merging galaxies and the stellarbirthcloud covering fraction. the most luminous (s850 ~ 15 mjy) sources arerecovered by ~10^13 msun 1:1 major mergers with a birthcloud covering fractionclose to unity, whereas more average smgs ~5-7 mjy) may be formed in lower masshalos ~5x10^12 msun. these models demonstrate the need for high spatialresolution hydrodynamic and radiative transfer simulations in matching both themost luminous sources as well as the full seds of smgs. while these modelssuggest a natural formation mechanism for smgs, they do not attempt to matchcosmological statistics of galaxy populations; future efforts along this linewill help ascertain the robustness of these models.

0706.3706	modeling the dust properties of z ~ 6 quasars with art^2 --  all-wavelength radiative transfer with adaptive refinement tree	the detection of large quantities of dust in z ~ 6 quasars by infrared andradio surveys presents puzzles for the formation and evolution of dust in theseearly systems. previously (li et al. 2007), we showed that luminous quasars atz &gt; 6 can form through hierarchical mergers of gas-rich galaxies. here, wecalculate the dust properties of simulated quasars and their progenitors usinga three-dimensional monte carlo radiative transfer code, art^2 --all-wavelength radiative transfer with adaptive refinement tree. art^2incorporates a radiative equilibrium algorithm for dust emission, an adaptivegrid for inhomogeneous density, a multiphase model for the ism, and asupernova-origin dust model. we reproduce the sed and dust properties of sdssj1148+5251, and find that the infrared emission are closely associated with theformation and evolution of the quasar host. the system evolves from a cold to awarm ulirg owing to heating and feedback from stars and agn. furthermore, theagn has significant implications for the interpretation of observation of thehosts. our results suggest that vigorous star formation in merging progenitorsis necessary to reproduce the observed dust properties of z~6 quasars,supporting a merger-driven origin for luminous quasars at high redshifts andthe starburst-to-quasar evolutionary hypothesis.

0905.2184	the star-forming molecular gas in high redshift submillimeter galaxies	we present a model for the co molecular line emission from high redshiftsubmillimeter galaxies (smgs). by combining hydrodynamic simulations of gasrich galaxy mergers with the polychromatic radiative transfer code, sunrise,and the 3d non-lte molecular line radiative transfer code, turtlebeach, we showthat if smgs are typically a transient phase of major mergers, their observedcompact co spatial extents, broad line widths, and high excitation conditions(co sed) are naturally explained. in this sense, smgs can be understood asscaled-up analogs to local ulirgs. we utilize these models to investigate theusage of co as an indicator of physical conditions. we find that care must betaken when applying standard techniques. the usage of co line widths as adynamical mass estimator from smgs can possibly overestimate the true enclosedmass by a factor ~1.5-2. at the same time, assumptions of line ratios of unityfrom co j=3-2 (and higher lying lines) to co (j=1-0) will oftentimes lead tounderestimates of the inferred gas mass. we provide tests for these models byoutlining predictions for experiments which are imminently feasible with thecurrent generation of bolometer arrays and radio-wave spectrometers.

0905.2411	color distributions, number and mass densities of massive galaxies at  1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3: comparing observations with merger simulations	we present a comparison between the observed color distribution, number andmass density of massive galaxies at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3 and a model by hopkins et al.that relates the quasar and galaxy population on the basis of gas-rich mergers.in order to test the hypothesis that quiescent red galaxies are formed after agas-rich merger involving quasar activity, we confront photometry of massive (m&gt; 4x10^10 msun) galaxies extracted from the fires, goods-south, and musycsurveys, together spanning an area of 496 arcmin^2, with synthetic photometryfrom hydrodynamical merger simulations. as in the hopkins et al. (2006b) model,we use the observed quasar luminosity function to estimate the merger rate. wefind that the synthetic u-v and v-j colors of galaxies that had a quasar phasein their past match the colors of observed galaxies that are best characterizedby a quiescent stellar population. at z ~ 2.6, the observed number and massdensity of quiescent red galaxies with m &gt; 4x10^10 msun is consistent with themodel in which every quiescent massive galaxy underwent a quasar phase in thepast. at z ~ 1.9, 2.8 times less quiescent galaxies are observed than predictedby the model as descendants of higher redshift quasars. the merger model alsopredicts a large number of galaxies undergoing merger-driven star formation. wefind that the predicted number and mass density accounts for 30-50% of theobserved massive star-forming galaxies. however, their colors do not matchthose of observed star-forming galaxies. in particular, the colors of dusty redgalaxies are not reproduced by the simulations. several possible origins ofthis discrepancy are discussed. the observational constraints on the validityof the model are currently limited by cosmic variance and uncertainties instellar population synthesis and radiative transfer.

0907.2442	resonant stripping as the origin of dwarf spheroidal galaxies	dwarf spheroidal galaxies are the most dark matter dominated systems in thenearby universe and their origin is one of the outstanding puzzles of howgalaxies form. dwarf spheroidals are poor in gas and stars, making themunusually faint, and those known as ultra-faint dwarfs have by far the lowestmeasured stellar content of any galaxy. previous theories require that dwarfspheroidals orbit near giant galaxies like the milky way, but some dwarfs havebeen observed in the outskirts of the local group. here we report simulationsof encounters between dwarf disk galaxies and somewhat larger objects. we findthat the encounters excite a process, which we term ``resonant stripping'',that can transform them into dwarf spheroidals. this effect is distinct fromother mechanisms proposed to form dwarf spheroidals, including mergers,galaxy-galaxy harassment, or tidal and ram pressure stripping, because it isdriven by gravitational resonances. it may account for the observed propertiesof dwarf spheroidals in the local group, including their morphologies andkinematics. resonant stripping predicts that dwarf spheroidals should formthrough encounters, leaving detectable long stellar streams and tails.

0909.2039	discriminating between the physical processes that drive spheroid size  evolution	massive galaxies at high-z have smaller effective radii than those today, butsimilar central densities. their size growth therefore relates primarily to theevolving abundance of low-density material. various models have been proposedto explain this evolution, which have different implications for galaxy, star,and bh formation. we compile observations of spheroid properties as a functionof redshift and use them to test proposed models. evolution in progenitorgas-richness with redshift gives rise to initial formation of smaller spheroidsat high-z. these systems can then evolve in apparent or physical size viaseveral channels: (1) equal-density 'dry' mergers, (2) later major or minor'dry' mergers with less-dense galaxies, (3) adiabatic expansion, (4) evolutionin stellar populations &amp; mass-to-light-ratio gradients, (5) age-dependent biasin stellar mass estimators, (6) observational fitting/selection effects. if anyone of these is tuned to explain observed size evolution, they make distinctpredictions for evolution in other galaxy properties. only model (2) isconsistent with observations as a dominant effect. it is the only model whichallows for an increase in m_bh/m_bulge with redshift. still, the amount ofmerging needed is larger than that observed or predicted. we therefore comparecosmologically motivated simulations, in which all these effects occur, &amp; showthey are consistent with all the observational constraints. effect (2), whichbuilds up an extended low-density envelope, does dominate the evolution, buteffects 1,3,4, &amp; 6 each contribute ~20% to the size evolution (a net factor~2). this naturally also predicts evolution in m_bh-sigma similar to thatobserved.

0910.2234	a physical model for z~2 dust obscured galaxies	we present a physical model for the origin of z~2 dust-obscured galaxies(dogs), a class of high-redshift ulirgs selected at 24 micron which areparticularly optically faint (24/r&gt;1000). by combining n-body/sph simulationsof high redshift galaxy evolution with 3d polychromatic dust radiative transfermodels, we find that luminous dogs (with f24 &gt; 0.3 mjy at z~2 are well-modeledas extreme gas-rich mergers in massive (~5x10^12-10^13 msun) halos, withelevated star formation rates (~500-1000 msun/yr) and/or significant agn growth(mdot &gt; 0.5 msun/yr), whereas less luminous dogs are more diverse in nature. atfinal coalescence, merger-driven dogs transition from being starburst dominatedto agn dominated, evolving from a "bump" to a power-law shaped mid-ir (irac)spectral energy distribution (sed). after the dog phase, the galaxy settlesback to exhibiting a "bump" sed with bluer colors and lower star formationrates. while canonically power-law galaxies are associated with beingagn-dominated, we find that the power-law mid-ir sed can owe both to direct agncontribution, as well as to a heavily dust obscured stellar bump at times thatthe galaxy is starburst dominated. thus power-law galaxies can be eitherstarburst or agn dominated. less luminous dogs can be well-represented eitherby mergers, or by massive ($m_{\rm baryon} ~5x10^11 msun) secularly evolvinggas-rich disc galaxies (with sfr &gt; 50 msun/yr). by utilising similar models asthose employed in the smg formation study of narayanan et al. (2010), weinvestigate the connection between dogs and smgs. we find that the most heavilystar-forming merger driven dogs can be selected as submillimetre galaxies(smgs), while both merger-driven and secularly evolving dogs typically satisfythe bzk selection criteria.

0707.3141	the nature of co emission from z~6 quasars	we investigate the nature of co emission from z~6 quasars by combiningnon-lte radiative transfer calculations with merger-driven models of z~6 quasarformation that arise naturally in lcdm cosmological simulations. we considerfour model quasars formed in 10^12-10^13 m_sun halos from different merginghistories. our main results follow. owing to massive starbursts and funnelingof dense gas into the nuclear regions of merging galaxies, the co is highlyexcited and the flux density peaks between j=5-8. the co morphology of z~6quasars often exhibits multiple emission peaks which arise from h2concentrations which have not yet fully coalesced. quasars at z~6 display alarge range of sightline dependent line widths such that the lines arenarrowest when the rotating h2 gas associated with the quasar is viewed face-on(when l_b is largest), and broadest when the gas is seen edge-on (when l_b islowest). thus for all models selection effects exist such that quasars selectedfor optical luminosity are preferentially face-on which may result in detectedco line widths narrower than the median. the sightline averaged line width isreflective of the circular velocity (v_c) of the host halo, and ranges fromsigma~300-650 km/s. for optically selected qsos, 10-25% (halo-mass dependant)of sightlines have narrow line widths compatible with the sole co detection atz&gt;6, j1148+5251. when accounting for both the temporal evolution of co linewidths, as well as the redshift evolution of halo v_c, these modelsself-consistently account for the co line widths of both z~2 sub-mm galaxiesand qso's. finally, the dynamical mass derived from the sightline averaged linewidths provides a good estimate of the total mass, and allows for a stellarbulge and smbh consistent with the local m_bh-m_bulge relation.

1001.0799	orbital structure of merger remnants: trends with gas fraction in 1:1  mergers	since the violent relaxation in hierarchical merging is incomplete,elliptical galaxies retain a wealth of information about their formationpathways in their present-day orbital structure. a variety of evidenceindicates that gas-rich major mergers play an important role in the formationof elliptical galaxies. we simulate 1:1 disk mergers at seven different initialgas fractions ranging from 0 to 40%, using the treesph code gadget-2. weclassify the stellar orbits in each remnant and construct radial profiles ofthe orbital content, intrinsic shape, and orientation. the dissipationlessremnants are typically prolate-triaxial, dominated by box orbits within r_c ~1.5reff, and by tube orbits in their outer parts. as the gas fractionincreases, the box orbits within r_c are increasingly replaced by a populationof short axis tubes (z-tubes) with near zero net rotation, and the remnantsbecome progressively more oblate and round. the long axis tube (x-tube) orbitsare highly streaming and relatively insensitive to the gas fraction, implyingthat their angular momentum is retained from the dynamically cold initialconditions. outside r_c, the orbital structure is essentially unchanged by thegas. the 15-20% gas remnants often display disk-like kinematically distinctcores (kdcs). these remnants show an interesting resemblance, in both theirvelocity maps and intrinsic orbital structure, to the kdc galaxy ngc4365 (vanden bosch et al. 2008). at 30-40% gas, the remnants are rapidly rotating, withsharp embedded disks on ~ 1reff scales. we predict a characteristic, physicallyintuitive orbital structure for 1:1 disk merger remnants, with a distincttransition between 1 and 3reff that will be readily observable with combineddata from the 2d kinematics surveys sauron and smeagol.

1005.3020	the kennicutt-schmidt star formation relation at z~2	recent observations of excited co emission lines from z~2 disc galaxies haveshed light on the kennicutt-schmidt relation at high-z via observed sfr-co(j=2-1) and (j=3-2) relations. here, we describe a novel methodology forutilising these observations of high-excitation co to derive the underlyingschmidt (sfr-rho^n) relationship. to do this requires an understanding of thepotential effects of differential co excitation with sfr. if the most heavilystar-forming galaxies have a larger fraction of their gas in highly excited costates than the lower sfr galaxies, then the observed molecular sfr-co^alphaindex, alpha, will be less than the underlying (volumetric) schmidt index, n.utilising a combination of sph models of galaxy evolution and molecular lineradiative transfer, we present the first calculations of co excitation in z~2disc galaxies with the aim of developing a mapping between various observedsfr-co relationships and the underlying schmidt relation. we find that even inrelatively luminous z~2 discs, differential excitation does indeed exist,resulting in alpha &lt; n for highly excited co lines. this means that an observed(e.g.) sfr-co (j=3-2) relation does not map linearly to sfr-h2 relation. weutilise our model results to provide a mapping from alpha to n for the range ofschmidt indices n=1-2. by comparing to recent observational surveys, we findthat the observed sfr-co (j=2-1) and sfr-co (j=3-2) relations suggest that anunderlying sfr rho^1.5 relation describes z~2 disc galaxies.

1008.4127	on sizes, kinematics, m/l gradients, and light profiles of massive  compact galaxies at z~2	we present a detailed analysis of the structure and resolved stellarpopulations of simulated merger remnants, and compare them to observations ofcompact quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2. we find that major merging is a viablemechanism to produce systems of ~ 10^11 msun and ~ 1 kpc size, provided the gasfraction at the time of final coalescence is high (~ 40%), and provided thatthe progenitors are compact star-forming galaxies, as expected at highredshift. their integrated spectral energy distributions and velocitydispersions are in good agreement with the observations, and their position inthe (v_{maj}/sigma, ellipticity) diagram traces the upper envelope of thedistribution of lower redshift early-type galaxies. the simulated mergerremnants show time- and sightline-dependent m/l ratio gradients that resultfrom a superposition of radially dependent stellar age, stellar metallicity,and extinction. the median ratio of effective radius in rest-frame v-band lightto that in mass surface density is ~ 2 during the quiescent remnant phase. thisis typically expressed by a negative color gradient (i.e., red core), which weexpect to correlate with the integrated color of the system. finally, thesimulations differ from the observations in their surface brightness profileshape. the simulated remnants are typically best fit by high (n &gt;&gt; 4) sersicindices, whereas observed quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2 tend to be less cuspy(median n ~ 2.3). limiting early star formation in the progenitors may berequired to prevent the simulated merger remnants from having extended wings.

1009.4940	recoiling black holes in merging galaxies: relationship to agn  lifetimes, starbursts, and the m-sigma relation	gravitational-wave (gw) recoil of merging supermassive black holes (smbhs)may influence the co-evolution of smbhs and their host galaxies. we examinethis possibility using sph/n-body simulations of gaseous galaxy mergers inwhich the merged bh receives a recoil kick. this enables us to follow recoilingbhs in self-consistent, evolving merger remnants. in contrast to recent studieson similar topics, we conduct a large parameter study, generating a suite ofover 200 simulations with more than 60 merger models and a range of recoilvelocities (vk). our main results are as follows. (1) bhs kicked at nearly thecentral escape speed (vesc) may oscillate on large orbits for up to a hubbletime, but in gas-rich mergers, bhs kicked with up to ~ 0.7 vesc may be confinedto the central few kpc of the galaxy, owing to gas drag and steep centralpotentials. (2) vesc in gas-rich mergers may increase rapidly during finalcoalescence, in which case trajectories may depend on the timing of the bhmerger relative to the formation of the potential well. (3) recoil eventsgenerally reduce the lifetimes of bright active galactic nuclei (agn), but mayactually extend agn lifetimes at lower luminosities. (4) kinematically-offsetagn (v &gt; 800 km s^-1) may be observable for up to ~ 10 myr either immediatelyafter the recoil or during pericentric passages through a gas-rich remnant. (5)spatially-offset agn (r &gt; 1 kpc) generally have low luminosities and lifetimesof ~ 1 - 100 myr. (6) rapidly-recoiling bhs may be up to ~ 5 times less massivethan their stationary counterparts. this lowers the normalization of them-sigma relation and contributes to both intrinsic and overall scatter. (7)finally, the displacement of agn feedback after a recoil event enhances centralstar formation rates, thereby extending the starburst phase of the merger andcreating a denser stellar cusp.

1103.3701	recoiling black holes in merging galaxies	gravitational-wave (gw) recoil of merging supermassive black holes (smbhs)may influence the co-evolution of smbhs and their host galaxies. we examinethis possibility using sph/n-body simulations of gaseous galaxy mergers inwhich the merged bh receives a recoil kick. with our suite of over 200 mergersimulations, we identify systematic trends in the behavior of recoiling bhs.our main results are as follows. (1) while bhs kicked at nearly the centralescape speed (vesc) are essentially "lost" to the galaxy, in gas rich mergers,bhs kicked with up to about 0.7 vesc may be confined to the central few kpc ofthe galaxy. (2) the inflow of cold gas during a gas-rich major merger may causea rapid increase in central escape speed; in such cases recoil trajectorieswill depend on the timing of the bh merger relative to the change in vesc. (3)recoil events generally reduce the lifetimes of bright active galactic nuclei(agn) but may actually extend agn lifetimes at lower luminosities. (4)recoiling agn may be observable via kinematic offsets (v &gt; 500 km s^-1) orspatial offsets (r &gt; 1 kpc) for lifetimes of up to about 10 - 100 myr. (5)rapidly-recoiling bhs may be up to about 5 times less massive than theirstationary counterparts. these mass deficits lower the normalization of the m -sigma relation and contribute to both intrinsic and overall scatter. (6)finally, the displacement of agn feedback by a recoil event causes highercentral star formation rates in the merger remnant, thereby extending thestarburst phase of the merger and creating a denser, more massive stellar cusp.

1104.0246	the effects of a hot gaseous halo in galaxy major mergers	cosmological hydrodynamical simulations as well as observations indicate thatspiral galaxies are comprised of five different components: dark matter halo,stellar disc, stellar bulge, gaseous disc and gaseous halo. while the firstfour components have been extensively considered in numerical simulations ofbinary galaxy mergers, the effect of a hot gaseous halo has usually beenneglected even though it can contain up to 80% of the total gas within thegalaxy virial radius. we present a series of hydrodynamic simulations of majormergers of disc galaxies, that for the first time include a diffuse, rotating,hot gaseous halo. through cooling and accretion, the hot halo can dissipate andrefuel the cold gas disc before and after a merger. this cold gas cansubsequently form stars, thus impacting the morphology and kinematics of theremnant. simulations of isolated systems with total mass m~10^12msun show anearly constant star formation rate of ~5msun/yr if the hot gaseous halo isincluded, while the star formation rate declines exponentially if it isneglected. we conduct a detailed study of the star formation efficiency duringmergers and find that the presence of a hot gaseous halo reduces the starburstefficiency (e=0.5) compared to simulations without a hot halo (e=0.68).moreover we find cases where the stellar mass of the merger remnant is lowerthan the sum of the stellar mass of the two progenitor galaxies when evolved inisolation. this suggests a revision to semi-analytic galaxy formation modelswhich assume that a merger always leads to enhanced star formation. we showthat adding the hot gas component has a significant effect on the kinematicsand internal structure of the merger remnants, like an increased abundance offast rotators and an r^(1/4) surface brightness profile at small scales.

1109.6574	recoiling black holes in merging galaxies: relationship to agn lifetimes  and merger remnant properties	central supermassive black holes (smbhs) are a ubiquitous feature oflocally-observed galaxies, and ample evidence suggests that the growth of smbhsand their host galaxies is closely linked. however, in the event of a merger,gravitational-wave (gw) recoil may displace a smbh from its galactic center, oreject it entirely. to explore the consequences of this phenomenon, we usehydrodynamic simulations of gaseous galaxy mergers that include a range of bhrecoil velocities. we have generated a suite of over 200 simulations with morethan 60 merger models, enabling us to identify systematic trends in thebehavior of recoiling bhs -- specifically (i) their dynamics, (ii) theirobservable signatures, and (iii) their effects on bh/galaxy co-evolution. (i)recoiling bh trajectories depend heavily on the gas content of the host galaxy;maximal bh displacements from the center may vary by up to an order ofmagnitude between gas-rich and gas-poor mergers. in some cases, recoiltrajectories also depend on the timing of the bh merger relative to theformation of the galaxy merger remnant. (ii) recoiling bhs may be observable asoffset active galactic nuclei (agn) via either kinematic offsets (v &gt; 800 kms^-1) or spatial offsets (r &gt; 1 kpc) for lifetimes of about 1 - 100 myr. inaddition, recoil events affect the total agn lifetime. gw recoil generallyreduces the lifetimes of bright agn, but may extend lower-luminosity agnlifetimes. (iii) rapidly-recoiling bhs may be up to about 5 times less massivethan their stationary counterparts. these mass deficits lower the normalizationof the m - sigma relation and contribute to both intrinsic and overall scatter.furthermore, recoil events displace agn feedback from the galactic center,which enhances central star formation rates. this results in longer starburstphases and higher central stellar densities in merger remnants.

1205.2533	on galaxies and homology	the definition of homology for single-component galaxies is clear, but formulti-component (luminous and dark matter) galaxies there is some ambiguity. weattempt to clarify the situation by carefully separating the different conceptsof homology that have been used to date. we argue that the most usefuldefinition is that a set of galaxies is homologous if they are the same in allrespects up to a set of three dimensional scaling constants which may differfrom one galaxy to the next. noting that we are free to choose the dimensionalconstants, we find that a set of hydrodynamic simulated galaxy merger remnantsis significantly closer to homologous when the dimensional length constant istaken to be the radius containing equal amounts of dark and baryonic matterrather than the usual observationally motivated choice of the baryonichalf-mass radius. once the correct dimensional scaling constants are used, thestellar velocity dispersion anisotropy is essentially the sole source of thevariation in the kinematic structure of these simulated merger remnants. inorder to facilitate the use of these scaling constants to analyse observedgalaxies, we calculated the relationship between our preferred dimensionalscaling constants and the typical observationally accessible quantities.

0711.1361	molecular star formation rate indicators in galaxies	we derive a physical model for the observed relations between star formationrate (sfr) and molecular line (co and hcn) emission in galaxies, and show howthese observed relations are reflective of the underlying star formation law.we do this by combining 3d non-lte radiative transfer calculations withhydrodynamic simulations of isolated disk galaxies and galaxy mergers. wedemonstrate that the observed sfr-molecular line relations are driven by therelationship between molecular line emission and gas density, and anchored bythe index of the underlying schmidt law controlling the sfr in the galaxy.lines with low critical densities (e.g. co j=1-0) are typically thermalized andtrace the gas density faithfully. in these cases, the sfr will be related toline luminosity with an index similar to the schmidt law index. lines with highcritical densities greater than the mean density of most of the emitting cloudsin a galaxy (e.g. co j=3-2, hcn j=1-0) will have only a small amount ofthermalized gas, and consequently a superlinear relationship between molecularline luminosity and mean gas density. this results in a sfr-line luminosityindex less than the schmidt index for high critical density tracers. oneobservational consequence of this is a significant redistribution of light fromthe small pockets of dense, thermalized gas to diffuse gas along the line ofsight, and prodigious emission from subthermally excited gas. at the higheststar formation rates, the sfr-lmol slope tends to the schmidt index, regardlessof the molecular transition. the fundamental relation is the kennicutt-schmidtlaw, rather than the relation between sfr and molecular line luminosity. we usethese results to make imminently testable predictions for the sfr-molecularline relations of unobserved transitions.

1206.0011	star formation in galaxy mergers with realistic models of stellar  feedback &amp; the interstellar medium	we use simulations with realistic models for stellar feedback to study galaxymergers. these high resolution (1 pc) simulations follow formation anddestruction of individual gmcs and star clusters. the final starburst isdominated by in situ star formation, fueled by gas which flows inwards due toglobal torques. the resulting high gas density results in rapid star formation.the gas is self gravitating, and forms massive (~10^10 m_sun) gmcs andsubsequent super-starclusters (masses up to 10^8 m_sun). however, in contrastto some recent simulations, the bulk of new stars which eventually form thecentral bulge are not born in superclusters which then sink to the center ofthe galaxy, because feedback efficiently disperses gmcs after they turn severalpercent of their mass into stars. most of the mass that reaches the nucleusdoes so in the form of gas. the kennicutt-schmidt law emerges naturally as aconsequence of feedback balancing gravitational collapse, independent of thesmall-scale star formation microphysics. the same mechanisms that drive thisrelation in isolated galaxies, in particular radiation pressure from irphotons, extend over seven decades in sfr to regulate star formation in themost extreme starbursts (densities &gt;10^4 m_sun/pc^2). feedback also drivessuper-winds with large mass loss rates; but a significant fraction of the windmaterial falls back onto the disks at later times, leading to higherpost-starburst sfrs in the presence of stellar feedback. strong agn feedback isrequired to explain sharp cutoffs in star formation rate. we compare thepredicted relic structure, mass profile, morphology, and efficiency of disksurvival to simulations which do not explicitly resolve gmcs or feedback.global galaxy properties are similar, but sub-galactic properties and starformation rates can differ significantly.

1210.6347	modeling mid-infrared diagnostics of obscured quasars and starbursts	we analyze the link between active galactic nuclei (agn) and mid-infraredflux using dust radiative transfer calculations of starbursts realized inhydrodynamical simulations. focusing on the effects of galaxy dust, we evaluatediagnostics commonly used to disentangle agn and star formation inultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs). we examine these quantities as afunction of time, viewing angle, dust model, agn spectrum, and agn strength inmerger simulations representing two possible extremes of the ulirg population:one is a typical gas-rich merger at z ~ 0, and the other is characteristic ofextremely obscured starbursts at z ~ 2 to 4. this highly obscured burst beginsstar-formation-dominated with significant pah emission, and ends with a ~10^9yr period of red near-ir colors. at coalescence, when the agn is most luminous,dust obscures the near-infrared agn signature, reduces the relative emissionfrom polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs), and enhances the 9.7 micronabsorption by silicate grains. although generally consistent with previousinterpretations, our results imply none of these indicators can unambiguouslyestimate the agn luminosity fraction in all cases. motivated by thesimulations, we show that a combination of the extinction feature at 9.7micron, the pah strength, and a near-infrared slope can simultaneouslyconstrain the agn fraction and dust grain distribution for a wide range ofobscuration. we find that this indicator, accessible to the james webb spacetelescope, may estimate the agn power as tightly as the hard x-ray flux alone,thereby providing a valuable future cross-check and constraint for largesamples of distant ulirgs.

1303.3584	the spatial extent and distribution of star formation in 3d-hst mergers  at z~1.5	we present an analysis of the spatial distribution of star formation in asample of 60 visually identified galaxy merger candidates at z&gt;1. our sample,drawn from the 3d-hst survey, is flux-limited and was selected to have highstar formation rates based on fits of their broad-band, low spatial resolutionspectral energy distributions. it includes plausible pre-merger (close pairs)and post-merger (single objects with tidal features) systems, with totalstellar masses and star formation rates derived from multi-wavelengthphotometry. here we use near-infrared slitless spectra from 3d-hst whichproduce halpha or [oiii] emission line maps as proxies for star-formation maps.this provides a first comprehensive high-resolution, empirical picture of wherestar formation occurred in galaxy mergers at the epoch of peak cosmic starformation rate. we find that detectable star formation can occur in one or bothgalaxy centres, or in tidal tails. the most common case (58%) is that starformation is largely concentrated in a single, compact region, coincident withthe centre of (one of) the merger components. no correlations between starformation morphology and redshift, total stellar mass, or star formation rateare found. a restricted set of hydrodynamical merger simulations betweensimilarly massive and gas-rich objects implies that star formation should bedetectable in both merger components, when the gas fractions of the individualcomponents are the same. this suggests that z~1.5 mergers typically occurbetween galaxies whose gas fractions, masses, and/or star formation rates aredistinctly different from one another.

0802.0508	dissipation and extra light in galactic nuclei: i. gas-rich merger  remnants	we study the origin and properties of 'extra' or 'excess' central light inthe surface brightness profiles of gas-rich merger remnants. combining a largeset of hydrodynamical simulations with data on observed mergers (spanning abroad range of profiles at various masses and degrees of relaxation), we showhow to robustly separate the physically meaningful extra light -- stellarpopulations formed in a compact central starburst during a gas-rich merger --from the outer profile established by violent relaxation acting on starsalready present in the progenitors prior to the final merger. this separationis sensitive to the profile treatment, and we demonstrate that certain fittingprocedures can yield physically misleading results. we show that our methodreliably recovers the younger starburst population, and examine how theproperties of this component scale with mass, gas content, and other aspects ofthe progenitors. we consider the time evolution of profiles in different bands,and estimate biases introduced by observational studies at different times andwavelengths. we show that extra light is ubiquitous in observed and simulatedgas-rich merger remnants, with sufficient mass (~3-30% of the stellar mass) toexplain the discrepancy in the maximum phase-space densities of ellipticals andtheir progenitor spirals. the nature of this central component providespowerful new constraints on the formation histories of observed systems.

1407.4812	simulating multiple merger pathways to the central kinematics of  early-type galaxies	two-dimensional integral field surveys such as atlas^3d are producing richobservational data sets yielding insights into galaxy formation. these newkinematic observations have highlighted the need to understand the evolutionarymechanisms leading to a spectrum of fast-rotators and slow-rotators inearly-type galaxies. we address the formation of slow and fast rotators througha series of controlled, comprehensive hydrodynamical simulations samplingidealized galaxy merger scenarios constructed from model spiral galaxies.idealized and controlled simulations of this sort complement the more'realistic' cosmological simulations by isolating and analyzing the effects ofspecific parameters, as we do in this paper. we recreate minor and major binarymergers, binary merger trees with multiple progenitors, and multiple sequentialmergers. within each of these categories of formation history, we correlateprogenitor gas fraction, mass ratio, orbital pericenter, orbital ellipticity,and spin with remnant kinematic properties. we create kinematic profiles ofthese 95 simulations comparable to atlas^3d data. by constructing remnantprofiles of the projected specific angular momentum (lambda_r = &lt;r|v|&gt; /&lt;sqrt(v^2+sigma^2)&gt;, triaxiality, and measuring the incidences of kinematictwists and kinematically decoupled cores, we distinguish between varyingformation scenarios. we find that binary mergers nearly always form fastrotators. slow rotators can be formed from zero initial angular momentumconfigurations and gas-poor mergers, but are not as round as the atlas^3dgalaxies. remnants of binary merger trees are triaxial slow rotators.sequential mergers form round slow rotators that most resemble the atlas^3drotators.

0805.3533	dissipation and extra light in galactic nuclei: ii. 'cusp' ellipticals	we study the origin and properties of 'extra' or 'excess' central light inthe surface brightness profiles of cusp or power-law ellipticals. dissipationalmergers give rise to two-component profiles: an outer profile established byviolent relaxation acting on stars present in the progenitors prior to thefinal merger, and an inner stellar population comprising the extra light,formed in a compact starburst. combining a large set of hydrodynamicalsimulations with data that span a broad range of profiles and masses, we showthat this picture is borne out -- cusp ellipticals are indeed 'extra light'ellipticals -- and examine how the properties of this component scale withglobal galaxy properties. we show how to robustly separate the 'extra' light,and demonstrate that observed cusps are reliable tracers of the degree ofdissipation in the spheroid-forming merger. we show that the typical degree ofdissipation is a strong function of stellar mass, tracing observed disk gasfractions at each mass. we demonstrate a correlation between extra lightcontent and effective radius at fixed mass: systems with more dissipation aremore compact. the outer shape of the light profile does not depend on mass,with a mean outer sersic index ~2.5. we explore how this relates to shapes,kinematics, and stellar population gradients. simulations with the gas contentneeded to match observed profiles also reproduce observed age, metallicity, andcolor gradients, and we show how these can be used as tracers of the degree ofdissipation in spheroid formation.

0806.1739	how do disks survive mergers?	we develop a physical model for how galactic disks survive and/or aredestroyed in interactions. based on dynamical arguments, we show gas primarilyloses angular momentum to internal torques in a merger. gas within somecharacteristic radius (a function of the orbital parameters, mass ratio, andgas fraction of the merging galaxies), will quickly lose angular momentum tothe stars sharing the perturbed disk, fall to the center and be consumed in astarburst. a similar analysis predicts where violent relaxation of the stellardisks is efficient. our model allows us to predict the stellar and gas contentthat will survive to re-form a disk in the remnant, versus being violentlyrelaxed or contributing to a starburst. we test this in hydrodynamicsimulations and find good agreement as a function of mass ratio, orbitalparameters, and gas fraction, in simulations spanning a wide range in theseproperties and others, including different prescriptions for gas physics andfeedback. in an immediate sense, the amount of disk that re-forms can beunderstood in terms of well-understood gravitational physics, independent ofdetails of ism gas physics or feedback. this allows us to explicitly quantifythe requirements for such feedback to (indirectly) enable disk survival, bychanging the pre-merger gas content and distribution. the efficiency of diskdestruction is a strong function of gas content: we show how and whysufficiently gas-rich major mergers can, under general conditions, yieldsystems with small bulges (b/t&lt;0.2). we provide prescriptions for inclusion ofour results in semi-analytic models.

0806.2325	dissipation and extra light in galactic nuclei: iii. 'core' ellipticals  and 'missing' light	we investigate how 'extra' central light in the surface brightness profilesof cusp ellipticals relates to the profiles of ellipticals with cores. cuspelliptical envelopes are formed by violent relaxation in mergers acting onstars in progenitor disks, while their centers are structured by dissipationalstarbursts. core ellipticals are formed by subsequent merging of (now gas-poor)cusp ellipticals, with the fossil starburst components combining to preserve acompact component in the remnant (although the 'transition' is smoothed).comparing hydrodynamical simulations and observed profiles, we show how toobservationally isolate the relic starburst components in core ellipticals. wedemonstrate that these survive re-mergers and reliably trace the dissipation inthe initial gas-rich merger(s). the typical degree of dissipation is a strongfunction of stellar mass, tracing observed disk gas fractions. we find acorrelation between dissipation and effective radius: systems with moredissipation are more compact. the survival of this component and scattering ofstars into the envelope naturally explain high-sersic index profilescharacteristic of massive core ellipticals. this is also closely related to thekinematics and isophotal shapes: only systems with matched starburst componentsfrom their profile fits also reproduce the observed kinematics of boxy/coreellipticals. we show that it is critical to adopt physically motivated profileswhen attempting to quantify how much mass has been 'scoured' or scattered outof the inner regions by binary black holes. estimates of scoured mass ignoringmulti-component structure can be strongly biased, potentially explainingobserved systems with large inferred core masses in apparent conflict withcore-scouring models.

0806.2861	the radical consequences of realistic satellite orbits for the heating  and implied merger histories of galactic disks	previous models of galactic disk heating in interactions invoke restrictiveassumptions not necessarily valid in modern lcdm contexts: that satellites andorbits are rigid and circular, with slow decay over many orbital times fromdynamical friction. this leads to a linear scaling of disk heating withsatellite mass: disk heights and velocity dispersions scale ~m_sat/m_disk. inturn, observed disk thicknesses present strong constraints on merger histories:the implication for the milky way is that &lt;5% of its mass could come frommergers since z~2, in conflict with cosmological predictions. morerealistically, satellites merge on nearly radial orbits, and once near thedisk, resonant interactions efficiently remove angular momentum while tidaleffects strip mass, leading to rapid merger/destruction in a couple offree-fall plunges. under these conditions the proper heating efficiency isnon-linear in mass ratio, ~(m_sat/m_disk)^2. we derive the scaling of diskscale heights and velocity dispersions as a function of mass ratio and disk gascontent in this regime, and show this accurately describes the results ofsimulations with proper 'live' halos and disks. under realistic circumstances,disk heating in minor mergers is suppressed by an order of magnitude relativeto expectations of previous models. we show that the milky way disk could haveabsorbed ~5-10 1:10 mass-ratio mergers since z=2, in agreement withcosmological models. these distinctions lead to dramatic differences in whichmass ratios are most important for disk heating and in the isophotal shapes ofdisk+bulge systems.

0806.3974	dissipation and the fundamental plane: observational tests	we develop observational tests of the idea that dissipation in gas-richmergers produces the fundamental plane (fp) and related correlations obeyed byellipticals. the fp 'tilt' implies lower-mass ellipticals have a higher ratioof stellar to dark matter within their stellar effective radii. models arguethat mergers between more gas-rich (typically lower-mass) disks yield largermass fractions formed in compact starbursts, giving a smaller stellar r_e andhigher m_stellar/m_tot within that r_e. such starbursts leave a characteristicimprint in the surface brightness profile: a central excess above an outerprofile established by the dissipationless violent relaxation of disk stars. inprevious work, we developed empirical methods to decompose the observedprofiles of ellipticals and robustly estimate the amount of dissipation in theoriginal spheroid-forming merger(s). applying this to a large sample ofobserved ellipticals, we test whether or not their location on the fp and itstilt are driven by dissipation. at fixed mass, ellipticals formed in moredissipational events are smaller and have higher m_stellar/m_tot. at fixeddegree of dissipation, there is no tilt in the fp. we show that the dynamicalmass estimator r_e*sigma^2/g is a good estimator of the true mass: the observedfp tilt cannot primarily owe to other forms of non-homology. removing theeffects of dissipation, observed ellipticals obey the same fp correlations asdisks: unusual progenitors are not required to make typical ellipticals.dissipation appears to be both necessary and sufficient to explain the fp tilt.

0807.2868	dissipation and extra light in galactic nuclei: iv. evolution in the  scaling relations of spheroids	we develop a model for the origins and redshift evolution of spheroid scalingrelations. we consider spheroid sizes, velocity dispersions, masses, profileshapes (sersic indices), and black hole (bh) masses, and their relatedscalings. our approach combines advantages of observational constraints in halooccupation models and hydrodynamic merger simulations. this allows us toseparate the relative roles of dissipation, dry mergers, formation time, andprogenitor evolution, and identify their effects on scalings at each redshift.dissipation is the most important factor determining spheroid sizes andfundamental plane (fp) scalings, and can account for the fp tilt anddifferences between disk and spheroid scalings. because disks at high-z havehigher gas fractions, mergers are more gas-rich, yielding more compactspheroids. this predicts mass-dependent evolution in spheroid sizes, inagreement with observations. this relates to subtle evolution in the fp,important to studies that assume a fixed intrinsic fp. this also predicts mildevolution in bh-host correlations, towards larger bhs at higher z. dry mergersare significant, but only for massive systems which form early: they formcompact, but undergo dry mergers (consistent with observations) such that theirsizes at later times are similar to spheroids of similar mass formed morerecently. we model descendants of observed compact high-z spheroids: most willbecome cores of bcgs, with sizes, velocity dispersions, and bh massesconsistent with observations, but we identify a fraction that might survive toz=0 intact.

astro-ph;0502241	a physical model for the origin of quasar lifetimes	we propose a model of quasar lifetimes in which observational quasarlifetimes and an intrinsic lifetime of rapid accretion are stronglydistinguished by the physics of obscuration by surrounding gas and dust.quasars are powered by gas funneled to galaxy centers, but for a large part ofthe accretion lifetime are heavily obscured by the large gas densities poweringaccretion. in this phase, starbursts and black hole growth are fueled but thequasar is buried. eventually, feedback from accretion energy dispersessurrounding gas, creating a window in which the black hole is observableoptically as a quasar, until accretion rates drop below those required tomaintain a quasar luminosity. we model this process and measure the unobscuredand intrinsic quasar lifetimes in a hydrodynamical simulation of a major galaxymerger. the source luminosity is determined from the black hole accretion rate,calculated from local gas properties. we calculate the column density ofhydrogen to the source along multiple lines of sight and use these columndensities and gas metallicities to determine b-band attenuation of the source.defining the observable quasar lifetime as the total time with an observedb-band luminosity above some limit l_b,min, we find lifetimes ~10-20 myr forl_b,min=10^11 l_sun (m_b=-23), in good agreement with observationallydetermined quasar lifetimes. this is significantly smaller than the intrinsiclifetime ~100 myr obtained if attenuation is neglected. the ratio of observedto intrinsic lifetime is also strong function of both the limiting luminosityand the observed frequency.

astro-ph;0503369	a merger-driven scenario for cosmological disk galaxy formation	(abridged) the violent hierarchical nature of the lcdm cosmology posesserious difficulties for the formation of disk galaxies. to help resolve theseissues, we describe a new, merger-driven scenario for the cosmologicalformation of disk galaxies at high redshifts that supplements the standardmodel based on dissipational collapse.in this picture, large gaseous disks maybe produced from high-angular momentum mergers of systems that aregas-dominated, i.e. m_gas/(m_gas +m_star &gt; 0.5 at the height of the merger.pressurization from the multiphase structure of the interstellar mediumprevents the complete conversion of gas into stars during the merger, and ifenough gas remains to form a disk, the remnant eventually resembles a diskgalaxy. we perform numerical simulations of galaxy mergers to study howsupernovae feedback strength, supermassive black hole growth and feedback,progenitor gas fraction, merger mass-ratio, and orbital geometry impact theformation of remnant disks. we find that disks can build angular momentumthrough mergers and the degree of rotational support of the baryons in themerger remnant is primarily related to feedback processes associated with starformation. disk-dominated remnants are restricted to form in mergers that aregas-dominated at the time of final coalescence and gas-dominated mergerstypically require extreme progenitor gas fractions (&gt;80%). we also show thatthe formation of rotationally-supported stellar systems in mergers is notrestricted to idealized orbits, or major or minor mergers. we suggest that thehierarchical nature of the lcdm cosmology and the physics of the interstellargas may act together to form spiral galaxies by building the angular momentumof disks through early, gas-dominated mergers.

astro-ph;0504190	black holes in galaxy mergers: evolution of quasars	based on numerical simulations of gas-rich galaxy mergers, we discuss a modelin which quasar activity is tied to the self-regulated growth of supermassiveblack holes in galaxies. nuclear inflow of gas attending a galaxy collisiontriggers a starburst and feeds black hole growth, but for most of the durationof the starburst, the black hole is heavily obscured by surrounding gas anddust which limits the visibility of the quasar, especially at optical and uvwavelengths. eventually, feedback energy from accretion heats the gas andexpels it in a powerful wind, leaving a 'dead quasar'. between buried and deadphases there is a window during which the galaxy would be seen as a luminousquasar. because the black hole mass, radiative output, and distribution ofobscuring gas and dust all evolve strongly with time, the duration of thisphase of observable quasar activity depends on both the waveband and imposedluminosity threshold. we determine the observed and intrinsic lifetimes as afunction of luminosity and frequency, and calculate observable lifetimes ~10myr for bright quasars in the optical b-band, in good agreement with empiricalestimates and much smaller than the black hole growth timescales ~100 myr,naturally producing a substantial population of 'buried' quasars. however,observed and intrinsic energy outputs converge in the ir and hard x-ray bandsas attenuation becomes weaker and chances of observation greatly increase. weobtain the distribution of column densities along sightlines in which thequasar is seen above a given luminosity, and find that our result agreesremarkably well with observed estimates of the column density distribution fromthe sdss for appropriate luminosity thresholds.

astro-ph;0504253	luminosity-dependent quasar lifetimes: reconciling the optical and x-ray  quasar luminosity functions	we consider implications of our new model of quasar lifetimes and lightcurves for the quasar luminosity function (lf) at different frequencies andredshifts. in our picture, quasars evolve rapidly and the lifetime depends onboth their instantaneous and peak luminosities. the bright end of the lf tracesthe peak intrinsic quasar activity, but the faint end consists of quasars whichare either undergoing exponential growth to much larger masses andluminosities, or are in sub-eddington quiescent states going into or coming outof a period of peak activity. the 'break' in the observed lf correspondsdirectly to the maximum in the intrinsic distribution of peak luminosities,which falls off at both brighter and fainter luminosities. we study this modelusing simulations of galaxy mergers which successfully reproduce a wide rangeof observed quasar phenomena, including the observed column densitydistribution. by combining quasar lifetimes and the distribution of maximumquasar luminosities determined from the observed hard x-ray lf with thecorresponding luminosity and host-system dependent column densities, we producethe expected soft x-ray and b-band lfs. our predictions agree exceptionallywell with the observed lfs at all observed luminosities, over the redshiftrange considered (z &lt; 1), without invoking any ad hoc assumptions about anobscured population of sources. our results also suggest that observedcorrelations in hard x-ray samples between the obscured fraction of quasars andluminosity can be explained in the context of our model by the expulsion ofsurrounding gas due to heating from accretion feedback energy as a quasar nearsits peak luminosity and final black hole mass.

astro-ph;0506038	the evolution of the m-sigma relation	(abridged) we examine the evolution of the black hole mass - stellar velocitydispersion (m-sigma) relation over cosmic time using simulations of galaxymergers that include feedback from supermassive black hole growth. we considermergers of galaxies varying the properties of the progenitors to match thoseexpected at redshifts z=0-6. we find that the slope of the resulting m-sigmarelation is the same at all redshifts considered. for the same feedbackefficiency that reproduces the observed amplitude of the m-sigma relation atz=0, there is a weak redshift-dependence to the normalization that results froman increasing velocity dispersion for a given galactic stellar mass. we developa formalism to connect redshift evolution in the m-sigma relation to thescatter in the local relation at z=0. we show that the scatter in the localrelation places severe constraints on the redshift evolution of both thenormalization and slope of the m-sigma relation. furthermore, we demonstratethat cosmic downsizing introduces a black hole mass-dependent dispersion in them-sigma relation and that the skewness of the distribution about the locallyobserved m-sigma relation is sensitive to redshift evolution in thenormalization and slope. in principle, these various diagnostics provide amethod for differentiating between theories for producing the m-sigma relation.in agreement with existing constraints, our simulations imply that hierarchicalstructure formation should produce the relation with small intrinsic scatter.

astro-ph;0506398	a unified, merger-driven model for the origin of starbursts, quasars,  the cosmic x-ray background, supermassive black holes and galaxy spheroids	we present an evolutionary model for starbursts, quasars, and spheroidalgalaxies in which mergers between gas-rich galaxies drive nuclear inflows ofgas, producing intense starbursts and feeding the buried growth of supermassiveblack holes (bhs) until feedback expels gas and renders a briefly visibleoptical quasar. the quasar lifetime and obscuring column density depend on boththe instantaneous and peak luminosity of the quasar, and we determine thisdependence using a large set of simulations of galaxy mergers varying hostgalaxy properties, orbital geometry, and gas physics. we use these fits todeconvolve observed quasar luminosity functions (lfs) and obtain the evolutionof the formation rate of quasars with a certain peak luminosity, n(l_peak,z).quasars spend extended periods of time at luminosities well below peak, and son(l_peak) has a maximum corresponding to the 'break' in the observed lf,falling off at both brighter and fainter luminosities. from n(l_peak) and oursimulation results, we obtain self-consistent fits to hard and soft x-ray andoptical quasar lfs and predict many observables, including: column densitydistributions of optical and x-ray samples, the lf of broad-line quasars inx-ray samples and the broad-line fraction as a function of luminosity, activebh mass functions, the distribution of eddington ratios at z~0-2, the z=0 massfunction of relic bhs and total mass density of bhs, and the cosmic x-raybackground. in every case, our predictions agree well with observed estimates,and unlike previous modeling attempts, we are able to reproduce them withoutinvoking any ad hoc assumptions about source properties or distributions. weprovide a library of monte carlo realizations of our models for comparison withobservations.

astro-ph;0507361	the luminosity dependence of quasar clustering	we investigate the luminosity dependence of quasar clustering, inspired bynumerical simulations of galaxy mergers that incorporate black hole growth.these simulations have motivated a new interpretation of the quasar luminosityfunction. in this picture, the bright end of the quasar luminosity functionconsists of quasars radiating nearly at their peak luminosities, while thefaint end consists mainly of very similar sources, but at dimmer phases intheir evolution. we combine this model with the statistics of dark matter halosthat host quasar activity. we find that, since bright and faint quasars aremostly similar sources seen in different evolutionary stages, a broad range inquasar luminosities corresponds to only a narrow range in the masses of quasarhost halos. on average, bright and faint quasars reside in similar host halos.consequently, we argue that quasar clustering should depend only weakly onluminosity. this prediction is in qualitative agreement with recentmeasurements of the luminosity dependence of the quasar correlation function(croom et al. 2005) and the galaxy-quasar cross-correlation function(adelberger &amp; steidel 2005). future precision clustering measurements from sdssand 2df, spanning a large range in luminosity, should provide a strong test ofour model.

astro-ph;0508167	determining the properties and evolution of red galaxies from the quasar  luminosity function	(abridged) we study the link between quasars and the red galaxy populationusing a model for the self-regulated growth of supermassive black holes inmergers involving gas-rich galaxies. using a model for quasar lifetimes andevolution motivated by hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy mergers, wede-convolve the observed quasar luminosity function at various redshifts todetermine the rate of formation of black holes of a given final mass.identifying quasar activity with the formation of spheroids in the framework ofthe merger hypothesis, this enables us to deduce the corresponding rate offormation of spheroids with given properties as a function of redshift. thisallows us to predict, for the red galaxy population, the distribution of galaxyvelocity dispersions, the mass function, mass density, star formation rates,the luminosity function in many observed wavebands (nuv, u, b, v, r, i, j, h,k), the total red galaxy number density and luminosity density, thedistribution of colors as a function of magnitude and velocity dispersion forseveral different wavebands, the distribution of mass to light ratios vs. mass,the luminosity-size relations, and the typical ages and distribution of ages(formation redshifts) as a function of both mass and luminosity. for each ofthese quantities, we predict the evolution from redshift z=0-6. each of ourpredictions agrees well with existing observations, without the addition oftunable parameters; the essential observational inputs come from the observedquasar luminosity function. these predictions are skewed by several orders ofmagnitude if we adopt simpler, traditional models of quasar lifetimes in whichquasars turn on/off or follow simple exponential light curves, instead of themore complicated evolution implied by our simulations.

astro-ph;0508299	the evolution in the faint-end slope of the quasar luminosity function	(abridged) based on numerical simulations of galaxy mergers that incorporateblack hole (bh) growth, we predict the faint end slope of the quasar luminosityfunction (qlf) and its evolution with redshift. our simulations have yielded anew model for quasar lifetimes where the lifetime depends on both theinstantaneous and peak quasar luminosities. this motivates a new interpretationof the qlf in which the bright end consists of quasars radiating at nearlytheir peak luminosities, but the faint end is mostly made up of quasars in lessluminous phases of evolution. the faint-end qlf slope is then determined by thefaint-end slope of the quasar lifetime for quasars with peak luminosities nearthe observed break. we determine this slope from the quasar lifetime as afunction of peak luminosity, based on a large set of simulations spanning awide variety of host galaxy, merger, bh, and ism gas properties. brighter peakluminosity (higher bh mass) systems undergo more violent evolution, and expeland heat gas more rapidly in the final stages of quasar evolution, resulting ina flatter faint-end slope (as these objects fall below the observed break inthe qlf more rapidly). therefore, as the qlf break luminosity moves to higherluminosities with increasing redshift, implying a larger typical quasar peakluminosity, the faint-end qlf slope flattens. from the quasar lifetime as afunction of peak luminosity and this interpretation of the qlf, we predict thefaint-end qlf slope and its evolution with redshift in good agreement withobservations. although bhs grow anti-hierarchically (with lower-mass bhs formedprimarily at lower redshifts), the observed change in slope and differential orluminosity dependent density evolution in the qlf is completely determined bythe luminosity-dependent quasar lifetime and physics of quasar feedback.

astro-ph;0602290	the relation between quasar and merging galaxy luminosity functions and  the merger-induced star formation rate of the universe	using a model for self-regulated growth of black holes (bhs) in mergersinvolving gas-rich galaxies, we study the relationship between quasars and thepopulation of merging galaxies and predict the merger-induced star formationrate density of the universe. mergers drive nuclear gas inflows, fuelingstarbursts and 'buried quasars' until accretion feedback expels the gas,rendering a briefly visible optical quasar. star formation is shut down andaccretion declines, leaving a passively evolving remnant with propertiestypical of red, elliptical galaxies. based on evolution of these events in oursimulations, we demonstrate that the observed statistics of merger rates,luminosity functions (lfs) and mass functions, sfr distributions, specificsfrs, quasar and quasar host galaxy lfs, and elliptical/red galaxy lfs areself-consistent and follow from one another as predicted by the mergerhypothesis. we use our simulations to de-convolve both quasar and merginggalaxy lfs to determine the birthrate of black holes of a given final mass andmerger rates as a function of stellar mass. we use this to predict the merginggalaxy lf in several observed wavebands, color-magnitude relations, massfunctions, absolute and specific sfr distributions and sfr density, and quasarhost galaxy lfs, as a function of redshift from z=0-6. we invert this andpredict e.g. quasar lfs from observed merger lfs or sfr distributions. ourresults agree well with observations, but idealized models of quasarlightcurves are ruled out by comparison of merger and quasar observations at&gt;99.9% confidence. using only observations of quasars, we estimate thecontribution of mergers to the sfr density of the universe even to highredshifts z~4.

astro-ph;0608091	an upper limit to the degree of evolution between supermassive black  holes and their host galaxies	we describe a model-independent integral constraint which defines an upperlimit to the allowed degree of evolution in the ratio of black hole (bh) massto host galaxy luminosity or mass, as a function of redshift. essentially, ifthe bh/host ratio is excessive at redshift z, then it would imply that thetotal mass density in bhs above some m_bh(min) is larger at that redshift thanat z=0, which is impossible. this argument requires no knowledge of host or bhproperties, only a lower limit to the observed luminosity density in thebrightest galaxies at some z. we calculate this upper limit from a variety ofluminosity and mass functions in different bands from redshifts z=0-2. we showthat it is consistent with passive evolution of spheroid populations (with afixed m_bh/m_host relation) in all cases, and provides tighter constraints thanhave generally been obtained previously, ruling out at &gt;6 sigma observationaland theoretical estimates suggesting that m_bh/m_host was significantly largerat high redshifts than locally, although relatively weak (factor ~2 by z=2)evolution is still allowed. we discuss a variety of possible 'loopholes' orchanges in the bh/host populations and correlations, and show that theytypically lower the upper limits and strengthen our conclusions.

astro-ph;0608190	formation of z ~ 6 quasars from hierarchical galaxy mergers	the discovery of luminous quasars at redshift z ~ 6 indicates the presence ofsupermassive black holes (smbhs) of mass ~10^9 msun when the universe was lessthan one billion years old. this finding presents several challenges fortheoretical models. here, we present the first multi-scale simulations that,together with a self-regulated model for the smbh growth, produce a luminousquasar at z ~ 6.5 in the lcdm paradigm. we follow the hierarchical assemblyhistory of the most massive halo in a ~ 3 gpc^3 volume, and find that this haloof ~ 8x 10^{12} msun forming at z ~ 6.5 after several major mergers is able toreproduce a number of observed properties of sdss j1148+5251, the most distantquasar detected at z =6.42 (fan et al. 2003). moreover, the smbhs grow throughgas accretion below the eddington limit in a self-regulated manner owing tofeedback. we find that the progenitors experience significant star formation(up to 10^4 msun/yr) preceding the major quasar phase such that the stellarmass of the quasar host reaches 10^{12} msun at z ~ 6.5, consistent withobservations of significant metal enrichment in sdss j1148+5251. our resultsprovide a viable formation mechanism for z ~ 6 quasars in the standard lcdmcosmology, and demonstrate a common, merger-driven origin for the rarestquasars and the fundamental smbh-host correlation in a hierarchicaluniverse.(abridged)

astro-ph;0611792	the co-formation of spheroids and quasars traced in their clustering	we compare observed clustering of quasars and galaxies as a function ofredshift, mass, luminosity, &amp; color/morphology, to constrain models of quasarfueling and spheroid-bh co-evolution. high redshift quasars are shown to bedrawn from progenitors of local early-type galaxies, with the characteristicquasar luminosity l* reflecting a characteristic mass of 'active' bh/hostpopulations at each redshift. evolving observed high-z quasar clustering to z=0predicts a trend of clustering in 'quasar remnants' as a function of stellarmass identical to that observed for early-types. however, quasar clusteringdoes not simply reflect observed early (or late)-type populations; at eachredshift, quasars cluster as an 'intermediate' population. comparing with theage of elliptical stellar populations reveals that this 'intermediate'population represents those ellipticals undergoing or terminating their finalsignificant star formation at each epoch. assuming that quasar triggering isassociated with the formation/termination epoch of ellipticals predicts quasarclustering at all observed redshifts without any model dependence orassumptions about quasar light curves, lifetimes, or accretion rates. this isnot true for disks or quasar halos: i.e. quasars do not generically trace starformation, disks, or halo assembly. quasar clustering at all z is consistentwith a constant halo mass ~4x10^{12} m_sun, similar to local 'group scales.'the observations support a scenario in which major mergers trigger quasaractivity and dominate bright, high-z quasar populations. we show thatmeasurements of quasar clustering versus luminosity at z~1 can be used toconstrain different lower-luminosity agn fueling mechanisms, and that high-zclustering is sensitive to whether or not systems 'shut down' growth at z&gt;3.

astro-ph;0701351	a theoretical interpretation of the black hole fundamental plane	we examine the origin and evolution of correlations between properties ofsupermassive black holes (bhs) and their host galaxies using simulations ofmajor galaxy mergers, including the effects of gas dissipation, cooling, starformation, and bh accretion and feedback. we demonstrate that the simulationspredict the existence of a bh 'fundamental plane' (bhfp), of the form m_bhsigma^(3.0+-0.3)*r_e^(0.43+-0.19) or m_bhm_bulge^(0.54+-0.17)*sigma^(2.2+-0.5), similar to relations foundobservationally. the simulations indicate that the bhfp can be understoodroughly as a tilted intrinsic correlation between bh mass and spheroid bindingenergy, or the condition for feedback coupling to power a pressure-drivenoutflow. while changes in halo circular velocity, merger orbital parameters,progenitor disk redshifts and gas fractions, ism gas pressurization, and otherparameters can drive changes in e.g. sigma at fixed m_bulge, and thereforechanges in the m_bh-sigma or m_bh-m_bulge relations, the bhfp is robust. giventhe empirical trend of decreasing r_e for a given m_bulge at high redshift, thebhfp predicts that bhs will be more massive at fixed m_bulge, in good agreementwith recent observations. this evolution in the structural properties of mergerremnants, to smaller r_e and larger sigma (and therefore larger m_bh,conserving the bhfp) at a given m_bulge, is driven by the fact that bulgeprogenitors have characteristically larger gas fractions at high redshifts.adopting the observed evolution of disk gas fractions with redshift, oursimulations predict the observed trends in both r_e(m_bulge) and m_bh(m_bulge).

0706.1243	a cosmological framework for the co-evolution of quasars, supermassive  black holes, and elliptical galaxies: i. galaxy mergers &amp; quasar activity	(abridged) we develop a model for the cosmological role of mergers in theevolution of starbursts, quasars, and spheroidal galaxies. combining halo massfunctions (mfs) with empirical halo occupation models, we calculate where majorgalaxy-galaxy mergers occur and what kinds of galaxies merge, at all redshifts.we compare with observed merger mfs, clustering, fractions, and small-scaleenvironments, and show that this yields robust estimates in good agreement withobservations. making the simple ansatz that major, gas-rich mergers causequasar activity, we demonstrate that this naturally reproduces the observedrise and fall of the quasar luminosity density from z=0-6, as well as quasarlfs, fractions, host galaxy colors, and clustering as a function of redshiftand luminosity. the observed excess of quasar clustering on small scales is anatural prediction of the model, as mergers preferentially occur in regionswith excess small-scale galaxy overdensities. we show that quasar environmentsat all observed redshifts correspond closely to the empirically determinedsmall group scale, where mergers of gas-rich galaxies are most efficient. wecontrast with a secular model in which quasar activity is driven by bars/diskinstabilities, and show that while these modes probably dominate at seyfertluminosities, the constraints from clustering (large and small-scale),pseudobulge populations, disk mfs, luminosity density evolution, and hostgalaxy colors argue that they must be a small contributor to the z&gt;1 quasarluminosity density.
