0905.1692	an ultra-deep near-infrared spectrum of a compact quiescent galaxy at  z=2.2	several recent studies have shown that about half of the massive galaxies atz~2 are in a quiescent phase. moreover, these galaxies are commonly found to beultra-compact with half-light radii of ~1 kpc. we have obtained a ~29 hrspectrum of a typical quiescent, ultra-dense galaxy at z=2.1865 with the gemininear-infrared spectrograph. the spectrum exhibits a strong optical break andseveral absorption features, which have not previously been detected in z&gt;2quiescent galaxies. comparison of the spectral energy distribution with stellarpopulation synthesis models implies a low star formation rate (sfr) of 1-3msol/yr, an age of 1.3-2.2 gyr, and a stellar mass of ~2x10^11 msol. we detectseveral faint emission lines, with emission-line ratios of [nii]/halpha,[sii]/halpha and [oii]/[oiii] typical of low-ionization nuclear emission-lineregions. thus, neither the stellar continuum nor the nebular emission impliesactive star formation. the current sfr is &lt;1% of the past average sfr. if thisgalaxy is representative of compact quiescent galaxies beyond z=2, it impliesthat quenching of star formation is extremely efficient and also indicates thatlow luminosity active galactic nuclei (agns) could be common in these objects.nuclear emission is a potential concern for the size measurement. however, weshow that the agn contributes &lt;8% to the rest-frame optical emission. apossible post-starburst population may affect size measurements more strongly;although a 0.5 gyr old stellar population can make up &lt;10% of the total stellarmass, it could account for up to ~40% of the optical light. nevertheless, thisspectrum shows that this compact galaxy is dominated by an evolved stellarpopulation.

0909.0260	the hubble sequence beyond z=2 for massive galaxies: contrasting large  star-forming and compact quiescent galaxies	we present hubble space telescope nic2 morphologies of a spectroscopic sampleof massive galaxies at z~2.3, by extending our sample of 9 compact quiescentgalaxies (r_e~0.9 kpc) with 10 massive emission-line galaxies. theemission-line galaxies are classified by the nature of their ionized emission;there are six star-forming galaxies and four galaxies hosting an activegalactic nucleus (agn). the star-forming galaxies are the largest among theemission-line galaxies, with a median size of re = 2.8 kpc. the three galaxieswith the highest star formation rates (&gt; 100m \odot/yr) have irregular andclumpy morphologies. the agn host galaxies are more similar to the compactquiescent galaxies in terms of their structures (re~1.1 kpc) and spectralenergy distributions. the total sample clearly separates into two classes in acolor-mass diagram: the large star-forming galaxies that form the blue cloud,and the compact quiescent galaxies on the red sequence. however, it is unclearhow or even if the two classes are evolutionary related. three out of sixmassive star-forming galaxies have dense cores and thus may passively evolveinto compact galaxies due to fading of outer star-forming regions. for thesegalaxies a reverse scenario, in which compact galaxies grow inside-out by starformation is also plausible. we do caution though that the sample is small.nonetheless, it is evident that a hubble sequence of massive galaxies withstrongly correlated galaxy properties is already in place at z &gt; 2.

0910.0837	the dependence of star formation rates on stellar mass and environment  at z~0.8	we examine the star formation rates (sfrs) of galaxies in a redshift sliceencompassing the z=0.834 cluster rx j0152.7-1357. we used a low-dispersionprism in the inamori magellan areal camera and spectrograph (imacs) to identifygalaxies with z&lt;23.3 ab mag in diverse environments around the cluster out toprojected distances of ~8 mpc from the cluster center. we utilize amass-limited sample (m&gt;2x10^{10} m_sun) of 330 galaxies that were imaged byspitzer mips at 24 micron to derive sfrs and study the dependence of specificsfr (ssfr) on stellar mass and environment. we find that the sfr and ssfr showa strong decrease with increasing local density, similar to the relation atz~0. our result contrasts with other work at z~1 that find the sfr-densitytrend to reverse for luminosity-limited samples. these other results appear tobe driven by star-formation in lower mass systems (m~10^{10} m_sun). ourresults imply that the processes that shut down star-formation are present ingroups and other dense regions in the field. our data also suggest that thelower sfrs of galaxies in higher density environments may reflect a change inthe ratio of star-forming to non-star-forming galaxies, rather than a change insfrs. as a consequence, the sfrs of star-forming galaxies, in environmentsranging from small groups to clusters, appear to be similar and largelyunaffected by the local processes that truncate star-formation at z~0.8.

0910.1836	optical spectroscopy of distant red galaxies	we present optical spectroscopic follow-up of a sample of distant redgalaxies (drgs) with k &lt; 22.5 (vega), selected by j-k &gt; 2.3, in the hubble deepfield south, the ms 1054-03 field, and the chandra deep field south.spectroscopic redshifts were obtained for 15 drgs. only 2 out of 15 drgs arelocated at z &lt; 2, suggesting a high efficiency to select high-redshift sources.  from other spectroscopic surveys in the cdfs targeting intermediate to highredshift populations selected with different criteria, we find spectroscopicredshifts for a further 30 drgs. we use the sample of spectroscopicallyconfirmed drgs to establish the high quality (scatter in \delta z/(1+z) of ~0.05) of their photometric redshifts in the considered deep fields, as derivedwith eazy (brammer et al. 2008). combining the spectroscopic and photometricredshifts, we find that 74% of drgs with k &lt; 22.5 lie at z &gt; 2. the combinedspectroscopic and photometric sample is used to analyze the distinct intrinsicand observed properties of drgs at z &lt; 2 and z &gt; 2. in our photometric sampleto k &lt; 22.5, low-redshift drgs are brighter in k than high-redshift drgs by 0.7mag, and more extincted by 1.2 mag in av. our analysis shows that the drgcriterion selects galaxies with different properties at different redshifts.such biases can be largely avoided by selecting galaxies based on theirrest-frame properties, which requires very good multi-band photometry and highquality photometric redshifts.

0707.2080	uv luminosity functions at z~4, 5, and 6 from the hudf and other deep  hst acs fields: evolution and star formation history	we use the acs bviz data from the hudf and all other deep hst acs fields(including the goods fields) to find large samples of star-forming galaxies atz~4 and z~5 and to extend our previous z~6 sample. these samples contain 4671,1416, and 627 b, v, and i dropouts, respectively, and reach to extremely lowluminosities (0.01-0.04 l* or m(uv)~-16 to -17), allowing us to determine therest-frame uv luminosity function (lf) and faint-end slope alpha at z~4-6 tohigh accuracy. we find faint-end slopes alpha of -1.73+/-0.05 at z~4,-1.66+/-0.09 at z~5, and -1.74+/-0.16 at z~6 -- suggesting that the faint-endslope is very steep and shows little evolution with cosmic time. we find thatm*(uv) brightens considerably in the 0.7 gyr from z~6 to z~4 (by ~0.7 mag fromm*=-20.24+/-0.19 to m*=-20.98+/-0.10). the observed increase in thecharacteristic luminosity over this range is almost identical to that expectedfor the halo mass function -- suggesting that the observed evolution is likelydue to the hierarchical coalescence and merging of galaxies. the evolution inphi* is not significant. the uv luminosity density at z~6 is modestly lower(0.45+/-0.09 times) than that at z~4 (integrated to -17.5 ab mag) though alarger change is seen in the dust-corrected star-formation rate density. wethoroughly examine published lf results and assess the reasons for their widedispersion. we argue that the results reported here are the most robustavailable. the extremely steep faint-end slopes alpha found here suggest thatlower luminosity galaxies play a significant role in reionizing the universe.finally, we consider recent search results for galaxies at z~7-8 and use themto extend our estimates of the evolution in m* from z~7-8 to z~4.

0912.0514	the growth of massive galaxies since z=2	we study the growth of massive galaxies from z=2 to the present using datafrom the newfirm medium band survey. the sample is selected at a constantnumber density of n=2x10^-4 mpc^-3, so that galaxies at different epochs can becompared in a meaningful way. we show that the stellar mass of galaxies at thisnumber density has increased by a factor of ~2 since z=2, following therelation log(m)=11.45-0.15z. in order to determine at what physical radii thismass growth occurred we construct very deep stacked rest-frame r-band images atredshifts z=0.6, 1.1, 1.6, and 2.0. these image stacks of typically 70-80galaxies enable us to characterize the stellar distribution to surfacebrightness limits of ~28.5 mag/arcsec^2. we find that massive galaxiesgradually built up their outer regions over the past 10 gyr. the mass within aradius of r=5 kpc is nearly constant with redshift whereas the mass at 5-75 kpchas increased by a factor of ~4 since z=2. parameterizing the surfacebrightness profiles we find that the effective radius and sersic n parameterevolve as r_e~(1+z)^-1.3 and n~(1+z)^-1.0 respectively. the data demonstratethat massive galaxies have grown mostly inside-out, assembling their extendedstellar halos around compact, dense cores with possibly exponential radialdensity distributions. comparing the observed mass evolution to the averagestar formation rates of the galaxies we find that the growth is likelydominated by mergers, as in-situ star formation can only account for ~20% ofthe mass build-up from z=2 to z=0. the main uncertainties in this study arepossible redshift-dependent systematic errors in the total stellar masses andthe conversion from light-weighted to mass-weighted radial profiles.

1003.1706	z~7 galaxy candidates from nicmos observations over the hdf south and  the cdf-s and hdf-n goods fields	we use ~88 arcmin**2 of deep (&gt;~26.5 mag at 5 sigma) nicmos data over the twogoods fields and the hdf south to conduct a search for bright z&gt;~7 galaxycandidates. this search takes advantage of an efficient preselection over 58arcmin**2 of nicmos h-band data where only plausible z&gt;~7 candidates arefollowed up with nicmos j-band observations. ~248 arcmin**2 of deepground-based near-infrared data (&gt;~25.5 mag, 5 sigma) is also considered in thesearch. in total, we report 15 z-dropout candidates over this area -- 7 ofwhich are new to these search fields. two possible z~9 j-dropout candidates arealso found, but seem unlikely to correspond to z~9 galaxies. the present z~9search is used to set upper limits on the prevalence of such sources. rigoroustesting is undertaken to establish the level of contamination of our selectionsby photometric scatter, low mass stars, supernovae (sne), and spurious sources.the estimated contamination rate of our z~7 selection is ~24%. through carefulsimulations, the effective volume available to our z&gt;~7 selections is estimatedand used to establish constraints on the volume density of luminous (l*(z=3),or -21 mag) galaxies from these searches. we find that the volume density ofluminous star-forming galaxies at z~7 is 13_{-5}^{+8}x lower than at z~4 and&gt;25x lower (1 sigma) at z~9 than at z~4. this is the most stringent constraintyet available on the volume density of &gt;~l* galaxies at z~9. the presentwide-area, multi-field search limits cosmic variance to &lt;20%. the evolution wefind at the bright end of the uv lf is similar to that found from recent subarusuprime-cam, hawk-i or ers wfc3/ir searches. the present paper also includes acomplete summary of our final z~7 z-dropout sample (18 candidates) identifiedfrom all nicmos observations to date (over the two goods fields, the hudf,galaxy clusters).

1004.1411	confirmation of the compactness of a z=1.91 quiescent galaxy with hubble  space telescope's wide field camera 3	we present very deep wide field camera 3 (wfc3) photometry of a massive,compact galaxy located in the hubble ultra deep field. this quiescent galaxyhas a spectroscopic redshift z=1.91 and has been identified as an extremelycompact galaxy by daddi et al. 2005. we use new h-f160w imaging data obtainedwith hubble space telescope/wfc3 to measure the deconvolved surface brightnessprofile to h = 28 mag arcsec**-2. we find that the surface brightness profileis well approximated by an n=3.7 sersic profile. our deconvolved profile isconstructed by a new technique which corrects the best-fit sersic profile withthe residual of the fit to the observed image. this allows for galaxy profileswhich deviate from a sersic profile. we determine the effective radius of thisgalaxy: r_e=0.42 +- 0.14 kpc in the observed h-f160w-band. we show that thisresult is robust to deviations from the sersic model used in the fit. we testthe sensitivity of our analysis to faint "wings" in the profile using simulatedgalaxy images consisting of a bright compact component and a faint extendedcomponent. we find that due to the combination of the wfc3 imaging depth andour method's sensitivity to extended faint emission we can accurately trace theintrinsic surface brightness profile, and that we can therefore confidentlyrule out the existence of a faint extended envelope around the observed galaxydown to our surface brightness limit. these results confirm that the galaxylies a factor of 10 off from the local mass-size relation.

1009.0269	the most massive galaxies at 3.0&lt;z&lt;4.0 in the newfirm medium-band  survey: properties and improved constraints on the stellar mass function	[abridged] we use the newfirm medium-band survey (nmbs) to characterize theproperties of a mass-complete sample of 14 galaxies at 3.0&lt;z&lt;4.0 withm_star&gt;2.5x10^11 msun, and to derive more accurate measurements of thehigh-mass end of the stellar mass function (smf) of galaxies at z=3.5, withsignificantly reduced contributions from photometric redshift errors and cosmicvariance to the total error budget of the smf. the typical very massive galaxyat z=3.5 is red and faint in the observer's optical, with median r=26.1, andrest-frame u-v=1.6. about 60% of the sample have optical colors satisfyingeither the u- or the b-dropout color criteria, although ~50% of these galaxieshave r&gt;25.5. about 30% of the sample has sfrs from sed modeling consistent withzero. however, &gt;80% of the sample is detected at 24 micron, with total infraredluminosities in the range (0.5-4.0)x10^13 lsun. this implies the presence ofeither dust-enshrouded starburst activity (with sfrs of 600-4300 msun/yr)and/or highly-obscured active galactic nuclei (agn). the contribution ofgalaxies with m_star&gt;2.5x10^11 msun to the total stellar mass budget at z=3.5is ~8%. we find an evolution by a factor of 2-7 and 3-22 from z~5 and z~6,respectively, to z=3.5. the previously found disagreement at the high-mass endbetween observed and model-predicted smfs is now significant at the 3sigmalevel. however, systematic uncertainties dominate the total error budget, witherrors up to a factor of ~8 in the densities, bringing the observed smf inmarginal agreement with the predicted smf. additional systematic uncertaintieson the high-mass end could be introduced by either 1) the intensestar-formation and/or the very common agn activities as inferred from the mips24 micron detections, and/or 2) contamination by a significant population ofmassive, old, and dusty galaxies at z~2.6.

1105.4609	the newfirm medium-band survey: photometric catalogs, redshifts and the  bimodal color distribution of galaxies out to z~3	we present deep near-infrared (nir) medium-bandwidth photometry over thewavelength range 1-1.8 microns in the all-wavelength extended groth stripinternational survey (aegis) and cosmic evolution survey (cosmos) fields. theobservations were carried out as part of the newfirm medium-band survey (nmbs),an noao survey program on the mayall 4m telescope on kitt peak using the noaoextremely wide-field infrared imager (newfirm). in this paper, we describe thefull details of the observations, data reduction and photometry for the survey.we also present a public k-selected photometric catalog, along with accuratephotometric redshifts. the redshifts are computed with 37 (20) filters in thecosmos (aegis) fields, combining the nir medium-bandwidth data with existingultraviolet (uv; galaxy evolution explorer), visible and nir(canada-france-hawaii telescope and subaru) and mid-ir (spitzer/irac) imaging.we find excellent agreement with publicly available spectroscopic redshifts,with sigma_z/(1+z)~1-2% for ~4000 galaxies at z=0-3. the nmbs catalogs contain~13,000 galaxies at z&gt;1.5 with accurate photometric redshifts and rest-framecolors. due to the increased spectral resolution obtained with the five nirmedium-band filters, the median 68% confidence intervals of the photometricredshifts of both quiescent and star-forming galaxies are a factor of ~2 timessmaller when comparing catalogs with medium-band nir photometry to nirbroadband photometry. we show evidence for a clear bimodal color distributionbetween quiescent and star-forming galaxies that persists to z~3, a higherredshift than has been probed so far.

1106.1641	morphological evolution of galaxies from ultradeep hst wfc3 imaging: the  hubble sequence at z~2	we use ultradeep hst wfc3/ir imaging of the hudf to investigate therest-frame optical morphologies of a mass-selected sample of galaxies at z~2.we find a large variety of galaxy morphologies, ranging from large, blue,disk-like galaxies to compact, red, early-type galaxies. we derive rest-frameu-g color profiles for these galaxies and show that most z~2 galaxies in oursample have negative color gradients such that their cores are red. althoughthese color gradients may partly be caused by radial variations in dustcontent, they point to the existence of older stellar populations in thecenters of z~2 galaxies. this result is consistent with an "inside-out"scenario of galaxy growth. we find that the median color gradient is fairlyconstant with redshift: [delta(u-g_{rest})/delta(log r)]_{median} = -0.46,-0.44 and -0.49 for z~2, z~1 and z=0, respectively. using structural parametersderived from surface brightness profiles we confirm that at z~2 galaxymorphology correlates well with specific star formation rate. at the same mass,star forming galaxies have larger effective radii, bluer rest-frame u-g colorsand lower sersic indices than quiescent galaxies. these correlations are verysimilar to those at lower redshift, suggesting that the relations that giverise to the hubble sequence at z=0 are already in place for massive galaxies atthis early epoch.

1107.3147	the uvj selection of quiescent and star forming galaxies: separating  early and late-type galaxies and isolating edge-on spirals	we utilize for the first time hst acs imaging to examine the structuralproperties of galaxies in the rest-frame u-v versus v-j diagram (i.e., the uvjdiagram) using a sample at 0.6&lt;z&lt;0.9 that reaches a low stellar mass limit (logm/msun&gt;10.25). the use of the uvj diagram as a tool to distinguish quiescentgalaxies from star forming galaxies (sfgs) is becoming more common due to itsability to separate red quiescent galaxies from reddened sfgs. quiescentgalaxies occupy a small and distinct region of uvj color space and we find mostof them to have concentrated profiles with high sersic indices (n&gt;2.5) andsmooth structure characteristic of early-type systems. sfgs populate a broad,but well-defined sequence of uvj colors and are comprised of objects with a mixof sersic indices. interestingly, most uvj-selected sfgs with high sersicindices also display structure due to dust and star formation typical of then&lt;2.5 sfgs and late-type systems. finally, we find that the position of a sfgon the sequence of uvj colors is determined to a large degree by the mass ofthe galaxy and its inclination. systems that are closer to edge-on generallydisplay redder colors and lower [oii]3727 luminosity per unit mass as aconsequence of the reddening due to dust within the disks. we conclude that thetwo main features seen in uvj color space correspond closely to the traditionalmorphological classes of early and late-type galaxies.

1108.6060	first results from the 3d-hst survey: the striking diversity of massive  galaxies at z&gt;1	we present first results from the 3d-hst program, a near-ir spectroscopicsurvey performed with the wide field camera 3 on the hubble space telescope. wehave used 3d-hst spectra to measure redshifts and halpha equivalent widths fora stellar mass-limited sample of 34 galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;1.5 with m(stellar)&gt;10^11m(sun) in the cosmos, goods, and aegis fields. we find that a substantialfraction of massive galaxies at this epoch are forming stars at a high rate:the fraction of galaxies with halpha equivalent widths &gt;10 a is 59%, comparedto 10% among sdss galaxies of similar masses at z=0.1. galaxies with weakhalpha emission show absorption lines typical of 2-4 gyr old stellarpopulations. the structural parameters of the galaxies, derived from theassociated wfc3 f140w imaging data, correlate with the presence of halpha:quiescent galaxies are compact with high sersic index and high inferredvelocity dispersion, whereas star-forming galaxies are typically largetwo-armed spiral galaxies, with low sersic index. some of these star forminggalaxies might be progenitors of the most massive s0 and sa galaxies. ourresults challenge the idea that galaxies at fixed mass form a homogeneouspopulation with small scatter in their properties. instead we find that massivegalaxies form a highly diverse population at z&gt;1, in marked contrast to thelocal universe.

1204.3626	the star formation rate function for redshift z~4-7 galaxies: evidence  for a uniform build-up of star-forming galaxies during the first 3 gyr of  cosmic time	we combine recent estimates of dust extinction at z~4-7 with uv luminosityfunction (lf) determinations to derive star formation rate (sfr) functions atz~4, 5, 6 and 7. sfr functions provide a more physical description of galaxybuild-up at high redshift and allow for direct comparisons to sfrs at lowerredshifts determined by a variety of techniques. our sfr functions are derivedfrom well-established z~4-7 uv lfs, uv-continuum slope trends with redshift andluminosity, and irx-beta relations. they are well-described by schechterrelations. we extend the comparison baseline for sfr functions to z~2 byconsidering recent determinations of the h{\alpha} and mid-ir luminosityfunctions. the low-end slopes of the sfr functions are flatter than for the uvlfs, \delta\alpha\sim+0.13, and show no clear evolution with cosmic time(z~0-7). in addition, we find that the characteristic value sfr* from theschechter fit to sfr function exhibits consistent, and substantial, lineargrowth as a function of redshift from ~5 m_sun/yr at z~8, 650 myr after the bigbang, to ~100 m_sun/yr at z~2, ~2.5 gyr later. recent results at z~10, close tothe onset of galaxy formation, are consistent with this trend. the uniformityof this evolution is even greater than seen in the uv lf over the redshiftrange z~2-8, providing validation for our dust corrections. these resultsprovide strong evidence that galaxies build up uniformly over the first 3 gyrof cosmic time.

1207.6634	the evolution of mass-size relation for lyman break galaxies from z=1 to  z=7	for the first time, we study the evolution of the stellar mass-size relationfor star-forming galaxies from z ~ 4 to z ~ 7 from hubble-wfc3/ir cameraobservations of the hudf and early release science (ers) field. the sizes aremeasured by determining the best fit model to galaxy images in the rest-frame2100 \aa \ with the stellar masses estimated from sed fitting to rest-frameoptical (from spitzer/irac) and uv fluxes. we show that the stellar mass-sizerelation of lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) persists, at least to z ~ 5, and themedian size of lbgs at a given stellar mass increases towards lower redshifts.for galaxies with stellar masses of 9.5&lt;log(m*/msun)&lt;10.4 sizes evolve as$(1+z)^{-1.20\pm0.11}$. this evolution is very similar for galaxies with lowerstellar masses of 8.6&lt;log(m*/msun)&lt;9.5 which is $r_{e} \propto(1+z)^{-1.18\pm0.10}$, in agreement with simple theoretical galaxy formationmodels at high z. our results are consistent with previous measurements of thelbgs mass-size relation at lower redshifts (z ~ 1-3).

1208.4363	the stellar mass structure of massive galaxies from z=0 to z=2.5;  surface density profiles and half-mass radii	we present stellar mass surface density profiles of a mass-selected sample of177 galaxies at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.5, obtained using very deep hst optical andnear-infrared data over the goods-south field, including recent candels data.accurate stellar mass surface density profiles have been measured for the firsttime for a complete sample of high-redshift galaxies more massive than 10^10.7m_sun. the key advantage of this study compared to previous work is that thesurface brightness profiles are deconvolved for psf smoothing, allowingaccurate measurements of the structure of the galaxies. the surface brightnessprofiles account for contributions from complex galaxy structures such as ringsand faint outer disks. mass profiles are derived using radial rest-frame u-gcolor profiles and a well-established empirical relation between these colorsand the stellar mass-to-light ratio. we derive stellar half-mass radii from themass profiles, and find that these are on average ~25% smaller than rest-frameg band half-light radii. this average size difference of 25% is the same at allredshifts, and does not correlate with stellar mass, specific star formationrate, effective surface density, sersic index, or galaxy size. although onaverage the difference between half-mass size and half-light size is modest,for approximately 10% of massive galaxies this difference is more than a factortwo. these extreme galaxies are mostly extended, disk-like systems with largecentral bulges. these results are robust, but could be impacted if the centraldust extinction becomes high. alma observations can be used to explore thispossibility. these results provide added support for galaxy growth scenarioswherein massive galaxies at these epochs grow by accretion onto their outerregions.

0801.1110	a near-infrared spectroscopic survey of k-selected galaxies at z~2.3:  redshifts and implications for broadband photometric studies	using the gemini near-infrared spectrograph (gnirs), we have completed anear-infrared spectroscopic survey for k-bright galaxies at z~2.3, selectedfrom the musyc survey. we derived spectroscopic redshifts from emission linesor from continuum features and shapes for all 36 observed galaxies. thecontinuum redshifts are driven by the balmer/4000 angstrom break, and have anuncertainty in dz/(1+z) of &lt;0.019. we use this unique sample to determine, forthe first time, how accurately redshifts and other properties of massivehigh-redshift galaxies can be determined from broadband photometric data alone.we find that the photometric redshifts of the galaxies in our sample have asystematic error of 0.08 and a random error of 0.13 in dz/(1+z). the systematicerror can be reduced by using optimal templates and deep photometry; the randomerror, however, will be hard to reduce below 5%. the spectra lead tosignificantly improved constraints for stellar population parameters. for mostquantities this improvement is about equally driven by the higher spectralresolution and by the much reduced redshift uncertainty. properties such as theage, a_v, current star formation rate, and the star formation history aregenerally very poorly constrained with broadband data alone. interestinglystellar masses and mass-to-light ratios are among the most stable parametersfrom broadband data. nevertheless, photometric studies may overestimate thenumber of massive galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3, and thus underestimate the evolution ofthe stellar mass density. finally,the spectroscopy supports our previousfinding that red galaxies dominate the high-mass end of the galaxy populationat z=2-3.

1401.2984	observations of environmental quenching in groups in the 11 gyr since  z=2.5: different quenching for central and satellite galaxies	we present direct observational evidence for star formation quenching ingalaxy groups in the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;2.5. we utilize a large sample ofnearly 6000 groups, selected by fixed cumulative number density from threephotometric catalogs, to follow the evolving quiescent fractions of central andsatellite galaxies over roughly 11 gyr. at z~0, central galaxies in our samplerange in stellar mass from milky way/m31 analogs (m=6.5x10^10 m\solar) tonearby massive ellipticals (m=1.5x10^11 m\solar). satellite galaxies in thesame groups reach masses as low as twice that of the large magellanic cloud(m=6.5x10^9 m\solar). using statistical background subtraction, we measure theaverage rest-frame colors of galaxies in our groups and calculate the evolvingquiescent fractions of centrals and satellites over seven redshift bins. ouranalysis shows clear evidence for star formation quenching in group halos, witha different quenching onset for centrals and their satellite galaxies. usinghalo mass estimates for our central galaxies, we find that star formation shutsoff in centrals when typical halo masses reach between 10^12 and 10^13 m\solar,consistent with predictions from the halo quenching model. in contrast,satellite galaxies in the same groups most likely undergo quenching byenvironmental processes, whose onset is delayed with respect to their centralgalaxy. although star formation is suppressed in all galaxies over time, theprocesses that govern quenching are different for centrals and satellites.while mass plays an important role in determining the star formation activityof central galaxies, quenching in satellite galaxies is dominated by theenvironment in which they reside.

0803.0548	z~7-10 galaxies in the hudf and goods fields, and their uv luminosity  functions	we use all available deep optical acs and near-ir data over both the hudf andthe two goods fields to search for star-forming galaxies at z&gt;~7 and constrainthe uv lf within the first 700 myrs. our data set includes ~23 arcmin^2 of deepnicmos j+h data and ~248 arcmin^2 of ground-based (isaac+moircs) data,coincident with acs optical data of greater or equal depths. in total, we find8 &lt;z&gt;~7.3 z-dropouts in our search fields, but no z~9 j-dropout candidates. acareful consideration of a wide variety of different contaminants suggest anoverall contamination level of just ~12% for our z-dropout selection. afterperforming detailed simulations to accurately estimate the selection volumes,we derive constraints on the uv lfs at z~7 and z~9. for a faint-end slopealpha=-1.74, our most likely values for m*(uv) and phi* at z~7 are -19.8+/-0.4mag and 1.1_{-0.7}^{+1.7} x 10^{-3} mpc^{-3}, respectively. our search resultsfor z~9 j-dropouts set a 1 sigma lower limit on m*(uv) of -19.6 mag assumingthat phi* and alpha are the same as their values at slightly later times. thislower limit on m*(uv) is 1.4 mag fainter than our best-fit value at z~4,suggesting that the uv lf has undergone substantial evolution over this timeperiod. no evolution is ruled out at 99% confidence from z~7 to z~6 and at 80%confidence from z~9 to z~7. the inferred brightening in m*(uv) with redshift(i.e., m*(uv) = (-21.02+/-0.09) + (0.36+/-0.08)(z - 3.8)) matches the evolutionexpected in the halo mass function, if the mass-to-light ratio of halos evolvesas ~(1+z)**{-1}. finally, we consider the shape of the uv lf at z&gt;~5 anddiscuss the implications of the schechter-like form of the observed lfs,particularly the unexpected abrupt cut-off at the bright end.

0804.4175	the detection of a red sequence of massive field galaxies at z~2.3 and  its evolution to z~0	the existence of massive galaxies with strongly suppressed star formation atz~2.3, identified in a previous paper, suggests that a red sequence may alreadybe in place beyond z=2. in order to test this hypothesis, we study therest-frame u-b color distribution of massive galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3. the sample isdrawn from our near-infrared spectroscopic survey for massive galaxies. thecolor distribution shows a statistically significant (&gt;3 sigma) red sequence,which hosts ~60% of the stellar mass at the high-mass end. the red-sequencegalaxies have little or no ongoing star formation, as inferred from bothemission-line diagnostics and stellar continuum shapes. their strong balmerbreaks and their location in the rest-frame u-b, b-v plane indicate that theyare in a post-starburst phase, with typical ages of ~0.5-1.0 gyr. in order tostudy the evolution of the red sequence, we compare our sample withspectroscopic massive galaxy samples at 0.02&lt;z&lt;0.045 and 0.6&lt;z&lt;1.0. therest-frame u-b color reddens by ~0.25 mag from z~2.3 to the present at a givenmass. over the same redshift interval, the number and stellar mass density onthe high-mass end (&gt;10^11 msol) of the red sequence grow by factors of ~8 and~6, respectively. we explore simple models to explain the observed evolution.passive evolution models predict too strong d(u-b), and produce z~0 galaxiesthat are too red. more complicated models that include aging, galaxytransformations, and red mergers can explain both the number density and colorevolution of the massive end of the red sequence between z~2.3 and the present.

0805.0593	z~7-10 galaxies behind lensing clusters: contrast with field search  results	we conduct a search for z&gt;~7 dropout galaxies behind 11 massive lensingclusters using 21 arcmin**2 of deep hst nicmos, acs, and wfpc2 image data. intotal, over this entire area, we find only one robust z~7 z-dropout candidate(previously reported around abell 1689). four less robust z-dropout andj-dropout candidates are also found. the nature of the four weaker candidatescould not be precisely determined due to the limited depth of the availableoptical data, but detailed simulations suggest that all four could below-redshift interlopers. we compare these numbers with what we might expectusing the z~7 uv luminosity function (lf) determined from field searches. wepredict 2.7 z~7 z-dropouts and 0.3 z~9 j-dropouts over our cluster search area,in reasonable agreement with our observational results, given the smallnumbers. the number of z&gt;~7 candidates we find in the present search are muchlower than has been reported in several previous studies of the prevalence ofz&gt;~7 galaxies behind lensing clusters. to understand these differences, weexamined z&gt;~7 candidates in other studies and conclude that only a smallfraction are likely to be z&gt;~7 galaxies. our findings support models that showthat gravitational lensing from clusters is of the most value for detectinggalaxies at magnitudes brighter than l* (h&lt;~ 27) where the lf is expected to bevery steep. use of these clusters to constrain the faint-end slope or determinethe full lf is likely of less value due to the shallower effective slopemeasured for the lf at fainter magnitudes, as well as significant uncertaintiesintroduced from modelling both the gravitational lensing and incompleteness.

1506.03085	forming compact massive galaxies	in this paper we study a key phase in the formation of massive galaxies: thetransition of star forming galaxies into massive (m_stars~10^11 msun), compact(r_e~1 kpc) quiescent galaxies, which takes place from z~3 to z~1.5. we use hstgrism redshifts and extensive photometry in all five 3d-hst/candels fields,more than doubling the area used previously for such studies, and combine thesedata with keck mosfire and nirspec spectroscopy. we first confirm that apopulation of massive, compact, star forming galaxies exists at z~2, usingk-band spectroscopy of 25 of these objects at 2.0&lt;z&lt;2.5. they have a mediannii/halpha ratio of 0.6, are highly obscured with sfr(tot)/sfr(halpha)~10, andhave a large range of observed line widths. we infer from the kinematics andspatial distribution of halpha that the galaxies have rotating disks of ionizedgas that are a factor of ~2 more extended than the stellar distribution. bycombining measurements of individual galaxies, we find that the kinematics areconsistent with a nearly keplerian fall-off from v_rot~500 km/s at 1 kpc tov_rot~250 km/s at 7 kpc, and that the total mass out to this radius isdominated by the dense stellar component. next, we study the size and massevolution of the progenitors of compact massive galaxies. even thoughindividual galaxies may have had complex histories with periods of compactionand mergers, we show that the population of progenitors likely followed asimple inside-out growth track in the size-mass plane of d(log r_e) ~ 0.3 d(logm_stars). this mode of growth gradually increases the stellar mass within afixed physical radius, and galaxies quench when they reach a stellar density orvelocity dispersion threshold. as shown in other studies, the mode of growthchanges after quenching, as dry mergers take the galaxies on a relatively steeptrack in the size-mass plane.

0807.1766	the hd 163296 circumstellar disk in scattered light: evidence of  time-variable self-shadowing	we present the first multi-color view of the scattered light disk of theherbig ae star hd 163296, based on coronagraphic observations from the hubblespace telescope advanced camera for surveys (acs). radial profile fits of thesurface brightness along the disk's semi-major axis indicates that the disk isnot continuously flared, and extends to 540 au. the disk's color (v-i)=1.1 at aradial distance of 3.5 arcseconds is redder than the observed stellar color(v-i)=0.15. this red disk color might be indicative of either an evolution inthe grain size distribution (i.e. grain growth) and/or composition, both ofwhich would be consistent with the observed non-flared geometry of the outerdisk. we also identify a single ansa morphological structure in our f435w acsdata, which is absent from earlier epoch f606w and f814w acs data, butcorresponds to one of the two ansa observed in archival hst stis coronagraphicdata.  following transformation to similar band-passes, we find that the scatteredlight disk of hd 163296 is 1 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ fainter at 3.5 arcseconds in thestis data than in the acs data. moreover, variations are seen in (i) thevisibility of the ansa(e) structures, in (ii) the relative surface brightnessof the ansa(e) structures, and in (iii) the (known) intrinsic polarization ofthe system. these results indicate that the scattered light from the hd 163296disk is variable. we speculate that the inner disk wall, which sitko et al.suggests has a variable scale height as diagnosed by near-ir sed variability,induces variable self-shadowing of the outer disk. we further speculate thatthe observed surface brightness variability of the ansa(e) structures mayindicate that the inner disk wall is azimuthally asymmetric.

0808.0077	recent structural evolution of early-type galaxies: size growth from z=1  to z=0	strong size and internal density evolution of early-type galaxies between z~2and the present has been reported by several authors. here we analyze samplesof nearby and distant (z~1) galaxies with dynamically measured masses in orderto confirm the previous, model-dependent results and constrain theuncertainties that may play a role. velocity dispersion measurements are takenfrom the literature for 50 morphologically selected 0.8&lt;z&lt;1.2 field and clusterearly-type galaxies with typical masses 2e11 msol. sizes are determined withacs imaging. we compare the distant sample with a large sample of nearby(0.04&lt;z&lt;0.08) early-type galaxies extracted from the sdss for which wedetermine sizes, masses, and densities in a consistent manner, usingsimulations to quantify systematic differences between the size measurements ofnearby and distant galaxies. we find a highly significant structural differencebetween the nearby and distant samples, regardless of sample selection effects.the implied evolution in size at fixed mass between z=1 and the present is afactor of 1.97(0.15). this is in qualitative agreement with semianalyticmodels; however, the observed evolution is much faster than the predictedevolution. our results reinforce and are quantitatively consistent withprevious, photometric studies that found size evolution of up to a factor of 5since z~2. a combination of structural evolution of individual galaxies throughthe accretion of companions and the continuous formation of early-type galaxiesthrough increasingly gas-poor mergers is one plausible explanation of theobservations.

astro-ph;0103351	the evolution of balmer absorption line strengths in e/s0 galaxies from  z=0 to z=0.83	we present new results from a systematic study of absorption line strengthsof galaxies in clusters approaching redshifts of unity. in this paper, wespecifically compare the strengths of the high-order balmer absorption featuresof hgamma and hdelta in e/s0s in the four clusters abell 2256 (z=0.06),cl1358+62 (z=0.33), ms2053--04 (z=0.58), and ms1054--03 (z=0.83). by comparingthe correlation of balmer line strength with velocity dispersion for e/s0s inthe three clusters, we find moderate evolution in the zero-point of the(hdelta_a+hgamma_a)-sigma relation with redshift. the trend is consistent withpassive evolution of old stellar populations. under the assumption that thesamples can be compared directly, we use single-burst stellar populationsynthesis models to constrain the last major occurrences of star-formation inthe observed e/s0s to be z_f &gt; 2.5 (95% confidence). we have compared theevolution of the balmer absorption with the evolution of the b-band fundamentalplane and find that simple stellar population models agree very well with thedata. while the best agreement occurs with a low value for omega_m, the dataprovide strong confirmation of the time-evolution in recent stellar populationmodels.

astro-ph;0104155	luminosity evolution of field early-type galaxies to z=0.55	we study the fundamental plane of field early-type galaxies at intermediateredshift, using hst wfpc2 observations and deep keck spectroscopy. structuralparameters and internal velocity dispersions are measured for eighteen galaxiesat 0.15 &lt; z &lt; 0.55. rest frame m/l_b ratios are determined from the fundamentalplane and compared to those of cluster early-type galaxies at the sameredshifts. the systematic offset between m/l ratios of field and clusterearly-type galaxies at intermediate redshift is small, and not significant: &lt;lnm/l_b&gt;(field) - &lt;ln m/l_b&gt;(cluster) = -0.18 +- 0.11. the m/l ratios of fieldearly-type galaxies evolve as \delta (ln m/l_b) = (-1.35 +- 0.35) z, verysimilar to cluster early-type galaxies. after correcting for luminosityevolution, the fp of field early-type galaxies has a scatter 0.09 +- 0.02 inlog r_e, similar to that in local clusters. the scatter appears to be driven bylow mass s0 galaxies; for the elliptical galaxies alone we find 0.03 +- 0.03.there is a hint that the fp has a different slope than in clusters, but moredata are needed to confirm this. the similarity of the m/l ratios of clusterand field early-type galaxies provides a constraint on the relative ages oftheir stars. at &lt;z&gt; = 0.43, field early-type galaxies are younger than clusterearly-type galaxies by only 21 +- 13 %, and we infer that the stars in fieldearly-type galaxies probably formed at z &gt;~ 1.5. recent semi-analytical modelsfor galaxy formation in a lambda-cdm universe predict a systematic differencebetween field and cluster galaxies of \delta (ln m/l_b) ~ -0.6, much largerthan the observed difference. this result is consistent with the hypothesisthat field early-type galaxies formed earlier than predicted by these models.

astro-ph;0307242	the deep groth strip survey ix: evolution of the fundamental plane of  field galaxies	fundamental plane studies provide an excellent means of understanding theevolutionary history of early-type galaxies. using the low resolution imagingspectrograph on the keck telescope, we obtained internal stellar kinematicinformation for 36 field galaxies in the groth strip--21 early-type and 15 diskgalaxies. their redshifts range from 0.3--1.0, with a median redshift 0.8. theslope of the relation shows no difference compared with the local slope.however, there is significant evolution in the zero-point offset; an offset dueto evolution in magnitude requires a 2.4 magnitude luminosity brightening atz=1. we see little differences of the offset with bulge fraction, which is agood surrogate for galaxy type. correcting for the luminosity evolution reducesthe orthogonal scatter in the fundamental plane to 8%, consistent with thelocal scatter. this scatter is measured for our sample, and does not includeresults from other studies which may have different selection effects. thedifference in the degree of evolution between our field sample and publishedcluster galaxies suggests a more recent formation epoch--around z=1.5 for fieldgalaxies compared to z&gt;2.0 for cluster galaxies. the magnitude differenceimplies that the field early-type galaxies are about 2 gyr younger than thecluster ellipticals using standard single-burst models. however, the samemodels imply a significant change in the rest-frame u-b color from then topresent, which is not seen in our sample. continuous low-level star formation,however, would serve to explain the constant colors over this large magnitudechange. a consistent model has 7% of the stellar mass created after the initialburst, using an exponentially decaying star formation rate with an e-foldingtime of 5 gyr.

astro-ph;0409488	galaxies at z~7-8: z-dropouts in the hubble ultra deep field	we have detected likely z~7-8 galaxies in the 144"x144" nicmos observationsof the hubble ultra deep field. objects are required to be &gt;3 sigma detectionsin both nicmos bands, j and h. the selection criteria for this sample are(z-j)&gt;0.8, (z-j) &gt; 0.66 (j-h)+0.8, (j-h)&lt;1.2, and no detection at &lt;8500angstroms. the 5 selected sources have total magnitudes h~27. four of the fivesources are quite blue compared to typical lower-redshift dropout galaxies andare clustered within a 1 arcmin**2 region. because all 5 sources are near thelimit of the nicmos data, we have carefully evaluated their reality. each ofthe candidates is visible in different splits of the data and a median stack.we analyzed several noise images and estimate the number of spurious sources tobe 1+/-1. a search using an independent reduction of this same data set clearlyrevealed 3 of the 5 candidates and weakly detected a 4th candidate, suggestingthe contamination could be higher. for comparison with predictions from lowerredshift samples we take a conservative approach and adopt four z~7-8 galaxiesas our sample. with the same detection criteria on simulated datasets, assumingno-evolution from z~3.8, we predict 10 sources at z~7-8, or 14 if we use a morerealistic (1+z)^{-1} size scaling. we estimate that the rest-frame continuum uv(~1800 angstroms) luminosity density at z~7.5 (integrated down to 0.3l*) isjust 0.20_{-0.08}^{+0.12}x that found at z~3.8. effectively this sets an upperlimit on the luminosity density down to 0.3 l*. this result is consistent withsignificant evolution at the bright end of the luminosity function from z~7.5to z~3.8. even with the lower uv luminosity density at z~7.5, it appears thatgalaxies could still play an important role in reionization at these redshifts,though definitive measurements remain to be made.

astro-ph;0409696	infall, the butcher-oemler effect, and the descendants of blue cluster  galaxies at z~0.6	using wide-field hst/wfpc2 imaging and extensive keck/lris spectroscopy, wepresent a detailed study of the galaxy populations in ms2053--04, a massive,x-ray luminous cluster at z=0.5866. analysis of 149 confirmed cluster membersshows that ms2053 is composed of two structures that are gravitationally boundto each other; their respective velocity dispersions are 865 km/s (113 members)and 282 km/s (36 members). ms2053's total dynamical mass is 1.2x10^15 msun.ms2053 is a classic butcher-oemler cluster with a high fraction of blue members(24%) and an even higher fraction of star-forming members (44%), as determinedfrom their [oii] emission. the number fraction of blue/star-forming galaxies ismuch higher in the infalling structure than in the main cluster. this result isthe most direct evidence to date that the butcher-oemler effect is linked togalaxy infall. in terms of their colors, luminosities, estimated internalvelocity dispersions, and [oii] equivalent widths, the infalling galaxies areindistinguishable from the field population. ms2053's deficit of s0 galaxiescombined with its overabundance of blue spirals implies that many of theselate-types will evolve into s0 members. the properties of the blue clustermembers in both the main cluster and infalling structure indicate they willevolve into low mass, l&lt;l* galaxies with extended star formation histories likethat of low mass s0's in coma. our observations show that most of ms2053's bluecluster members, and ultimately most of its low mass s0's, originate in thefield. finally, we measure the redshift of the giant arc in ms2053 to bez=3.1462; this object is one in only a small set of known strongly lensedgalaxies at z&gt;3.

astro-ph;0411125	the nature of blue cores in spheroids: a possible connection with agn  and star formation	we investigate the physical nature of blue cores in early-type galaxiesthrough the first multi-wavelength analysis of a serendipitously discoveredfield blue-nucleated spheroid in the background of the deep acs/wfc grizmulticolor observations of the cluster abell 1689. the resolved g-r, r-i andi-z color maps reveal a prominent blue core identifying this galaxy as a``typical'' case study, exhibiting variations of 0.5-1.0 mag in color betweenthe center and the outer regions, opposite to the expectations of reddenedmetallicity induced gradients in passively evolved ellipticals. from amagellan-clay spectrum we secure the galaxy redshift at $z=0.624$. we find astrong x-ray source coincident with the spheroid galaxy. spectral features anda high x-ray luminosity indicate the presence of an agn in the galaxy. however,a comparison of the x-ray luminosity to a sample derived from the chandra deepfield south displays lx to be comparable to type i/qso galaxies while theoptical flux is consistent with a normal star-forming galaxy. we conclude thatthe galaxy's non-thermal component dominates at high-energy wavelengths whilewe associate the spheroid blue light with the stellar spectrum of normalstar-forming galaxies. we argue about a probable association between thepresence of blue cores in spheroids and agn activity.

astro-ph;0503116	constraints on z~10 galaxies from the deepest hst nicmos fields	we use all available fields with deep nicmos imaging to search for j dropouts(h&lt;28) at z~10. our primary data set for this search were the two j+h nicmosparallel fields taken with the acs hudf. the 5 sigma limiting mags were 28.6 inj and 28.5 in h. several shallower fields were also used: j+h nicmos framesavailable over the hdf north, the hdf south nicmos parallel, and the acs hudf.the primary selection criterion was (j-h)&gt;1.8. 11 such sources were found inall search fields using this criterion. 8 of these were clearly ruled out ascredible z~10 sources, either as a result of detections (&gt;2 sigma) blueward ofj or their colors redward of the break (h-k~1.5). the nature of the 3 remainingsources could not be determined from the data. the number appears consistentwith the expected contamination from low-z interlopers. analysis of the stackedimages for the 3 candidates also suggests contamination. regardless of theirtrue redshifts, the actual number of z~10 sources must be &lt;=3. to assess thesignificance of these results, two lower redshift samples (a z~3.8 b-dropoutand z~6 i-dropout sample) were projected to z~8-12 using a (1+z)^{-1} sizescaling. they were added to the image frames, and the selection repeated,giving 15.6 and 4.8 j-dropouts, respectively. this suggests that to the limitof this probe (0.3 l*) there has been evolution from z~3.8 and possibly fromz~6. this is consistent with the strong evolution already noted at z~6 andz~7.5 relative to z~3-4. even assuming that 3 sources from this probe are atz~10, the rest-frame continuum uv (~1500 a) luminosity density at z~10(integrated down to 0.3 l*) is just 0.19_{-0.09}^{+0.13}x that at z~3.8 (or0.19_{-0.10}^{+0.15}x including cosmic variance). however, if none of oursources is at z~10, this ratio has a 1 sigma upper limit of 0.07.

(1999) are indeed bound systems: they have projected separationsof r_s&lt;10 kpc and relative line-of sight velocities of dv&lt;165 km/s. for theremaining three pairs, we were unable to obtain redshifts of both constituentgalaxies. to identify a more objective sample of merging systems, we selectbound red galaxy pairs (r_s&lt;=30 kpc, dv&lt;=300 km/s) from our sample of 121confirmed cluster members: galaxies in bound red pairs make up 15.7+/-3.6% ofthe cluster population. the (b-k_s) color-magnitude diagram shows that the pairgalaxies are as red as the e/s0 members and have a homogeneous stellarpopulation. the red pair galaxies span a large range in luminosity and internalvelocity dispersion to include some of the brightest, most massive members(l&gt;l*, sigma&gt;200 km/s); these bound galaxy pairs must evolve into e/s0 membersby z~0.7. these results combined with ms1054's high merger fraction andreservoir of likely future mergers indicates that most, if not all, of itsearly-type members evolved from (passive) galaxy-galaxy mergers at z&lt;~1.

astro-ph;0604082	evolution of the color-magnitude relation in high-redshift clusters:  early-type galaxies in the lynx supercluster at z~1.26	color-magnitude relations have been derived in the clusters rx j0849+4452 andrx j0848+4453 at z~1.26. the color-magnitude relation was determined fromadvanced camera for surveys imaging in the wfc f775w (i_775) and f850lp (z_850)filters combined with ground-based spectroscopy. early-type cluster candidateshave been identified according to the postman et al. morphologicalclassification. in both clusters the bright red early-type population defines atight color-magnitude relation very similar in color, although the two clusterspresent different x-ray luminosities and shapes, with rx j0849+4452 being threetimes more x-ray luminous and more compact, and having a temperature two timeshigher. the elliptical galaxy color-magnitude relations (cmr) in rx j0849+4452and rx j0848+4453 show an intrinsic (i_775-z_850) color scatter of 0.026 +/-0.012 mag and 0.024 +/- 0.015 mag, respectively, within 2 arcminutes (~1mpc atz=1.26) from the cluster x-ray emission centers. simple modeling of thescatters using stellar population models from bruzual and charlot, gives a meanluminosity-weighted age t &gt; 2.5 gyr (z_f &gt; 2.75). s0 galaxies follow theelliptical cmr; they show larger scatters about the cmr.  the intrinsic scatter decreases and the cmr slopes are steeper at smallerradii, within both clusters. we conclude that old stellar populations incluster elliptical galaxies are already in place at z=1.26, both in the moreevolved cluster rx j0849+4452, and in its less evolved companion rx j0848+4453.even at a lookback time of 9 gyr, in the early merging and buildup of massiveclusters, the bulk of the stellar content of the bright elliptical galaxypopulation was in place - apparently formed some 2.5~gyr earlier at z~3

astro-ph;0606642	line strengths in early-type cluster galaxies at z=0.33: implications  for alpha/fe, nitrogen and the histories of e/s0s	[heavily abbreviated] in this paper we analyze previously published spectrawith high signal-to-noise ratios of e/s0 galaxies in the rich cluster cl1358+62at z=0.33, and introduce techniques for fitting stellar population models tothe data. here we focus on the 19 e and s0 galaxies with an homogeneous set ofeight blue lick indices. we explore the galaxy properties using six-parameterstellar population models from the literature, and describe an approach forfitting the models differentially, such that the largest systematic errors areavoided. we find: (1) no differences between the stellar population parametersof es and s0s, at fixed sigma; (2) the stars in the es and s0s are uniformlyold, consistent with previously published results using m/l ratios; (3) asignificant correlation of [z/h] with sigma, in a manner consistent with theobserved b-v colors of the galaxies; (4) no significant correlation of[alpha/fe] with sigma; and (5) a significant anti-correlation of [alpha/n] with[z/h], which we interpret as the signature of secondary nitrogen. neither[alpha/c], nor [alpha/ca] shows significant variation. while the differencesbetween our conclusions and the current view of stellar populations may pointto serious deficiencies, our deduced correlation of mean metallicity with sigmadoes reproduce the b-v colors of the galaxies, as well as the slope of thelocal mg-sigma relation. in matching the inferred population trends withpublished data on nearby galaxies, the line strength-line width relations matchwell, save for the narrow iron indices. taken together, these results reduceearly-type galaxies in clusters to a family with one-parameter, velocitydispersion, greatly simplifying scenarios for their formation and evolution.

astro-ph;0607649	comparing dynamical and photometric mass estimates of low- and  high-redshift galaxies: random and systematic uncertainties	we determine the importance of redshift-dependent systematic effects in thedetermination of stellar masses from broad band spectral energy distributions(seds), using high quality kinematic and photometric data of early-typegalaxies at z~1 and z~0. we find that photometric masses of z~1 galaxies can besystematically different, by up to a factor of 2, from photometric masses ofz~0 galaxies with the same dynamical mass. the magnitude of this bias dependson the choice of stellar population synthesis model and the rest-framewavelength range used in the fits. the best result, i.e., without significantbias, is obtained when rest-frame optical seds are fitted with models frombruzual&amp;charlot (2003). when the seds are extended to the rest-frame near-ir, abias is introduced: photometric masses of the z~1 galaxies increase by a factorof 2 relative to the photometric masses of the z~0 galaxies. when we use themaraston (2005) models, the photometric masses of the z~1 galaxies are lowrelative to the photometric masses of the z~0 galaxies by a factor of ~1.8.this offset occurs both for fits based on rest-frame optical seds, and fitsbased on rest-frame optical+near-ir seds. the results indicate that modeluncertainties produce uncertainties as high as a factor of 2.5 in massestimates from rest-frame near-ir photometry, independent of uncertainties dueto unknown star formation histories.

astro-ph;0611724	the origin of line emission in massive z~2.3 galaxies: evidence for  cosmic downsizing of agn host galaxies	using the gemini near-infrared spectrograph (gnirs), we have assembled acomplete sample of 20 k-selected galaxies at 2.0&lt;z&lt;2.7 with high qualitynear-infrared spectra. as described in a previous paper, 9 of these 20 galaxieshave strongly suppressed star formation and no detected emission lines. thepresent paper concerns the 11 galaxies with detected halpha emission, andstudies the origin of the line emission using the gnirs spectra and follow-upobservations with sinfoni on the vlt. based on their [nii]/halpha ratios, thespatial extent of the line emission and several other diagnostics, we inferthat four of the eleven emission-line galaxies host narrow line active galacticnuclei (agns). the agn host galaxies have stellar populations ranging fromevolved to star-forming. combining our sample with a uv-selected galaxy sampleat the same redshift that spans a broader range in stellar mass, we find thatblack-hole accretion is more effective at the high-mass end of the galaxydistribution (~2.9x10^11 msun) at z~2.3. furthermore, by comparing our resultswith sdss data, we show that the agn activity in massive galaxies has decreasedsignificantly between z~2.3 and z~0. agns with similar normalized accretionrates as those detected in our k-selected galaxies reside in less massivegalaxies (~4.0x10^10 msun) at low redshift. this is direct evidence fordownsizing of agn host galaxies. finally, we speculate that the typical stellarmass-scale of the actively accreting agn host galaxies, both at low and at highredshift, might be similar to the mass-scale at which star-forming galaxiesseem to transform into red, passive systems.

astro-ph;9701115	evolution of early-type galaxies in distant clusters: the fundamental  plane using hst imaging and keck spectroscopy	we present new results on the fundamental plane of galaxies in two richclusters, cl1358+62 at $z=0.33$ and ms2053--04 at $z=0.58$, based on keck andhst observations. our new data triple the sample of galaxies with measuredfundamental plane parameters at intermediate redshift. the early-type galaxiesin these clusters define very clear fundamental plane relations, confirming anearlier result for cl0024+16 at $z=0.39$. this large sample allows us toestimate the scatter reliably. we find it to be low, at 0.067 dex in $\logr_e$, or 17% in re, similar to that observed in comparable low redshiftclusters. this suggests that the structure of the older galaxies has changedlittle since $z=0.58$.  the $m/l_v$ ratios of early-type galaxies clearly evolve with redshift; theevolution is consistent with $\delta \log m/l_v \sim -0.3z$. the $m/l_v$ ratiosof two e+a galaxies in cl1358+62 are also lower by a factor of $\sim 3$,consistent with the hypothesis that they underwent a starburst 1 gyrpreviously. we conclude that the fundamental plane can therefore be used as asensitive diagnostic of the evolutionary history of galaxies. our data, whencompared to the predictions of simple stellar population models, imply that theoldest cluster galaxies formed at high redshift ($z &gt; 2$). we infer a differentevolutionary history for the e+a galaxies, in which a large fraction of starsformed at $z&lt;1$. larger samples spanning a larger redshift range are needed todetermine the influence of starbursts on the general cluster population.

astro-ph;9701244	optical rotation curves of distant field galaxies: sub-l* systems	moderate-resolution spectroscopic observations from the keck 10m telescopeare used to derive internal kinematics for eight faint disk galaxies in thefields flanking the hubble deep field. the spectroscopic data are combined withhigh-resolution f814w wfpc2 images from the hubble space telescope whichprovide morphologies and scale-lengths, inclinations and orientations. theeight galaxies have redshifts 0.15 &lt; z &lt; 0.75, magnitudes 18.6 &lt; i_814 &lt; 22.1and luminosities -21.8 &lt; m_b &lt; -19.0 (h_0 = 75 and q_0 = 0.05). terminal diskvelocities are derived from the spatially-resolved velocity profiles bymodeling the effects of seeing, slit width, slit misalignment with galaxy majoraxis, and inclination for each source. these data are combined with the sampleof vogt et al. (1996) to provide a high-redshift tully-fisher relation thatspans three magnitudes. this sample was selected primarily by morphology andmagnitude, rather than color or spectral features. we find no obvious change inthe shape or slope of the relation with respect to the local tully-fisherrelation. the small offset of &lt; 0.4 b mag with respect to the local relation ispresumably caused by luminosity evolution in the field galaxy population, anddoes not correlate with galaxy mass. a comparison of disk surface brightnessbetween local and high-redshift samples yields a similar offset, ~0.6 mag.these results provide further evidence for only a modest increase in luminositywith lookback time.

astro-ph;9801190	the color-magnitude relation in cl 1358+62 at z=0.33: evidence for  significant evolution in the s0 population	we use a large mosaic of hst wfpc2 images to measure the colors andmorphologies of 194 spectroscopically confirmed members of the rich galaxycluster cl1358+62 at z=0.33. we study the color-magnitude (cm) relation as afunction of radius in the cluster. the intrinsic scatter in the restframe b-vcm relation of the elliptical galaxies is very small: ~0.022 magnitudes. the cmrelation of the ellipticals does not depend significantly on the distance fromthe cluster center. in contrast, the cm relation for the s0 galaxies doesdepend on radius: the s0s in the core follow a cm relation similar to theellipticals, but at large radii (r&gt;0.7mpc) the s0s are systematically bluer andthe scatter in the cm relation approximately doubles to ~0.043 magnitudes. theblueing of the s0s is significant at the 95% confidence level. these resultsimply that the s0 galaxies in the outer parts of the cluster have formed starsmore recently than the s0s in the inner parts. a likely explanation is thatclusters at z=0.33 continue to accrete galaxies and groups from the field andthat infall extinguishes star formation. the apparent homogeneity of theelliptical galaxy population implies that star formation in recently accretedellipticals was terminated well before accretion occurred. we have constructedmodels to explore the constraints that these observations place on the starformation history of cluster galaxies. we conclude that the population of s0sin clusters is likely to evolve as star forming galaxies are converted intopassively evolving galaxies. assuming a constant accretion rate after z=0.33,we estimate ~15% of the present day early-type galaxy population in richclusters was accreted between z=0.33 and z=0. the ellipticals (and thebrightest s0s) are probably a more stable population, at least since z=0.6.

(1998) using thehst/wfpc2. combined with cluster velocities corrected for a cosmological flowmodel, these distances imply a value of the hubble constant of h0 = 69 +/- 4(random) +/- 6 (systematic) km/s/mpc. this result assumes that the cepheid plrelation is independent of the metallicity of the variable stars; adopting ametallicity correction as in kennicutt et al. (1998), would produce a (5 +/-3)% decrease in h0. finally, the newly derived calibration allows us toinvestigate systematics in the cepheid, pnlf, sbf, gclf and trgb distancescales.

astro-ph;9910501	a database of cepheid distance moduli and trgb, gclf, pnlf and sbf data  useful for distance determinations	we present a compilation of cepheid distance moduli and data for foursecondary distance indicators that employ stars in the old stellar populations:the planetary nebula luminosity function (pnlf), the globular clusterluminosity function (gclf), the tip of the red giant branch (trgb), and thesurface brightness fluctuation (sbf) method. the database includes all datapublished as of july 15, 1999. the main strength of this compilation resides inall data being on a consistent and homogeneous system: all cepheid distancesare derived using the same calibration of the period-luminosity relation, thetreatment of errors is consistent for all indicators, measurements which arenot considered reliable are excluded. as such, the database is ideal forinter-comparing any of the distance indicators considered, or for deriving acepheid calibration to any secondary distance indicator. specifically, thedatabase includes: 1) cepheid distances, extinctions and metallicities; 2)apparent magnitudes of the pnlf cutoff; 3) apparent magnitudes and colors ofthe turnover of the gclf (both in the v- and b-bands); 4) apparent magnitudesof the trgb (in the i-band) and v-i colors at and 0.5 magnitudes fainter thanthe trgb; 5) apparent surface brightness fluctuation magnitudes i, k', k_short,and using the f814w filter with the hst/wfpc2. in addition, for every galaxy inthe database we give reddening estimates from dirbe/iras as well as hi maps,j2000 coordinates, hubble and t-type morphological classification, apparenttotal magnitude in b, and systemic velocity.

astro-ph;9911065	the evolution of early-type galaxies in distant clusters i.: surface  photometry and structural parameters for 53 galaxies in the z=0.33 cluster  cl1358+62	using hst imaging of cl1358+62 (z=0.33) structural parameters are derived for53 cluster members. we fit integrated r^{1/4}-laws to the integrated s.b.profiles, and fit two-dimensional r^{1/4}-law model galaxies to the imagesdirectly. the results from the two methods agree very well, with an rms scatterof 13% in r_e. the half-light radii range from 1 to 20 kpc, with a median of 3kpc. we compared r_e from the r^{1/4}-law fits to r_{1/2} derived using otherprofiles. in particular, we fit sersic r^{1/n}-laws and superpositions ofr^{1/4}-law bulges with exponential disks. the r_{1/2} derived from thebest-fit sersic profiles varied with respect to r_e from the r^{1/4}-law fitsby 1% in the median, but with a standard deviation of more than 40%. for thebulge-plus-disk fits, the derived r_{1/2} were offset from r_e of ther^{1/4}-law fits by 10% in the mean, also with a standard deviation of morethan 40%. by comparing the sersic r_{1/2} with those derived from thebulge-plus-disk fitting, that scatter is also large, at 30%. we conclude thatr_{1/2} is generally measured with a typical accuracy of 30-40%. the largeuncertainties in r_{1/2} do not impact the fundamental plane analysis becausethe combination r&lt;i&gt;^{0.76}, which enters the fundamental plane, is extremelystable. the rms scatter in r&lt;i&gt;^{0.76} is less than 3%, regardless of the formof the profile fit to the galaxies. we find that the median bulge fraction ofthe sample is 84% and that the few e+a galaxies in this sample have disks whichmake up about 10-35% of their total light. these results are consistent withresiduals from fitting 2d r^{1/4}-law models directly to the galaxies, in whichdisk-like structures are revealed in about half of the sample. two of the threee+a galaxies show spiral arm structure.

0810.1917	evolution of the color-magnitude relation in galaxy clusters at z ~1  from the acs intermediate redshift cluster survey	we apply detailed observations of the color-magnitude relation (cmr) with theacs/hst to study galaxy evolution in eight clusters at z~1. the early-type redsequence is well defined and elliptical and lenticular galaxies lie on similarcmrs. we analyze cmr parameters as a function of redshift, galaxy propertiesand cluster mass. for bright galaxies (m_b &lt; -21mag), the cmr scatter of theelliptical population in cluster cores is smaller than that of the s0population, although the two become similar at faint magnitudes. while thebright s0 population consistently shows larger scatter than the ellipticals,the scatter of the latter increases in the peripheral cluster regions. if weinterpret these results as due to age differences, bright elliptical galaxiesin cluster cores are on average older than s0 galaxies and peripheralelliptical galaxies (by about 0.5gyr). cmr zero point, slope, and scatter inthe (u-b)_z=0 rest-frame show no significant evolution out to redshift z~1.3nor significant dependence on cluster mass. two of our clusters display cmrzero points that are redder (by ~2sigma) than the average (u-b)_z=0 of oursample. we also analyze the fraction of morphological early-type and late-typegalaxies on the red sequence. we find that, while in the majority of theclusters most (80% to 90%) of the cmr population is composed of early-typegalaxies, in the highest redshift, low mass cluster of our sample, the cmrlate-type/early-type fractions are similar (~50%), with most of the late-typepopulation composed of galaxies classified as s0/a. this trend is notcorrelated with the cluster's x-ray luminosity, nor with its velocitydispersion, and could be a real evolution with redshift.

0812.2021	a wide-field study of the z~0.8 cluster rx j0152.7-1357: the role of  environment in the formation of the red-sequence	[abridged] we present the first results from the largest spectroscopic surveyto date of an intermediate redshift galaxy cluster, the z=0.834 cluster rxj0152.7-1357. we use the colors of galaxies, assembled from a d~12 mpc regioncentered on the cluster, to investigate the properties of the red-sequence as afunction of density and clustercentric radius. our wide-field multi-slit surveywith a low-dispersion prism in the imacs spectrograph at magellan allowed us toidentify 475 new members of the cluster and its surrounding large scalestructure with a redshift accuracy of dz/(1+z)~1% and a contamination rate of~2% for galaxies with i&lt;23.75 mag. we combine these new members with the 279previously known spectroscopic members to give a total of 754 galaxies fromwhich we obtain a mass-limited sample of 300 galaxies with stellar massesm&gt;4x10^{10} m_sun. we find that the red galaxy fraction is 93+/-3% in the twomerging cores of the cluster and declines to a level of 64+/-3% at projectedclustercentric radii r&gt;~3 mpc. at these large projected distances, thecorrelation between clustercentric radius and local density is nonexistent.this allows an assessment of the influence of the local environment on galaxyevolution, as opposed to mechanisms that operate on cluster scales. even beyondr&gt;3 mpc we find an increasing fraction of red galaxies with increasing localdensity. the red fraction at the highest local densities in two groups at r&gt;3mpc matches the red fraction found in the two cores. strikingly, galaxies atintermediate densities at r&gt;3 mpc, that are not group members, also show signsof an enhanced red fraction. our results point to such intermediate densityregions and the groups in the outskirts of the cluster, as sites where thelocal environment influences the transition of galaxies onto the red-sequence.
