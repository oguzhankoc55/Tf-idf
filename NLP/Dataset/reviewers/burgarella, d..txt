0905.4616	the science case for pilot ii: the distant universe	pilot (the pathfinder for an international large optical telescope) is aproposed 2.5 m optical/infrared telescope to be located at dome c on theantarctic plateau. the atmospheric conditions at dome c deliver a highsensitivity, high photometric precision, wide-field, high spatial resolution,and high-cadence imaging capability to the pilot telescope. these capabilitiesenable a unique scientific potential for pilot, which is addressed in thisseries of papers. the current paper presents a series of projects dealing withthe distant (redshift &gt;) universe, that have been identified as key sciencedrivers for the pilot facility. the potential for pilot to detect the firstpopulations of stars to form in the early universe, via infrared projectssearching for pair-instability supernovae and gamma-ray burst afterglows, isinvestigated. two projects are proposed to examine the assembly and evolutionof structure in the universe: an infrared survey searching for the firstevolved galaxies at high redshift, and an optical survey aimed atcharacterising moderate-redshift galaxy clusters. finally, a large-areaweak-lensing survey and a program to obtain supernovae infrared light-curvesare proposed to examine the nature and evolution of dark energy and darkmatter.

0907.2819	the infrared emission of ultraviolet selected galaxies from z = 0 to z=1	we select galaxies in uv rest-frame at z=0, z~0.7 and z~1 together with asample of lbgs at z~1, the samples are built in order to sample the same rangeof luminosity at any redshift. the evolution of the ir and uv luminosities withz is analysed for individual galaxies as well as in terms of luminosityfunctions. the l_ir/l_uv ratio is used to measure dust attenuation. this ratiodoes not exhibit a strong evolution with z for the bulk of our sample galaxiesbut some trends are found for galaxies with a strong dust attenuation and foruv luminous sources: galaxies with l_ir/l_uv&gt;10 are more frequent at z&gt;0 thanat z=0 and the largest values of l_ir/l_uv are found for uv faint objects;conversely the most luminous galaxies of our samples (l_uv&gt; 2 10^{10} l_sun$),detected at z=1, exhibit a lower dust attenuation than the fainter ones.l_ir/l_uv increases with the k rest-frame luminosity of the galaxies at all theredshifts considered and shows a residual anti-correlation with l_uv. the mostmassive and uv luminous galaxies exhibit quite large specific star formationrates. lbgs exhibit systematically lower dust attenuation than uv selectedgalaxies of same luminosity but similar specific star formation rates. theanalysis of the uv+ir luminosity functions leads to the conclusion that up to z= 1 most of the star formation activity of uv selected galaxies is emitted inir. whereas we are able to retrieve all the star formation from our uvselection at z=0.7, at z = 1 we miss a large fraction of galaxies more luminousthan ~ 10^{11} l_sun. the effect is found larger for lyman break galaxies.

0909.5439	analysis of galaxy seds from far-uv to far-ir with cigale: studying a  sings test sample	photometric data of galaxies covering the rest-frame wavelength range fromfar-uv to far-ir make it possible to derive galaxy properties with a highreliability by fitting the attenuated stellar emission and the related dustemission at the same time. for this purpose we wrote the code cigale (codeinvestigating galaxy emission) that uses model spectra composed of the maraston(or pegase) stellar population models, synthetic attenuation functions based ona modified calzetti law, spectral line templates, the dale &amp; helou dustemission models, and optional spectral templates of obscured agn. depending onthe input redshifts, filter fluxes are computed for the model set and comparedto the galaxy photometry by carrying out a bayesian-like analysis. cigale wastested by analysing 39 nearby galaxies selected from sings. the reliability ofthe different model parameters was evaluated by studying the resultingexpectation values and their standard deviations in relation to the input modelgrid. moreover, the influence of the filter set and the quality of photometricdata on the code results was estimated. for up to 17 filters between 0.15 and160 mum, we find robust results for the mass, star formation rate, effectiveage of the stellar population at 4000 a, bolometric luminosity, luminosityabsorbed by dust, and attenuation in the far-uv. a study of the mutualrelations between the reliable properties confirms the dependence of starformation activity on morphology in the local universe and indicates asignificant drop in this activity at about 10^11 m_sol towards higher totalstellar masses. the dustiest sample galaxies are present in the same massrange.

0912.5051	star formation and dust extinction properties of local galaxies from  akari-galex all-sky surveys: first results from most secure multiband sample  from fuv to fir	the akari all-sky survey provided the first bright point source catalogdetected at 90um. starting from this catalog, we selected galaxies by matchingakari sources with those in the iras pscz. next, we have measured total galexfuv and nuv flux densities. then, we have matched this sample with sdss and2mass galaxies. by this procedure, we obtained the final sample which consistsof 607 galaxies. if we sort the sample with respect to 90um, their average sedshows a coherent trend: the more luminous at 90um, the redder the global sedbecomes. the m_r--nuv-r color-magnitude relation of our sample does not showbimodality, and the distribution is centered on the green valley between theblue cloud and red sequence seen in optical surveys. we have establishedformulae to convert fir luminosity from akari bands to the total infrared (ir)luminosity l_tir. with these formulae, we calculated the star formationdirectly visible with fuv and hidden by dust. the luminosity related to starformation activity (l_sf) is dominated by l_tir even if we take into accountthe far-infrared (fir) emission from dust heated by old stars. at high starformation rate (sfr) (&gt; 20 msun yr^-1), the fraction of directly visible sfr,sfr_fuv, decreases. we also estimated the fuv attenuation a_fuv fromfuv-to-total ir (tir) luminosity ratio. we also examined the l_tir/l_fuv-uvslope (fuv- nuv) relation. the majority of the sample has l_tir/l_fuv ratios 5to 10 times lower than expected from the local starburst relation, while somelirgs and all the ulirgs of this sample have higher l_tir/l_fuv ratios. wefound that the attenuation indicator l_tir/l_fuv is correlated to the stellarmass of galaxies, m*, but there is no correlation with specific sfr (ssfr),sfr/m*, and dust attenuation l_tir/l_fuv.

0707.3415	uv to ir seds of uv selected galaxies in the elais fields: evolution of  dust attenuation and star formation activity from z=0.7 to z=0.2	we study the ultraviolet to far-infrared (hereafter uv-to-ir) seds of asample of intermediate redshift (0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.7) uv-selected galaxies from theelais-n1 and elais-n2 fields by fitting a multi-wavelength dataset to a libraryof grasil templates. star formation related properties of the galaxies arederived from the library of models by using the bayesian statistics. we find adecreasing presence of galaxies with low attenuation and low total luminosityas redshift decreases, which does not hold for high total luminosity galaxies.in addition the dust attenuation of low mass galaxies increases as redshiftdecreases, and this trend seems to disappear for galaxies with m* &gt; 10^11m_sun. this result is consistent with a mass dependent evolution of the dust togas ratio, which could be driven by a mass dependent efficiency of starformation in star forming galaxies. the specific star formation rates (ssfr)decrease with increasing stellar mass at all redshifts, and for a given stellarmass the ssfr decreases with decreasing redshift. the differences in the slopeof the m*--ssfr relation found between this work and others at similar redshiftcould be explained by the adopted selection criteria of the samples which, fora uv selected sample, favours blue, star forming galaxies.

1002.3674	detection of the cosmic far-infrared background in the akari deep field  south	we report the detection and measurement of the absolute brightness andspatial fluctuations of the cosmic infrared background (cib) with the akarisatellite. we have carried out observations at 65, 90, 140 and 160 um as acosmological survey in akari deep field south (adf-s), which is one of thelowest cirrus regions with contiguous area on the sky. after removing brightgalaxies and subtracting zodiacal and galactic foregrounds from the measuredsky brightness, we have successfully measured the cib brightness and itsfluctuations across a wide range of angular scales from arcminutes to degrees.the measured cib brightness is consistent with previous results reported fromcobe data but significantly higher than the lower limits at 70 and 160 umobtained with the spitzer satellite from the stacking analysis of 24-umselected sources. the discrepancy with the spitzer result is possibly due to anew galaxy population at high redshift obscured by hot dust. from powerspectrum analysis at 90 um, three components are identified: shot noise due toindividual galaxies; galactic cirrus emission dominating at the largest angularscales of a few degrees; and an additional component at an intermediate angularscale of 10-30 arcminutes, possibly due to galaxy clustering. the spectralshape of the clustering component at 90 um is very similar to that at longerwavelengths as observed by spitzer and blast. moreover, the color of thefluctuations indicates that the clustering component is as red asultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) at high redshift, these galaxies arenot likely to be the majority of the cib emission at 90 um, but responsible forthe clustering component. our results provide new constraints on the evolutionand clustering properties of distant infrared galaxies.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.2187	the hermes spire submillimeter local luminosity function	local luminosity functions are fundamental benchmarks for high-redshiftgalaxy formation and evolution studies as well as for models describing theseprocesses. determining the local luminosity function in the submillimeter rangecan help to better constrain in particular the bolometric luminosity density inthe local universe, and herschel offers the first opportunity to do so in anunbiased way by imaging large sky areas at several submillimeter wavelengths.  we present the first herschel measurement of the submillimeter 0&lt;z&lt;0.2 localluminosity function and infrared bolometric (8-1000 $\mu$m) local luminositydensity based on spire data from the hermes herschel key program over 14.7deg^2.  flux measurements in the three spire channels at 250, 350 and 500 \mum arecombined with spitzer photometry and archival data. we fit the observedoptical-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution of spire sources and usethe 1/v_{max} estimator to provide the first constraints on the monochromatic250, 350 and 500 \mum as well as on the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) localluminosity function based on herschel data.  we compare our results with modeling predictions and find a slightly moreabundant local submillimeter population than predicted by a number of models.our measurement of the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local luminosityfunction suggests a flat slope at low luminosity, and the inferred localluminosity density, 1.31_-0.21^+0.24 x 10^8 lsun mpc^-3, is consistent with therange of values reported in recent literature.

1005.2192	hermes: far-infrared properties of known agn in the hermes fields	nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly.herschel-spire provides sampling of the fir seds of type 1 and type 2 agn,allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust(starburst) emission. we study large samples of spectroscopically confirmedtype 1 and type 2 agn lying within the herschel multi-tiered extragalacticsurvey (hermes) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aimingto understand their fir colour distributions and constrain their starburstcontributions. we find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed agn inthe hermes fields have 5-sigma detections at 250um, in agreement with previous(sub)mm agn studies. their combined spitzer-mips and herschel-spire colours -specifically s(250)/s(70) vs. s(70)/s(24) - quite clearly separate them fromthe non-agn, star-forming galaxy population, as their 24-um flux is dominatedby the hot torus emission. however, their spire colours alone do not differfrom those of non-agn galaxies. sed fitting shows that all those agn need astarburst component to fully account for their fir emission. for objects at z &gt;2, we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to thestarburst component, l(sb), and the agn accretion luminosity, l(acc), withl(sb) propto l(acc)^0.35. type 2 agn detected at 250um show on average higherl(sb) than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establishwhether this trend indicates stronger star-formation activity.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1007.1857	measures of star formation rates from infrared (herschel) and uv (galex)  emissions of galaxies in the hermes fields	the reliability of infrared (ir) and ultraviolet (uv) emissions to measurestar formation rates in galaxies is investigated for a large sample of galaxiesobserved with the spire and pacs instruments on herschel as part of the hermesproject. we build flux-limited 250 micron samples of sources at redshift z&lt;1,cross-matched with the spitzer/mips and galex catalogues. about 60 % of theherschel sources are detected in uv. the total ir luminosities, l_ir, of thesources are estimated using a sed-fitting code that fits to fluxes between 24and 500 micron. dust attenuation is discussed on the basis of commonly-useddiagnostics: the l_ir/l_uv ratio and the slope, beta, of the uv continuum. amean dust attenuation a_uv of ~ 3 mag is measured in the samples. l_ir/l_uv isfound to correlate with l_ir. galaxies with l_ir &gt; 10 ^{11} l_sun and 0.5&lt; z&lt;1exhibit a mean dust attenuation a_uv about 0.7 mag lower than that found fortheir local counterparts, although with a large dispersion. our galaxy samplesspan a large range of beta and l_ir/l_uv values which, for the most part, aredistributed between the ranges defined by the relations found locally forstarburst and normal star-forming galaxies. as a consequence the recipecommonly applied to local starbursts is found to overestimate the dustattenuation correction in our galaxy sample by a factor ~2-3 .

1009.3001	herschel-spire, far-infrared properties of millimetre-bright and -faint  radio galaxies	(abridged) we present the first study of the farir properties of highredshift, radio-selected ulirgs using deep observations obtained with spirefrom the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes). these galaxiesspan a large range of 850um fluxes from submillimetre-luminous ~10mjy "scubagalaxies -- smgs" to ~1.5mjy from stacked scuba non-detections, thus likelyrepresenting a complete distribution of ulirg spectral energy distributions.from keck spectroscopic surveys in the lockman-north field we identified asample of 31 smgs and 37 submillimetre-faint, optically-faint radio galaxies(ofrgs), all with radio-inferred ir luminosities &gt;10^12 lsun. these galaxieswere cross-identified with spire 250, 350 and 500um catalogs based on fluxesextracted at 24um positions in the swire survey, yielding a sample of more thanhalf of the galaxies well detected in at least two of the spire bandpasses. byfitting greybody dust models to the spire photometry together with scuba 850ummeasurements, we infer dust temperatures and far-infrared luminosities. theofrgs detected by spire have median &lt;t_d&gt;= 41+-5 k and the smgs have &lt;t_d&gt;=34+-5 k, both in reasonable agreement with previous (pre-herschel) estimates,reaffirming that the local fir/radio correlation holds (at least for thissubset of high-z ulirgs) at high redshift. our observations firstly confirmthat a substantial fraction of ofrgs exhibit large infrared luminositiescorresponding to sfrs of ~400 msun/yr. the spire observations secondly confirmthe higher dust temperatures for these ofrgs than similarly selected smgs,consistent with early predictions of the submm-faint radio populations. ourobservations also clearly confirm the large infrared luminosities of most smgsselected with s850um&gt;5 mjy and radio and strong 24um detections, correspondingto sfrs of ~700 msun/yr.

1010.0673	hermes : spire detection of high redshift massive compact galaxies in  goods-n field	we have analysed the rest-frame far infrared (fir) properties of a sample ofmassive (mstar &gt; 10^11msun) galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3 in the goods (great observatoriesorigins deep survey) north field using the spectral and photometric imagingreceiver (spire) instrument aboard the herschel space observatory. to conductthis analysis we take advantage of the data from the hermes key program. thesample comprises 45 massive galaxies with structural parameters characterisedwith hst nicmos-3. we study detections at submm herschel bands, together withspitzer 24{\mu}m data, as a function of the morphological type, mass and size.we find that 26/45 sources are detected at mips-24{\mu}m and 15/45 (allmips-24{\mu}m detections) are detected at spire-250{\mu}m, with disk-likegalaxies more easily detected. we derive star formation rates (sfr) andspecific star formation rates (ssfr) by fitting the spectral energydistribution (sed) of our sources, taking into account non-detections for spireand systematic effects for mips derived quantities. we find that the mean sfrfor the spheroidal galaxies (50-100 msun*yr^-1) is substantially (a factor ~ 3)lower than the mean value presented by disk-like galaxies (250-300 msun*yr^-1).

1010.2582	lyman `bump' galaxies - ii. a possible signature of massive extremely  metal-poor or metal-free stars in z=3.1 ly-alpha emitters	(abridged) deep nb359 imaging with subaru by iwata et al. have detectedsurprisingly strong lyman continuum (lyc; ~900a in the rest-frame) from somelaes at z=3.1. however, the redshifts might be misidentified due to a narrowwavelength coverage in previous spectroscopy. we here present new deepspectroscopy covering the observed 4,000-7,000a with vlt/vimos and subaru/focasof 8 laes detected in nb359. all the 8 objects have only one detectableemission line around 4,970a which is most likely to be ly-a at z=3.1, and thus,the objects are certainly laes at the redshift. however, 5 of them show a~0.''8 spatial offset between the ly-a emission and the source detected innb359. no indications of the redshifts of the nb359 sources are found althoughit is statistically difficult that all the 5 laes have a foreground objectaccounting for the nb359 flux. the rest 3 laes show no significant offset fromthe nb359 position. therefore, they are truly lyc emitting laes at z=3.1. wealso examine the stellar population which simultaneously accounts for thestrength of the lyc and the spectral slope of non-ionizing ultraviolet of thelaes. we consider the latest statistics of lyman limit systems to estimate thelyc optical depth in the igm and an additional contribution of the bound-freelyc from photo-ionized nebulae to the lyc emissivity. as a result, we find thatstellar populations with metallicity z&gt;=1/50z_sun can explain the observed lycstrength only with a very top-heavy initial mass function (imf; &lt;m&gt;~50 m_sun).however, the critical metallicity for such an imf is expected to be much lower.a very young (~1 myr) and massive (~100 m_sun) extremely metal-poor(z&lt;=5e-4z_sun) or metal-free (so-called population iii) stellar population canreproduce the observed lyc strength. the required mass fraction of such`primordial' stellar population is ~1--10% in total stellar mass of the laes.

1101.4796	hermes: detection of cosmic magnification of sub-mm galaxies using  angular cross-correlation	cosmic magnification is due to the weak gravitational lensing of sources inthe distant universe by foreground large-scale structure leading to coherentchanges in the observed number density of the background sources. depending onthe slope of the background source number counts, cosmic magnification causes acorrelation between the background and foreground galaxies, which is unexpectedin the absence of lensing if the two populations are spatially disjoint.previous attempts using submillimetre (sub-mm) sources have been hampered bysmall number statistics. the large number of sources detected in the {\itherschel} multi-tiered extra-galactic survey (hermes) lockman-swire fieldenables us to carry out the first robust study of the cross-correlation betweensub-mm sources and sources at lower redshifts. using ancillary data we compiletwo low-redshift samples from sdss and swire with &lt;z&gt; ~ 0.2 and 0.4,respectively, and cross-correlate with two sub-mm samples based on flux densityand colour criteria, selecting galaxies preferentially at z ~ 2. we detectcross-correlation on angular scales between ~1 and 50 arcmin and find clearevidence that this is primarily due to cosmic magnification. a small, butnon-negligible signal from intrinsic clustering is likely to be present due tothe tails of the redshift distribution of the sub-mm sources overlapping withthose of the foreground samples.

1102.1571	spectral energy distributions of an akari-sdss-galex sample of galaxies	the nearby universe remains the best laboratory to understand physicalproperties of galaxies and is a reference for any comparison with high redshiftobservations. the all sky (or very large) surveys performed from theultraviolet (uv) to the far-infrared (far-ir) gives us large datasets with avery large wavelength coverage to perform a reference study. we want toinvestigate dust attenuation characteristics as well as star formation rate(sfr) calibrations on a sample of nearby galaxies observed over 13 bands from0.15 to 160 microns. a sample of 363 galaxies is built from the akari /fis allsky survey cross-correlated with sdss and galex surveys. broad band spectralenergy distributions are fitted with the cigale code optimized to analyzevariations in dust attenuation curves and sfr measurements and based on anenergetic budget between the stellar and dust emission. our galaxy sample isprimarily selected in far-ir and mostly constituted of massive, actively starforming galaxies. there is some evidence for a dust attenuation law slightlysteeper than that used for starburst galaxies but we are unable to constrainthe presence or not of a bump at 220 nm. we confirm that a time dependent dustattenuation is necessary to perform the best fits. various calibrations of thedust attenuation in the uv as a function of uv-optical colours are discussed. acalibration of the current star formation rate combining uv and total iremissions is proposed with an accurate estimation of dust heating by old stars:for the whole sample 17 % of the total dust luminosity is not related to therecent star formation

1104.4113	discovery of a multiply-lensed submillimeter galaxy in early hermes  herschel/spire data	we report the discovery of a bright ($f(250\mum) &gt; 400$ mjy), multiply-lensedsubmillimeter galaxy \obj\ in {\it  herschel}/spire science demonstration phase data from the hermes project.interferometric 880\mum\ submillimeter array observations resolve at least fourimages with a large separation of $\sim 9\arcsec$. a high-resolution adaptiveoptics $k_p$ image with keck/nirc2 clearly shows strong lensing arcs. follow-upspectroscopy gives a redshift of $z=2.9575$, and the lensing model gives atotal magnification of $\mu \sim 11 \pm 1$. the large image separation allowsus to study the multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution (sed) of thelensed source unobscured by the central lensing mass. thefar-ir/millimeter-wave sed is well described by a modified blackbody fit withan unusually warm dust temperature, $88 \pm 3$ k. we derive a lensing-correctedtotal ir luminosity of $(1.43 \pm 0.09) \times 10^{13}\, \mathrm{l}_{\odot}$,implying a star formation rate of $\sim 2500\, \mathrm{m}_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. however, models primarily developed from brighter galaxiesselected at longer wavelengths are a poor fit to the full optical-to-millimetersed. a number of other strongly lensed systems have already been discovered inearly {\it herschel} data, and many more are expected as additional data arecollected.

1104.4115	redshift determination and co line excitation modeling for the  multiply-lensed galaxy hlsw-01	we report on the redshift measurement and co line excitation of hermesj105751.1+573027 (hlsw-01), a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy discoveredin herschel/spire observations as part of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes). hlsw-01 is an ultra-luminous galaxy with anintrinsic far-infrared luminosity of 1.4x10^(13) solar luminosities, and islensed by a massive group of galaxies into at least four images with a totalmagnification of 10.9+/-0.7. with the 100 ghz instantaneous bandwidth of thez-spec instrument on the caltech submillimeter observatory, we robustlyidentify a redshift of z=2.958+/-0.007 for this source, using the simultaneousdetection of four co emission lines (j = 7-6, j = 8-7, j = 9-8, and j = 10-9).combining the measured line fluxes for these high-j transitions with the j =1-0, j = 3-2 and j = 5-4 line fluxes measured with the green bank telescope,the combined array for research in millimeter astronomy, and the plateau debure interferometer, respectively, we model the physical properties of themolecular gas in this galaxy. we find that the full co spectral line energydistribution is well described by warm, moderate-density gas with tkin = 86-235k and n(h2) = (1.1-3.5)x10^3 cm^(-3). however, it is possible that thehighest-j transitions are tracing a small fraction of very dense gas inmolecular cloud cores, and two-component models that include a warm/densemolecular gas phase with tkin ~ 200 k, n(h2) ~ 10^5 cm^(-3) are also consistentwith these data. higher signal-to-noise measurements of the j(upper) &gt; 7transitions with high spectral resolution, combined with high spatialresolution co maps, are needed to improve our understanding of the gasexcitation, morphology, and dynamics of this interesting high-redshift galaxy.

1104.4116	dynamical structure of the molecular interstellar medium in an extremely  bright, multiply lensed z~3 submillimeter galaxy discovered with herschel	we report the detection of co 5-4, 3-2, and 1-0 emission in the stronglylensed, herschel/spire-selected submillimeter galaxy (smg) hlsw-01 atz=2.9574+/-0.0001, using the plateau de bure interferometer, the combined arrayfor research in millimeter-wave astronomy, and the green bank telescope. theobservations spatially resolve the molecular gas into four lensed images with amaximum separation of ~9", and reveal the internal gas dynamics in this system.we derive lensing-corrected co line luminosities of l'(co 1-0) = (4.17+/-0.41),l'(co 3-2) = (3.96+/-0.20) and l'(co 5-4) = (3.45+/-0.20) x 10^10(mu_l/10.9)^-1 kkm/s pc^2, corresponding to luminosity ratios of r_31 =0.95+/-0.10, r_53 = 0.87+/-0.06, and r_51 = 0.83+/-0.09. this suggests a totalmolecular gas mass of mgas = 3.3 x 10^10 (alpha_co/0.8) (mu_l/10.9)^-1 msun.the gas mass, gas mass fraction, gas depletion timescale, star formationefficiency, and specific star formation rate are typical for an smg. thevelocity structure of the gas reservoir suggests that the brightest two lensedimages are dynamically resolved projections of the same dust-obscured region inthe galaxy that are kinematically offset from the unresolved fainter images.the resolved kinematics appear consistent with the complex velocity structureobserved in major, `wet' (i.e., gas-rich) mergers. major mergers are commonlyobserved in smgs, and are likely to be responsible for fueling their intensestarbursts at high gas consumption rates. this study demonstrates the level ofdetail to which galaxies in the early universe can be studied by utilizing theincrease in effective spatial resolution and sensitivity provided bygravitational lensing.

1104.4119	modeling of the hermes j105751.1+573027 submillimeter source lensed by a  dark matter dominated foreground group of galaxies	we present the results of a gravitational lensing analysis of the bright$\zs=2.957$ sub-millimeter galaxy (smg), hermes j105751.1+573027 found in {\itherschel}/spire science demonstration phase data from the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes) project. the high resolution imaging available inoptical and near-ir channels, along with co emission obtained with the plateaude bure interferometer, allow us to precisely estimate the intrinsic sourceextension and hence estimate the total lensing magnification to be $\mu=10.9\pm0.7$. we measure the half-light radius $r_{\rm eff}$ of the source in therest-frame near-uv and $v$ bands that characterize the unobscured light comingfrom stars and find $r_{\rm eff,*}= [2.0 \pm 0.1]$ kpc, in good agreement withrecent studies on the submillimeter galaxy population. this lens model is alsoused to estimate the size of the gas distribution ($r_{\rm eff,gas}=[1.1\pm0.5]$) kpc by mapping back in the source plane the co (j=5-4) transitionline emission. the lens modeling yields a relatively large einstein radius$r_{\rm ein}= 4\farcs10 \pm 0\farcs02$, corresponding to a deflector velocitydispersion of [$483\pm 16] \,\kms$. this shows that hermes j105751.1+573027 islensed by a {\it galaxy group-size} dark matter halo at redshift $\zl\sim 0.6$.the projected dark matter contribution largely dominates the mass budget withinthe einstein radius with $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm ein})\sim 80%$. this fractionreduces to $f_{\rm dm}(&lt;r_{\rm eff,g1}\simeq 4.5\kpc)\sim 47%$ within theeffective radius of the main deflecting galaxy of stellar mass $m_{\rm*,g1}=[8.5\pm 1.6] \times 10^{11}\msun$. at this smaller scale the dark matterfraction is consistent with results already found for massive lensingellipticals at $z\sim0.2$ from the slacs survey.

1105.0646	hermes: lyman break galaxies individually detected at 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 2.0 in  goods-n with herschel/spire	as part of the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey we haveinvestigated the rest-frame far-infrared (fir) properties of a sample of morethan 4800 lyman break galaxies (lbgs) in the great observatories origins deepsurvey north field. most lbgs are not detected individually, but we do detect asub-sample of 12 objects at 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.6 and one object at z ~ 2.0.  the ones detected by herschel spire have redder observed nuv-u and u-r colorsthan the others, while the undetected ones have colors consistent with averagelbgs at z &gt; 2.5. the uv-to-fir spectral energy distributions of the objectsdetected in the rest-frame fir are investigated using the code cigale toestimate physical parameters. we find that lbgs detected by spire are highmass, luminous infrared galaxies.  it appears that lbgs are located in a triangle-shaped region in the a_fuv vs.log l_fuv diagram limited by a_fuv=0 at the bottom and by a diagonal followingthe temporal evolution of the most massive galaxies from the bottom-right tothe top-left of the diagram. this upper envelop can be used as upper limits forthe uv dust attenuation as a function of l_fuv}. the limits of this region arewell explained using a closed-box model, where the chemical evolution ofgalaxies produces metals, which in turn lead to higher dust attenuation whenthe galaxies age.

1105.2537	goods-herschel: an infrared main sequence for star-forming galaxies	we present the deepest far-ir observations obtained with herschel and examinethe 3-500um seds of galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5, supplemented by a local referencesample from iras, iso, spitzer and akari data. we find that the ratio of totalir luminosity to rest-frame 8um luminosity, ir8 (=lir/l8), follows a gaussiandistribution centered on ir8=4 and defines an ir main sequence (ms). a minoritypopulation (&lt;20 %) of outliers producing a tail skewed toward higher values ofir8 consist of starbursts (sb) with compact projected star formation densities.ir8 can be used to separate galaxies with normal and extended modes of starformation from compact sbs with high-ir8, high projected ir surface brightness(&gt;3x10^10 lsun kpc^-2) and a high specific sfr (i.e., sbs). the rest-frame,uv-2700a size of these distant sbs is typically half that of ms galaxies,supporting the correlation between star formation density and sb activity thatis measured for the local sample. locally, (u)lirgs are systematically in thesb mode, whereas most distant (u)lirgs form stars in the "normal" ms mode. thisconfusion between two modes of star formation is the cause of the so-called"mid-ir excess" population of galaxies found at z&gt;1.5 by previous studies. msgalaxies have strong pah emission line features, a broad far-ir bump resultingfrom a combination of dust temperatures (tdust~15-50 k), and an effectivetdust~31 k, as derived from the peak wavelength of their ir sed. galaxies inthe sb regime instead exhibit weak pah ew and a sharper far-ir bump with aneffective tdust~40 k. finally, we present evidence that the mid-to-far iremission of x-ray agns is predominantly produced by star formation and thatcandidate dusty agns with a power-law emission in the mid-ir systematicallyoccur in compact, dusty sbs. after correcting for the effect of sbs on ir8, weidentify new candidates for extremely obscured agns.

1107.1373	herschel/hermes: the x-ray - infrared correlation for star-forming  galaxies at z~1	for the first time, we investigate the x-ray/infrared (ir) correlation forstar-forming galaxies at z~1, using spire submm data from the recently-launchedherschel space observatory and deep x-ray data from the 2ms chandra deep fieldnorth (cdfn) survey. we examine the x-ray/ir correlation in the soft x-ray (sx,0.5-2 kev) and hard x-ray (hx, 2-10 kev) bands by comparing our z~1spire-detected star-forming galaxies (sfgs) to equivalently ir-luminous (l_ir&gt;10^10 l_sun) samples in the local/low redshift universe. our results suggestthat the x-ray/ir properties of the spire sfgs are on average similar to thoseof their local counterparts, as we find no evidence for evolution in thel_sx/l_ir and l_hx/l_ir ratios with redshift. we note however, that at allredshifts, both l_sx/l_ir and l_hx/l_ir are strongly dependent on irluminosity, with luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs andulirgs,l_ir &gt;10^11 l_sun) having up to an order of magnitude lower values thannormal infrared galaxies (l_ir &lt;10^11 l_sun). we derive a l_sx-l_ir relationand confirm the applicability of an existing l_hx-l_ir relation for both localand distant lirgs and ulirgs, consistent with a scenario where x-ray luminosityis correlated with the star-formation rate (sfr).

1107.2653	goods-herschel measurements of the dust attenuation of typical  star-forming galaxies at high redshift: observations of uv-selected galaxies  at z~2	we take advantage of the sensitivity and resolution of herschel at 100 and160 micron to directly image the thermal dust emission and investigate theinfrared luminosities, l(ir), and dust obscuration of typical star-forming (l*)galaxies at high redshift. our sample consists of 146 uv-selected galaxies withspectroscopic redshifts 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.6 in the goods-north field. supplemented withdeep very large array (vla) and spitzer imaging, we construct median stacks atthe positions of these galaxies at 24, 100, and 160 micron, and 1.4 ghz. thecomparison between these stacked fluxes and a variety of dust templates andcalibrations implies that typical star-forming galaxies with uv luminositiesl(uv)&gt;1e10 lsun at z~2 are luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs) with a medianl(ir)=(2.2+/-0.3)e11 lsun. typical galaxies at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.6 have a median dustobscuration l(ir)/l(uv) = 7.1+/-1.1, which corresponds to a dust correctionfactor, required to recover the bolometric star formation rate (sfr) from theunobscured uv sfr, of 5.2+/-0.6. this result is similar to that inferred fromprevious investigations of the uv, h-alpha, 24 micron, radio, and x-rayproperties of the same galaxies studied here. stacking in bins of uv slopeimplies that l* galaxies with redder spectral slopes are also dustier, and thatthe correlation between uv slope and dustiness is similar to that found forlocal starburst galaxies. hence, the rest-frame 30 and 50 micron fluxesvalidate on average the use of the local uv attenuation curve to recover thedust attenuation of typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift. in thesimplest interpretation, the agreement between the local and high redshift uvattenuation curves suggests a similarity in the dust production and stellar anddust geometries of starburst galaxies over the last 10 billion years.

1203.2562	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: hermes	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey, hermes, is a legacy programdesigned to map a set of nested fields totalling ~380 deg^2. fields range insize from 0.01 to ~20 deg^2, using herschel-spire (at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m),and herschel-pacs (at 100 and 160 \mu m), with an additional wider component of270 deg^2 with spire alone. these bands cover the peak of the redshiftedthermal spectral energy distribution from interstellar dust and thus capturethe re-processed optical and ultra-violet radiation from star formation thathas been absorbed by dust, and are critical for forming a completemulti-wavelength understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.  the survey will detect of order 100,000 galaxies at 5\sigma in some of thebest studied fields in the sky. additionally, hermes is closely coordinatedwith the pacs evolutionary probe survey. making maximum use of the fullspectrum of ancillary data, from radio to x-ray wavelengths, it is designed to:facilitate redshift determination; rapidly identify unusual objects; andunderstand the relationships between thermal emission from dust and otherprocesses. scientific questions hermes will be used to answer include: thetotal infrared emission of galaxies; the evolution of the luminosity function;the clustering properties of dusty galaxies; and the properties of populationsof galaxies which lie below the confusion limit through lensing and statisticaltechniques.  this paper defines the survey observations and data products, outlines theprimary scientific goals of the hermes team, and reviews some of the earlyresults.

1205.3778	hermes: candidate gravitationally lensed galaxies and lensing statistics  at submillimeter wavelengths	we present a list of 13 candidate gravitationally lensed submillimetergalaxies (smgs) from 95 square degrees of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey, a surface density of 0.14\pm0.04deg^{-2}. the selectedsources have 500um flux densities (s_500) greater than 100mjy. gravitationallensing is confirmed by follow-up observations in 9 of the 13 systems (70%),and the lensing status of the four remaining sources is undetermined. we alsopresent a supplementary sample of 29 (0.31\pm0.06deg^{-2}) gravitationallylensed smg candidates with s_500=80--100mjy, which are expected to contain ahigher fraction of interlopers than the primary candidates. the number countsof the candidate lensed galaxies are consistent with a simple statistical modelof the lensing rate, which uses a foreground matter distribution, the intrinsicsmg number counts, and an assumed smg redshift distribution. the model predictsthat 32--74% of our s_500&gt;100mjy candidates are strongly gravitationally lensed(mu&gt;2), with the brightest sources being the most robust; this is consistentwith the observational data. our statistical model also predicts that, onaverage, lensed galaxies with s_500=100mjy are magnified by factors of ~9, withapparently brighter galaxies having progressively higher average magnification,due to the shape of the intrinsic number counts. 65% of the sources areexpected to have intrinsic 500micron flux densities less than 30mjy. thus,samples of strongly gravitationally lensed smgs, such as those presented here,probe below the nominal herschel detection limit at 500 micron. they are goodtargets for the detailed study of the physical conditions in distant dusty,star-forming galaxies, due to the lensing magnification, which can lead tospatial resolutions of ~0.01" in the source plane.

1206.2319	herschel observations of a z~2 stellar mass selected galaxy sample drawn  from the goods nicmos survey	we present a study of the far-ir properties of a stellar mass selected sampleof 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 3 galaxies with log(m_*/m_sun) &gt; 9.5 drawn from the goods nicmossurvey (gns), the deepest h-band hubble space telescope survey of its typeprior to the installation of wfc3. we use far-ir and sub-mm data from the pacsand spire instruments on-board herschel, taken from the pacs evolutionary probe(pep) and herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes) key projectsrespectively. we find a total of 22 gns galaxies, with median log(m_*/m_sun) =10.8 and z = 2.0, associated with 250 um sources detected with snr &gt; 3. wederive mean total ir luminosity log l_ir (l_sun) = 12.36 +/- 0.05 andcorresponding star formation rate sfr_(ir+uv) = (280 +/- 40) m_sun/yr for theseobjects, and find them to have mean dust temperature t_dust ~ 35 k. we findthat the sfr derived from the far-ir photometry combined with uv-basedestimates of unobscured sfr for these galaxies is on average more than a factorof 2 higher than the sfr derived from extinction corrected uv emission alone,although we note that the ir-based estimate is subject to substantial malmquistbias. to mitigate the effect of this bias and extend our study to fainterfluxes, we perform a stacking analysis to measure the mean sfr in bins ofstellar mass. we obtain detections at the 2-4 sigma level at spire wavelengthsfor samples with log(m_*/m_sun) &gt; 10. in contrast to the herschel detected gnsgalaxies, we find that estimates of sfr_(ir+uv) for the stacked samples arecomparable to those derived from extinction corrected uv emission, although theuncertainties are large. we find evidence for an increasing fraction of dustobscured star formation with stellar mass, finding sfr_ir/sfr_uv \proptom_*^{0.7 +/- 0.2}, which is likely a consequence of the mass--metallicityrelation.

1207.3528	goods-herschel:dust attenuation properties of uv selected high redshift  galaxies	we study dust attenuation at uv wavelengths at high redshift, where the uv isredshifted to the observed visible. in particular, we search for a uv bump andrelated implications for dust attenuation determinations. we use data in thecdfs, obtained in intermediate and broad band filters by the musyc project, tosample the uv rest-frame of 751 galaxies with 0.95&lt;z&lt;2.2. when available,herschel/pacs data (goods-herschel project), and spitzer/mips measurements, areused to estimate the dust emission. the sed of each source is fit using thecigale code. the amount of dust attenuation and the dust attenuation curve areobtained as outputs of the sed fitting process, together with other parameterslinked to the sfh. the global amount of dust attenuation at uv wavelengths isfound to increase with stellar mass and to decrease as uv luminosity increases.a uv bump at 2175a is securely detected in 20% of the galaxies, and the meanamplitude of the bump for the sample is similar to that observed in the lmcsupershell region. this amplitude is found to be lower in galaxies with veryhigh ssfrs, and 90% of the galaxies exhibiting a secure bump are at z&lt;1.5. theattenuation curve is confirmed to be steeper than that of local starburstgalaxies for 20$% of the galaxies. the large dispersion found for these twoparameters describing the attenuation law is likely to reflect a wide diversityof attenuation laws among galaxies. the relations between dust attenuation,ir-to-uv flux ratio, and the slope of the uv continuum are derived for the meanattenuation curve found for our sample. deviations from the average trends arefound to correlate with the age of the young stellar population and the shapeof the attenuation curve.(abriged)

1209.5844	star formation and dust extinction properties of local galaxies as seen  from akari and galex	an accurate estimation of the star formation-related properties of galaxiesis crucial for understanding the evolution of galaxies. in galaxies,ultraviolet (uv) light emitted by recently formed massive stars is attenuatedby dust, which is also produced by star formation (sf) activity, and isreemitted at mid- and far- infrared (ir) wavelengths. in this study, weinvestigate the star formation rate (sfr) and dust extinction using uv and irdata. we selected local galaxies which are detected at akari fis 90 um andmatched the iras iifscz 60 um select catalog. we measured fuv and nuv fluxdensities from galex images. we examined the sf and extinction of localgalaxies using four bands of akari. then, we calculated fuv and total irluminosities, and obtained the sf luminosity, l_{sf}, the total luminosityrelated to star formation activity, and the sfr. we find that in most galaxies,l_{sf} is dominated by l_{dust}. we also find that galaxies with higher sfactivity have a higher fraction of their sf hidden by dust. in fact, the sf ofgalaxies with sfrs &gt;20 m_{sun}/yr is almost completely hidden by dust. ourresults boast a significantly higher precision with respect to previouslypublished works, due to the use of much larger object samples from the akariand galex all sky surveys.

1210.4932	a population of z&gt;2 far-infrared herschel-spire selected starbursts	we present spectroscopic observations for a sample of 36 herschel-spire250-500um selected galaxies (hsgs) at 2&lt;z&lt;5 from the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey (hermes). redshifts are confirmed as part of a largeredshift survey of herschel-spire-selected sources covering ~0.93deg^2 in sixextragalactic legacy fields. observations were taken with the keck i lowresolution imaging spectrometer (lris) and the keck ii deep imagingmulti-object spectrograph (deimos). precise astrometry, needed forspectroscopic follow-up, is determined by identification of counterparts at24um or 1.4ghz using a cross-identification likelihood matching method.individual source luminosities range from log(l_ir/lsun)=12.5-13.6(corresponding to star formation rates 500-9000msun/yr, assuming a salpeterimf), constituting some of the most intrinsically luminous, distant infraredgalaxies yet discovered. we present both individual and composite rest-frameultraviolet spectra and infrared spectral energy distributions (seds). theselection of these hsgs is reproducible and well characterized across largeareas of sky in contrast to most z&gt;2 hylirgs in the literature which aredetected serendipitously or via tailored surveys searching only for high-zhylirgs; therefore, we can place lower limits on the contribution of hsgs tothe cosmic star formation rate density at (7+-2)x10^(-3)msun/yr h^3mpc^(-3) atz~2.5, which is &gt;10% of the estimated total star formation rate density (sfrd)of the universe from optical surveys. the contribution at z~4 has a lower limitof 3x10^(-3)msun/yr h^3 mpc^(-3), ~&gt;20% of the estimated total sfrd. thishighlights the importance of extremely infrared-luminous galaxies with highstar formation rates to the build-up of stellar mass, even at the earliestepochs.

1211.4336	hermes: unveiling obscured star formation - the far infrared luminosity  function of ultraviolet-selected galaxies at z~1.5	we study the far-infrared (ir) and sub-millimeter properties of a sample ofultraviolet (uv) selected galaxies at z\sim1.5. using stacking at 250, 350 and500 um from herschel space observatory spire imaging of the cosmos fieldobtained within the hermes key program, we derive the mean ir luminosity as afunction of both uv luminosity and slope of the uv continuum beta. the ir to uvluminosity ratio is roughly constant over most of the uv luminosity range weexplore. we also find that the ir to uv luminosity ratio is correlated withbeta. we observe a correlation that underestimates the correlation derived fromlow-redshift starburst galaxies, but is in good agreement with the correlationderived from local normal star-forming galaxies. using these results wereconstruct the ir luminosity function of our uv-selected sample. thisluminosity function recovers the ir luminosity functions measured from irselected samples at the faintest luminosities (lir ~ 10^{11} l_sun), but mightunderestimate them at the bright-end (lir &gt; 5.10^{11} l_sun). for galaxies with10^{11}&lt;lir/l_sun&lt;10^{13}, the ir luminosity function of a uv selectionrecovers (given the differences in ir-based estimates) 52-65 to 89-112 per centof the star-formation rate density derived from an ir selection. the cosmicstar-formation rate density derived from this ir luminosity function is 61-76to 100-133 per cent of the density derived from ir selections at the sameepoch. assuming the latest herschel results and conservative stackingmeasurements, we use a toy model to fully reproduce the far ir luminosityfunction from our uv selection at z\sim 1.5. this suggests that a sample around4 magnitudes deeper (i.e. reaching u \sim 30 mag) and a large dispersion of their to uv luminosity ratio are required.

1211.6116	the complex physics of dusty star-forming galaxies at high redshifts as  revealed by herschel and spitzer	we combine far-infrared photometry from herschel (pep/hermes) with deepmid-infrared spectroscopy from spitzer to investigate the nature and the massassembly history of a sample of 31 luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxiesat z~1 and 2 selected in goods-s with 24 $\mu$m fluxes between 0.2 and 0.5 mjy.we model the data with a self-consistent physical model (grasil) which includesa state-of-the-art treatment of dust extinction and reprocessing. we find thatall of our galaxies appear to require massive populations of old (&gt;1 gyr) starsand, at the same time, to host a moderate ongoing activity of sf (sfr &lt; 100m$_{\odot}$/yr). the bulk of the stars appear to have been formed a few gyrbefore the observation in essentially all cases. only five galaxies of thesample require a recent starburst superimposed on a quiescent star formationhistory (sfh). we also find discrepancies between our results and those basedon optical-only sed fitting for the same objects; by fitting their observedspectral energy distributions with our physical model we find higherextinctions (by $\delta$a_{v} ~ 0.81 and 1.14) and higher stellar masses (by$\delta$log(m*) ~ 0.16 and 0.36 dex) for z~1 and z~2 (u)lirgs, respectively.the stellar mass difference is larger for the most dust obscured objects. wealso find lower sfrs than those computed from l_{ir} using the kennicuttrelation due to the significant contribution to the dust heating byintermediate-age stellar populations through 'cirrus' emission (~73% and ~66%of total l_{ir} for z~1 and z~2 (u)lirgs, respectively).

1212.1956	an investigation of star formation and dust attenuation in major mergers  using ultraviolet and infrared data	merger processes play an important role in galaxy formation and evolution. tostudy the influence of merger processes on the evolution of dust properties andcosmic star formation rate, we investigate a local sample of major mergergalaxies and a control sample of isolated galaxies using galex ultraviolet (uv)and spitzer infrared (ir) images. through a statistical study, we find thatdust attenuation in merger galaxies is enhanced with respect to isolatedgalaxies. we find this enhancement is contributed mainly by spiral galaxies inspiral-spiral (s-s) pairs, and increases with the increasing stellar mass of agalaxy. combining the ir and uv parts of star formation rates (sfrs), we thencalculated the total sfrs and specific star formation rates (ssfrs). we findthe ssfrs to be enhanced in merger galaxies. this enhancement depends on galaxystellar mass and the companion's morphology, but depends little on whether thegalaxy is a primary or secondary component or on the separation between twocomponents. these results are consistent with a previous study based only on irimages. in addition, we investigate the nuclear contributions to sfrs. sfrs inpaired galaxies are more concentrated in the central part of the galaxies thanin isolate galaxies. our studies of dust attenuation show that the nuclearparts of pairs most resemble ulirgs. including uv data in the present work notonly provides reliable information on dust attenuation, but also refinesanalyses of sfrs.

1304.7000	on the redshift evolution (0 &lt; z &lt; 4) of dust attenuation and of the  total (uv+ir) star formation rate density	using new homogeneous lfs in the fuv and in the fir herschel/pep andherschel/hermes, we study the evolution of the dust attenuation with redshift.with this information in hand, we are able to estimate the redshift evolutionof the total (fuv + fir) star formation rate density sfrd_tot. by integratingsfrd_tot, we follow the mass building and analyze the redshift evolution of thestellar mass density (smd). this letter aims at providing a complete view ofstar formation from the local universe to z = 4 and, using assumptions onearlier star formation history, compares this evolution to what was knownbefore in an attempt to draw a homogeneous picture of the global evolution ofstar formation in galaxies.  the main conclusions of this letter are: 1) the dust attenuation a_fuv isfound to increase from z = 0 to z \sim 1.2 and then starts to decrease up toour last data point at z = 3.6; 2) the estimated sfrd confirms publishedresults up to z = 2. at z &gt; 2, we observe either a plateau or a small increaseup to z = 3 and then a likely decrease up to z = 3.6; 3) the peak of a_fuv isdelayed with respect to the plateau of sfrd_tot and a likely origin might befound in the evolution of the bright ends of the fuv and fir lfs; 4) usingassumptions (namely exponential rise and linear rise with time) for theevolution of the star formation density from z = 3.6 to z_form = 10, weintegrate sfrd_tot and find a good agreement with the published smds.

1310.3227	hermes: dust attenuation and star formation activity in uv-selected  samples from z~4 to z~1.5	we study the link between observed ultraviolet luminosity, stellar mass, anddust attenuation within rest-frame uv-selected samples at z~ 4, 3, and 1.5. wemeasure by stacking at 250, 350, and 500 um in the herschel/spire images fromthe hermes program the average infrared luminosity as a function of stellarmass and uv luminosity. we find that dust attenuation is mostly correlated withstellar mass. there is also a secondary dependence with uv luminosity: at agiven uv luminosity, dust attenuation increases with stellar mass, while at agiven stellar mass it decreases with uv luminosity. we provide new empiricalrecipes to correct for dust attenuation given the observed uv luminosity andthe stellar mass. our results also enable us to put new constraints on theaverage relation between star formation rate and stellar mass at z~ 4, 3, and1.5. the star formation rate-stellar mass relations are well described by powerlaws (sfr~ m^0.7), with the amplitudes being similar at z~4 and z~3, anddecreasing by a factor of 4 at z~1.5 at a given stellar mass. we furtherinvestigate the evolution with redshift of the specific star formation rate.our results are in the upper range of previous measurements, in particular atz~3, and are consistent with a plateau at 3&lt;z&lt;4. current model predictions(either analytic, semi-analytic or hydrodynamic) are inconsistent with thesevalues, as they yield lower predictions than the observations in the redshiftrange we explore. we use these results to discuss the star formation historiesof galaxies in the framework of the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. ourresults suggest that galaxies at high redshift (2.5&lt;z&lt;4) stay around 1 gyr onthe main sequence. with decreasing redshift, this time increases such that z=1main sequence galaxies with 10^8&lt;m_*/msun&lt;10^10 stay on the main sequence untilz=0.

1310.7583	hermes: candidate high-redshift galaxies discovered with herschel/spire	we present a method for selecting $z&gt;4$ dusty, star forming galaxies (dsfgs)using herschel/spire 250/350/500 $\mu m$ flux densities to search for redsources. we apply this method to 21 deg$^2$ of data from the hermes survey toproduce a catalog of 38 high-$z$ candidates. follow-up of the first 5 of thesesources confirms that this method is efficient at selecting high-$z$ dsfgs,with 4/5 at $z=4.3$ to $6.3$ (and the remaining source at $z=3.4$), and thatthey are some of the most luminous dusty sources known. comparison withprevious dsfg samples, mostly selected at longer wavelengths (e.g., 850 $\mum$) and in single-band surveys, shows that our method is much more efficient atselecting high-$z$ dsfgs, in the sense that a much larger fraction are at$z&gt;3$. correcting for the selection completeness and purity, we find that thenumber of bright ($s_{500\,\mu m} \ge 30$ mjy), red herschel sources is $3.3\pm 0.8$ deg$^{-2}$. this is much higher than the number predicted by currentmodels, suggesting that the dsfg population extends to higher redshifts thanpreviously believed. if the shape of the luminosity function for high-$z$ dsfgsis similar to that at $z\sim2$, rest-frame uv based studies may be missing asignificant component of the star formation density at $z=4$ to $6$, even aftercorrection for extinction.

1312.0765	properties of star forming galaxies in akari deep field-south	the main aim of this work is the characterization of physical properties ofgalaxies detected in the far infrared (fir) in the akari deep field-south(adf-s) survey. starting from a catalog of the 1 000 brightest adf-s sources inthe wide-s (90$\mu$m) akari band, we constructed a subsample of galaxies withspectral coverage from the ultraviolet to the far infrared. we then analyzedthe multiwavelength properties of this 90$\mu$m selected sample of galaxies.for galaxies without known spectroscopic redshifts we computed photometricredshifts using the codes photometric analysis for redshift estimate (le phare)and code investigating galaxy emission (cigale), tested these photometricredshifts using spectroscopic redshifts, and compared the performances of bothcodes. to test the reliability of parameters obtained by fitting spectralenergy distributions, a mock cataloge was generated. we built a largemultiwavelength catalog of more than 500 adf-s galaxies. we successfully fittedspectral energy distributions of 186 galaxies with $\rm{\chi^2_{min}&lt;4}$, andanalyzed the output parameters of the fits. we conclude that our sampleconsists mostly of nearby actively star-forming galaxies, and all our galaxieshave a relatively high metallicity. we estimated photometric redshifts for 113galaxies from the whole adf-s sample. comparing the performance of le phare andcigale, we found that cigale gives more reliable redshift estimates for ourgalaxies, which implies that including the ir photometry allows for substantialimprovement of photometric redshift estimation.

1401.6079	hermes: spectral energy distributions of submillimeter galaxies at z &gt;4	we present a study of the infrared properties for a sample of sevenspectroscopically confirmed submillimeter galaxies at $z&gt;$4.0. by combiningground-based near-infrared, spitzer irac and mips, herschel spire, andground-based submillimeter/millimeter photometry, we construct their spectralenergy distributions (sed) and a composite model to fit the seds. the modelincludes a stellar emission component at $\lambda_{\rm rest} &lt;$ 3.5$ \mu$m; ahot dust component peaking at $\lambda_{rest} \sim$ 5$\,\mu$m; and cold dustcomponent which becomes significant for $\lambda_{\rm rest} &gt;$ 50$\,\mu$m. sixobjects in the sample are detected at 250 and 350$ \mu$m. the dust temperaturesfor the sources in this sample are in the range of 40$-$80 k, and their $l_{\rmfir}$ $\sim$ 10$^{13}$ l$_{\odot}$ qualifies them as hyper$-$luminous infraredgalaxies (hyperlirgs). the mean fir-radio index for this sample is around $&lt; q&gt; = 2.2$ indicating no radio excess in their radio emission. most sources inthe sample have 24$ \mu$m detections corresponding to a rest-frame 4.5$ \mu$mluminosity of log$_{10}$(l$_{4.5}$ / l$_{\odot}$) = 11 $\sim$ 11.5. theirl$_{\rm 4.5}$/$l_{\rm fir}$ ratios are very similar to those of starburstdominated submillimeter galaxies at $z \sim$ 2. the $l_{\rm co}-l_{\rm fir}$relation for this sample is consistent with that determined for local ulirgsand smgs at $z \sim$ 2. we conclude that submillimeter galaxies at $z &gt;$ 4 arehotter and more luminous in the fir, but otherwise very similar to those at $z\sim$ 2. none of these sources show any sign of the strong qso phase beingtriggered.

0803.0414	star formation history of galaxies from z=0 to z=0.7 a backward approach  to the evolution of star-forming galaxies	we investigate whether the mean star formation activity of star-forminggalaxies from z=0 to z=0.7 in the goods-s field can be reproduced by simpleevolution models of these systems. in this case, such models might be used asfirst order references for studies at higher z to decipher when and to whatextent a secular evolution is sufficient to explain the star formation historyin galaxies.  we selected star-forming galaxies at z=0 and at z=0.7 in ir and in uv to haveaccess to all the recent star formation. we focused on galaxies with a stellarmass ranging between 10^{10} and 10^{11} m_sun for which the results are notbiased by the selections. we compared the data to chemical evolution modelsdeveloped for spiral galaxies and originally built to reproduce the maincharacteristics of the milky way and nearby spirals without fine-tuning themfor the present analysis. we find a shallow decrease in the specific starformation rate (ssfr) when the stellar mass increases. the evolution of thessfr characterizing both uv and ir selected galaxies from z=0 to z=0.7 isconsistent with the models built to reproduce the present spiral galaxies.there is no need to strongly modify of the physical conditions in galaxies toexplain the average evolution of their star formation from z=0 to z=0.7. we usethe models to predict the evolution of the star formation rate and themetallicity on a wider range of redshift and we compare these predictions withthe results of semi-analytical models.

1504.00248	dust attenuation up to z~2 in the akari north ecliptic pole deep field	(abridged) we aim to study the evolution of dust attenuation in galaxiesselected in the ir in the redshift range in which they are known to dominatethe star formation activity in the universe. the comparison with othermeasurements of dust attenuation in samples selected using different criteriawill give us a global picture of the attenuation at work in star-forminggalaxies and its evolution with redshift. using multiple filters of ircinstrument, we selected more than 4000 galaxies from their rest-frame emissionat 8 microns, from z~0.2 to 2$. we built seds from the rest-frame uv to thefar-ir by adding data in the optical-nir and from galex and herschel surveys.we fit seds with the physically-motivated code cigale. we test differenttemplates for agns and recipes for dust attenuation and estimate stellarmasses, sfrs, amount of dust attenuation, and agn contribution to the total irluminosity. the agn contribution to the total ir luminosity is found to be onaverage approximately 10% with a slight increase with redshift. dustattenuation in galaxies dominating the ir luminosity function is found toincrease from z=0 to z=1 and to remain almost constant from z=1 to z=1.5.conversely, when galaxies are selected at a fixed ir luminosity, their dustattenuation slightly decreases as redshift increases but with a largedispersion. the attenuation in our mid-ir selected sample is found ~ 2 maghigher than that found globally in the universe or in uv and halpha lineselections in the same redshift range. this difference is well explained by anincrease of dust attenuation with the stellar mass, in global agreement withother recent studies. starbursting galaxies do not systematically exhibit ahigh attenuation

1504.04534	environment of the submillimeter-bright massive starburst hfls3 at  $z\sim$6.34	we describe the search for lyman-break galaxies (lbgs) near thesub-millimeter bright starburst galaxy hfls3 at $z$$=$6.34 and a study on theenvironment of this massive galaxy during the end of reionization.we performedtwo independent selections of lbgs on images obtained with the \textit{grantelescopio canarias} (gtc) and the \textit{hubble space telescope} (hst) bycombining non-detections in bands blueward of the lyman-break and colorselection. a total of 10 objects fulfilling the lbg selection criteria at$z$$&gt;$5.5 were selected over the 4.54 and 55.5 arcmin$^2$ covered by our hstand gtc images, respectively. the photometric redshift, uv luminosity, and thestar-formation rate of these sources were estimated with models of theirspectral energy distribution. these $z$$\sim$6 candidates have physicalproperties and number densities in agreement with previous results. the uvluminosity function at $z$$\sim$6 and a voronoi tessellation analysis of thisfield shows no strong evidence for an overdensity of relatively bright objects(m$_{f105w}$$&lt;$25.9) associated with \textit{hfls3}. however, the over-densityparameter deduced from this field and the surface density of objects can notexcluded definitively the lbg over-density hypothesis. moreover we identifiedthree faint objects at less than three arcseconds from \textit{hfls3} withcolor consistent with those expected for $z$$\sim$6 galaxies. deeper data areneeded to confirm their redshifts and to study their association with\textit{hfls3} and the galaxy merger that may be responsible for the massivestarburst.

1505.06242	hermes: current cosmic infrared background estimates can be explained by  known galaxies and their faint companions at z &lt; 4	we report contributions to cosmic infrared background (cib) intensitiesoriginating from known galaxies and their faint companions at submillimeterwavelengths. using the publicly-available ultravista catalog, and maps at 250,350, and 500 {\mu}m from the \emph{herschel} multi-tiered extragalactic survey(hermes), we perform a novel measurement that exploits the fact thatuncatalogued sources may bias stacked flux densities --- particularly if theresolution of the image is poor --- and intentionally smooth the images beforestacking and summing intensities. by smoothing the maps we are capturing thecontribution of faint (undetected in k_s ~ 23.4) sources that are physicallyassociated, or correlated, with the detected sources. we find that thecumulative cib increases with increased smoothing, reaching 9.82 +- 0.78, 5.77+- 0.43, and 2.32 +- 0.19$\, \rm nw m^{-2} sr^{-1}$ at 250, 350, and 500 {\mu}mat 300 arcsec fwhm. this corresponds to a fraction of the fiducial cib of 0.94+- 0.23, 1.07 +- 0.31, and 0.97 +- 0.26 at 250, 350, and 500 {\mu}m, where theuncertainties are dominated by those of the absolute cib. we then propose, witha simple model combining parametric descriptions for stacked flux densities andstellar mass functions, that emission from galaxies with log(m/msun) &gt; 8.5 canaccount for the most of the measured total intensities, and argue againstcontributions from extended, diffuse emission. finally, we discuss prospectsfor future survey instruments to improve the estimates of the absolute ciblevels, and observe any potentially remaining emission at z &gt; 4.

1506.07397	the spectral energy distribution of galaxies at z &gt; 2.5: implications  from the herschel/spire color-color diagram	we use the herschel spire color-color diagram to study the spectral energydistribution (sed) and the redshift estimation of high-z galaxies. we compileda sample of 57 galaxies with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts and spiredetections in all three bands at $z=2.5-6.4$, and compared their average spirecolors with sed templates from local and high-z libraries. we find that localseds are inconsistent with high-z observations. the local calibrations of theparameters need to be adjusted to describe the average colors of high-zgalaxies. for high-z libraries, the templates with an evolution from z=0 to 3can well describe the average colors of the observations at high redshift.using these templates, we defined color cuts to divide the spire color-colordiagram into different regions with different mean redshifts. we tested thismethod and two other color cut methods using a large sample of 783herschel-selected galaxies, and find that although these methods can separatethe sample into populations with different mean redshifts, the dispersion ofredshifts in each population is considerably large. additional information isneeded for better sampling.

0805.4012	detections of lyman continuum from star-forming galaxies at z~3 through  subaru/suprime-cam narrow-band imaging	knowing the amount of ionizing photons from young star-forming galaxies is ofparticular importance to understanding the reionization process. here we reportinitial results of subaru/suprime-cam deep imaging observation of the ssa22proto-cluster region at z=3.09, using a special narrow-band filter to optimallytrace lyman continuum (lyc) from galaxies at z~3. the unique wide field-of-viewof suprime-cam enabled us to search for ionizing photons from 198 galaxies (73lyman break galaxies (lbgs) and 125 ly-alpha emitters (laes)) withspectroscopically measured redshifts z~3.1. we detected lyc from 7 lbgs, aswell as from 10 lae candidates. some of the detected galaxies show significantspatial offsets of lyc from non-ionizing uv emission. for some lbgs theobserved non-ionizing uv to lyc flux density ratios are smaller than valuesexpected from population synthesis models with a standard salpeter initial massfunction (imf) with moderate dust attenuation (which is suggested from theobserved uv slopes), even if we assume very transparent igm along thesightlines of these objects. this implies an intrinsically bluer spectralenergy distribution, e.g, that produced by a top-heavy imf, for these lbgs. theobserved flux desity ratios of non-ionizing uv to lyc of 7 detected lbgs rangefrom 2.4 to 23.8 and the median is 6.6. the observed flux density ratios of thedetected laes are even smaller than lbgs, if they are truly at z~3.1. we findthat the median value of the flux density ratio for the deteced lbgs suggestthat their escape fractions is likely to be higher than 4%, if the lyc escapeis isotropic. the results imply that some of the lbgs in the proto-cluster atz~3 have the escape fraction significantly higher than that of galaxies (in ageneral field) at z~1 studied previously.

1511.06167	the hermes sub-millimetre local and low-redshift luminosity functions	we used wide area surveys over 39 deg$^2$ by the hermes collaboration,performed with the herschel observatory spire multi-wavelength camera, toestimate the low-redshift, $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.5$, monochromatic luminosity functions(lfs) of galaxies at 250, 350 and 500$\,\mu$m. spire flux densities were alsocombined with spitzer photometry and multi-wavelength archival data to performa complete sed fitting analysis of spire detected sources to calculate precisek-corrections, as well as the bolometric infrared (8-1000$\,\mu$m) luminosityfunctions and their low-$z$ evolution from a combination of statisticalestimators. integration of the latter prompted us to also compute the localluminosity density (lld) and the comoving star formation rate density (sfrd)for our sources, and to compare them with theoretical predictions of galaxyformation models. the luminosity functions show significant and rapidluminosity evolution already at low redshifts, $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.2$, with l$_{ir}^*\propto (1+z)^{6.0\pm0.4}$ and $\phi_{ir}^* \propto (1+z)^{-2.1\pm0.4}$,l$_{250}^* \propto (1+z)^{5.3\pm0.2}$ and $\phi_{250}^* \propto(1+z)^{-0.6\pm0.4}$ estimated using the ir bolometric and the 250$\,\mu$m lfsrespectively. converting our ir ld estimate into an sfrd assuming a standardsalpeter imf and including the unobscured contribution based on the uvdust-uncorrected emission from local galaxies, we estimate a sfrd scaling ofsfrd$_0+0.08 z$, where sfrd$_0\simeq (1.9\pm 0.03)\times 10^{-2}[\mathrm{m}_\odot\,\mathrm{mpc}^{-3}]$ is our total sfrd estimate at$z\sim0.02$.

1512.04120	dust properties of lyman break galaxies at $z\sim3$	we explore from a statistical point of view the far-infrared (far-ir) andsub-millimeter (sub-mm) properties of a large sample of lbgs (22,000) at z~3 inthe cosmos field. the large number of galaxies allows us to split it in severalbins as a function of uv luminosity, uv slope, and stellar mass to bettersample their variety. we perform stacking analysis in pacs (100 and 160 um),spire (250, 350 and 500 um) and aztec (1.1 mm) images. our stacking procedurecorrects the biases induced by galaxy clustering and incompleteness of ourinput catalogue in dense regions. we obtain the full ir spectral energydistributions (sed) of subsamples of lbgs and derive the mean ir luminosity asa function of uv luminosity, uv slope, and stellar mass. the average irx isroughly constant over the uv luminosity range, with a mean of 7.9 (1.8 mag).however, it is correlated with uv slope, and stellar mass. we investigate usinga statistically-controlled stacking analysis as a function of (stellar mass, uvslope) the dispersion of the irx-uvslope and irx-m* plane. our results enableus to study the average relation between star-formation rate (sfr) and stellarmass, and we show that our lbg sample lies on the main sequence of starformation at z~3.

astro-ph;0109289	the falcon concept: multi-object spectroscopy combined with mcao in  near-ir	a large fraction of the present-day stellar mass was formed between z=0.5 andz~3 and our understanding of the formation mechanisms at work at these epochsrequires both high spatial and high spectral resolution: one shallsimultaneously} obtain images of objects with typical sizes as small as1-2kpc(~0''.1), while achieving 20-50 km/s (r &gt;= 5000) spectral resolution. theobvious instrumental solution to adopt in order to tackle the science goal istherefore a combination of multi-object 3d spectrograph with multi-conjugateadaptive optics in large fields. a partial, but still competitive correctionshall be prefered, over a much wider field of view. this can be done byestimating the turbulent volume from sets of natural guide stars, by optimizingthe correction to several and discrete small areas of few arcsec2 selected in alarge field (nasmyth field of 25 arcmin) and by correcting up to the 6th, andeventually, up to the 60th zernike modes. simulations on real extragalacticfields, show that for most sources (&gt;80%), the recovered resolution could reach0".15-0".25 in the j and h bands. detection of point-like objects is improvedby factors from 3 to &gt;10, when compared with an instrument without adaptivecorrection. the proposed instrument concept, falcon, is equiped with deployablemini-integral field units (ifus), achieving spectral resolutions between r=5000and 20000. its multiplex capability, combined with high spatial and spectralresolution characteristics, is a natural ground based complement to the nextgeneration of space telescopes.

astro-ph;0411196	mid-infrared luminosity as an indicator of the total infrared luminosity  of galaxies	the infrared (ir) emission plays a crucial role for understanding the starformation in galaxies hidden by dust. we first examined four estimators of their luminosity of galaxies, l_fir (helou et al. 1988), l_tir (dale et al. 2001),revised version of l_tir (dale &amp; helou 2002) (we denote l_tir2), and l_ir(sanders &amp; mirabel 1996) by using the observed seds of well-known galaxies. wefound that l_ir provides excellent estimates of the total ir luminosity for avariety of galaxy seds. the performance of l_tir2 was also found to be verygood. using l_ir, we then statistically analyzed the iras pscz galaxy sample(saunders et al. 2000) and found useful formulae relating the mir monochromaticluminosities [l(12um) and l(25um)], and l_ir. for this purpose we constructed asubsample of 1420 galaxies with all iras four band (12, 25, 60, and 100um) fluxdensities. we found linear relations between l_ir and mir luminosities, l(12um)and l(25um). the prediction error with 95-% confidence level is a factor of4-5. hence, these formulae are useful for the estimation of the total irluminosity only from 12um or 25um observations. we further tried to make an`interpolation' formula for galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;1. for this purpose we constructthe formula of the relation between 15-um luminosity and the total irluminosity. we conclude that the 15-um formula can be used as an estimator ofthe total ir luminosity from 24um observation of galaxies at z \simeq 0.6.

astro-ph;0411309	galex observations of the ultraviolet halos of ngc 253 and m82	we present galaxy evolution explorer (galex) images of the prototypicaledge-on starburst galaxies m82 and ngc253. our initial analysis is restrictedto the complex of ultraviolet (uv) filaments in the starburst-driven outflowsin the galaxy halos. the uv luminosities in the halo are too high to beprovided by shock-heated or photoionized gas except perhaps in the brightestfilaments in m82, suggesting that most of the uv light is the stellar continuumof the starburst scattered into our line of sight by dust in the outflow. thisinterpretation agrees with previous results from optical imaging polarimetry inm82. the morphology of the uv filaments in both galaxies shows a high degree ofspatial correlation with h-alpha and x-ray emission. this indicates that theseoutflows contain cold gas and dust, some of which may be vented into theintergalactic medium (igm). uv light is seen in the ``h-alpha cap'' 11 kpcnorth of m82. if this cap is a result of the wind fluid running into apre-existing gas cloud, the gas cloud contains dust and is not primordial innature but was probably stripped from m82 or m81. if starburst windsefficiently expel dust into the igm, this could have significant consequencesfor the observation of cosmologically distant objects.

astro-ph;0411343	dust attenuation in the nearby universe: comparison between galaxies  selected in the ultraviolet or in the infrared	we compare the dust attenuation properties of two samples of galaxies purelyselected in the near-ultraviolet (nuv) band (1750-2750 a, lambda_m = 2310 a)and in the far-infrared (fir) at 60micron. these samples are built using thegalex and iras sky surveys over ~600 square degrees. the nuv selected samplecontains 95 galaxies detected down to nuv=16mag (ab system). 83 galaxies inthis sample are spirals or irregulars and only two of them are not detected at60micron. the fir selected sample is built from the iras pscz catalog completedown to 0.6jy. among the 163 sources, we select 118 star forming galaxies wellmeasured by iras, all but 1 are detected in nuv and 14 galaxies are notdetected in the far-ultraviolet (fuv) band (1350-1750 a, lambda_m = 1530 a).the dust to ultraviolet (nuv and fuv) flux ratio is calibrated to estimate thedust attenuation at both wavelengths. the median value of the attenuation innuv is found to be ~1 mag for the nuv selected sample versus ~2 mag for the firselected one. within both samples, the dust attenuation is found to correlatewith the luminosity of the galaxies. almost all the nuv selected galaxies and2/3 of the fir selected sample exhibit a lower dust attenuation than thatexpected from the tight relation found previously for starburst galaxiesbetween the dust attenuation and the slope of the ultraviolet continuum. thesituation is inverse for one third of the fir selected galaxies: theirextinction is higher than that deduced from their fuv-nuv color and therelation valid for starbursts.

astro-ph;0604010	galaxy luminosity function per morphological type up to z=1.2	we have computed the evolution of the rest-frame b-band luminosity function(lf) for bulge and disk-dominated galaxies since z=1.2. we use a sample of 605spectroscopic redshifts with i_{ab}&lt;24 in the chandra deep field south from thevimos-vlt deep survey, 3555 galaxies with photometric redshifts from thecombo-17 multi-color data, coupled with multi-color hst/acs images from thegreat observatories origin deep survey. we split the sample in bulge- anddisk-dominated populations on the basis of asymmetry and concentrationparameters measured in the rest-frame b-band. we find that at z=0.4-0.8, the lfslope is significantly steeper for the disk-dominated population (\alpha=-1.19\pm 0.07) compared to the bulge-dominated population (\alpha=-0.53 \pm 0.13).the lf of the bulge-dominated population is composed of two distinctpopulations separated in rest-frame color: 68% of red (b-i)_{ab}&gt;0.9 and brightgalaxies showing a strongly decreasing lf slope \alpha=+0.55 \pm 0.21, and 32%of blue (b-i)_{ab}&lt;0.9 and more compact galaxies which populate the lffaint-end. we observe that red bulge-dominated galaxies are already well inplace at z~1, but the volume density of this population is increasing by afactor 2.7 between z~1 and z~0.6. it may be related to the building-up ofmassive elliptical galaxies in the hierarchical scenario. in addition, weobserve that the blue bulge-dominated population is dimming by 0.7 magnitudebetween z~1 and z~0.6. galaxies in this faint and more compact population couldpossibly be the progenitors of the local dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

astro-ph;0609738	the local universe as seen in far-infrared and in far-ultraviolet: a  global point of view on the local recent star formation	we select far-infrared (fir-60 microns) and far-ultraviolet (fuv-1530 a)samples of nearby galaxies in order to discuss the biases encountered bymonochromatic surveys (fir or fuv). very different volumes are sampled by eachselection and much care is taken to apply volume corrections to all theanalyses. the distributions of the bolometric luminosity of young stars arecompared for both samples: they are found to be consistent with each other forgalaxies of intermediate luminosities but some differences are found for high(&gt;5 10^{10} l_sun) luminosities. the shallowness of the iras survey prevents usfrom securing comparison at low luminosities (&lt;2 10^9 l_sun). the ratio of thetotal infrared (tir) luminosity to the fuv luminosity is found to increase withthe bolometric luminosity in a similar way for both samples up to 5 10^{10}l_sun. brighter galaxies are found to have a different behavior according totheir selection: the l_tir/l_fuv ratio of the fuv-selected galaxies brighterthan 5 10^{10} l_sun reaches a plateau whereas l_tir/l_fuv continues toincrease with the luminosity of bright galaxies selected in fir. thevolume-averaged specific star formation rate (sfr per unit galaxy stellar mass,ssfr) is found to decrease toward massive galaxies within each selection. thessfr is found to be larger than that measured for optical and nir-selectedsample over the whole mass range for the fir selection, and for masses largerthan 10^{10} m_sun for the fuv selection. luminous and massive galaxiesselected in fir appear as active as galaxies with similar characteristicsdetected at z ~ 0.7.

astro-ph;0610688	an ultraviolet-to-radio broadband spectral atlas of nearby galaxies	the ultraviolet-to-radio continuum spectral energy distributions arepresented for all 75 galaxies in the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey(sings). a principal component analysis of the sample shows that most of thesample's spectral variations stem from two underlying components, onerepresentative of a galaxy with a low infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio and onerepresentative of a galaxy with a high infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio. theinfluence of several parameters on the infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio is studied(e.g., optical morphology, disk inclination, far-infrared color, ultravioletspectral slope, and star formation history). consistent with our understandingof normal star-forming galaxies, the sings sample of galaxies in comparison tomore actively star-forming galaxies exhibits a larger dispersion in theinfrared-to-ultraviolet versus ultraviolet spectral slope correlation. earlytype galaxies, exhibiting low star formation rates and high optical surfacebrightnesses, have the most discrepant infrared-to-ultraviolet correlation.these results suggest that the star formation history may be the dominantregulator of the broadband spectral variations between galaxies. finally, a newdiscovery shows that the 24 micron morphology can be a useful tool forparametrizing the global dust temperature and ultraviolet extinction in nearbygalaxies. the dust emission in dwarf/irregular galaxies is clumpy and warmaccompanied by low ultraviolet extinction, while in spiral galaxies there istypically a much larger diffuse component of cooler dust and averageultraviolet extinction. for galaxies with nuclear 24 micron emission, the dusttemperature and ultraviolet extinction are relatively high compared to diskgalaxies.

astro-ph;0612152	531 new spectroscopic redshifts from the cdfs and a test on the  cosmological relevance of the goods-south field	(abbrev.) this paper prepares a series of papers analysing the intermediatemass galaxy evolution sequence (images) up to z=1. intermediate mass galaxies(mj &lt;=-20.3) are selected from the chandra deep field south (cdfs) for which weidentify a serious lack of spectroscopically determined redshifts..... we havespectroscopically identified 691 objects including 580 gal., 7 qsos, and 104stars. this study provides 531 new redshifts in the cdfs. it confirms thepresence of several large scale structures in the cdfs. to test the impact ofthese structures in the goods-south field, we ... compare the evolution ofrest-frame u, b, v and k galaxy luminosity densities to that derived from thecfrs. the cdfs field shows a significant excess of luminosity densities in thez=0.5-0.75 range, which increases with the wavelength, reaching up to 0.5 dexat 2.1 um. stellar mass and specific star formation evolutions might besignificantly affected by the presence of the peculiar large scale structuresat z= 0.668 and at z= 0.735, that contain a significant excess of evolved,massive galaxies when compared to other fields. this leads to a clear warningto results based on the cdfs/goods south fields, especially those related tothe evolution of red luminosity densities, i.e. stellar mass density andspecific star formation rate. photometric redshift techniques, when applied tothat field, are producing quantities which are apparently less affected bycosmic variance (0.25 dex at 2.1 um), however at the cost of the difficulty indisentangling between evolutionary and cosmic variance effects.

astro-ph;0701322	lyman break galaxies and luminous ir galaxies at z ~ 1	we use deep galex images of cdfs in uv to define the first large sample of420 lyman break galaxies at z~1. we use a psf fitting to estimate uv magnitudeson these deep crowded images. deep spitzer irac and mips provide the firstdetection of a large sample of lyman break galaxies in the mid- to far-infraredrange. we are therefore able to study and compare the uv and tir emission oflyman break galaxies. we find that about 15% of the lbg sample are strongemitters at 24 microns (red lbgs). most of them are luminous ir galaxies(lirgs) while the rest (blue lbgs) are undetected at the 83 microjy level ofmips gto image. we find that blue lbgs have a spectral energy distributionsimilar to high redshift lyman break galaxies. finally, the dust-to-fuv ratioof this sample is compared with similar ratios at z=1 and z~2. this worksuggests an evolution (decrease) of the dust-to-fuv ratio with the redshift.

astro-ph;0703014	the ultraviolet properties of luminous infrared galaxies at z ~ 0.7: is  there any evolution in their dust attenuation?	the tir and fuv luminosity functions of galaxies and the related luminositydensities rho(tir) and rho(fuv) are known to evolve from z=0 to z~1 but with adifferent rate: the galaxy populations appear brighter in the past at bothwavelengths but the evolution in tir is larger than in fuv. it leads to anincrease of the ratio of tir to fuv luminosity densities rho(tir)/rho(fuv)which can be interpreted as a global increase of the dust attenuation from z=0to z~1. our aim is to understand the origin of this increase. we focus oninfrared galaxies with l(tir&gt;10^{11} lsun at z~0.7 observed by spitzer/mips andwe measure their uv emission at 2310 a from galex. these luminous infraredgalaxies (lirgs) represent the bulk of the tir luminosity density atintermediate redshift. some evolution of l(tir)/l(fuv) and therefore of dustattenuation is found for these galaxies: lirgs at z=0.7 span a larger range ofl(tir)/l(fuv) ratios than at z=0 and their mean dust attenuation at fuv isfound ~0.5 mag lower than for their local counterparts. the decrease of dustattenuation is found lower than that reported in other studies for brightgalaxies selected in uv rest-frame at z=1 and 2. from a semi-quantitativeanalysis we find that the slight decrease of dust attenuation for lirgs atz=0.7 remains consistent with the increase of rho(tir)/rho(fuv) with redshift.

astro-ph;9703026	hst observations of blue straggler stars in the core of the globular  cluster m3	the core of the galactic globular cluster m3 (ngc 5272) has been observedwith the wfpc2 through the filters f255w, f336w, f555w, and f814w. using theseobservations along with a thorough reanalysis of earlier catalogs, we haveproduced a catalog of blue straggler stars (bss) spanning the cluster. earlierstudies and the fainter part of our sample suffer severe selection biases. ouranalysis is based on a more reliable bright global sample of 122 bss. weconfirm earlier suggestions that the radial bss distribution in m3 is bimodal.it is strongly peaked in the center, has a clear dip 100--200" from the center,and rises again at larger radii. the observed distribution agrees with thedynamical model of sigurdsson et al. (1994) which takes into account both starcollisions and merging of primordial binaries for the origin of bss. theobserved luminosity functions of bss in the inner and outer parts of thecluster are different. interpreting these using the models of bailyn &amp;pinsonneault (1995), we suggest that the bss in the inner cluster are formed bystellar collisions and those in the outer cluster from merging primordialbinaries.

astro-ph;9904095	the globular cluster system around the low-luminosity s0 galaxy ngc 7457	we investigate the globular cluster system around the low-luminosity s0galaxy ngc 7457 with deep b, v, i photometry. from the v photometry the totalnumber of globular clusters around the galaxy is estimated to be 178 +- 75. thespecific frequency is estimated to be s_n = 2.7 +- 1.1 adopting m_v = -19.55mag for the galaxy.  we select 89 globular cluster candidates on the basis of their colors (b-i,v-i and b-v). the b-i and v-i color distributions are found unimodal with amean metallicity [fe/h] ~ -1. dex. nevertheless the width of the b-i colordistribution is found larger than that expected for a single population ofglobular clusters and is consistent with the presence of more than onepopulation. if the latter is the case, the two peaks would not be detected inb-i because of the small statistics and/or a small difference in the meanmetallicity of the two populations. no metal poor globular clusters similar tothose of the milky way halo are detected around ngc 7457.

astro-ph;9909421	far infrared and far ultraviolet emissions of galaxies: luminosity  functions and selection effects. implications for the future ngst and alma  observations	the fir(60 microns) and uv (0.2 microns) emissions of individual star forminggalaxies are compared to the mean properties of the local universe. almost allthe galaxies exhibit a fir to uv flux ratio larger than the ratio of the firand uv luminosity densities. it is likely to be due to the contribution of lowluminosity galaxies to the uv luminosity density: these galaxies are deficientin any survey.  as the galaxies become brighter in fir their fir to uv flux ratio increases:(around 0.2 microns) it implies an increase of 0.5 mag of extinction (around0.2 microns) per decade of fir (60 microns) luminosity. this trend is extendedand amplified in ultra luminous infrared galaxies observed at low and highredshift. the lyman break galaxies detected by their u dropout in the hdf seemto have less extreme properties more compatible with the trend found in thenearby star forming galaxies.  the detection limits of the ngst and of the future large millimeter array(alma) in terms of fir to uv ratios are presented.

0706.0810	lyman break galaxies at z~1 and the evolution of the dust attenuation in  star-forming galaxies with the redshift	ultraviolet (uv) galaxies have been selected from galex. the presence of afuv-dropout in their spectral energy distributions proved to be a very complete(83.3%) but not very efficient (21.4%) tool for identifying lyman breakgalaxies (lbgs) at z~1. we divide the lbg sample into two sub-classes: red lbgs(rlbgs) detected at 24 micron which are mainly luminous ir galaxies (lirgs) andblue lbgs (blbgs) undetected at 24 microns down to 83 microjy. two of the rlbgsare also detected at 70 micron. the median sed of the rlbgs is similar (abovelambda~1 micron) to the dusty starburst hr10. however, unlike local (u)lirgs,rlbgs are uv bright objects. we suggest that these objects contain a largeamount of dust but that some bare stellar populations are also directlyvisible. the median sed of the blbgs is consistent with their containing thesame stellar population as the rlbgs but with a lower dust content. theluminosity function of our lbg sample at z~1 is similar to the luminosityfunction of nuv-selected galaxies at the same redshift. the integratedluminosity densities of z~1 lbgs and nuv-selected galaxies are very consistent.we show that star formation rates (sfrs) estimated from uv measurements andcorrected using the irx-beta method provide average total sfr_tot in agreementwith sfr_uv + sfr_dust. however, irx-beta-based sfr_tot shows a largedispersion. summing up the detected uv (1150a rest-frame) and ir-based starformation rates of the detected objects, we find that only one third of thetotal (i.e. uv + dust) lbg sfr resides in blbgs and two thirds in rlbgs, eventhough most lbgs at z~1 are blbgs. on the other hand, the total sfr of lbgsaccounts for only 11% of the total sfr at z~1. finally, we observe a regulardecrease of l_tir / l_fuv from z=0 to z~2 for uv-selected samples.

0811.4158	photometric redshift accuracy in akari deep surveys	we investigate the photometric redshift accuracy achievable with the akariinfrared data in deep multi-band surveys, such as in the north ecliptic polefield. we demonstrate that the passage of redshifted policyclic aromatichydrocarbons and silicate features into the mid-infrared wavelength windowcovered by akari is a valuable means to recover the redshifts of starburstgalaxies. to this end we have collected a sample of ~60 galaxies drawn from thegoods-north field with spectroscopic redshift 0.5&lt;~z_spec&lt;~1.5 and photometryfrom 3.6 to 24 micron, provided by the spitzer, iso and akari satellites. theinfrared spectra are fitted using synthetic galaxy spectral energydistributions which account for starburst and active nuclei emission. for ~90%of the sources in our sample the redshift is recovered with an accuracy|z_phot-z_spec|/(1+z_spec)&lt;~10%. a similar analysis performed on different setsof simulated spectra shows that the akari infrared data alone can providephotometric redshifts accurate to |z_phot-z_spec|/(1+z_spec)&lt;~10% (1-sigma) atz&lt;~2. at higher redshifts the pah features are shifted outside the wavelengthrange covered by akari and the photo-z estimates rely on the less prominent 1.6micron stellar bump; the accuracy achievable in this case on (1+z) is ~10-15%,provided that the agn contribution to the infrared emission is subdominant. ourtechnique is no more prone to redshift aliasing than optical-uv photo-z, and itmay be possible to reduce this aliasing further with the addition ofsubmillimetre and/or radio data.
