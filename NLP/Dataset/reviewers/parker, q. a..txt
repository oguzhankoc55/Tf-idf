0901.1351	first detection of optical light from snr g279.0+1.1	this is the initial paper in a series presenting the first optical detectionsand subsequent follow-up spectroscopy of known southern galactic supernovaremnants (snrs) previously discovered in the radio. these new detections comefrom the aao/ukst halpha survey of the southern galactic plane which has openedup fresh opportunities to study galactic remnants. here we present the firstoptical imaging and follow-up spectra of galactic snr g279.0+1.1 where a seriesof 14 small-scale fragmented groups of halpha filaments have been discovered ina ~2.3 deg. area centred on g279.0+1.1. individually they are somewhatinconspicuous but collectively they are completely enclosed within the overallradio contours of this known snr. three of these filamentary groupings areparticularly prominent and optical spectra have been obtained across two ofthem. their morphological structure and spectral characteristics are typical ofoptically detected snr filaments. very strong [s ii] emission relative to h hasbeen detected with [s ii]/halpha 0.7 and 1.1, confirming strong, shock heatedemission. this is sufficient to classify these filaments in the likely snrdomain and therefore indicating a direct connection with the radio remnant.other typical snr emission lines such as [o ii] at 3727a, hbeta, [o iii] at4959 and 5007a, halpha and [n ii] at 6548 and 6584a were also detected, lendingstrong support to an snr origin of these optical filaments. the value andinsights that these optical data can provide for known remnants are discussedalong with their relevance to the galactic nitrogen abundance. a serendipitousdiscovery of an adjacent h ii region is also briefly described.

0901.4419	binary planetary nebulae nuclei towards the galactic bulge. i. sample  discovery, period distribution and binary fraction	binarity has been hypothesised to play an important, if not ubiquitous, rolein the formation of planetary nebulae (pne). yet there remains a severe paucityof known binary central stars required to test the binary hypothesis and toplace strong constraints on the physics of the common-envelope (ce) phase ofbinary stellar evolution. large photometric surveys offer an unrivalledopportunity to efficiently discover many binary central stars. we have combinedphotometry from the ogle microlensing survey with the largest sample of pnetowards the galactic bulge to systematically search for new binaries. a totalof 21 periodic binaries were found thereby more than doubling the known sample.the orbital period distribution was found to be best described by ce populationsynthesis models when no correlation between primary and secondary masses isassumed for the initial mass ratio distribution. a comparison with post-cewhite dwarf binaries indicates both distributions are representative of thetrue post-ce period distribution with most binaries exhibiting periods lessthan one day. an estimated close binary fraction of 12--21% is derived and isthe first robust and independent validation of the prevailing 10--15% fractionestimated by bond (2000). this suggests that binarity is not a precondition forthe formation of pne and that close binaries do not play a dominant role in theshaping of nebular morphologies. systematic effects and biases of the surveyare discussed with implications for future photometric surveys.

0904.1937	new young planetary nebulae in iphas	we search for very small-diameter galactic planetary nebulae (pne)representing the earliest phases of pn evolution. a recently published iphascatalogue of ha-emitting stars provides a useful base for this study as allsources present in this catalogue must be of small angular diameter.  the pn candidates are selected based on their location in two colour-colourdiagrams: iphas (r' - ha) vs. (r' - i'), and 2mass (j - h) vs. (h - ks).spectroscopic follow-up has been carried out on a sample of candidates in orderto confirm their nature.  we present a total of 83 pn candidates. we were able to obtain spectra orfind the classification from the literature for 35 candidates. five of theseobjects are likely to be new pne, including one large bipolar pn discoveredserendipitously near an emission-line star. pn distances deduced fromextinction-distance relations based on iphas field-star photometry arepresented for the first time. these yield distance estimates for our objects inthe range from 2 kpc to 6 kpc. from the data to hand, we conclude that four ofthe discovered objects are very probably young pne.

0906.4588	radio planetary nebulae in the magellanic clouds	we report the extragalactic radio-continuum detection of 15 planetary nebulae(pne) in the magellanic clouds (mcs) from recent australia telescope compactarray+parkes mosaic surveys. these detections were supplemented by new and highresolution radio, optical and ir observations which helped to resolve the truenature of the objects. four of the pne are located in the small magellaniccloud (smc) and 11 are located in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). based ongalactic pne the expected radio flux densities at the distance of the lmc/smcare up to ~2.5 mjy and ~2.0 mjy at 1.4 ghz, respectively. we find that one ofour new radio pne in the smc has a flux density of 5.1 mjy at 1.4 ghz, severaltimes higher than expected. we suggest that the most luminous radio pn in thesmc (n s68) may represent the upper limit to radio peak luminosity because itis ~3 times more luminous than ngc 7027, the most luminous known galactic pn.we note that the optical diameters of these 15 mcs pne vary from very small(~0.08 pc or 0.32"; smp l47) to very large (~1 pc or 4"; smp l83). their fluxdensities peak at different frequencies, suggesting that they may be indifferent stages of evolution. we briefly discuss mechanisms that may explaintheir unusually high radio-continuum flux densities. we argue that thesedetections may help solve the "missing mass problem" in pne whose central starswere originally 1-8 msun. we explore the possible link between ionised halosejected by the central stars in their late evolution and extended radioemission. because of their higher than expected flux densities we tentativelycall this pne (sub)sample - "super pne".

0907.2463	binary planetary nebulae nuclei towards the galactic bulge. ii. a  penchant for bipolarity and low-ionisation structures	considerable effort has been applied towards understanding the preciseshaping mechanisms responsible for the diverse range of morphologies exhibitedby planetary nebulae (pne). a binary companion is increasingly gaining supportas a dominant shaping mechanism, however morphological studies of the few pnethat we know for certain were shaped by binary evolution are scarce or biased.newly discovered binary central stars (cspn) from the ogle-iii photometricvariability survey have significantly increased the sample of postcommon-envelope (ce) nebulae available for morphological analysis. we presentgemini south narrow-band images for most of the new sample to complementexisting data in a qualitative morphological study of 30 post-ce nebulae.nearly 30% of nebulae have canonical bipolar morphologies, however this risesto 60% once inclination effects are incorporated with the aid of geometricmodels. this is the strongest observational evidence yet linking ce evolutionto bipolar morphologies. a higher than average proportion of the sample showslow-ionisation knots, filaments or jets suggestive of a binary origin. thesefeatures are also common around emission-line nuclei which may be explained byspeculative binary formation scenarios for h-deficient cspn.

0708.0615	multi-wavelength study of a new galactic snr g332.5-5.6	we present compelling evidence for confirmation of a galactic supernovaremnant (snr) candidate, g332.5-5.6, based initially on identification of new,filamentary, optical emission line nebulosity seen in the arcsecond resolutionimages from the aao/ukst halpha survey. the extant radio observations and x-raydata which we have independently re-reduced, together with new opticalspectroscopy of the large-scale fragmented nebulosity, confirms theidentification. optical spectra, taken across five different, widely separatednebula regions of the remnant as seen on the halpha images, show average ratiosof [nii]/halpha =2.42, [sii]/halpha = 2.10, and [sii] 6717/6731 = 1.23, as wellas strong [oi] 6300, 6364a and [oii] 3727a emission. these ratios are firmlywithin those typical of snrs. here, we also present the radio-continuumdetection of the snr at 20/13cm from observations with the australia telescopecompact array (atca). radio emission is also seen at 4850 mhz, in the pmnsurvey (griffith and wright 1993) and at 843 mhz from the sumss survey (bock,large and sadler 1999). we estimate an angular diameter of ~30 arcmin andobtain an average radio spectral index of alpha = -0.6 +- 0.1 which indicatesthe non-thermal nature of g332.5-5.6. fresh analysis of existing rosat x-raydata in the vicinity also confirms the existence of the snr. the distance tog332.5-5.6 has been independently estimated by reynoso and green (2007) as 3.4kpc based on measurements of the hi lambda21 cm line seen in absorption againstthe continuum emission. our cruder estimates via assumptions on the height ofthe dust layer (3.1 kpc) and using the sigma-d relation (4 kpc) are in goodagreement.

1008.3828	origins of the thick disk as traced by the alpha-elements of metal-poor  giant stars selected from rave	theories of thick disk formation can be differentiated by measurements ofstellar elemental abundances. we have undertaken a study of metal-poor starsselected from the rave spectroscopic survey of bright stars to establishwhether or not there is a significant population of metal-poor thick-disk stars([fe/h] &lt;~ -1.0) and to measure their elemental abundances. in this paper, wepresent abundances of four alpha-elements (mg, si, ca, ti) and iron for asubsample of 212 rgb and 31 rc/hb stars from this study. we find that the[alpha/fe] ratios are enhanced implying that enrichment proceeded by purelycore-collapse supernovae. this requires that star formation in each starforming region had a short duration. the relative lack of scatter in the[alpha/fe] ratios implies good mixing in the ism prior to star formation. inaddition, the ratios resemble that of the halo, indicating that the halo andthick disk share a similar massive star imf. we conclude that the alphaenhancement of the metal-poor thick disk implies that direct accretion of starsfrom dwarf galaxies similar to surviving dwarf galaxies today did not play amajor role in the formation of the thick disk.

1010.4491	the rave survey: rich in very metal-poor stars	very metal-poor stars are of obvious importance for many problems in chemicalevolution, star formation, and galaxy evolution. finding complete samples ofsuch stars which are also bright enough to allow high-precision individualanalyses is of considerable interest. we demonstrate here that stars with ironabundances [fe/h] &lt; -2 dex, and down to below -4 dex, can be efficientlyidentified within the radial velocity experiment (rave) survey of bright stars,without requiring additional confirmatory observations. we determine acalibration of the equivalent width of the calcium triplet lines measured fromthe rave spectra onto true [fe/h], using high spectral resolution data for asubset of the stars. these rave iron abundances are accurate enough to obviatethe need for confirmatory higher-resolution spectroscopy. our initial study hasidentified 631 stars with [fe/h] &lt;= -2, from a rave database containingapproximately 200,000 stars. this rave-based sample is complete for stars with[fe/h] &lt; -2.5, allowing statistical sample analysis. we identify three starswith [fe/h] &lt;= -4. of these, one was already known to be `ultra metal-poor',one is a known carbon-enhanced metal-poor star, but we obtain [fe/h]= -4.0,rather than the published [fe/h]=-3.3, and derive [c/fe] = +0.9, and [n/fe] =+3.2, and the third is at the limit of our s/n. rave observations are on-goingand should prove to be a rich source of bright, easily studied, very metal-poorstars.

1101.4959	the influence of binarity on dust obscuration events in the planetary  nebula m 2-29 and its analogues	the central star of the planetary nebula (cspn) m 2-29 shows an extraordinaryr coronae borealis-like fading event in its optical lightcurve. the only othercspn to show these events are cpd-568032 (hen 3-1333) and v651 mon (ngc 2346).dust cloud formation in the line of sight appears responsible but the exacttriggering mechanism is not well understood. understanding how planetarynebulae (pne) trigger dust obscuration events may help understand the sameprocess in a wide range of objects including population-i wc9 stars, symbioticstars and perhaps asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars with long secondaryperiods (lsps). a binary scenario involving an eccentric, wide companion thattriggers dust formation via interaction at periastron is a potentialexplanation that has been suggested for lsp variables. model fits to thelightcurves of cpd-568032 and m 2-29 show the dust forms in excess of 70 au atthe inner edge of a dust disk. in the case of cpd-568032 this radius is far toolarge to coincide with a binary companion trigger, although a binary may havebeen responsible for the formation of the dust disk. we find no direct evidenceto support previous claims of binarity in m 2-29 either from the oglelightcurve or deep medium-resolution vlt flames spectroscopy of the cspn. weclassify the cspn as of(h) with t_eff=50+-10 kk and log g=4.0+-0.3. we find amean distance of 7.4+-1.8 kpc to m 2-29 at which the m_v=-0.9 mag cspn couldpotentially hide a subgiant luminosity or fainter companion. a companion wouldhelp explain the multiple similarities with d'-type symbiotic stars whose outernebulae are thought to be bona-fide pne. the 7.4 kpc distance, oxygen abundanceof 8.3 dex and galactic coordinates (l=4.0, b=-3.0) prove that m 2-29 is agalactic bulge pn and not a halo pn as commonly misconceived.

1104.2379	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the star formation rate dependence of  the stellar initial mass function	the stellar initial mass function (imf) describes the distribution in stellarmasses produced from a burst of star formation. for more than fifty years, theimplicit assumption underpinning most areas of research involving the imf hasbeen that it is universal, regardless of time and environment. we measure thehigh-mass imf slope for a sample of low-to-moderate redshift galaxies from thegalaxy and mass assembly survey. the large range in luminosities and galaxymasses of the sample permits the exploration of underlying imf dependencies. astrong imf-star formation rate dependency is discovered, which shows thathighly star forming galaxies form proportionally more massive stars (they haveimfs with flatter power-law slopes) than galaxies with low star formationrates. this has a significant impact on a wide variety of galaxy evolutionstudies, all of which rely on assumptions about the slope of the imf. ourresult is supported by, and provides an explanation for, the results ofnumerous recent explorations suggesting a variation of or evolution in the imf.

1105.1673	single-lined spectroscopic binary star candidates in the rave survey	repeated spectroscopic observations of stars in the radial velocityexperiment (rave) database are used to identify and examine single-lined binary(sb1) candidates. the rave latest internal database (vdr3) includes radialvelocities, atmospheric and other parameters for approximately quarter millionof different stars with little less than 300,000 observations. in the sample of~20,000 stars observed more than once, 1333 stars with variable radialvelocities were identified. most of them are believed to be sb1 candidates. thefraction of sb1 candidates among stars with several observations is between 10%and 15% which is the lower limit for binarity among rave stars. due to thedistribution of time spans between the re-observation that is biased towardsrelatively short timescales (days to weeks), the periods of the identified sb1candidates are most likely in the same range. because of the rave's narrowmagnitude range most of the dwarf candidates belong to the thin galactic diskwhile the giants are part of the thick disk with distances extending to up to afew kpc. the comparison of the list of sb1 candidates to the vsx catalog ofvariable stars yielded several pulsating variables among the giant populationwith the radial velocity variations of up to few tens of km/s. there are 26matches between the catalog of spectroscopic binary orbits (sb9) and the wholerave sample for which the given periastron time and the time of raveobservation were close enough to yield a reliable comparison. rave measurementsof radial velocities of known spectroscopic binaries are consistent with theirpublished radial velocity curves.

1106.3896	a pilot study of the radio-continuum emission from mash planetary  nebulae	we report an australia telescope compact array (atca) radio-continuumobservations of 26 planetary nebulae (pne) at wavelengths of 3 and 6 cm. thissample of 26 pne were taken from the macquarie/aao/strasbourg halpha pne (mash)catalogue and previous lists. we investigate radio detection quality includingmeasured and derived parameters for all detected or marginally detected pnefrom this combined sample. some 11 objects from the observed sample have beensuccessfully detected and parametrized. except for one, all detected pne havevery low radio surface brightnesses. we use a statistical distance scale methodto calculate distances and ionised masses of the detected objects. nebulae fromthis sample are found to be large (&gt;0.2 pc in diameter) and highly dilutedwhich indicates old age. for 21 pne from this sample we list integrated halphafluxes and interstellar extinction coefficients, either taken from theliterature or derived here from the balmer decrement and radio to halpha ratiomethods. finally, our detected fraction of the mash pilot sample is relativelylow compared to the non-mash sub-sample. we conclude that future radio surveysof the mash sample must involve deeper observations with better uv coverage inorder to increase the fraction of detected objects and improve the quality ofthe derived parameters.

1107.1256	distance determination for rave stars using stellar models iii: the  nature of the rave survey and milky way chemistry	we apply the method of burnett &amp; binney (2010) for the determination ofstellar distances and parameters to the internal catalogue of the radialvelocity experiment (steinmetz et al. 2006). subsamples of stars that eitherhave hipparcos parallaxes or belong to well-studied clusters, inspireconfidence in the formal errors. distances to dwarfs cooler than ~6000 k appearto be unbiased, but those to hotter dwarfs tend to be too small by ~10% of theformal errors. distances to giants tend to be too large by about the sameamount. the median distance error in the whole sample of 216,000 stars is 28%and the error distribution is similar for both giants and dwarfs. roughly halfthe stars in the rave survey are giants. the giant fraction is largest at lowlatitudes and in directions towards the galactic centre. near the plane themetallicity distribution is remarkably narrow and centred on [m/h]-0.04 dex;with increasing |z| it broadens out and its median moves to [m/h] ~ -0.5. meanage as a function of distance from the galactic centre and distance |z| fromthe galactic plane shows the anticipated increase in mean age with |z|.

1107.3206	a bayesian approach to locating the red giant branch tip magnitude (part  i)	we present a new approach for identifying the tip of the red giant branch(trgb) which, as we show, works robustly even on sparsely populated targets.moreover, the approach is highly adaptable to the available data for thestellar population under study, with prior information readily incorporableinto the algorithm. the uncertainty in the derived distances is also madetangible and easily calculable from posterior probability distributions. weprovide an outline of the development of the algorithm and present the resultsof tests designed to characterize its capabilities and limitations. we thenapply the new algorithm to three m31 satellites: andromeda i, andromeda ii andthe fainter andromeda xxiii, using data from the pan-andromeda archaeologicalsurvey (pandas), and derive their distances as $731^{(+ 5) + 18}_{(- 4) - 17}$kpc, $634^{(+ 2) + 15}_{(- 2) - 14}$ kpc and $733^{(+ 13)+ 23}_{(- 11) - 22}$kpc respectively, where the errors appearing in parentheses are the componentsintrinsic to the method, while the larger values give the errors afteraccounting for additional sources of error. these results agree well with thebest distance determinations in the literature and provide the smallestuncertainties to date. this paper is an introduction to the workings andcapabilities of our new approach in its basic form, while a follow-up papershall make full use of the method's ability to incorporate priors and use theresulting algorithm to systematically obtain distances to all of m31'ssatellites identifiable in the pandas survey area.

1204.2662	further investigation of white dwarfs in the open clusters ngc2287 and  ngc3532	we report the results of a ccd imaging survey, complimented by astrometricand spectroscopic follow-up studies, that aims to probe the fate ofheavy-weight intermediate mass stars by unearthing new, faint, white dwarfmembers of the rich, nearby, intermediate age open clusters ngc3532 andngc2287. we identify a total of four white dwarfs with distances, propermotions and cooling times which can be reconciled with membership of thesepopulations. we find that wdj0643-203 in ngc2287, with an estimated mass ofm=1.02-1.16msun, is potentially the most massive white dwarf so far identifiedwithin an open cluster. guided by the predictions of modern theoretical modelsof the late-stage evolution of heavy-weight intermediate mass stars, weconclude that there is a distinct possibility it has a core composed of o andne. we also determine that despite the cooling times of the three new whitedwarfs in ngc3532 and the previously known degenerate member ngc3532-10spanning ~90myr, they all have remarkably similar masses (m~0.9-1msun). this isfully consistent with the results from our prior work on a heterogeneous sampleof ~50 white dwarfs from 12 stellar populations, on the basis of which weargued that the stellar initial mass-final mass relation is less steep atminit&gt;4msun than in the adjacent lower initial mass regime. this change in thegradient of the relation could account for the secondary peak observed in themass distribution of the field white dwarf population and mitigate the need toinvoke close binary evolution to explain its existence. spectroscopicinvestigation of numerous additional candidate white dwarf members of ngc3532unearthed by a recent independent study would be useful to confirm (orotherwise) these conclusions.

1204.6502	exploring the morphology of rave stellar spectra	the radial velocity experiment (rave) is a medium resolution r~7500spectroscopic survey of the milky way which already obtained over half amillion stellar spectra. they present a randomly selected magnitude-limitedsample, so it is important to use a reliable and automated classificationscheme which identifies normal single stars and discovers different types ofpeculiar stars. to this end we present a morphological classification of350,000 rave survey stellar spectra using locally linear embedding, adimensionality reduction method which enables representing the complex spectralmorphology in a low dimensional projected space while still preserving theproperties of the local neighborhoods of spectra. we find that the majority ofall spectra in the database ~90-95% belong to normal single stars, but there isalso a significant population of several types of peculiars. among them themost populated groups are those of various types of spectroscopic binary andchromospherically active stars. both of them include several thousands ofspectra. particularly the latter group offers significant further investigationopportunities since activity of stars is a known proxy of stellar ages.applying the same classification procedure to the sample of normal single starsalone shows that the shape of the projected manifold in two dimensional spacecorrelates with stellar temperature, surface gravity and metallicity.

1207.0363	the properties of the local spiral arms from rave data: two-dimensional  density wave approach	using the rave survey, we recently brought to light a gradient in the meangalactocentric radial velocity of stars in the extended solar neighbourhood.this gradient likely originates from non-axisymmetric perturbations of thepotential, among which a perturbation by spiral arms is a possible explanation.here, we apply the traditional density wave theory and analytically model theradial component of the two-dimensional velocity field. provided that theradial velocity gradient is caused by relatively long-lived spiral arms thatcan affect stars substantially above the plane, this analytic model providesnew independent estimates for the parameters of the milky way spiral structure.our analysis favours a two-armed perturbation with the sun close to the innerultra-harmonic 4:1 resonance, with a pattern speed \omega_p=18.6^{+0.3}_{-0.2}km/s/kpc and a small amplitude a=0.55 \pm 0.02% of the background potential(14% of the background density). this model can serve as a basis for numericalsimulations in three dimensions, additionally including a possible influence ofthe galactic bar and/or other non-axisymmetric modes.

1301.3994	the planetary nebula abell 48 and its [wn] nucleus	we have conducted a detailed multi-wavelength study of the peculiar nebulaabell 48 and its central star. we classify the nucleus as a helium-rich,hydrogen-deficient star of type [wn4-5]. the evidence for either a massive wnor a low-mass [wn] interpretation is critically examined, and we firmlyconclude that abell 48 is a planetary nebula (pn) around an evolved low-massstar, rather than a population i ejecta nebula. importantly, the surroundingnebula has a morphology typical of pne, and is not enriched in nitrogen, andthus not the `peeled atmosphere' of a massive star. we estimate a distance of1.6 kpc and a reddening, e(b-v) = 1.90 mag, the latter value clearly showingthe nebula lies on the near side of the galactic bar, and cannot be a massivewn star. the ionized mass (~0.3 m_sun) and electron density (700 cm^-3) aretypical of middle-aged pne. the observed stellar spectrum was compared to agrid of models from the potsdam wolf-rayet (powr) grid. the best fittemperature is 71 kk, and the atmospheric composition is dominated by heliumwith an upper limit on the hydrogen abundance of 10 per cent. our results arein very good agreement with the recent study of todt et al., who determined ahydrogen fraction of 10 per cent and an unusually large nitrogen fraction of ~5per cent. this fraction is higher than any other low-mass h-deficient star, andis not readily explained by current post-agb models. we give a discussion ofthe implications of this discovery for the late-stage evolution ofintermediate-mass stars. there is now tentative evidence for two distincthelium-dominated post-agb lineages, separate to the helium and carbon dominatedsurface compositions produced by a late thermal pulse. further theoretical workis needed to explain these recent discoveries.

1310.5145	a new stellar chemo-kinematic relation reveals the merger history of the  milky way disc	the velocity dispersions of stars near the sun are known to increase withstellar age, but age can be difficult to determine so a proxy like theabundance of alpha elements (e.g., mg) with respect to iron, [alpha/fe], isused. here we report an unexpected behavior found in the velocity dispersion ofa sample of giant stars from the radial velocity experiment (rave) survey withhigh quality chemical and kinematical information, in that it decreasesstrongly for stars with [mg/fe] &gt; 0.4 dex (i.e., those that formed in the firstgyr of the galaxy's life). these findings can be explained by perturbationsfrom massive mergers in the early universe, which have affected more stronglythe outer parts of the disc, and the subsequent radial migration of stars withcooler kinematics from the inner disc. similar reversed trends in velocitydispersion are also found for different metallicity subpopulations. our resultssuggest that the milky way disc merger history can be recovered by relating theobserved chemo-kinematic relations to the properties of past merger events.

1402.7024	the vst photometric halpha survey of the southern galactic plane and  bulge (vphas+)	the vst photometric halpha survey of the southern galactic plane and bulge(vphas+) is surveying the southern milky way in u, g, r, i and halpha at 1arcsec angular resolution. its footprint spans the galactic latitude range -5 &lt;b &lt; +5 at all longitudes south of the celestial equator. extensions around thegalactic centre to galactic latitudes +/-10 bring in much of the galacticbulge. this eso public survey, begun on 28th december 2011, reaches down to20th magnitude (10-sigma) and will provide single-epoch digital opticalphotometry for around 300 million stars. the observing strategy and datapipelining is described, and an appraisal of the segmented narrowband halphafilter in use is presented. using model atmospheres and library spectra, wecompute main-sequence (u - g), (g - r), (r - i) and (r - halpha) stellarcolours in the vega system. we report on a preliminary validation of thephotometry using test data obtained from two pointings overlapping the sloandigital sky survey. an example of the (u - g, g - r) and (r - halpha, r - i)diagrams for a full vphas+ survey field is given. attention is drawn to theopportunities for studies of compact nebulae and nebular morphologies thatarise from the image quality being achieved. the value of the u band as themeans to identify planetary-nebula central stars is demonstrated by thediscovery of the central star of ngc 2899 in survey data. thanks to itsexcellent imaging performance, the vst/omegacam combination used by this surveyis a perfect vehicle for automated searches for reddened early-type stars, andwill allow the discovery and analysis of compact binaries, white dwarfs andtransient sources.

1403.4046	component masses of young, wide, non-magnetic white dwarf binaries in  the sdss dr7	we present a spectroscopic component analysis of 18 candidate young, wide,non-magnetic, double-degenerate binaries identified from a search of the sloandigital sky survey data release 7 (dr7). all but two pairings are likely to bephysical systems. we show sdss j084952.47+471247.7 + sdss j084952.87+471249.4to be a wide da+db binary, only the second identified to date. combining ourmeasurements for the components of 16 new binaries with results for threesimilar, previously known systems within the dr7, we have constructed a massdistribution for the largest sample to date (38) of white dwarfs in young,wide, non-magnetic, double-degenerate pairings. this is broadly similar in formto that of the isolated field population with a substantial peak around m~0.6msun. we identify an excess of ultra-massive white dwarfs and attribute this tothe primordial separation distribution of their progenitor systems peaking atrelatively larger values and the greater expansion of their binary orbitsduring the final stages of stellar evolution. we exploit this mass distributionto probe the origins of unusual types of degenerates, confirming a mildpreference for the progenitor systems of high-field-magnetic white dwarfs, atleast within these binaries, to be associated with early-type stars.additionally, we consider the 19 systems in the context of the stellar initialmass-final mass relation. none appear to be strongly discordant with currentunderstanding of this relationship.

1405.7435	kinematic modelling of the milky way using the rave and gcs stellar  surveys	we investigate the kinematic parameters of the milky way disc using the raveand gcs stellar surveys. we do this by fitting a kinematic model to the datataking the selection function of the data into account. for stars in the gcs weuse all phase-space coordinates, but for rave stars we use only $(l,b,v_{\rmlos})$. using mcmc technique, we investigate the full posterior distributionsof the parameters given the data. we investigate the `age-velocity dispersion'relation for the three kinematic components($\sigma_r,\sigma_{\phi},\sigma_z$), the radial dependence of the velocitydispersions, the solar peculiar motion ($u_{\odot},v_{\odot}, w_{\odot} $), thecircular speed $\theta_0$ at the sun and the fall of mean azimuthal motion withheight above the mid-plane. we confirm that the besan\c{c}on-style gaussianmodel accurately fits the gcs data, but fails to match the details of the morespatially extended rave survey. in particular, the shu distribution function(df) handles non-circular orbits more accurately and provides a better fit tothe kinematic data. the gaussian distribution function not only fits the datapoorly but systematically underestimates the fall of velocity dispersion withradius. we find that correlations exist between a number of parameters, whichhighlights the importance of doing joint fits. the large size of the ravesurvey, allows us to get precise values for most parameters. however, largesystematic uncertainties remain, especially in $v_{\odot}$ and $\theta_0$. wefind that, for an extended sample of stars, $\theta_0$ is underestimated by asmuch as $10\%$ if the vertical dependence of the mean azimuthal motion isneglected. using a simple model for vertical dependence of kinematics, we findthat it is possible to match the sgr a* proper motion without any need for$v_{\odot}$ being larger than that estimated locally by surveys like gcs.

1412.1484	characterizing the high-velocity stars of rave: the discovery of a  metal-rich halo star born in the galactic disk	we aim to characterize high-velocity (hivel) stars in the solar vicinity bothchemically and kinematically using the fourth data release of the radialvelocity experiment (rave). we used a sample of 57 hivel stars with galacticrest-frame velocities larger than 275 km s$^{-1}$. with 6d position andvelocity information, we integrated the orbits of the hivel stars and foundthat, on average, they reach out to 13 kpc from the galactic plane and haverelatively eccentric orbits consistent with the galactic halo. using thestellar parameters and [$\alpha$/fe] estimates from rave, we found themetallicity distribution of the hivel stars peak at [m/h] = -1.2 dex and ischemically consistent with the inner halo. there are a few notable exceptionsthat include a hypervelocity star (hvs) candidate, an extremely high-velocitybound halo star, and one star that is kinematically consistent with the halobut chemically consistent with the disk. high-resolution spectra were obtainedfor the metal-rich hivel star candidate and the second highest velocity star inthe sample. using these high-resolution data, we report the discovery of ametal-rich halo star that has likely been dynamically ejected into the halofrom the galactic thick disk. this discovery could aid in explaining theassembly of the most metal-rich component of the galactic halo.

1412.2793	the chandra planetary nebulae survey (chanplans): iii. x-ray emission  from the central stars of planetary nebulae	we present x-ray spectral analysis of 20 point-like x-ray sources detected inchandra planetary nebula survey (chanplans) observations of 59 planetarynebulae (pne) in the solar neighborhood. most of these 20 detections areassociated with luminous central stars within relatively young, compactnebulae. the vast majority of these point-like x-ray-emitting sources at pncores display relatively "hard" ($\geq0.5$~kev) x-ray emission components thatare unlikely to be due to photospheric emission from the hot central stars(cspn). instead, we demonstrate that these sources are well modeled byoptically-thin thermal plasmas. from the plasma properties, we identify twoclasses of cspn x-ray emission: (1) high-temperature plasmas with x-rayluminosities, $l_{\rm x}$, that appear uncorrelated with the cspn bolometricluminosity, $l_{\rm bol}$; and (2) lower-temperature plasmas with $l_{\rmx}/l_{\rm bol}\sim10^{-7}$. we suggest these two classes correspond to thephysical processes of magnetically active binary companions and self-shockingstellar winds, respectively. in many cases this conclusion is supported bycorroborative multiwavelength evidence for the wind and binary properties ofthe pn central stars. by thus honing in on the origins of x-ray emission frompn central stars, we enhance the ability of cspn x-ray sources to constrainmodels of pn shaping that invoke wind interactions and binarity.

1502.04767	the galah survey: scientific motivation	the galah survey is a large high-resolution spectroscopic survey using thenewly commissioned hermes spectrograph on the anglo-australian telescope. thehermes spectrograph provides high-resolution (r ~28,000) spectra in fourpassbands for 392 stars simultaneously over a 2 degree field of view. the goalof the survey is to unravel the formation and evolutionary history of the milkyway, using fossil remnants of ancient star formation events which have beendisrupted and are now dispersed throughout the galaxy. chemical tagging seeksto identify such dispersed remnants solely from their common and uniquechemical signatures; these groups are unidentifiable from their spatial,photometric or kinematic properties. to carry out chemical tagging, the galahsurvey will acquire spectra for a million stars down to v~14. the hermesspectra of fgk stars contain absorption lines from 29 elements including lightproton-capture elements, alpha-elements, odd-z elements, iron-peak elements andn-capture elements from the light and heavy s-process and the r-process. thispaper describes the motivation and planned execution of the galah survey, andpresents some results on the first-light performance of hermes.

1504.01534	the h\alpha\ surface brightness - radius relation: a robust statistical  distance indicator for planetary nebulae	measuring the distances to galactic planetary nebulae (pne) has been anintractable problem for many decades. we have now established a robust opticalstatistical distance indicator, the h$\alpha$ surface brightness- radius or s-rrelation, which addresses this problem. we developed this relation from acritically evaluated sample of primary calibrating pne. the robust nature ofthe method results from our revised calibrating distances with significantlyreduced systematic uncertainties, and the recent availability of high-qualitydata, including updated nebular diameters and integrated h$\alpha$ fluxes. thes-r technique is simple in its application, requiring only an angular size, anintegrated h\alpha\ flux, and the reddening to the pn. from these quantities,an intrinsic radius is calculated, which when combined with the angular size,yields the distance directly. furthermore, we have found that optically thickpne tend to populate the upper bound of the trend, while optically-thin pnefall along the lower boundary in the s-r plane. this enables sub-trends to bedeveloped which offer even better precision in the determination of distances,as good as 18 per cent in the case of optically-thin, high-excitation pne. thisis significantly better than any previous statistical indicator. we use thistechnique to create a catalogue of statistical distances for over 1100 galacticpne, the largest such compilation in the literature to date. finally, in anappendix, we investigate both a set of transitional pne and a range of pnmimics in the s-r plane, to demonstrate its use as a diagnostic tool.interestingly, stellar ejecta around massive stars plot on a tight locus in s-rspace with the potential to act as a separate distance indicator for theseobjects.

astro-ph;0402362	the large scale distribution of galaxies in the shapley supercluster	we present new results of our wide-field redshift survey of galaxies in a 182square degree region of the shapley supercluster (ssc) based on observationswith the flair-ii spectrograph on the uk schmidt telescope. we present newmeasurements to give a total sample of redshifts for 710 bright (r&lt;16.6)galaxies, of which 464 are members of the ssc (8000&lt;v&lt;18000 kms). our datareveal that the main plane of the ssc extends further than previously realised,filling the whole extent of our survey region of 10 degrees by 20 degrees onthe sky (35 mpc by 70 mpc). there is also a significant structure associatedwith the slightly nearer abell 3571 cluster complex with a caustic structureevident out to a radius of 6 mpc. these galaxies seem to link two previouslyidentified sheets of galaxies and establish a connection with a third one atv=15000 kms. they also tend to fill the gap of galaxies between the foregroundhydra-centaurus region and the more distant ssc. we calculate galaxyoverdensities of 5.0+/-0.1 over the 182 square degree region surveyed and3.3+/-0.1 in a 159 square degree region excluding rich clusters.

astro-ph;0403482	discovery of a wo star in the scutum-crux arm of the inner galaxy	we report the discovery of only the fourth massive wo star to be found in themilky way, and only the seventh identified within the local group. this hasresulted from the first observations made in a programme of follow-upspectroscopy of candidate emission line stars from the aao/uk schmidt southerngalactic plane h-alpha survey. the optical spectrum of this star, to become wr93b in the catalogue of galactic wolf-rayet stars, is presented and described.wr 93b is classified as wo3 and is shown to be highly reddened (e(b-v) = 2.1 pm0.1). a recombination line analysis of the emission lines yields the abundanceratios c/he = 0.95 and o/he = 0.13 (by number). comparisons at near infraredwavelengths of reddening corrected photometry between wr 93b and both of sand 2(wo3, d = 49 kpc) and sand 5 (wo2, d = 1.75 kpc) yields a consistent distanceto wr 93b of 3.4 kpc. positioned at galactic co-ordinates l = 353.27, b =-0.85, the star is most likely located in the scutum-crux arm of the innermilky way. we note that none of the four galactic wo stars lies significantlybeyond the solar circle (with two well inside). estimation of the wind terminalvelocity in wr 93b at 5750 km/s makes this star the current wind speed recordholder among all non-degenerate stars.

astro-ph;0409628	the cosmological significance of low surface brightness galaxies found  in a deep blind neutral-hydrogen survey	we have placed limits on the cosmological significance of gas-rich lowsurface-brightness (lsb) galaxies as a proportion of the total population ofgas-rich galaxies by carrying out a very deep survey (hideep) for neutralhydrogen (hi) with the parkes multibeam system. such a survey avoids thesurface-brightness selection effects that limit the usefulness of opticalsurveys for finding lsb galaxies. to complement the hideep survey we havedigitally stacked eight 1-hour r-band tech pan films from the uk schmidttelescope covering 36 square degrees of the survey area to reach a very deepisophotal limit of 26.5 r mag/sq. arcsec. at this level, we find that all ofthe 129 hi sources within this area have optical counterparts and that 107 ofthem can be identified with individual galaxies. we have used the properties ofthe galaxies identified as the optical counterparts of the hi sources toestimate the significance of lsb galaxies (defined to be those at least 1.5magnitudes dimmer in effective surface-brightness than the peak in the observeddistribution seen in optical surveys). we calculate the contribution of lsbgalaxies to the total number, neutral hydrogen density, luminosity density,baryonic mass density, dynamical mass density and cross-sectional area ofgas-rich galaxies. we do not find any `crouching giant' lsb galaxies such asmalin 1, nor do we find a population of extremely low surface-brightnessgalaxies not previously found by optical surveys. such objects must either berare, gas-poor or outside the survey detection limits.

0809.0615	estimation of the tilt of the stellar velocity ellipsoid from rave and  implications for mass models	we present a measure of the inclination of the velocity ellipsoid at 1 kpcbelow the galactic plane using a sample of red clump giants from the rave dr2release. we find that the velocity ellipsoid is tilted towards the galacticplane with an inclination of 7.3 +/-1.8 degree. we compare this value tocomputed inclinations for two mass models of the milky way. we find that ourmeasurement is consistent with a short scale length of the stellar disc (rd ~2kpc) if the dark halo is oblate or with a long scale length (rd~3 kpc) if thedark halo is prolate. once combined with independent constraints on theflattening of the halo, our measurement suggests that the scale length isapproximately halfway between these two extreme values, with a preferred range[2.5-2.7] kpc for a nearly spherical halo. nevertheless, no model can beclearly ruled out. with the continuation of the rave survey, it will bepossible to provide a strong constraint on the mass distribution of the milkyway using refined measurements of the orientation of the velocity ellipsoid.

astro-ph;0509120	discovery of ultra-compact dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster	we have discovered nine ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (ucds) in the virgocluster, extending samples of these objects outside the fornax cluster. usingthe 2df multi-fiber spectrograph on the anglo-australian telescope, the newvirgo members were found among 1500 color-selected, star-like targets with 16.0&lt; b_j &lt; 20.2 in a two-degree diameter field centered on m87 (ngc4486). thenewly-found ucds are comparable to the ucds in the fornax cluster, with sizes&lt;~ 100 pc, -12.9 &lt; m_b &lt; -10.7, and exhibiting red, absorption-line spectra,indicative of an older stellar population. the properties of these objectsremain consistent with the tidal threshing model for the origin of ucds fromthe surviving nuclei of nucleated dwarf ellipticals disrupted in the clustercore, but can also be explained as objects that were formed by mergers of starclusters created in galaxy interactions. the discovery that ucds exist in virgoshows that this galaxy type is probably a ubiquitous phenomenon in clusters ofgalaxies; coupled with their possible origin by tidal threshing, the ucdpopulation is a potential indicator and probe of the formation history of agiven cluster.  we also describe one additional bright ucd with m_b = -12.0 in the core ofthe fornax cluster. we find no further ucds in our fornax cluster spectroscopicsurvey down to b_j = 19.5 in two additional 2df fields extending as far as 3degrees from the center of the cluster. all six fornax bright ucds identifiedwith 2df lie within 0.5 degree (projected distance of 170 kpc) of the centralelliptical galaxy ngc1399.

astro-ph;0605114	an optical emission line survey of large planetary nebulae	accurate emission line fluxes from planetary nebulae (pne) provide importantconstraints on the nature of the final phases of stellar evolution. large,evolved pne may trace the latest stages of pn evolution, where material fromthe agb wind is returned to the interstellar medium. however, the low surfacebrightness and spatially extended emission of large pne have made accuratemeasurements of line fluxes difficult with traditional long-slit spectroscopictechniques. furthermore, distinguishing these nebulae from hii regions,supernova remnants, or interstellar gas ionized by a hot, evolved stellar corecan be challenging. here, we report on an ongoing survey of large galactic pne(r &gt; 5') with the wisconsin h-alpha mapper (wham), a fabry-perot spectrographdesigned to detect faint diffuse optical emission lines with high sensitivityand spectral resolution. our sample includes newly revealed h-alphaenhancements from the aao/ukst and wham h-alpha surveys of parker et al. andhaffner et al. we present accurate emission line fluxes of h-alpha, [nii], and[oiii], and compare our data to other measurements. we use the emission lineratios and kinematics of the ionized gas to assess, or in some cases reassess,the identification of some nebulae.

astro-ph;0611671	the rave survey: constraining the local galactic escape speed	we report new constraints on the local escape speed of our galaxy. ouranalysis is based on a sample of high velocity stars from the rave survey andtwo previously published datasets. we use cosmological simulations of diskgalaxy formation to motivate our assumptions on the shape of the velocitydistribution, allowing for a significantly more precise measurement of theescape velocity compared to previous studies. we find that the escape velocitylies within the range $498\kms &lt; \ve &lt; 608 \kms$ (90 per cent confidence), witha median likelihood of $544\kms$. the fact that $\ve^2$ is significantlygreater than $2\vc^2$ (where $\vc=220\kms$ is the local circular velocity)implies that there must be a significant amount of mass exterior to the solarcircle, i.e. this convincingly demonstrates the presence of a dark halo in thegalaxy. for a simple isothermal halo, one can calculate that the minimum radialextent is $\sim58$ kpc. we use our constraints on $\ve$ to determine the massof the milky way halo for three halo profiles. for example, an adiabaticallycontracted nfw halo model results in a virial mass of$1.42^{+1.14}_{-0.54}\times10^{12}m_\odot$ and virial radius of$305^{+66}_{-45}$ kpc (90 per cent confidence). for this model the circularvelocity at the virial radius is $142^{+31}_{-21}\kms$. although our halomasses are model dependent, we find that they are in good agreement with eachother.
