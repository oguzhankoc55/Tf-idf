0901.2587	the wigglez dark energy survey: small-scale clustering of lyman break  galaxies at z &lt; 1	the wigglez dark energy survey is a large-scale structure survey ofintermediate-redshift uv-selected emission-line galaxies scheduled to cover1000 sq deg, spanning a broad redshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.0. the main scientificgoal of the survey is the measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) inthe galaxy clustering pattern at a significantly higher redshift than previousstudies. the bao may be applied as a standard cosmological ruler to constraindark energy models. based on the first 20% of the dataset, we present initialresults concerning the small-scale clustering of the wigglez targets, togetherwith survey forecasts. the wigglez galaxy population possesses a clusteringlength r_0 = 4.40 +/- 0.12 mpc/h, which is significantly larger than z=0uv-selected samples, with a slope gamma = 1.92 +/- 0.08. this clustering lengthis comparable to z=3 lyman break galaxies with similar uv luminosities. thefull survey, scheduled for completion in 2010, will map an effective volumev_eff ~ 1 gpc^3 (evaluated at a scale k = 0.15 h/mpc) and will measure theangular-diameter distance and hubble expansion rates in three redshift binswith accuracies ~ 5%. we will determine the value of a constant dark energyequation-of-state parameter, w, with a higher precision than existingsupernovae observations using an entirely independent technique. the wigglezand supernovae measurements lie in highly complementary directions in the planeof w and the matter density omega_m. the forecast using the full combination ofwigglez, supernovae and cmb datasets is a marginalized error sigma(w) = 0.07,providing a robust and precise measurement of the properties of dark energyincluding cross-checking of systematic errors.

0905.4311	forecasts for dark energy measurements with future hi surveys	we use two independent methods to forecast the dark energy measurementsachievable by combining future galaxy redshift surveys based on the radio hiemission line with cosmic microwave background (cmb) data from the {\sl planck}satellite. in the first method we focus on the `standard ruler' provided by thebaryon acoustic oscillation (bao) length scale. in the second method we utilizeadditional information encoded in the galaxy power spectrum including galaxybias from velocity-space distortions and the growth of cosmic structure. wefind that a radio synthesis array with about 10 per cent of the collecting areaof the square kilometre array (ska), equipped with a wide ($10-100 ~ {\rmdeg}^2$) field-of-view, would have the capacity to perform a $20{,}000 ~ {\rmdeg}^2$ redshift survey to a maximum redshift $z_{\rm max} \sim 0.8$ andthereby produce dark energy measurements that are competitive with surveyslikely to be undertaken by optical telescopes around 2015. there would then bepowerful arguments for adding collecting area to such a `phase-1' ska becauseof the square-law scaling of survey speed with telescope sensitivity for hisurveys, compared to the linear scaling for optical redshift surveys. the fullska telescope should, by performing a $20{,}000 ~ {\rm deg}^2$ hi redshiftsurvey to $z_{\rm max} \sim 2$ around 2020, yield an accurate measurement ofcosmological parameters independent of cmb datasets. combining cmb ({\slplanck}) and galaxy power spectrum (ska) measurements will drive errors in thedark energy equation-of-state parameter $w$ well below the 1 per cent level.the major systematic uncertainty in these forecasts is the lack of directinformation about the mass function of high-redshift hi-emitting galaxies.

0910.4714	forecasting neutrino masses from galaxy clustering in the dark energy  survey combined with the planck measurements	we study the prospects for detecting neutrino masses from the galaxy angularpower spectrum in photometric redshift shells of the dark energy survey (des)over a volume of 20 (gpc/h)^3 combined with the cosmic microwave background(cmb) angular fluctuations expected to be measured from the planck satellite.we find that for a lambda-cdm concordance model with 7 free parameters inaddition to a fiducial neutrino mass of m_nu = 0.24 ev, we recover from des&amp;planck the correct value with uncertainty of +- 0.12 ev (95 % cl), assumingperfect knowledge of the galaxy biasing. if the fiducial total mass is close tozero, then the upper limit is 0.11 ev (95 % cl). this upper limit from des&amp;planck is over 3 times tighter than using planck alone, as des breaks theparameter degeneracies in a cmb-only analysis. the analysis utlilizes sphericalharmonics up to 300, averaged in bin of 10 to mimic the des sky coverage. theresults are similar if we supplement des bands (grizy) with the vistahemisphere survey (vhs) near infrared band (jhk). the result is robust touncertainties in non-linear fluctuations and redshift distortions. however, theresult is sensitive to the assumed galaxy biasing schemes and it requiresaccurate prior knowledge of the biasing. to summarize, if the total neutrinomass in nature greater than 0.1ev, we should be able to detect it with des&amp;planck, a result with great importance to fundamental physics.

0707.2566	the environments and clustering properties of 2dfgrs-selected starburst  galaxies	we investigate the environments and clustering properties of starburstgalaxies selected from the 2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) in order todetermine which, if any, environmental factors play a role in triggering astarburst. we quantify the local environments, clustering properties andluminosity functions of our starburst galaxies and compare to random controlsamples. the starburst galaxies are also classified morphologically in terms oftheir broad hubble type and evidence of tidal merger/interaction signatures. wefind the starburst galaxies to be much less clustered on large (5-15 mpc)scales compared to the overall 2dfgrs galaxy population. in terms of theirenvironments, we find just over half of the starburst galaxies to reside in lowto intermediate luminosity groups, and a further ~30 per cent residing in theoutskirts and infall regions of rich clusters. their luminosity functions alsodiffer significantly from that of the overall 2dfgrs galaxy population, withthe sense of the difference being critically dependent on the way their starformation rates are measured. in terms of pin-pointing what might trigger thestarburst, it would appear that factors relating to their local environment aremost germane. specifically, we find clear evidence that the presence of a nearneighbour of comparable luminosity/mass within 20 kpc is likely to be importantin triggering a starburst. we also find that a significant fraction (20-30 percent) of our starburst galaxies have morphologies indicative of either anongoing or recent tidal interaction and/or merger. these findingsnotwithstanding, there remain a significant portion of starburst galaxies wherelocal environmental influences are not in any obvious way playing a triggeringrole, leading us to conclude that starbursts can also be internally driven.

0911.4246	the wigglez dark energy survey: survey design and first data release	the wigglez dark energy survey is a survey of 240,000 emission line galaxiesin the distant universe, measured with the aaomega spectrograph on the 3.9-manglo-australian telescope (aat). the target galaxies are selected usingultraviolet photometry from the galex satellite, with a flux limit of nuv&lt;22.8mag. the redshift range containing 90% of the galaxies is 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.0. theprimary aim of the survey is to precisely measure the scale of baryon acousticoscillations (bao) imprinted on the spatial distribution of these galaxies atlook-back times of 4-8 gyrs. detailed forecasts indicate the survey willmeasure the bao scale to better than 2% and the tangential and radial acousticwave scales to approximately 3% and 5%, respectively.  this paper provides a detailed description of the survey and its design, aswell as the spectroscopic observations, data reduction, and redshiftmeasurement techniques employed. it also presents an analysis of the propertiesof the target galaxies, including emission line diagnostics which show thatthey are mostly extreme starburst galaxies, and hubble space telescope images,which show they contain a high fraction of interacting or distorted systems. inconjunction with this paper, we make a public data release of data for thefirst 100,000 galaxies measured for the project.

0911.5347	the wigglez dark energy survey: direct constraints on blue galaxy  intrinsic alignments at intermediate redshifts	correlations between the intrinsic shapes of galaxy pairs, and between theintrinsic shapes of galaxies and the large-scale density field, may be inducedby tidal fields. these correlations, which have been detected at low redshifts(z&lt;0.35) for bright red galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss), andfor which upper limits exist for blue galaxies at z~0.1, provide a window intogalaxy formation and evolution, and are also an important contaminant forcurrent and future weak lensing surveys. measurements of these alignments atintermediate redshifts (z~0.6) that are more relevant for cosmic shearobservations are very important for understanding the origin and redshiftevolution of these alignments, and for minimising their impact on weak lensingmeasurements. we present the first such intermediate-redshift measurement forblue galaxies, using galaxy shape measurements from sdss and spectroscopicredshifts from the wigglez dark energy survey. our null detection allows us toplace upper limits on the contamination of weak lensing measurements by bluegalaxy intrinsic alignments that, for the first time, do not requiresignificant model-dependent extrapolation from the z~0.1 sdss observations.also, combining the sdss and wigglez constraints gives us a long redshiftbaseline with which to constrain intrinsic alignment models and contaminationof the cosmic shear power spectrum. assuming that the alignments can beexplained by linear alignment with the smoothed local density field, we findthat a measurement of \sigma_8 in a blue-galaxy dominated, cfhtls-like surveywould be contaminated by at most +/-0.02 (95% confidence level, sdss andwigglez) or +/-0.03 (wigglez alone) due to intrinsic alignments.

1003.5721	the wigglez dark energy survey: the selection function and z=0.6 galaxy  power spectrum	we report one of the most accurate measurements of the three-dimensionallarge-scale galaxy power spectrum achieved to date, using 56,159 redshifts ofbright emission-line galaxies at effective redshift z=0.6 from the wigglez darkenergy survey at the anglo-australian telescope. we describe in detail how weconstruct the survey selection function allowing for the varying targetcompleteness and redshift completeness. we measure the total power with anaccuracy of approximately 5% in wavenumber bands of dk=0.01 h/mpc. a modelpower spectrum including non-linear corrections, combined with a linear galaxybias factor and a simple model for redshift-space distortions, provides a goodfit to our data for scales k &lt; 0.4 h/mpc. the large-scale shape of the powerspectrum is consistent with the best-fitting matter and baryon densitiesdetermined by observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation. bysplitting the power spectrum measurement as a function of tangential and radialwavenumbers we delineate the characteristic imprint of peculiar velocities. weuse these to determine the growth rate of structure as a function of redshiftin the range 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.8, including a data point at z=0.78 with an accuracyof 20%. our growth rate measurements are a close match to the self-consistentprediction of the lcdm model. the wigglez survey data will allow a wide rangeof investigations into the cosmological model, cosmic expansion and growthhistory, topology of cosmic structure, and gaussianity of the initialconditions. our calculation of the survey selection function will be releasedat a future date via our website wigglez.swin.edu.au.

1104.2948	the wigglez dark energy survey: the growth rate of cosmic structure  since redshift z=0.9	we present precise measurements of the growth rate of cosmic structure forthe redshift range 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.9, using redshift-space distortions in thegalaxy power spectrum of the wigglez dark energy survey. our results, whichhave a precision of around 10% in four independent redshift bins, are well-fitby a flat lcdm cosmological model with matter density parameter omega_m = 0.27.our analysis hence indicates that this model provides a self-consistentdescription of the growth of cosmic structure through large-scale perturbationsand the homogeneous cosmic expansion mapped by supernovae and baryon acousticoscillations. we achieve robust results by systematically comparing our datawith several different models of the quasi-linear growth of structure includingempirical models, fitting formulae calibrated to n-body simulations, andperturbation theory techniques. we extract the first measurements of the powerspectrum of the velocity divergence field, p_vv(k), as a function of redshift(under the assumption that p_gv(k) = -sqrt[p_gg(k) p_vv(k)] where g is thegalaxy overdensity field), and demonstrate that the wigglez galaxy-masscross-correlation is consistent with a deterministic (rather than stochastic)scale-independent bias model for wigglez galaxies for scales k &lt; 0.3 h/mpc.measurements of the cosmic growth rate from the wigglez survey and othercurrent and future observations offer a powerful test of the physical nature ofdark energy that is complementary to distance-redshift measures such assupernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations.

1105.2862	the wigglez dark energy survey: testing the cosmological model with  baryon acoustic oscillations at z=0.6	we measure the imprint of baryon acoustic oscillations (baos) in the galaxyclustering pattern at the highest redshift achieved to date, z=0.6, using thedistribution of n=132,509 emission-line galaxies in the wigglez dark energysurvey. we quantify baos using three statistics: the galaxy correlationfunction, power spectrum and the band-filtered estimator introduced by xu etal. (2010). the results are mutually consistent, corresponding to a 4.0%measurement of the cosmic distance-redshift relation at z=0.6 (in terms of theacoustic parameter "a(z)" introduced by eisenstein et al. (2005) we finda(z=0.6) = 0.452 +/- 0.018). both baos and power spectrum shape informationcontribute toward these constraints. the statistical significance of thedetection of the acoustic peak in the correlation function, relative to awiggle-free model, is 3.2-sigma. the ratios of our distance measurements tothose obtained using baos in the distribution of luminous red galaxies atredshifts z=0.2 and z=0.35 are consistent with a flat lambda cold dark mattermodel that also provides a good fit to the pattern of observed fluctuations inthe cosmic microwave background (cmb) radiation. the addition of the currentwigglez data results in a ~ 30% improvement in the measurement accuracy of aconstant equation-of-state, w, using bao data alone. based solely on geometricbao distance ratios, accelerating expansion (w &lt; -1/3) is required with aprobability of 99.8%, providing a consistency check of conclusions based onsupernovae observations. further improvements in cosmological constraints willresult when the wigglez survey dataset is complete.

1106.3366	the 6df galaxy survey: baryon acoustic oscillations and the local hubble  constant	we analyse the large-scale correlation function of the 6df galaxy survey(6dfgs) and detect a baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) signal. the 6dfgs baodetection allows us to constrain the distance-redshift relation at z_{\rm eff}= 0.106. we achieve a distance measure of d_v(z_{\rm eff}) = 456\pm27 mpc and ameasurement of the distance ratio, r_s(z_d)/d_v(z_{\rm eff}) = 0.336\pm0.015(4.5% precision), where r_s(z_d) is the sound horizon at the drag epoch z_d.the low effective redshift of 6dfgs makes it a competitive and independentalternative to cepheids and low-z supernovae in constraining the hubbleconstant. we find a hubble constant of h_0 = 67\pm3.2 km s^{-1} mpc^{-1} (4.8%precision) that depends only on the wmap-7 calibration of the sound horizon andon the galaxy clustering in 6dfgs. compared to earlier bao studies at higherredshift, our analysis is less dependent on other cosmological parameters. thesensitivity to h_0 can be used to break the degeneracy between the dark energyequation of state parameter w and h_0 in the cmb data. we determine that w =-0.97\pm0.13, using only wmap-7 and bao data from both 6dfgs and\citet{percival:2009xn}. we also discuss predictions for the large scalecorrelation function of two future wide-angle surveys: the wallaby blind h{\sci} survey (with the australian ska pathfinder, askap), and the proposed taipanall-southern-sky optical galaxy survey with the uk schmidt telescope (ukst). wefind that both surveys are very likely to yield detections of the bao peak,making wallaby the first radio galaxy survey to do so. we also predict thattaipan has the potential to constrain the hubble constant with 3% precision.

1107.3659	the wigglez dark energy survey: constraining the evolution of newton's  constant using the growth rate of structure	we constrain the evolution of newton's constant using the growth rate oflarge-scale structure measured by the wigglez dark energy survey in theredshift range $0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.9$. we use this data in two ways. firstly weconstrain the matter density of the universe, $\omms$ (assuming generalrelativity), and use this to construct a diagnostic to detect the presence ofan evolving newton's constant. secondly we directly measure the evolution ofnewton's constant, $\geff$, that appears in modified gravity theories, withoutassuming general relativity to be true. the novelty of these approaches arethat, contrary to other methods, they do not require knowledge of the expansionhistory of the universe, $h(z)$, making them model independent tests. ourconstraints for the second derivative of newton's constant at the present day,assuming it is slowly evolving as suggested by big bang nucleosynthesisconstraints, using the wigglez data is $\ddotgeff(t_0)=-1.19\pm 0.95\cdot10^{-20}h^2 \textrm{yr}^{-2}$, where $h$ is defined via $h_0=100 h kms^{-1}mpc^{-1}$, while using both the wigglez and the sloan digital sky surveyluminous red galaxy (sdss lrg) data is $\ddotgeff(t_0)=-3.6\pm 6.8\cdot10^{-21}h^2 \rm{yr}^{-2}$, both being consistent with general relativity.finally, our constraint for the rms mass fluctuation $\sigma_8$ using thewigglez data is $\sigma_8=0.75 \pm 0.08$, while using both the wigglez and thesdss lrg data $\sigma_8=0.77 \pm 0.07$, both in good agreement with the latestmeasurements from the cosmic microwave background radiation.

1108.2637	the wigglez dark energy survey: measuring the cosmic expansion history  using the alcock-paczynski test and distant supernovae	astronomical observations suggest that today's universe is dominated by adark energy of unknown physical origin. one of the most notable consequences inmany models is that dark energy should cause the expansion of the universe toaccelerate: but the expansion rate as a function of time has proven verydifficult to measure directly. we present a new determination of the cosmicexpansion history by combining distant supernovae observations with ageometrical analysis of large-scale galaxy clustering within the wigglez darkenergy survey, using the alcock-paczynski test to measure the distortion ofstandard spheres. our result constitutes a robust and non-parametricmeasurement of the hubble expansion rate as a function of time, which wemeasure with 10-15% precision in four bins within the redshift range 0.1 &lt; z &lt;0.9. we demonstrate that the cosmic expansion is accelerating, in a mannerindependent of the parameterization of the cosmological model (althoughassuming cosmic homogeneity in our data analysis). furthermore, we find thatthis expansion history is consistent with a cosmological-constant dark energy.

1201.1013	the wigglez dark energy survey: galaxy evolution at 0.25 &lt; z &lt; 0.75  using the second red-sequence cluster survey (rcs-2)	we study the evolution of galaxy populations around the spectroscopic wigglezsample of starforming galaxies at 0.25 &lt; z &lt; 0.75 using the photometric catalogfrom the second red-sequence cluster survey (rcs2). we probe the opticalphotometric properties of the net excess neighbor galaxies. the key concept isthat the marker galaxies and their neighbors are located at the same redshift,providing a sample of galaxies representing a complete census of galaxies inthe neighborhood of star-forming galaxies. the results are compared with thoseusing the rcs wigglez spare-fibre (rcs-wsf) sample as markers, representinggalaxies in cluster environments at 0.25 &lt; z &lt; 0.45. by analyzing the stackedcolor-color properties of the wigglez neighbor galaxies, we find that theiroptical colors are not a strong function of indicators of star-formingactivities such as ew([oii]) or galex nuv luminoisty of the markers. thegalaxies around the wigglez markers exhibit a bimodal distribution on thecolor-magnitude diagram, with most of them located in the blue cloud. theoptical galaxy luminosity functions (glf) of the blue neighbor galaxies have afaint-end slope \alpha of \sim -1.3, similar to that for galaxies in clusterenvironments drawn from the rcs-wsf sample. the faint-end slope of the glf forthe red neighbors, however, is \sim -0.4, significantly shallower than the \sim-0.7 found for those in cluster environments. this suggests that the build-upof the faint-end of the red sequence in cluster environments is in asignificantly more advanced stage than that in the star-forming and lowergalaxy density wigglez neighborhoods. we find that the red galaxy fraction(fred) around the star-forming wigglez galaxies has similar values from z \sim0.3 to z \sim 0.6 with fred \sim 0.28, but drops to fred \sim 0.20 at z &gt;\sim0.7. this change of fred with redshift suggests that (and more...)

1204.4725	the 6df galaxy survey: z \approx 0 measurement of the growth rate and  sigma_8	we present a detailed analysis of redshift-space distortions in the two-pointcorrelation function of the 6df galaxy survey (6dfgs). the k-band selectedsub-sample which we employ in this study contains 81971 galaxies distributedover 17000deg^2 with an effective redshift z = 0.067. by modelling the 2dgalaxy correlation function, xi(r_p,pi), we measure the parameter combinationf(z)sigma_8(z) = 0.423 +/- 0.055. alternatively, by assuming standard gravitywe can break the degeneracy between sigma_8 and the galaxy bias parameter, b.combining our data with the hubble constant prior from riess et al (2011), wemeasure sigma_8 = 0.76 +/- 0.11 and omega_m = 0.250 +/- 0.022, consistent withconstraints from other galaxy surveys and the cosmic microwave background datafrom wmap7. combining our measurement of fsigma_8 with wmap7 allows us to testthe relationship between matter and gravity on cosmic scales by constrainingthe growth index of density fluctuations, gamma. using only 6dfgs and wmap7data we find gamma = 0.547 +/- 0.088, consistent with the prediction of generalrelativity. we note that because of the low effective redshift of 6dfgs ourmeasurement of the growth rate is independent of the fiducial cosmologicalmodel (alcock-paczynski effect). we also show that our conclusions are notsensitive to the model adopted for non-linear redshift-space distortions. usinga fisher matrix analysis we report predictions for constraints on fsigma_8 forthe wallaby survey and the proposed taipan survey. the wallaby survey will beable to measure fsigma_8 with a precision of 4-10%, depending on the modellingof non-linear structure formation. this is comparable to the predictedprecision for the best redshift bins of the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss), demonstrating that low-redshift surveys have a significant roleto play in future tests of dark energy and modified gravity.

1205.4679	a combined measurement of cosmic growth and expansion from clusters of  galaxies, the cmb and galaxy clustering	combining galaxy cluster data from the rosat all-sky survey and the chandrax-ray observatory, cosmic microwave background data from the wilkinsonmicrowave anisotropy probe, and galaxy clustering data from the wigglez darkenergy survey, the 6-degree field galaxy survey and the sloan digital skysurvey iii, we test for consistency the cosmic growth of structure predicted bygeneral relativity (gr) and the cosmic expansion history predicted by thecosmological constant plus cold dark matter paradigm (lcdm). the combination ofthese three independent, well studied measurements of the evolution of the meanenergy density and its fluctuations is able to break strong degeneraciesbetween model parameters. we model the key properties of cosmic growth with thenormalization of the matter power spectrum, sigma_8, and the cosmic growthindex, gamma, and those of cosmic expansion with the mean matter density,omega_m, the hubble constant, h_0, and a kinematical parameter equivalent tothat for the dark energy equation of state, w. for a spatially flat geometry,w=-1, and allowing for systematic uncertainties, we obtain sigma_8=0.785+-0.019and gamma=0.570+0.064-0.063 (at the 68.3 per cent confidence level). allowingboth w and gamma to vary we find w=-0.950+0.069-0.070 and gamma=0.533+-0.080.to further tighten the constraints on the expansion parameters, we also includesupernova, cepheid variable and baryon acoustic oscillation data. for w=-1, wehave gamma=0.616+-0.061. for our most general model with a free w, we measureomega_m=0.278+0.012-0.011, h_0=70.0+-1.3 km s^-1 mpc^-1 andw=-0.987+0.054-0.053 for the expansion parameters, and sigma_8=0.789+-0.019 andgamma=0.604+-0.078 for the growth parameters. these results are in excellentagreement with gr+lcdm (gamma~0.55; w=-1) and represent the tightest and mostrobust simultaneous constraint on cosmic growth and expansion to date.

1205.6812	the wigglez dark energy survey: the transition to large-scale cosmic  homogeneity	we have made the largest-volume measurement to date of the transition tolarge-scale homogeneity in the distribution of galaxies. we use the wigglezsurvey, a spectroscopic survey of over 200,000 blue galaxies in a cosmic volumeof ~1 (gpc/h)^3. a new method of defining the 'homogeneity scale' is presented,which is more robust than methods previously used in the literature, and whichcan be easily compared between different surveys. due to the large cosmic depthof wigglez (up to z=1) we are able to make the first measurement of thetransition to homogeneity over a range of cosmic epochs. the mean number ofgalaxies n(&lt;r) in spheres of comoving radius r is proportional to r^3 within1%, or equivalently the fractal dimension of the sample is within 1% of d_2=3,at radii larger than 71 \pm 8 mpc/h at z~0.2, 70 \pm 5 mpc/h at z~0.4, 81 \pm 5mpc/h at z~0.6, and 75 \pm 4 mpc/h at z~0.8. we demonstrate the robustness ofour results against selection function effects, using a lcdm n-body simulationand a suite of inhomogeneous fractal distributions. the results are inexcellent agreement with both the lcdm n-body simulation and an analytical lcdmprediction. we can exclude a fractal distribution with fractal dimension belowd_2=2.97 on scales from ~80 mpc/h up to the largest scales probed by ourmeasurement, ~300 mpc/h, at 99.99% confidence.

1210.2130	the wigglez dark energy survey: final data release and cosmological  results	this paper presents cosmological results from the final data release of thewigglez dark energy survey. we perform full analyses of different cosmologicalmodels using the wigglez power spectra measured at z=0.22, 0.41, 0.60, and0.78, combined with other cosmological datasets. the limiting factor in thisanalysis is the theoretical modelling of the galaxy power spectrum, includingnon-linearities, galaxy bias, and redshift-space distortions. in this paper weassess several different methods for modelling the theoretical power spectrum,testing them against the gigaparsec wigglez simulations (gigglez). we fit for abase set of 6 cosmological parameters, {omega_b h^2, omega_cdm h^2, h_0, tau,a_s, n_s}, and 5 supplementary parameters {n_run, r, w, omega_k, sum m_nu}. incombination with the cosmic microwave background (cmb), our results areconsistent with the lambdacdm concordance cosmology, with a measurement of thematter density of omega_m =0.29 +/- 0.016 and amplitude of fluctuations sigma_8= 0.825 +/- 0.017. using wigglez data with cmb and other distance and matterpower spectra data, we find no evidence for any of the extension parametersbeing inconsistent with their lambdacdm model values. the power spectra dataand theoretical modelling tools are available for use as a module for cosmomc,which we here make publicly available at http://smp.uq.edu.au/wigglez-data . wealso release the data and random catalogues used to construct the baryonacoustic oscillation correlation function.

1211.5605	the wigglez dark energy survey: probing the epoch of radiation  domination using large scale structure	we place the most robust constraint to date on the scale of the turnover inthe cosmological matter power spectrum using data from the wigglez dark energysurvey. we find this feature to lie at a scale of$k_0=0.0160^{+0.0041}_{-0.0035}$ [h/mpc] (68% confidence) for an effectiveredshift of 0.62 and obtain from this the first-ever turnover-derived distanceand cosmology constraints: a measure of the cosmic distance-redshift relationin units of the horizon scale at the redshift of radiation-matter equality(r_h) of d_v(z=0.62)/r_h=18.3 (+6.3/-3.3) and, assuming a prior on the numberof extra relativistic degrees of freedom $n_{eff}=3$, constraints on the matterdensity parameter $\omega_mh^2=0.136^{+0.026}_{-0.052}$ and on the redshift ofmatter-radiation equality $z_{eq}=3274^{+631}_{-1260}$. all results are inexcellent agreement with the predictions of standard lcdm models. ourconstraints on the logarithmic slope of the power spectrum on scales largerthan the turnover is bounded in the lower limit with values only as low as -1allowed, with the prediction of standard lcdm models easily accommodated by ourresults. lastly, we generate forecasts for the achievable precision of futuresurveys at constraining $k_0$, $\omega_mh^2$, $z_{eq}$ and $n_{eff}$. we findthat boss should substantially improve upon the wigglez turnover constraint,reaching a precision on $k_0$ of $\pm$9% (68% confidence), translating toprecisions on $\omega_mh^2$ and $z_{eq}$ of $\pm$10% (assuming a prior$n_{eff}=3$) and on $n_{eff}$ of (+78/-56)% (assuming a prior$\omega_mh^2=0.135$). this is sufficient precision to sharpen the constraintson $n_{eff}$ from wmap, particularly in its upper limit. for euclid, we findcorresponding attainable precisions on $(k_0, \omega_mh^2, n_eff)$ of(3,4,+17/-21)%. this represents a precision approaching our forecasts for theplanck surveyor.

1212.3339	cfhtlens: testing the laws of gravity with tomographic weak lensing and  redshift space distortions	dark energy may be the first sign of new fundamental physics in the universe,taking either a physical form or revealing a correction to einsteinian gravity.weak gravitational lensing and galaxy peculiar velocities provide complementaryprobes of general relativity, and in combination allow us to test modifiedtheories of gravity in a unique way. we perform such an analysis by combiningmeasurements of cosmic shear tomography from the canada-france hawaii telescopelensing survey (cfhtlens) with the growth of structure from the wigglez darkenergy survey and the six-degree-field galaxy survey (6dfgs), producing thestrongest existing joint constraints on the metric potentials that describegeneral theories of gravity. for scale-independent modifications to the metricpotentials which evolve linearly with the effective dark energy density, wefind present-day cosmological deviations in the newtonian potential andcurvature potential from the prediction of general relativity to be (deltapsi)/psi = 0.05 \pm 0.25 and (delta phi)/phi = -0.05 \pm 0.3 respectively (68per cent cl).

1212.3610	the 6df galaxy survey: dependence of halo occupation on stellar mass	in this paper we study the stellar-mass dependence of galaxy clustering inthe 6df galaxy survey. the near-infrared selection of 6dfgs allows morereliable stellar mass estimates compared to optical bands used in other galaxysurveys. using the halo occupation distribution (hod) model, we investigate thetrend of dark matter halo mass and satellite fraction with stellar mass bymeasuring the projected correlation function, $w_p(r_p)$. we find that thetypical halo mass ($m_1$) as well as the satellite power law index ($\alpha$)increase with stellar mass. this indicates, (1) that galaxies with higherstellar mass sit in more massive dark matter halos and (2) that these moremassive dark matter halos accumulate satellites faster with growing masscompared to halos occupied by low stellar mass galaxies. furthermore we find arelation between $m_1$ and the minimum dark matter halo mass ($m_{\rm min}$) of$m_1 \approx 22\,m_{\rm min}$, in agreement with similar findings for sdssgalaxies. the satellite fraction of 6dfgs galaxies declines with increasingstellar mass from 21% at $m_{\rm stellar} = 2.6\times10^{10}h^{-2}\,m_{\odot}$to 12% at $m_{\rm stellar} = 5.4\times10^{10}h^{-2}\,m_{\odot}$ indicating thathigh stellar mass galaxies are more likely to be central galaxies. we compareour results to two different semi-analytic models derived from the millenniumsimulation, finding some disagreement. our results can be used for placing newconstraints on semi-analytic models in the future, particularly the behaviourof luminous red satellites. finally we compare our results to studies of halooccupation using galaxy-galaxy weak lensing. we find good overall agreement,representing a valuable crosscheck for these two different tools of studyingthe matter distribution in the universe.

1302.5167	determining accurate measurements of the growth rate from the galaxy  correlation function in simulations	we use high-resolution n-body simulations to develop a new, flexible,empirical approach for measuring the growth rate from redshift-spacedistortions (rsd) in the 2-point galaxy correlation function. we quantify thesystematic error in measuring the growth rate in a $1 \, h^{-3}$ gpc$^3$ volumeover a range of redshifts, from the dark matter particle distribution and arange of halo-mass catalogues with a number density comparable to the latestlarge-volume galaxy surveys such as the wigglez dark energy survey and thebaryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss). our simulations allow us tospan halo masses with bias factors ranging from unity (probed by emission-linegalaxies) to more massive haloes hosting luminous red galaxies. we show thatthe measured growth rate is sensitive to the model adopted for the small-scalereal-space correlation function, and in particular that the "standard"assumption of a power-law correlation function can result in a significantsystematic error in the growth rate determination. we introduce a new,empirical fitting function that produces results with a lower (5-10%) amplitudeof systematic error. we also introduce a new technique which permits the galaxypairwise velocity distribution, the quantity which drives the non-linear growthof structure, to be measured as a non-parametric stepwise function. our(model-independent) results agree well with an exponential pairwise velocitydistribution, expected from theoretical considerations, and are consistent withdirect measurements of halo velocity differences from the parent catalogues. ina companion paper we present the application of our new methodology to thewigglez survey dataset.

1302.5178	the wigglez dark energy survey: measuring the cosmic growth rate with  the two-point galaxy correlation function	the growth history of large-scale structure in the universe is a powerfulprobe of the cosmological model, including the nature of dark energy. we studythe growth rate of cosmic structure to redshift $z = 0.9$ using more than$162{,}000$ galaxy redshifts from the wigglez dark energy survey. we divide thedata into four redshift slices with effective redshifts $z =[0.2,0.4,0.6,0.76]$ and in each of the samples measure and model the 2-pointgalaxy correlation function in parallel and transverse directions to theline-of-sight. after simultaneously fitting for the galaxy bias factor werecover values for the cosmic growth rate which are consistent with our assumed$\lambda$cdm input cosmological model, with an accuracy of around 20% in eachredshift slice. we investigate the sensitivity of our results to the details ofthe assumed model and the range of physical scales fitted, making closecomparison with a set of n-body simulations for calibration. our measurementsare consistent with an independent power-spectrum analysis of a similardataset, demonstrating that the results are not driven by systematic errors. wedetermine the pairwise velocity dispersion of the sample in a non-parametricmanner, showing that it systematically increases with decreasing redshift, andinvestigate the alcock-paczynski effects of changing the assumed fiducial modelon the results. our techniques should prove useful for current and futuregalaxy surveys mapping the growth rate of structure using the 2-dimensionalcorrelation function.

1306.4031	the wigglez dark energy survey: star-formation in uv-luminous galaxies  from their luminosity functions	we present the ultraviolet (uv) luminosity function of galaxies from thegalex medium imaging survey with measured spectroscopic redshifts from thefirst data release of the wigglez dark energy survey. this sample selectsgalaxies with high star formation rates: at 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 0.9 the median starformation rate is at the upper 95th percentile of optically-selected (r&lt;22.5)galaxies and the sample contains about 50 per cent of all nuv &lt; 22.8, 0.6 &lt; z &lt;0.9 starburst galaxies within the volume sampled.  the most luminous galaxies in our sample (-21.0&gt;m_nuv&gt;-22.5) evolve veryrapidly with a number density declining as (1+z)^{5\pm 1} from redshift z = 0.9to z = 0.6. these starburst galaxies (m_nuv&lt;-21 is approximately a starformation rate of 30 \msuny) contribute about 1 per cent of cosmic starformation over the redshift range z=0.6 to z=0.9. the star formation ratedensity of these very luminous galaxies evolves rapidly, as (1+z)^{4\pm 1}.such a rapid evolution implies the majority of star formation in these largegalaxies must have occurred before z = 0.9.  we measure the uv luminosity function in 0.05 redshift intervals spanning0.1&lt;z&lt;0.9, and provide analytic fits to the results. at all redshifts greaterthan z=0.55 we find that the bright end of the luminosity function is not welldescribed by a pure schechter function due to an excess of very luminous(m_nuv&lt;-22) galaxies. these luminosity functions can be used to create a radialselection function for the wigglez survey or test models of galaxy formationand evolution. here we test the agn feedback model in scannapieco et al.(2005), and find that this agn feedback model requires agn feedback efficiencyto vary with one or more of the following: stellar mass, star formation rateand redshift.

1310.6810	using the topology of large-scale structure in the wigglez dark energy  survey as a cosmological standard ruler	we present new and accurate measurements of the cosmic distance-redshiftrelation, spanning 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1, using the topology of large-scale structure asa cosmological standard ruler. our results derive from an analysis of theminkowski functionals of the density field traced by the wigglez dark energysurvey. the minkowski functionals are a set of statistics which completelydescribe the topological nature of each isodensity surface within the field, asa function of the density value. given the shape of the underlying matter powerspectrum, measured by fluctuations in the cosmic microwave backgroundradiation, the expected amplitudes of the minkowski functionals are specifiedas an excursion set of a gaussian random field, with minimal non-gaussiancorrections for the smoothing scales &gt; 10 mpc/h considered in this analysis.the measured amplitudes then determine the cosmic distance d_v(z), which weobtain with 3-7% accuracies in six independent redshift slices, with thestandard ruler originating in the known curvature of the model power spectrumat the smoothing scale. we introduce a new method for correcting thetopological statistics for the sparse-sampling of the density field by thegalaxy tracers, and validate our overall methodology using mock catalogues fromn-body simulations. our distance measurements are consistent with standardmodels which describe the cosmic expansion history, and with previous analysesof baryon acoustic oscillations (baos) detected by the wigglez survey, with thetopological results yielding a higher distance precision by a factor of 2.however, the full redshift-space power-spectrum shape is required to recoverthe topological distances, in contrast to the preferred length scale imprintedby baos, which is determined by simpler physics.

1312.1022	are peculiar velocity surveys competitive as a cosmological probe?	peculiar velocity surveys, which measure galaxy peculiar velocities directlyfrom standard candles in addition to redshifts, can provide strong constraintson the linear growth rate of cosmological large-scale structure at lowredshift. the improvement originates from the physical relationship betweengalaxy density and peculiar velocity, which substantially reduces cosmicvariance. we present the results of fisher matrix forecasts of correlatedfields of galaxy density and velocity. peculiar velocity can improve the growthrate constraints by about a factor of two compared to density alone, if we canuse all the information for wavenumber k &lt; 0.2 h/mpc. future peculiar velocitysurveys, taipan, and the all-sky hi surveys, wallaby and wnshs, can measure thegrowth rate, f*sigma8 to 3 per cent at z ~ 0.025. although the velocitysubsample is about an order of magnitude smaller than the redshift sample fromthe same survey, it improves the constraint by 40 per cent compared to the samesurvey without velocity measurements. peculiar velocity surveys can alsomeasure the growth rate as a function of wavenumber with 15-30 per centuncertainties in bins with widths 0.01 h/mpc in the range 0.02 h/mpc &lt; k &lt; 0.1h/mpc, which is a large improvement over galaxy density only. such measurementson very large scales can detect signatures of modified gravity ornon-gaussianity through scale-dependent growth rate or galaxy bias. we usen-body simulations to improve the modelling of auto- and cross-power spectra ofgalaxy density and peculiar velocity by introducing a new redshift-spacedistortion term to the velocity, which has been neglected in previous studies.the velocity power spectrum has a damping in redshift space, which is largerthan that naively expected from the similar effect in the galaxy powerspectrum.

1407.0390	the gigaparsec wigglez simulations: characterising scale dependant bias  and associated systematics in growth of structure measurements	we use the gigaparsec wigglez (gigglez) simulations to characterise galaxybias and its scale dependence for a range of redshifts and halo masses in astandard $\lambda$lcdm cosmology. assuming bias converges to a scaleindependent form at large scales, we develop a phenomenological model whichfully expresses the mass and redshift dependence of bias and its scaledependence in real or redshift space. we then use this to illustrate howscale-dependent bias can systematically skew measurements of the growth-rate ofcosmic structure obtained from redshift-space distortion measurements. whendata is fit only to scales $k_{\rm max}{\le}0.1$ $[h^{-1} \rm{mpc}]^{-1}$, wefind that these effects are significant only for large biases ($b{\gtrsim}3$)at large redshifts ($z{\gtrsim}1$). however, when smaller scales areincorporated ($k_{\rm max}{\le}0.2$ $[h^{-1} \rm{mpc}]^{-1}$) to increasemeasurement precision, the combination of reduced statistical uncertainty andincreased scale dependent bias can result in highly significant systematics formost large halos across all redshifts. we identify several new interestingaspects of bias, including a significant large-scale bias boost for small halosat low-redshifts due to substructure effects ($\sim$20\% for milky way-likesystems) and a nearly redshift-independent halo mass (corresponding to aredshift-space bias of ${\sim}1.5$) for which halo bias has little-or-no scaledependence on scales greater than $3$ $[h^{-1} {\rm mpc}]$. this suggests anoptimal strategy of targeting bias ${\sim}{1.5}$ systems for clustering studieswhich are dominated by systematic uncertainties in how observed halo (orgalaxy) distributions map to their underlying mass distribution, such ascosmological measurements of neutrino masses. code for generating our fittingformula is publicly available at http://gbpoole.github.io/poole_2014a_code/(abridged)

1501.03821	measuring redshift-space distortions with future ska surveys	the peculiar motion of galaxies can be a particularly sensitive probe ofgravitational collapse. as such, it can be used to measure the dynamics of darkmatter and dark energy as well the nature of the gravitational laws at play oncosmological scales. peculiar motions manifest themselves as an overallanisotropy in the measured clustering signal as a function of the angle to theline-of-sight, known as redshift-space distortion (rsd). limiting factors inthis measurement include our ability to model non-linear galaxy motions onsmall scales and the complexities of galaxy bias. the anisotropy in themeasured clustering pattern in redshift-space is also driven by the unknowndistance factors at the redshift in question, the alcock-paczynski distortion.this weakens growth rate measurements, but permits an extra geometric probe ofthe hubble expansion rate. in this chapter we will briefly describe thescientific background to the rsd technique, and forecast the potential of theska phase 1 and the ska2 to measure the growth rate using both galaxycatalogues and intensity mapping, assessing their competitiveness with currentand future optical galaxy surveys.

1501.03825	cosmology with ska radio continuum surveys	radio continuum surveys have, in the past, been of restricted use incosmology. most studies have concentrated on cross-correlations with the cosmicmicrowave background to detect the integrated sachs-wolfe effect, due to thelarge sky areas that can be surveyed. as we move into the ska era, radiocontinuum surveys will have sufficient source density and sky area to play amajor role in cosmology on the largest scales. in this chapter we summarise theexperiments that can be carried out with the ska as it is built up through thecoming decade. we show that the ska can play a unique role in constraining thenon-gaussianity parameter to \sigma(f_nl) ~ 1, and provide a unique handle onthe systematics that inhibit weak lensing surveys. the ska will also providethe necessary data to test the isotropy of the universe at redshifts of orderunity and thus evaluate the robustness of the cosmological principle.thus, skacontinuum surveys will turn radio observations into a central probe ofcosmological research in the coming decades.

1504.06885	searching for modified gravity: scale and redshift dependent constraints  from galaxy peculiar velocities	we present measurements of both scale- and time-dependent deviations from thestandard gravitational field equations. these late-time modifications areintroduced separately for relativistic and non-relativistic particles, by wayof the parameters $g_{\rm matter}(k,z)$ and $g_{\rm light}(k,z)$ using two binsin both scale and time, with transition wavenumber $0.01$ mpc$^{-1}$ andredshift 1. we emphasize the use of two dynamical probes to constrain this setof parameters, galaxy power spectrum multipoles and the direct peculiarvelocity power spectrum, which probe fluctuations on different scales. themultipole measurements are derived from the wigglez and boss data release 11cmass galaxy redshift surveys and the velocity power spectrum is measured fromthe velocity sub-sample of the 6-degree field galaxy survey. we combine withadditional cosmological probes including baryon acoustic oscillations, type iasne, the cosmic microwave background (cmb), lensing of the cmb, and thetemperature--galaxy cross-correlation. using a markov chain monte carlolikelihood analysis, we find the inferred best-fit parameter values of $g_{\rmmatter}(k,z)$ and $g_{\rm light}(k,z)$ to be consistent with the standard modelat the $95\%$ confidence level. furthermore, accounting for thealcock-paczynski effect, we perform joint fits for the expansion history andgrowth index gamma; we measure $\gamma = 0.665 \pm 0.0669$ ($68\%$ c.l) for afixed expansion history, and $\gamma = 0.73^{+0.08}_{-0.10}$ ($68\%$ c.l) whenthe expansion history is allowed to deviate from $\lambda$cdm. with a fixedexpansion history the inferred value is consistent with gr at the $95\%$ c.l;alternatively, a $2\sigma$ tension is observed when the expansion history isnot fixed, this tension is worsened by the combination of growth and sne data.

1511.06930	the 6df galaxy survey: bulk flows on $50-70 h^{-1}$ mpc scales	we measure the bulk flow of the local universe using the 6df galaxy surveypeculiar velocity sample (6dfgsv), the largest and most homogeneous peculiarvelocity sample to date. 6dfgsv is a fundamental plane sample of $\sim10^4$peculiar velocities covering the whole southern hemisphere for galacticlatitude $|b| &gt; 10^\circ$, out to redshift ${z=0.0537}$. we apply the `minimumvariance' bulk flow weighting method, which allows us to make a robustmeasurement of the bulk flow on scales of $50$ and $70\,h^{-1}{\rm mpc}$. weinvestigate and correct for potential bias due to the lognormal velocityuncertainties, and verify our method by constructing $\lambda{\rm cdm}$ 6dfgsvmock catalogues incorporating the survey selection function. for a hemisphereof radius $50\,h^{-1}{\rm mpc}$ we find a bulk flow amplitude of$u=248\pm58\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ in the direction $(l,b) =(318^\circ\pm20^\circ,40^\circ\pm13^\circ)$, and for $70\,h^{-1}{\rm mpc}$ wefind $u=243\pm58\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$, in the same direction. ourmeasurement gives us a constraint on $\sigma_8$ of $1.01^{+1.07}_{-0.58}$. ourresults are in agreement with other recent measurements of the direction of thebulk flow, and our measured amplitude is consistent with a $\lambda{\rm cdm}$prediction.

1512.03626	cfhtlens and rcslens: testing photometric redshift distributions using  angular cross-correlations with spectroscopic galaxy surveys	we determine the accuracy of galaxy redshift distributions as estimated fromphotometric redshift probability distributions $p(z)$. our method utilisesmeasurements of the angular cross-correlation between photometric galaxies andan overlapping sample of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts. we describe theredshift leakage from a galaxy photometric redshift bin $j$ into aspectroscopic redshift bin $i$ using the sum of the $p(z)$ for the galaxiesresiding in bin $j$. we can then predict the angular cross-correlation betweenphotometric and spectroscopic galaxies due to intrinsic galaxy clustering when$i \neq j$ as a function of the measured angular cross-correlation when $i=j$.we also account for enhanced clustering arising from lensing magnificationusing a halo model. the comparison of this prediction with the measured signalprovides a consistency check on the validity of using the summed $p(z)$ todetermine galaxy redshift distributions in cosmological analyses, as advocatedby the canada-france-hawaii telescope lensing survey (cfhtlens).  we present an analysis of the photometric redshifts measured by cfhtlens,which overlaps the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss). we alsoanalyse the red-sequence cluster lensing survey (rcslens), which overlaps bothboss and the wigglez dark energy survey. we find that the summed $p(z)$ fromboth surveys are generally biased with respect to the true underlyingdistributions. if unaccounted for, this bias would lead to errors incosmological parameter estimation from cfhtlens by less than $\sim 4\%$. forphotometric redshift bins which spatially overlap in 3-d with our spectroscopicsample, we determine redshift bias corrections which can be used in futurecosmological analyses that rely on accurate galaxy redshift distributions.

astro-ph;0203385	detection of the velocity dipole in the radio galaxies of the nrao vla  sky survey	we are in motion against the cosmic backdrop. this motion is evidenced by thesystematic temperature shift - or dipole anisotropy - observed in the cosmicmicrowave background radiation (cmb). because of the doppler effect, thetemperature of the cmb is 0.1 per cent higher in our direction of motionthrough the universe. if our standard cosmological understanding is correct,this dipole should also be present as an enhancement in the surface density ofdistant galaxies. the main obstacle in finding this signal is the very unevendistribution of nearby galaxies in the local supercluster, which drowns out thesmall cosmological imprint. here we report the first detection of the expecteddipole anisotropy in the galaxy distribution, in a survey of galaxies detectedin radio waves. radio galaxies are mostly located at cosmological distances, sothe contamination from nearby clusters should be small. with local radiosources removed, we find a dipole anisotropy in the radio galaxy distributionin the same direction as the cmb, close to the expected amplitude. this resultis confirmation of the standard cosmological interpretation of the cmb.

astro-ph;0408536	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the local e+a galaxy population	we select a sample of low-redshift (z ~ 0.1) e+a galaxies from the 2df galaxyredshift survey (2dfgrs). the spectra of these objects are defined by stronghydrogen balmer absorption lines (h-delta, h-gamma, h-beta) combined with alack of [oii] 3727a emission, together implying a recently-truncated burst ofstar formation. the e+a spectrum is thus a signpost to galaxies in the processof evolution. we quantify the local environments, clustering properties andluminosity function of the e+a galaxies. we find that the environments areconsistent with the ensemble of 2dfgrs galaxies: low-redshift e+a systems arelocated predominantly in the field, existing as isolated objects or in poorgroups. however, the luminosity distribution of galaxies selected using threebalmer absorption lines h-delta-gamma-beta appears more typical of ellipticals.indeed, morphologically these galaxies are preferentially spheroidal (e/s0)systems. in a small but significant number we find evidence for recent majormergers, such as tidal tails. we infer that major mergers are one importantformation mechanism for e+a galaxies, as suggested by previous studies. at lowredshift the merger probability is high in the field and low in clusters, thusthese recently-formed spheroidal systems do not follow the usualmorphology-density relation for ellipticals. regarding the selection of e+agalaxies: we find that basing the balmer-line criterion solely on h-deltaabsorption leads to a significant sub-population of disk systems withdetectable h-alpha emission. in these objects the [oii] emission is presumablyeither obscured by dust or present with a low signal-to-noise ratio, whilst the(h-gamma, h-beta) absorption features are subject to emission-filling.

astro-ph;0411713	cosmology with photometric redshift surveys	we explore the utility of future photometric redshift imaging surveys fordelineating the large-scale structure of the universe, and assess the resultingconstraints on the cosmological model. we perform two complementary types ofanalysis: (1) we quantify the statistical confidence and the accuracy withwhich such surveys will be able to detect and measure characteristic featuresin the clustering power spectrum such as the acoustic oscillations and theturnover, in a 'model-independent' fashion. we show for example that a 10,000deg^2 imaging survey with depth r = 22.5 and photometric redshift accuracydz/(1+z) = 0.03 will detect the acoustic oscillations with 99.9% confidence,measuring the associated preferred cosmological scale with 2% precision. such asurvey will also detect the turnover with 95% confidence, determining thecorresponding scale with 20% accuracy. (2) by assuming a lambda-cdm model powerspectrum we calculate the confidence with which a non-zero baryon fraction canbe deduced from such future galaxy surveys. we quantify 'wiggle detection' bycalculating the number of standard deviations by which the baryon fraction ismeasured, after marginalizing over the shape parameter. this is typically afactor of four more significant (in terms of number of standard deviations)than the 'model-independent' result. we conclude that the precision with whichthe clustering pattern may be inferred from future photometric redshift surveyswill be competitive with contemporaneous spectroscopic redshift surveys,assuming that systematic effects can be controlled. we also note that ananalysis of luminous red galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey may yield amarginal detection of acoustic oscillations in the imaging survey, in additionto that recently reported for the spectroscopic component.

astro-ph;0602428	on the cross-correlation of sub-mm sources and optically-selected  galaxies	bright sub-mm galaxies are expected to arise in massive highly-biased haloes,and hence exhibit strong clustering. we argue that a valuable tool formeasuring these clustering properties is the cross-correlation of sub-mmgalaxies with faint optically-selected sources. we analyze populations ofscuba-detected and optical galaxies in the goods-n survey area. usingoptical/ir photometric-redshift information, we search for correlations inducedby two separate effects: (1) cosmic magnification of background sub-mm sourcesby foreground dark matter haloes traced by optical galaxies at lower redshifts;and (2) galaxy clustering due to sub-mm and optical sources tracing the samepopulation of haloes where their redshift distributions overlap. regardingcosmic magnification, we find no detectable correlation. our null result isconsistent with a theoretical model for the cosmic magnification, and we showthat a dramatic increase in the number of sub-mm sources will be required tomeasure the effect reliably. regarding clustering, we find evidence at the3.5-sigma level for a cross-correlation between sub-mm and optical galaxiesanalyzed in identical photometric redshift slices. the data hint that thesub-mm sources have an enhanced bias parameter compared to theoptically-selected population (with a significance of 2-sigma). the nextgeneration of deep sub-mm surveys can potentially perform an accuratemeasurement of each of these cross-correlations, adding a new set ofdiagnostics for understanding the development of massive structure in theuniverse.

astro-ph;0607630	megaz-lrg: a photometric redshift catalogue of one million sdss luminous  red galaxies	we describe the construction of megaz-lrg, a photometric redshift catalogueof over one million luminous red galaxies (lrgs) in the redshift range 0.4 &lt; z&lt; 0.7 with limiting magnitude i &lt; 20. the catalogue is selected from theimaging data of the sloan digital sky survey data release 4. the 2df-sdss lrgand quasar (2slaq) spectroscopic redshift catalogue of 13,000intermediate-redshift lrgs provides a photometric redshift training set,allowing use of annz, a neural network-based photometric-redshift estimator.the rms photometric redshift accuracy obtained for an evaluation set selectedfrom the 2slaq sample is sigma_z = 0.049 averaged over all galaxies, andsigma_z = 0.040 for a brighter subsample (i &lt; 19.0). the catalogue is expectedto contain ~5 per cent stellar contamination. the annz code is used to computea refined star/galaxy probability based on a range of photometric parameters;this allows the contamination fraction to be reduced to 2 per cent withnegligible loss of genuine galaxies. the megaz-lrg catalogue is publiclyavailable on the world wide web from http://www.2slaq.info .

astro-ph;0702040	optimising baryon acoustic oscillation surveys - i: testing the  concordance lcdm cosmology	we optimize the design of future spectroscopic redshift surveys forconstraining the dark energy via precision measurements of the baryon acousticoscillations (bao), with particular emphasis on the design of the wide-fieldmulti-object spectrograph (wfmos). we develop a model that predicts the numberdensity of possible target galaxies as a function of exposure time andredshift. we use this number counts model together with fitting formulae forthe accuracy of the bao measurements to determine the effectiveness ofdifferent surveys and instrument designs. we search through the availablesurvey parameter space to find the optimal survey with respect to the darkenergy equation-of-state parameters according to the dark energy task forcefigure-of-merit, including predictions of future measurements from the plancksatellite. we optimize the survey to test the lambdacdm model, assuming thatgalaxies are pre-selected using photometric redshifts to have a constant numberdensity with redshift, and using a non-linear cut-off for the matter powerspectrum that evolves with redshift. we find that line-emission galaxies arestrongly preferred as targets over continuum emission galaxies. the optimalsurvey covers a redshift range 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.4, over the widest possible area(6000 sq. degs from 1500 hours observing time). the most efficient number offibres for the spectrograph is 2,000, and the survey performance continues toimprove with the addition of extra fibres until a plateau is reached at 10,000fibres. the optimal point in the survey parameter space is not highly peakedand is not significantly affected by including constraints from upcomingsupernovae surveys and other bao experiments.

astro-ph;9808276	measurement of star-formation rate from h-alpha in field galaxies at z=1	we report the results of j-band infrared spectroscopy of a sample of 13 z=1field galaxies drawn from the canada-france redshift survey, targeting galaxieswhose redshifts place the rest frame h-alpha line emission from hii regions inbetween the bright night sky oh lines. as a result we detect emission down to aflux limit of ~10^{-16} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1} corresponding to a luminosity limitof ~10^{41} ergs at this redshift for a h_0=50 km s^{-1} mpc,^{-1} q_0=0.5cosmology. from these luminosities we derive estimates of the star-formationrates in these galaxies which are independent of previous estimates based upontheir rest-frame ultraviolet (2800a) luminosity. the mean star-formation rateat z=1, from this sample, is found to be at least three times as high as theultraviolet estimates. the standard dust extinction in these galaxies isinferred to be a_v=0.5-1.0 mags, comparable to local field galaxies, suggestingthat the bulk of star-formation is not heavily obscured unless one uses greyerextinction laws. star-forming galaxies have the bluest colours and apreponderance of disturbed/interacting morphologies. we also investigate theeffects of particular star-formation histories, in particular the role ofbursts vs continuous star-formation in changing the detailed distribution of uvto h-alpha emission. generally we find that models dominated by short,overlapping, bursts at typically 0.2 gyr intervals provide a better model forthe data than a constant rate of star-formation. the star-formation history ofthe universe from balmer lines is compiled and found to be typically 2--3\timeshigher than that inferred from the uv {\em at all redshifts}. it can not yet beclearly established whether the star-formation rate falls off or remainsconstant at high-redshift.
