0903.1045	metal-rich carbon stars in the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we present spectroscopic observations from the {\it spitzer space telescope}of six carbon-rich agb stars in the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (sgrdsph) and two foreground galactic carbon stars. the band strengths of theobserved c$_2$h$_2$ and sic features are very similar to those observed ingalactic agb stars. the metallicities are estimated from an empirical relationbetween the acetylene optical depth and the strength of the sic feature. themetallicities are higher than those of the lmc, and close to galactic values.while the high metallicity could imply an age of around 1 gyr, for the dustyagb stars, the pulsation periods suggest ages in excess of 2 or 3 gyr. we fitthe spectra of the observed stars using the dusty radiative transfer model anddetermine their dust mass-loss rates to be in the range 1.0--3.3$\times 10^{-8}$m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. the two galactic foreground carbon-rich agb stars arelocated at the far side of the solar circle, beyond the galactic centre. one ofthese two stars show the strongest sic feature in our present local groupsample.

0905.1240	structure of the outer layers of cool standard stars	context: among late-type red giants, an interesting change occurs in thestructure of the outer atmospheric layers as one moves to later spectral typesin the hertzsprung-russell diagram: a chromosphere is always present, but thecoronal emission diminishes and a cool massive wind steps in.  aims: where most studies have focussed on short-wavelength observations, thisarticle explores the influence of the chromosphere and the wind onlong-wavelength photometric measurements.  methods: the observational spectral energy distributions are compared withthe theoretical predictions of the marcs atmosphere models for a sample of 9 k-and m-giants. the discrepancies found are explained using basic models for fluxemission originating from a chromosphere or an ionized wind.  results: for 7 out of 9 sample stars, a clear flux excess is detected at(sub)millimeter and/or centimeter wavelengths. the precise start of the excessdepends upon the star under consideration. the flux at wavelengths shorter thanabout 1 mm is most likely dominated by an optically thick chromosphere, wherean optically thick ionized wind is the main flux contributor at longerwavelengths.  conclusions: although the optical to mid-infrared spectrum of the studied k-and m-giants is well represented by a radiative equilibrium atmospheric model,the presence of a chromosphere and/or ionized stellar wind at higher altitudesdominates the spectrum in the (sub)millimeter and centimeter wavelength ranges.the presence of a flux excess also has implications on the role of these starsas fiducial spectrophotometric calibrators in the (sub)millimeter andcentimeter wavelength range.

1001.2098	870 um observations of evolved stars with laboca	during their evolution, asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars experience a highmass-loss which leads to the formation of a circumstellar envelope (cse) ofdust and gas. the mass-loss process is the most important phenomenon duringthis evolutionary stage. in order to understand it, it is important to studythe physical parameters of the cse. the emission of the cse in the(sub)millimetre range is dominated by the dust continuum. this means that(sub)millimetre observations are a key tool in tracing the dust and improvingour knowledge of the mass-loss process.  in this paper we analyse new sub-millimetre observations of 9 evolved starsin order to constrain the cse physical parameters. the data were taken by thenew apex bolometer laboca.  the fluxes at 870 um are derived and the extended emission is investigated.  we compute the spectral energy distribution (seds) using a 1d radiativetransfer code, dusty which we compared to literature data. grain properties arecalculated using both spherical grains distribution and a continuousdistribution of ellipsoids (cde) and a comparison between the two is drawn.synthetic surface brightness maps have been derived from the modelling and werecompared to the laboca brightness maps.  we detected the presence of extended emission around four stars. physicalparameters of the circumstellar envelope are derived from sed modelling, suchas the dust chemical composition, the dust condensation temperature and thetotal mass of the envelope. it proves difficult however to fit the sed and theintensity profile simultaneously.

1003.3100	determining the forsterite abundance of the dust around asymptotic giant  branch stars	aims. we present a diagnostic tool to determine the abundance of thecrystalline silicate forsterite in agb stars surrounded by a thick shell ofsilicate dust. using six infrared spectra of high mass-loss oxygen rich agbstars we obtain the forsterite abundance of their dust shells.  methods. we use a monte carlo radiative transfer code to calculate infraredspectra of dust enshrouded agb stars. we vary the dust composition, mass-lossrate and outer radius. we focus on the strength of the 11.3 and the 33.6 \mu mforsterite bands, that probe the most recent (11.3 \mu m) and older (33.6 \mum) mass-loss history of the star. simple diagnostic diagrams are derived,allowing direct comparison to observed band strengths.  results. our analysis shows that the 11.3 \mu m forsterite band is a robustindicator for the forsterite abundance of the current mass-loss period for agbstars with an optically thick dust shell. the 33.6 \mu m band of forsterite issensitive to changes in the density and the geometry of the emitting dustshell, and so a less robust indicator. applying our method to six highmass-loss rate agb stars shows that agb stars can have forsterite abundances of12% by mass and higher, which is more than the previously found maximumabundance of 5%.

1004.1967	when an old star smolders: on the detection of hydrocarbon emission from  s-type agb stars	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) produce characteristic infraredemission bands that have been observed in a wide range of astrophysicalenvironments, where carbonaceous material is subjected to ultraviolet (uv)radiation. although pahs are expected to form in carbon-rich agb stars, theyhave up to now only been observed in binary systems where a hot companionprovides a hard radiation field. in this letter, we present low-resolutioninfrared spectra of four s-type agb stars, selected from a sample of 90 s-typeagb stars observed with the infrared spectrograph aboard the spitzer satellite.the spectra of these four stars show the typical infrared features of pahmolecules. we confirm the correlation between the temperature of the centralstar and the centroid wavelength of the 7.9 {\mu}m feature, present in a widevariety of stars spanning a temperature range from 3 000 to 12 000 k. three offour sources presented in this paper extend this relation towards lowertemperatures. we argue that the mixture of hydrocarbons we see in these s-starshas a rich aliphatic component. the fourth star, bz cma, deviates from thiscorrelation. based on the similarity with the evolved binary tu tau, we predictthat bz cma has a hot companion as well.

1005.1433	herschel pacs and spire imaging of cw leo	herschel pacs and spire images have been obtained over a 30'x30' area aroundthe well-known carbon star cw leo (irc +10 216). an extended structure is foundin an incomplete arc of ~22' diameter, which is cospatial with the terminationshock due to interaction with the interstellar medium (ism) as defined by sahai&amp; chronopoulos from ultraviolet galex images. fluxes are derived in the 70,160, 250, 350, and 550 um bands in the region where the interaction with theism takes place, and this can be fitted with a modified black body with atemperature of 25+-3 k. using the published proper motion and radial velocityfor the star, we derive a heliocentric space motion of 25.1 km/s. using thepacs and spire data and the analytical formula of the bow shock structure, weinfer a de-projected standoff distance of the bow shock of r0 =(8.0+-0.3)x10^17 cm. we also derive a relative velocity of the star withrespect to the ism of (106.6+-8.7)/sqrt(n_ism) km/s, where n_ism is the numberdensity of the local ism.

1005.1502	herschel images of ngc 6720: h2 formation on dust grains	herschel pacs and spire images have been obtained of ngc 6720 (the ringnebula). this is an evolved planetary nebula with a central star that iscurrently on the cooling track, due to which the outer parts of the nebula arerecombining. from the pacs and spire images we conclude that there is astriking resemblance between the dust distribution and the h2 emission, whichappears to be observational evidence that h2 forms on grain surfaces. we havedeveloped a photoionization model of the nebula with the cloudy code which weused to determine the physical conditions of the dust and investigate possibleformation scenarios for the h2. we conclude that the most plausible scenario isthat the h2 resides in high density knots which were formed after therecombination of the gas started when the central star entered the coolingtrack. hydrodynamical instabilities due to the unusually low temperature of therecombining gas are proposed as a mechanism for forming the knots. h2 formationin the knots is expected to be substantial after the central star underwent astrong drop in luminosity about one to two thousand years ago, and may still beongoing at this moment, depending on the density of the knots and theproperties of the grains in the knots.

1005.2618	from filamentary clouds to prestellar cores to the stellar imf: initial  highlights from the herschel gould belt survey	we summarize the first results from the gould belt survey, obtained towardthe aquila rift and polaris flare regions during the 'science demonstrationphase' of herschel. our 70-500 micron images taken in parallel mode with thespire and pacs cameras reveal a wealth of filamentary structure, as well asnumerous dense cores embedded in the filaments. between ~ 350 and 500prestellar cores and ~ 45-60 class 0 protostars can be identified in the aquilafield, while ~ unbound starless cores and no protostars are observed in thepolaris field. the prestellar core mass function (cmf) derived for the aquilaregion bears a strong resemblance to the stellar initial mass function (imf),already confirming the close connection between the cmf and the imf with muchbetter statistics than earlier studies. comparing and contrasting our herschelresults in aquila and polaris, we propose an observationally-driven scenariofor core formation according to which complex networks of long, thin filamentsform first within molecular clouds, and then the densest filaments fragmentinto a number of prestellar cores via gravitational instability.

1005.3915	the {\beta} pictoris disk imaged by herschel pacs and spire	we obtained herschel pacs and spire images of the thermal emission of thedebris disk around the a5v star {\beta} pic. the disk is well resolved in thepacs filters at 70, 100, and 160 {\mu}m. the surface brightness profilesbetween 70 and 160 {\mu}m show no significant asymmetries along the disk, andare compatible with 90% of the emission between 70 and 160 {\mu}m originatingin a region closer than 200 au to the star. although only marginally resolvingthe debris disk, the maps obtained in the spire 250 - 500 {\mu}m filtersprovide full-disk photometry, completing the sed over a few octaves inwavelength that had been previously inaccessible. the small far-infraredspectral index ({\beta} = 0.34) indicates that the grain size distribution inthe inner disk (&lt;200au) is inconsistent with a local collisional equilibrium.the size distribution is either modified by non-equilibrium effects, orexhibits a wavy pattern, caused by an under-abundance of impactors which havebeen removed by radiation pressure.

1005.4675	silicon in the dust formation zone of irc +10216 as observed with pacs  and spire on board herschel	the interstellar medium is enriched primarily by matter ejected from evolvedlow and intermediate mass stars. the outflows from these stars create acircumstellar envelope in which a rich gas-phase and dust-nucleation chemistrytakes place. we observed the nearest carbon-rich evolved star, irc+10216, usingthe pacs (55-210 {\mu}m) and spire (194-672 {\mu}m) spectrometers on boardherschel. we find several tens of lines from sis and sio, including lines fromthe v=1 vibrational level. for sis these transitions range up to j=124-123,corresponding to energies around 6700k, while the highest detectable transitionis j=90-89 for sio, which corresponds to an energy around 8400k. both speciestrace the dust formation zone of irc+10216, and the broad energy rangesinvolved in their detected transitions permit us to derive the physicalproperties of the gas and the particular zone in which each species has beenformed. this allows us to check the accuracy of chemical thermodynamicalequilibrium models and the suggested depletion of sis and sio due to accretiononto dust grains.

1104.2316	warm water vapour in the sooty outflow from a luminous carbon star	in 2001, the discovery of circumstellar water vapour around the ageing carbonstar irc+10216 was announced. this detection challenged the currentunderstanding of chemistry in old stars, since water vapour was predicted to beabsent in carbon-rich stars. several explanations for the occurrence of watervapour were postulated, including the vaporization of icy bodies (comets ordwarf planets) in orbit around the star, grain surface reactions, andphotochemistry in the outer circumstellar envelope. however, the only waterline detected so far from one carbon-rich evolved star can not discriminate, byitself, between the different mechanisms proposed. here we report on thedetection by the herschel satellite of dozens of water vapour lines in thefar-infrared and sub-millimetre spectrum of irc+10216, including somehigh-excitation lines with energies corresponding to ~1000 k. the emission ofthese high-excitation water lines can only be explained if water vapour ispresent in the warm inner region of the envelope. a plausible explanation forthe formation of warm water vapour appears to be the penetration of ultraviolet(uv) photons deep into a clumpy circumstellar envelope. this mechanism triggersalso the formation of other molecules such as ammonia, whose observedabundances are much higher than hitherto predicted.

1106.3645	x her and tx psc: two cases of ism interaction with stellar winds  observed by herschel	the asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars x her and tx psc have been imaged at70 and 160 microns with the pacs instrument onboard the herschel satellite, aspart of the large mess (mass loss of evolved stars) guaranteed time keyprogram. the images reveal an axisymmetric extended structure with its axisoriented along the space motion of the stars. this extended structure is verylikely to be shaped by the interaction of the wind ejected by the agb star withthe surrounding interstellar medium (ism). as predicted by numericalsimulations, the detailed structure of the wind-ism interface depends upon therelative velocity between star+wind and the ism, which is large for these twostars (108 and 55 km/s for x her and tx psc, respectively). in both cases,there is a compact blob upstream whose origin is not fully elucidated, but thatcould be the signature of some instability in the wind-ism shock. deconvolvedimages of x her and tx psc reveal several discrete structures along theoutermost filaments, which could be kelvin-helmholtz vortices. finally, tx pscis surrounded by an almost circular ring (the signature of the terminationshock?) that contrasts with the outer, more structured filaments. a similarinner circular structure seems to be present in x her as well, albeit lessclearly.

1110.5486	a far-infrared survey of bow shocks and detached shells around agb stars  and red supergiants	far-infrared herschel/pacs images at 70 and 160 micron of a sample of 78galactic evolved stars are used to study the (dust) emission structures,originating from stellar wind-ism interaction. in addition, two-fluidhydrodynamical simulations of the coupled gas and dust in wind-ism interactionsare used to compare with the observations.  four distinct classes of wind-ism interaction (i.e. "fermata", "eyes","irregular", and "rings") are identified and basic parameters affecting themorphology are discussed. we detect bow shocks for ~40% of the sample anddetached rings for ~20%. de-projected stand-off distances (r_0) -- defined asthe distance between the central star and the nearest point of the interactionregion -- of the detected bow shocks ("fermata" and "eyes") are derived fromthe pacs images and compared to previous results, model predictions and thesimulations. all observed bow shocks have stand-off distances smaller than 1pc. observed and theoretical stand-off distances are used together toindependently derive the local ism density.  both theoretical (analytical) models and hydrodynamical simulations givestand-off distances for adopted stellar properties that are in good agreementwith the measured de-projected stand-off distance of wind-ism bow shocks. thepossible detection of a bow shock -- for the distance limited sample -- appearsto be governed by its physical size as set roughly by the stand-off distance.in particular the star's peculiar space velocity and the density of the ismappear decisive in detecting emission from bow shocks or detached rings.tentatively, the "eyes" class objects are associated to (visual) binaries,while the "rings" generally appear not to occur for m-type stars, only for c ors-type objects that have experienced a thermal pulse.

1112.3348	the herschel exploitation of local galaxy andromeda (helga). i: global  far-infrared and sub-mm morphology	we have obtained herschel images at five wavelengths from 100 to 500 micronof a ~5.5x2.5 degree area centred on the local galaxy m31 (andromeda), ournearest neighbour spiral galaxy, as part of the herschel guaranteed timeproject "helga". the main goals of helga are to study the characteristics ofthe extended dust emission, focusing on larger scales than studied in previousobservations of andromeda at an increased spatial resolution, and the obscuredstar formation. in this paper we present data reduction and herschel maps, andprovide a description of the far-infrared morphology, comparing it withfeatures seen at other wavelengths. we use high--resolution maps of the atomichydrogen, fully covering our fields, to identify dust emission features thatcan be associated to m31 with confidence, distinguishing them from emissioncoming from the foreground galactic cirrus. thanks to the very large extensionof our maps we detect, for the first time at far-infrared wavelengths, threearc-like structures extending out to ~21, ~26 and ~31 kpc respectively, in thesouth-western part of m31. the presence of these features, hosting ~2.2e6 msolof dust, is safely confirmed by their detection in hi maps. overall, weestimate a total dust mass of ~5.8e7 msol, about 78% of which is contained inthe two main ring-like structures at 10 and 15 kpc, at an average temperatureof 16.5 k. we find that the gas-to-dust ratio declines exponentially as afunction of the galacto-centric distance, in agreement with the knownmetallicity gradient, with values ranging from 66 in the nucleus to ~275 in theoutermost region.

1202.2290	the spitzer spectroscopic survey of s-type stars	s-type agb stars are thought to be in the transitional phase between m-typeand c-type agb stars. because of their peculiar chemical composition, one mayexpect a strong influence of the stellar c/o ratio on the molecular chemistryand the mineralogy of the circumstellar dust. in this paper, we present a largesample of 87 intrinsic galactic s-type agb stars, observed at infraredwavelengths with the spitzer space telescope, and supplemented withground-based optical data. on the one hand, we derive the stellar parametersfrom the optical spectroscopy and photometry, using a grid of modelatmospheres. on the other, we decompose the infrared spectra to quantify theflux-contributions from the different dust species. finally, we compare theindependently determined stellar parameters and dust properties. for the starswithout significant dust emission, we detect a strict relation between thepresence of sis absorption in the spitzer spectra and the c/o ratio of thestellar atmosphere. these absorption bands can thus be used as an additionaldiagnostic for the c/o ratio. for stars with significant dust emission, wedefine three groups, based on the relative contribution of certain dust speciesto the infrared flux. we find a strong link between group-membership and c/oratio. we show that these groups can be explained by assuming that thedust-condensation can be cut short before silicates are produced, while theremaining free atoms and molecules can then form the observed magnesiumsulfides or the carriers of the unidentified 13 and 20 micron features.finally, we present the detection of emission features attributed to moleculesand dust characteristic to c-type stars, such as molecular sis, hydrocarbonsand magnesium sulfide grains. we show that we often detect magnesium sulfidestogether with molecular sis and we propose that it is formed by a reaction ofsis molecules with mg.

1204.5037	herschel images of fomalhaut. an extrasolar kuiper belt at the height of  its dynamical activity	fomalhaut is a young, nearby star that is suspected to harbor an infantplanetary system, interspersed with one or more belts of dusty debris. wepresent far-infrared images obtained with the herschel space observatory withan angular resolution between 5.7 and 36.7 arcsec at wavelengths between 70 and500 micrometer. the images show the main debris belt in great detail. even athigh spatial resolution, the belt appears smooth. the region in between thebelt and the central star is not devoid of material; thermal emission isobserved here as well. also at the location of the star, excess emission isdetected.  we use a dynamical model together with radiative-transfer tools to derive theparameters of the debris disk. we include detailed models of the interaction ofthe dust grains with radiation, for both the radiation pressure and thetemperature determination. comparing these models to the spatially resolvedtemperature information contained in the images allows us to place strongconstraints on the presence of grains that will be blown out of the system byradiation pressure. we use this to derive the dynamical parameters of thesystem.  the appearance of the belt points towards a remarkably active system in whichdust grains are produced at a very high rate by a collisional cascade in anarrow region filled with dynamically excited planetesimals. dust particleswith sizes below the blow-out size are abundantly present. the equivalent of2000 one-km-sized comets are destroyed every day, out of a cometary reservoiramounting to 110 earth masses. from comparison of their scattering and thermalproperties, we find evidence that the dust grains are fluffy aggregates, whichindicates a cometary origin. the excess emission at the location of the starmay be produced by hot dust with a range of temperatures, but may also be dueto gaseous free-free emission from a stellar wind.

1206.2451	discovery of a tio emission band in the infrared spectrum of the s star  np aurigae	we report on the discovery of an infrared emission band in the spitzerspectrum of the s-type agb star np aurigae that is caused by tio molecules inthe circumstellar environment. we modelled the observed emission to derive thetemperature of the tio molecules (\approx 600 k), an upper limit on the columndensity (\approx 10^17.25 cm^{-2}) and a lower limit on the spatial extent ofthe layer that contains these molecules. (\approx 4.6 stellar radii). this isthe first time that this tio emission band is observed. a search for similaremission features in the sample of s-type stars yielded two additionalcandidates. however, owing to the additional dust emission, the identificationis less stringent. by comparing the stellar characteristics of np aur to thoseof the other stars in our sample, we find that all stars with tio emission showlarge-amplitude pulsations, s-process enrichment, and a low c/o ratio. thesecharacteristics might be necessary requirements for a star to show tio inemission, but they are not sufficient.

1206.5982	an independent distance estimate to cw leo	cw leo has been observed six times between october 2009 and june 2012 withthe spire instrument on board the herschel satellite. variability has beendetected in the flux emitted by the central star with a period of 639 \pm 4days, in good agreement with determinations in the literature. variability isalso detected in the bow shock around cw leo that had previously been detectedin the ultraviolet and herschel pacs/spire data. although difficult to provedirectly, our working hypothesis is that this variability is directly relatedto that of the central star. in this case, fitting a sine curve with the periodfixed to 639 days results in a time-lag in the variability between bow shockand the central star of 402 \pm 37 days. the orientation of the bow shockrelative to the plane of the sky is unknown (but see below). for an inclinationangle of zero degrees, the observed time-lag translates into a distance to cwleo of 130 \pm 13 pc, and for non-zero inclination angles the distance issmaller. fitting the shape of the bow shock with an analytical model (wilkin1996), the effect of the inclination angle on the distance may be estimated.making the additional assumption that the relative peculiar velocity betweenthe interstellar medium (ism) and cw leo is determined entirely by the starspace velocity with respect to the local standard of rest (i.e. a stationaryism), the inclination angle is found to be (-33.3 \pm 0.8) degrees based on theobserved proper motion and radial velocity. using the wilkin model, our currentbest estimate of the distance to cw leo is 123 \pm 14 pc. for a distance of 123pc, we derive a mean luminosity of 7790 \pm 150 lsol (internal error).

1211.2626	comet-like mineralogy of olivine crystals in an extrasolar proto-kuiper  belt	some planetary systems harbour debris disks containing planetesimals such asasteroids and comets. collisions between such bodies produce small dustparticles, the spectral features of which reveal their composition and, hence,that of their parent bodies. a measurement of the composition of olivinecrystals has been done for the protoplanetary disk hd100546 and for olivinecrystals in the warm inner parts of planetary systems. the latter compares wellwith the iron-rich olivine in asteroids (x&lt;0.29). in the cold outskirts of thebeta pictoris system, an analogue to the young solar system, olivine crystalswere detected but their composition remained undetermined, leaving unknown howthe composition of the bulk of solar system cometary olivine grains compareswith that of extrasolar comets. here we report the detection of the69-micrometre-wavelength band of olivine crystals in the spectrum of betapictoris. because the disk is optically thin, we can associate the crystalswith an extrasolar proto-kuiper belt a distance of 15-45 astronomical unitsfrom the star (one astronomical unit is the sun-earth distance), determinetheir magnesium-rich composition (x=0.01+/-0.001) and show that they make up3.6+/-1.0 per cent of the total dust mass. these values are strikingly similarto those for the dust emitted by the most primitive comets in the solar system,even though beta pictoris is more massive and more luminous and has a differentplanetary system architecture.

1212.4870	the enigmatic nature of the circumstellar envelope and bow shock  surrounding betelgeuse as revealed by herschel. i. evidence of clumps,  multiple arcs, and a linear bar-like structure	context. the interaction between stellar winds and the interstellar medium(ism) can create complex bow shocks. the photometers on board the herschelspace observatory are ideally suited to studying the morphologies of these bowshocks. aims. we aim to study the circumstellar environment and wind-isminteraction of the nearest red supergiant, betelgeuse. methods. herschel pacsimages at 70, 100, and 160 micron and spire images at 250, 350, and 500 micronwere obtained by scanning the region around betelgeuse. these data werecomplemented with ultraviolet galex data, near-infrared wise data, and radio 21cm galfa-hi data. the observational properties of the bow shock structure werededuced from the data and compared with hydrodynamical simulations. results.the infrared herschel images of the environment around betelgeuse arespectacular, showing the occurrence of multiple arcs at 6-7 arcmin from thecentral target and the presence of a linear bar at 9 arcmin. remarkably, nolarge-scale instabilities are seen in the outer arcs and linear bar. the dusttemperature in the outer arcs varies between 40 and 140 k, with the linear barhaving the same colour temperature as the arcs. the inner envelope shows clearevidence of a non-homogeneous clumpy structure (beyond 15 arcsec), probablyrelated to the giant convection cells of the outer atmosphere. thenon-homogeneous distribution of the material even persists until the collisionwith the ism. a strong variation in brightness of the inner clumps at a radiusof 2 arcmin suggests a drastic change in mean gas and dust density some 32 000yr ago. using hydrodynamical simulations, we try to explain the observedmorphology of the bow shock around betelgeuse. conclusions: [abbreviated]

1305.3130	herschel observations of edge-on spirals (heroes). i: far-infrared  morphology and dust mass determination	context. edge-on spiral galaxies with prominent dust lanes provide us with anexcellent opportunity to study the distribution and properties of the dustwithin them. the heroes project was set up to observe a sample of seven largeedge-on galaxies across various wavelengths for this investigation.  aims. within this first paper, we present the herschel observations andperform a qualitative and quantitative analysis on them, and we derive someglobal properties of the far infrared and submillimetre emission.  methods. we determine horizontal and vertical profiles from the herschelobservations of the galaxies in the sample and describe the morphology.modified black-body fits to the global fluxes, measured using aperturephotometry, result in dust temperatures and dust masses. the latter values arecompared to those that are derived from radiative transfer models taken fromthe literature.  results. on the whole, our herschel flux measurements agree well witharchival values. we find that the exponential horizontal dust distributionmodel often used in the literature generally provides a good description of theobserved horizontal profiles. three out of the seven galaxies show signaturesof extended vertical emission at 100 and 160 {\mu}m at the 5{\sigma} level, butin two of these it is probably due to deviations from an exactly edge-onorientation. only for ngc 4013, a galaxy in which vertically extended dust hasalready been detected in optical images, we can detect vertically extendeddust, and the derived scaleheight agrees with the value estimated throughradiative transfer modelling. our analysis hints at a correlation between thedust scaleheight and its degree of clumpiness, which we infer from thedifference between the dust masses as calculated from modelling of optical dataand from fitting the spectral energy distribution of herschel datapoints.

1310.2947	herschel spire and pacs observations of the red supergiant vy cma:  analysis of the molecular line spectra	we present an analysis of the far-infrared and submillimetre molecularemission line spectrum of the luminous m-supergiant vy cma, observed with thespire and pacs spectrometers aboard the herschel space observatory. over 260emission lines were detected in the 190-650-micron spire fts spectra, withone-third of the observed lines being attributable to h2o. other detectedspecies include co, 13co, h2^18o, sio, hcn, so, so2, cs, h2s, and nh3. ourmodel fits to the observed 12co and 13co line intensities yield a 12c/13c ratioof 5.6+-1.8, consistent with measurements of this ratio for other msupergiants, but significantly lower than previously estimated for vy cma fromobservations of lower-j lines. the spectral line energy distribution for twentysio rotational lines shows two temperature components: a hot component at 1000k, which we attribute to the stellar atmosphere and inner wind, plus a cooler~200 k component, which we attribute to an origin in the outer circumstellarenvelope. we fit the line fluxes of 12co, 13co, h2o and sio, using the smmolnon-lte line transfer code, with a mass-loss rate of 1.85x10^-4 msun yr^-1between 9 r* and 350 r*. to fit the observed line fluxes of 12co, 13co, h2o andsio with smmol non-lte line radiative transfer code, along with a mass-lossrate of 1.85x10^-4 msun yr^-1.  to fit the high rotational lines of co and h2o, the model required a ratherflat temperature distribution inside the dust condensation radius, attributedto the high h2o opacity. beyond the dust condensation radius the gastemperature is fitted best by an r^-0.5 radial dependence, consistent with thecoolant lines becoming optically thin. our h2o emission line fits areconsistent with an ortho:para ratio of 3 in the outflow.

1311.6908	the problematically short superwind of oh/ir stars - probing the outflow  with the 69 {\mu}m spectral band of forsterite	spectra of oh/ir stars show prominent spectral bands of crystalline olivine(mg$_{(2-2x)}$fe$_{(2x)}$sio$_{4}$). to learn more about the timescale of theoutflows of oh/ir stars, we study the spectral band of crystalline olivine at69 {\mu}m. the 69 {\mu}m band is of interest because its width and peakwavelength position are sensitive to the grain temperature and to the exactcomposition of the crystalline olivine. with herschel/pacs, we observed the 69{\mu}m band in the outflow of 14 oh/ir stars. by comparing the crystallineolivine features of our sample with those of model spectra, we determined thesize of the outflow and its crystalline olivine abundance.  the temperature indicated by the observed 69 {\mu}m bands can only bereproduced by models with a geometrically compact superwind($r_{\rm{sw}}\lesssim$ 2500 au = 1400 r$_{*}$).this means that the superwindstarted less than 1200 years ago (assuming an outflow velocity of 10 km/s). thesmall amount of mass lost in one superwind and the high progenitor mass of theoh/ir stars introduce a mass loss and thus evolutionary problem for theseobjects, which has not yet been understood.

1403.2892	the wind of w hya as seen by herschel - i. the co envelope	asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars lose their envelopes by means of astellar wind whose driving mechanism is not understood well. characterizing thecomposition and thermal and dynamical structure of the outflow providesconstraints that are essential for understanding agb evolution, including therate of mass loss and isotopic ratios.  we modeled the co emission from the wind of the low mass-loss rateoxygen-rich agb star w hya using data obtained by the hifi, pacs, and spireinstruments onboard the herschel space observatory and ground-based telescopes.$^{12}$co and $^{13}$co lines are used to constrain the intrinsic$^{12}$c/$^{13}$c ratio from resolved hifi lines.  the acceleration of the outflow up to about 5.5 km/s is quite slow and can berepresented by a beta-type velocity law with index 5. beyond this point,acceleration up the terminal velocity of 7 km/s is faster. using the j=10-9,9-8, and 6-5 transitions, we find an intrinsic $^{12}$c/$^{13}$c ratio of$18\pm10$ for w hya, where the error bar is mostly due to uncertainties in the$^{12}$co abundance and the stellar flux around 4.6 $\mu$m. to match thelow-excitation co lines, these molecules need to be photo-dissociated at about500 stellar radii. the radial dust emission intensity profile measured by pacsimages at 70 $\mu$m shows substantially stronger emission than our modelpredicts beyond 20 arcsec.  the initial slow acceleration of the wind implies inefficient wind driving inthe lower part of the envelope. the final injection of momentum in the windmight be the result of an increase in the opacity thanks to the latecondensation of dust species. the derived intrinsic isotopologue ratio for whya is consistent with values set by the first dredge-up and suggestive of aninitial mass of 2 m$_\odot$ or more. however, the uncertainty in themain-sequence mass derived based on this isotopologic ratio is large.

1403.4272	the herschel exploitation of local galaxy andromeda (helga): iv. dust  scaling relations at sub-kpc resolution	the imprints of dust-starlight interactions are visible in scaling relationsbetween stellar characteristics, star formation parameters and dust properties.we aim to examine dust scaling relations on a sub-kpc resolution in theandromeda galaxy (m31) by comparing the properties on a local and global scaleto other galaxies of the local universe. new herschel observations are combinedwith available data from galex, sdss, wise and spitzer to construct a datasetcovering uv to submm wavelengths. we work at the resolution of the spire $500\;\mu$m beam, with pixels corresponding to physical regions of 137 x 608 pc inthe galaxy's disk. a panchromatic spectral energy distribution was modelled foreach pixel and several dust scaling relations are investigated. we find, on asub-kpc scale, strong correlations between $m_d/m_\star$ and nuv-r, and between$m_d/m_\star$ and $\mu_\star$ (the stellar mass surface density). strikingsimilarities with corresponding relations based on integrated galaxies arefound. we decompose m31 in four macro-regions based on their fir morphology;the bulge, inner disk, star forming ring and the outer disk. all regionsclosely follow the galaxy-scale average trends. the specific star formationcharacteristics we derive for these macro-regions give strong hints of aninside-out formation of the bulge-disk geometry, as well as an internaldownsizing process. however, within each macro-region, a great diversity inindividual micro-regions is found. furthermore, we confirm that dust in thebulge of m31 is heated only by the old stellar populations. in general, thelocal dust scaling relations indicate that the dust content in m31 ismaintained by a subtle interplay of past and present star formation. thesimilarity with galaxy-based relations strongly suggests that they are in situcorrelations, with underlying processes that must be local in nature.

1403.6335	herschel/pacs observations of the 69 $\mu m$ band of crystalline olivine  around evolved stars	we present 48 herschel/pacs spectra of evolved stars in the wavelength rangeof 67-72 $\mu$m. this wavelength range covers the 69 $\mu$m band of crystallineolivine ($\text{mg}_{2-2x}\text{fe}_{(2x)}\text{sio}_{4}$). the width andwavelength position of this band are sensitive to the temperature andcomposition of the crystalline olivine. our sample covers a wide range ofobjects: from high mass-loss rate agb stars (oh/ir stars, $\dot m \ge 10^{-5}$m$_\odot$/yr), through post-agb stars with and without circumbinary disks, toplanetary nebulae and even a few massive evolved stars. the goal of this studyis to exploit the spectral properties of the 69 $\mu$m band to determine thecomposition and temperature of the crystalline olivine. since the objects covera range of evolutionary phases, we study the physical and chemical propertiesin this range of physical environments. we fit the 69 $\mu$m band and use itswidth and position to probe the composition and temperature of the crystallineolivine. for 27 sources in the sample, we detected the 69 $\mu$m band ofcrystalline olivine ($\text{mg}_{(2-2x)}\text{fe}_{(2x)}\text{sio}_{4}$). the69 $\mu$m band shows that all the sources produce pure forsterite grainscontaining no iron in their lattice structure. the temperature of thecrystalline olivine as indicated by the 69 $\mu$m band, shows that on averagethe temperature of the crystalline olivine is highest in the group of oh/irstars and the post-agb stars with confirmed keplerian disks. the temperature islower for the other post-agb stars and lowest for the planetary nebulae. acouple of the detected 69 $\mu$m bands are broader than those of puremagnesium-rich crystalline olivine, which we show can be due to a temperaturegradient in the circumstellar environment of these stars. continued...

1405.2769	dusty shells surrounding the carbon variables s scuti and rt capricorni	for the mass-loss of evolved stars (mess) programme, the unprecedentedspatial resolution of the pacs photometer on board the herschel spaceobservatory was employed to map the dusty environments of asymptotic giantbranch (agb) and red supergiant (rsg) stars. among the morphologicallyheterogeneous sample, a small fraction of targets is enclosed by sphericallysymmetric detached envelopes. based on observations in the 70 {\mu}m and 160{\mu}m wavelength bands, we investigated the surroundings of the two carbonsemiregular variables s sct and rt cap, which both show evidence for a historyof highly variable mass-loss. s sct exhibits a bright, spherically symmetricdetached shell, 138" in diameter and co-spatial with an already known costructure. moreover, weak emission is detected at the outskirts, where themorphology seems indicative of a mild shaping by interaction of the wind withthe interstellar medium, which is also supported by the stellar space motion.two shells are found around rt cap that were not known so far in either dustemission or from molecular line observations. the inner shell with a diameterof 188" shows an almost immaculate spherical symmetry, while the outer ~5'structure is more irregularly shaped. mod, a modification of the dustyradiative transfer code, was used to model the detached shells. dusttemperatures, shell dust masses, and mass-loss rates are derived for bothtargets.

1409.0396	the wind of w hya as seen by herschel. ii. the molecular envelope of w  hya	the evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars on the asymptotic giantbranch (agb) is mainly controlled by the rate at which these stars lose mass ina stellar wind. understanding the driving mechanism and strength of the stellarwinds of agb stars and the processes enriching their surfaces with products ofnucleosynthesis are paramount to constraining agb evolution and predicting thechemical evolution of galaxies. in a previous paper we have constrained thestructure of the outflowing envelope of w hya using spectral lines of the$^{12}$co molecule. here we broaden this study by modelling an extensive set ofh$_{2}$o and $^{28}$sio lines observed by the three instruments on boardherschel using a state-of-the-art molecular excitation and radiative transfercode. the oxygen isotopic ratios and the $^{28}$sio abundance profile can beconnected to the initial stellar mass and to crucial aspects of dust formationat the base of the stellar wind, respectively. the modelling of h$_{2}$o and$^{28}$sio confirms the properties of the envelope model of w hya derived from$^{12}$co lines. we find an h$_2$o ortho-to-para ratio of2.5\,$^{+2.5}_{-1.0}$, consistent with what is expected for an agb wind. theo$^{16}$/o$^{17}$ ratio indicates that w hya has an initial mass of about 1.5m$_\odot$. although the ortho- and para-h$_{2}$o lines observed by hifi appearto trace gas of slightly different physical properties, a turbulence velocityof $0.7\pm0.1$ km s$^{-1}$ fits the hifi lines of both spin isomers and thoseof $^{28}$sio well. the ortho- and para-h$_2^{16}$o and $^{28}$sio abundancesrelative to h$_{2}$ are $(6^{+3}_{-2}) \times 10^{-4}$, $(3^{+2}_{-1}) \times10^{-4}$, and $(3.3\pm 0.8)\times 10^{-5}$, respectively. assuming a solarsilicon-to-carbon ratio, the $^{28}$sio line emission model is consistent withabout one-third of the silicon atoms being locked up in dust particles.

1505.01425	understanding agb evolution in galactic bulge stars from high-resolution  infrared spectroscopy	an analysis of high-resolution near-infrared spectra of a sample of 45asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars towards the galactic bulge is presented.the sample consists of two subsamples, a larger one in the inner andintermediate bulge, and a smaller one in the outer bulge. the data are analysedwith the help of hydrostatic model atmospheres and spectral synthesis. wederive the radial velocity of all stars, and the atmospheric chemical mix([fe/h], c/o, $^{12}$c/$^{13}$c, al, si, ti, and y) where possible. our abilityto model the spectra is mainly limited by the (in)completeness of atomic andmolecular line lists, at least for temperatures down to $t_{\rmeff}\approx3100$ k. we find that the subsample in the inner and intermediatebulge is quite homogeneous, with a slightly sub-solar mean metallicity and onlyfew stars with super-solar metallicity, in agreement with previous studies ofnon-variable m-type giants in the bulge. all sample stars are oxygen-rich,c/o$&lt;$1.0. the c/o and carbon isotopic ratios suggest that third dredge-up(3dup) is absent among the sample stars, except for two stars in the outerbulge that are known to contain technetium. these stars are also moremetal-poor than the stars in the intermediate or inner bulge. current stellarmasses are determined from linear pulsation models. the masses, metallicitiesand 3dup behaviour are compared to agb evolutionary models. we conclude thatthese models are partly in conflict with our observations. furthermore, weconclude that the stars in the inner and intermediate bulge belong to a moremetal-rich population that follows bar-like kinematics, whereas the stars inthe outer bulge belong to the metal-poor, spheroidal bulge population.

astro-ph;0010558	mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy of the enigmatic cocoon stars in  the quintuplet cluster	in an attempt to determine the nature of the enigmatic cocoon stars in thequintuplet cluster, we have obtained mid-infrared imaging and spectrophotometryof the cluster, using the cam and sws instruments on iso, using spectrocam-10on the palomar 5m telescope, and nicmos on hst. the spectra show smoothcontinua with various dust and ice absorption features. these features are allconsistent with an interstellar origin, and there is no clear evidence for anycircumstellar contribution to these features. we find no spectral line orfeature that could elucidate the nature of these sources. detailed modeling ofthe silicate absorption features shows that they are best reproduced by the mucep profile, which is typical of the interstellar medium, with tau(sil) \sim2.9. the high spatial resolution mid-ir images show that three of the fivecocoon stars have spatially extended and asymmetric envelopes, with diametersof \sim 20,000 aus.  a reddening law similar to that of lutz (1999) but with silicate featuresbased on the mu cep profile and normalized to our value of tau(sil) is used toderedden the observed spectrophotometry. the dereddened energy distributionsare characterised by temperatures of 750-925 k, somewhat cooler than determinedfrom near ir data alone. models of optically thin and geometrically thick dustshells, as used by williams et al. (1987) for very dusty, late-type wc stars,reproduce the observed seds from 4 to 17 mic, and imply shell luminosities oflog(l/l(sun)) \sim 4.5-4.9 for the brightest four components. an analysis ofthe various suggestions proposed to explain the nature of the cocoon starsreveals serious problems with all the hypotheses, and the nature of thesesources remains an enigma.

astro-ph;0401458	65 cybele in the thermal infrared: multiple observations and  thermophysical analysis	we investigated the physical and thermal properties of 65 cybele}, one of thelargest main-belt asteroids. based on published and recently obtained thermalinfrared observations, including iso measurements, we derived throughthermophysical modelling (tpm) a size of 302x290x232 km (+/- 4 %) and angeometric visible albedo of 0.050+/-0.005. our model of a regolith coveredsurface with low thermal inertia and "default" roughness describes thewavelengths and phase angle dependent thermal aspects very well. before/afteropposition effect and beaming behaviour can be explained in that way. we founda constant emissivity of 0.9 at wavelengths up to about 100 micron and lowervalues towards the submillimetre range, indicating a grain size distributiondominated by 200 micron particle sizes. the spectroscopic analysis revealed anemissivity increase between 8.0 and 9.5 micron. we compared this emissivitybehaviour with the christiansen features of carbonaceous chondrite meteorites,but a conclusive identification was not possible. a comparison between thestandard thermal model (stm) and the applied tpm clearly demonstrates thelimitations and problems of the stm for the analysis of multi-epoch and-wavelengths observations. while the tpm produced a unique diameter/albedosolution, the calculated stm values varied by +/-30 % and showed clear trendswith wavelength and phase angle. cybele can be considered as a nice textbookcase for the thermophysical analysis of combined optical and thermal infraredobservations.

astro-ph;0506338	mira variables in the ogle bulge fields	(abridged) the 222000 i-band light curves of variable stars detected by theogle-ii survey in the direction of the galactic bulge have been fitted and havealso been correlated with the denis and 2mass databases. results are presentedfor 2691 objects with i-band semi-amplitude larger than 0.45 magnitude,corresponding to classical mira variables. the mira period distribution of 6fields at similar longitude but spanning latitudes from -1.2 to -5.8 degreesare statistically indistinguisable indicating similar populations with initialmasses of 1.5-2 \msol (corresponding to ages of 1-3 gyr). a field at similarlongitude at b = -0.05 from glass et al. (2001) does show a significantlydifferent period distribution, indicating the presence of a younger populationof 2.5-3 \msol and ages below 1 gyr. the k-band period-luminosity relation ispresented for the whole sample, and for sub-fields. the zero point depends ongalactic longitude. simulations are carried out to show that the observeddependence of the zero point with $l$, and the number of stars per field arenaturally explained using the model of disk and bulge stars of binney et al.(1997), for a viewing angle of 43 +/- 17 degrees. a comparison is made withsimilar objects in the magellanic clouds, studied in a previous paper. theslope of the pl-relation in the bulge and the mcs agree within the errorbars. adistance to the galactic centre between 8.6 and 9.0 kpc is derived (for anassumed dm of 18.50 to the lmc).

astro-ph;0602531	a spitzer mid-infrared spectral survey of mass-losing carbon stars in  the large magellanic cloud	we present a spitzer space telescope spectroscopic survey of mass-losingcarbon stars (and one oxygen-rich star) in the large magellanic cloud. thespectra cover the wavelength range 5--38 micron. they show varying combinationsof dust continuum, dust emission features (sic, mgs) and molecular absorptionbands (c2h2, hcn). a set of four narrow bands, dubbed the manchester system, isused to define the infrared continuum for dusty carbon stars. the relationsbetween the continuum colours and the strength of the dust and molecularfeatures are studied, and are compared to galactic stars of similar colours.the circumstellar 7-micron c2h2 band is found to be stronger at lowermetallicity, from a comparison of stars in the galaxy, the lmc and the smc.this is explained by dredge-up of carbon, causing higher c/o ratios at lowmetallicity (less o). a possible 10-micron absorption feature seen in ourspectra may be due to c3. this band has also been identified with interstellarsilicate or silicon-nitrite dust. the line-to-continuum ratio of thesic and mgsbands shows some indication of being lower at low metallicity. the mgs band isonly seen at dust temperatures below 600 k. we discuss the selection of carbonversus oxygen-rich agb stars using the j-k vs. k-a colours, and show that thesecolours are relatively insensitive to chemical type. metal-poor carbon starsform amorphous carbon dust from self-produced carbon. the formation efficiencyof oxygen-rich dust depends more strongly on metallicity. we suggest that inlower-metallicity environments, the dust input into the interstellar medium byagb stars is efficient but may be strongly biassed towards carbonaceous dust,as compare to the galaxy.

astro-ph;0606296	spitzer observations of acetylene bands in carbon-rich agb stars in the  large magellanic cloud	we investigate the molecular bands in carbon-rich agb stars in the largemagellanic cloud (lmc), using the infrared spectrograph (irs) on board thespitzer space telescope (sst) over the 5--38 micron range. all 26low-resolution spectra show acetylene (c2h2) bands at 7 and 14 micron. thehydrogen cyanide (hcn) bands at these wavelengths are very weak or absent. thisis consistent with low nitrogen abundances in the lmc. the observed 14 micronc2h2 band is reasonably reproduced by an excitation temperature of 500 k. thereis no clear dilution of the 14 micron band by circumstellar dust emission. this14 micron band originates from molecular gas in the circumstellar envelope inthese high mass-loss rate stars, in agreement with previous findings forgalactic stars. the c2h2,column density, derived from the 13.7 micron band,shows a gas mass-loss rate in the range 3x10^-6 to 5x10^{-5} msun yr-1. this iscomparable with the total mass-loss rate of these stars estimated from thespectral energy distribution. additionally, we compare the line strengths ofthe 13.7 micron c2h2 band of our lmc sample with those of a galactic sample.despite the low metallicity of the lmc, there is no clear difference in thec2h2 abundance among lmc and galactic stars. this reflects the effect of the3rd dredge-up bringing self-produced carbon to the surface, leading to high c/oratios at low metallicity.

astro-ph;0611071	spitzer spectroscopy of carbon stars in the small magellanic cloud	we present spitzer space telescope spectroscopic observations of 14carbon-rich agb stars in the small magellanic cloud. sic dust is seen in mostof the carbon-rich stars but it is weak compared to lmc stars. the sic featureis strong only for stars with significant dust excess, opposite to what isobserved for galactic stars. we argue that in the smc, sic forms at lowertemperature than graphite dust, whereas the reverse situation occurs in thegalaxy where sic condenses at higher temperatures and forms first. dust inputinto the interstellar medium by agb stars consists mostly of carbonaceous dust,with little sic or silicate dust. only the two coolest stars show a 30-micronband due to mgs dust. we suggest that this is due to the fact that, in the smc,mass-losing agb stars generally have low circumstellar (dust) optical depth andtherefore effective heating of dust by the central star does not allowtemperatures below the 650 k necessary for mgs to exist as a solid. gas phasec$_2$h$_2$ bands are stronger in the smc than in the lmc or galaxy. this isattributed to an increasing c/o ratio at low metallicity. we present acolour-colour diagram based on spitzer irac and mips colours to discriminatebetween o- and c-rich stars. we show that agb stars in the smc become carbonstars early in the thermal-pulsing agb evolution, and remain optically visiblefor $\sim 6 \times 10^5$ yr. for the lmc, this lifetime is $\sim 3 \times 10^5$yr. the superwind phase traced with spitzer lasts for $\sim 10^4$ yr. spitzerspectra of a k supergiant and a compact hii region are also given.

astro-ph;0702628	continuum emission around agb stars at 1.2 mm	it is generally acknowledged that the mass loss of asymptotic giant branch(agb) stars undergoes variations on different time scales. we constructedmodels for the dust envelopes for a sample of agb stars to assess whethermass-loss variations influence the spectral energy distribution (sed). toconstrain the variability, extra observations at millimetre wavelengths (1.2mm) were acquired. from the analysis of the dust models, two indications forthe presence of mass-loss variations can be found, being (1) a dust temperatureat the inner boundary of the dust envelope that is far below the dustcondensation temperature and (2) an altered density distribution with respectto rho(r) \propto r^{-2} resulting from a constant mass-loss rate. for 5 out ofthe 18 studied sources a two-component model of the envelope is required,consisting of an inner region with a constant mass-loss rate and an outerregion with a less steep density distribution. for one source an outer regionwith a steeper density distribution was found. moreover, in a search for timevariability in our data set at 1.2 mm, we found that wx psc shows a largerelative time variation of 34% which might partially be caused by variablemolecular line emission.

astro-ph;9812046	spectroscopy of the pistol and quintuplet stars in the galactic centre	we present initial results of a spectroscopic study of the pistol and of thecocoon stars in the quintuplet cluster. from isocam cvf 5--17 micronspectroscopy of the field of the pistol star, we have discovered a nearlyspherical shell of hot dust surrounding this star, a probable lbv. this shellis most prominent at lambda &gt; 12 micron, and its morphology clearly indicatesthat the shell is stellar ejecta. emission line images show that most of theionised material is along the northern border of this shell, and its morphologyis very similar to that of the pistol hii region (yusef-zadeh &amp; morris, 1987,aj, 94, 1178). we thus confirm that the ionisation comes from very hot stars inthe core of the quintuplet cluster. an sws spectrum of the pistol nebulaindicates a harder ionising radiation than could be provided by the pistolstar, but which is consistent with ionisation from wolf-rayet stars in thequintuplet cluster. the cvf 5--17 micron spectra of the cocoon stars in thequintuplet do not show any emission feature that could help elucidate theirnature.

astro-ph;9904010	isogal survey of baade's windows in the mid-infrared	the isogal mid-infrared survey of areas close to the galactic plane aims todetermine their stellar content and its possible bearing on the history of thegalaxy. the ngc6522 and sgr i baade's windows of low obscuration towards theinner parts of the bulge represent ideal places in which to calibrate andunderstand the isogal colour-magnitude diagrams.  the survey observations were made with the isocam instrument of the isosatellite. the filter bands chosen were lw2(~7 microns) and lw3(~15 microns).  the results presented here show that most of the detected objects are latem-type giants on the agb, with a cut-off for those earlier than m3-m4. the mostluminous members of these two bulge fields at 7 microns are the mira variables.however, it is evident that they represent the end of a sequence of increasing15 micron dust emission which commences with m giants of earlier sub-type.  in observations of late-type giants the isocam 15 micron band is mainlysensitive to the cool silicate or aluminate dust shells which overwhelm thephotospheric emission. however, in ordinary m-giant stars, the 7 micron band isnot strongly affected by dust emission and may be influenced instead byabsorption. the nu2 band of water at 6.25 microns and the sio fundamental at7.9 microns are likely contribitors to this effect.  a group of late m stars has been found which vary little or not at all buthave infrared colours typical of well-developed dust shells. their luminositiesare similar to those of 200-300 day miras but they have slightly redder[7]-[15] colours which form an extension of the ordinary m giant sequence.  the mira dust shells show a mid-infrared [7]-[15] colour-period relation. ca700 days.

astro-ph;9906489	isogal-denis detection of red giants with weak mass loss in the galactic  bulge	the isogal project is a survey of the stellar populations, structure, andrecent star formation history of the inner disk and bulge of the galaxy. isogalcombines 15 and 7micron isocam observations with denis ijks data to determinethe nature of a source and the interstellar extinction. in this paper we reportan isogal study of a small field in the inner galactic bulge (l=0deg, b=1.0deg,area=0.035 sq. deg) as a prototype of the larger area isogal survey of theinner galaxy. the five wavelengths of isogal+denis, together with therelatively low and constant extinction in front of this specific field, allowreliable determination of the nature of the sources. the primary scientificresult of this paper is evidence that the most numerous class of isogal15micron sources are red giants in the galactic bulge and central disk, withluminosities just above or close to the rgb tip and weak mass-loss rates. theyform loose sequences in the magnitude-colour diagrams [15]/ks-[15] and[15]/[7]-[15]. their large excesses at 15micron with respect to 2micron and7micron is due to circumstellar dust produced by mass-loss at low rates. theseisogal results are the first systematic evidence and study of dust emission atthis early stage (''intermediate'' agb), before the onset of the largemass-loss phase. it is thus well established that efficient dust formation isalready associated with such low mass-loss rates during this early phase.
