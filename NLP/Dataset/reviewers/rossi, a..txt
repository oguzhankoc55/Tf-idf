hep-ph;9409464	vacuum oscillation solution to the solar neutrino problem in standard  and non-standard pictures	the neutrino long wavelength (just-so) oscillation is revisited as a solutionto the solar neutrino problem. we consider just-so scenario in various cases:in the framework of the solar models with relaxed prediction of the boronneutrino flux, as well as in the presence of the non-standard weak rangeinteractions between neutrino and matter constituents. we show that the fit ofthe experimental data in the just-so scenario is not very good for anyreasonable value of the $^8b$ neutrino flux, but it substantially improves ifthe non-standard $\tau$-neutrino--electron interaction is included. these newinteractions could also remove the conflict of the just-so picture with theshape of the sn 1987a neutrino spectrum. special attention is devoted to thepotential of the future real-time solar neutrino detectors as aresuper-kamiokande, sno and borexino, which could provide the model independenttests for the just-so scenario. in particular, these imply specific deformationof the original solar neutrino energy spectra, and time variation of theintermediate energy monochromatic neutrino ($^7be$ and $pep$) signals.

0902.0761	the redshift and afterglow of the extremely energetic gamma-ray burst  grb 080916c	the detection of gev photons from gamma-ray bursts (grbs) has importantconsequences for the interpretation and modelling of these most-energeticcosmological explosions. the full exploitation of the high-energy measurementsrelies, however, on the accurate knowledge of the distance to the events. herewe report on the discovery of the afterglow and subsequent redshiftdetermination of grb 080916c, the first grb detected by the fermi gamma-rayspace telescope with high significance detection of photons at &gt;0.1 gev.observations were done with 7-channel imager grond at the 2.2m mpi/esotelescope, the sirius instrument at the nagoya-saao 1.4m telescope in southafrica, and the gmos instrument at gemini-s. the afterglow photometric redshiftof z=4.35+-0.15, based on simultaneous 7-filter observations with the gamma-rayoptical and near-infrared detector (grond), places grb 080916c among the top 5%most distant grbs, and makes it the most energetic grb known to date. thedetection of gev photons from such a distant event is rather surprising.  the observed gamma-ray variability in the prompt emission together with theredshift suggests a lower limit for the lorentz factor of theultra-relativistic ejecta of gamma &gt; 1090. this value rivals any previousmeasurements of gamma in grbs and strengthens the extreme nature of grb080916c.

0903.1184	correlated optical and x-ray flares in the afterglow of xrf 071031	we present a densely sampled early light curve of the optical/near-infrared(nir) afterglow of the x-ray flash (xrf) 071031 at z=2.692. simultaneous andcontinuous observations in seven photometric bands from g' to k with grond atthe 2.2 m mpi/eso telescope on lasilla were performed between 4 minutes and 7hours after the burst. the light curve consists of 547 individual points whichallows us to study the early evolution of the optical transient associated withxrf 071031 in great detail. the optical/nir light curve is dominated by anearly increase in brightness which can be attributed to the apparent onset ofthe forward shock emission. there are several bumps which are superimposed ontothe overall rise and decay. significant flaring is also visible in the swiftx-ray telescope (xrt) light curve from early to late times. the availability ofhigh quality, broadband data enables detailed studies of the connection betweenthe x-ray and optical/nir afterglow and its colour evolution during the firstnight post burst. we find evidence of spectral hardening in the optical bandscontemporaneous with the emergence of the bumps from an underlying afterglowcomponent. the bumps in the optical/nir light curve can be associated withflares in the x-ray regime suggesting late central engine activity as thecommon origin.

0911.5430	first proton--proton collisions at the lhc as observed with the alice  detector: measurement of the charged particle pseudorapidity density at  sqrt(s) = 900 gev	on 23rd november 2009, during the early commissioning of the cern largehadron collider (lhc), two counter-rotating proton bunches were circulated forthe first time concurrently in the machine, at the lhc injection energy of 450gev per beam. although the proton intensity was very low, with only one pilotbunch per beam, and no systematic attempt was made to optimize the collisionoptics, all lhc experiments reported a number of collision candidates. in thealice experiment, the collision region was centred very well in both thelongitudinal and transverse directions and 284 events were recorded incoincidence with the two passing proton bunches. the events were immediatelyreconstructed and analyzed both online and offline. we have used these eventsto measure the pseudorapidity density of charged primary particles in thecentral region. in the range |eta| &lt; 0.5, we obtain dnch/deta = 3.10 +- 0.13(stat.) +- 0.22 (syst.) for all inelastic interactions, and dnch/deta = 3.51 +-0.15 (stat.) +- 0.25 (syst.) for non-single diffractive interactions. theseresults are consistent with previous measurements in proton--antiprotoninteractions at the same centre-of-mass energy at the cern spps collider. theyalso illustrate the excellent functioning and rapid progress of the lhcaccelerator, and of both the hardware and software of the alice experiment, inthis early start-up phase.

1002.3497	multi-gev electron spectrometer	the advance in laser plasma acceleration techniques pushes the regime of theresulting accelerated particles to higher energies and intensities. inparticular the upcoming experiments with the flame laser at lnf will enter thegev regime with almost 1pc of electrons. from the current status ofunderstanding of the acceleration mechanism, relatively large angular andenergy spreads are expected. there is therefore the need to develop a devicecapable to measure the energy of electrons over three orders of magnitude (fewmev to few gev) under still unknown angular divergences. within the plasmonxexperiment at lnf a spectrometer is being constructed to perform thesemeasurements. it is made of an electro-magnet and a screen made ofscintillating fibers for the measurement of the trajectories of the particles.the large range of operation, the huge number of particles and the need tofocus the divergence present unprecedented challenges in the design andconstruction of such a device. we will present the design considerations forthis spectrometer and the first results from a prototype.

1004.3261	a very metal poor damped lyman-alpha system revealed through the most  energetic grb 090926a	we present vlt/fors2 spectroscopy and grond optical/near-ir photometry of theafterglow of the bright fermi/lat grb 090926a. the spectrum shows prominentlyman-alpha absorption with n_hi = 10^(21.73 +/- 0.07) cm^-2 and a multitude ofmetal lines at a common redshift of z=2.1062 +/- 0.0004, which we associatewith the redshift of the grb. the metallicity derived from sii is log(z/z_sun)~ -1.9, one of the lowest values ever found in a grb damped lyman-alpha (dla)system. this confirms that the spread of metallicity in grb-dlas at z~2 is atleast two orders of magnitude. we argue that this spread in metallicity doesnot require a similar range in abundances of the grb progenitors, since theneutral interstellar medium probed by the dla is expected to be at asignificant distance from the explosion site. the hydrogen column densityderived from swift/xrt afterglow spectrum (assuming log(z/z_sun) ~ -1.9) isapprox. 100 times higher than the n_hi obtained from the lyman-alphaabsorptions. this suggests either a large column density of ionized gas or ahigher metallicity of the circum-burst medium compared to the gas traced by thedla. we also discuss the afterglow light curve evolution and energetics. theabsence of a clear jet-break like steeping until at least 21 days post-burstsuggests a beaming corrected energy release of e_gamma&gt;3.5x10^52erg, indicatingthat grb090926a may have been one of the most energetic bursts ever detected.

1010.4057	the circumburst density profile around grb progenitors: a statistical  study	according to our present understanding, long grbs originate from the collapseof massive stars while short bursts are due to the coalescence of compactstellar objects. since the afterglow evolution is determined by the circumburstdensity profile, n(r), traversed by the fireball, it can be used to distinguishbetween a so-called ism profile, n(r) = const., and a free stellar wind, $n(r)\propto r^{-2}$. our goal is to derive the most probable circumburst densityprofile for a large number of swift-detected bursts using well-sampledafterglow light curves in the optical and x-ray bands. we combined all publiclyavailable optical and swift/x-ray afterglow data from june 2005 to september2009 to find the best-sampled late-time afterglow light curves. after applyingseveral selection criteria, our final sample consists of 27 bursts, includingone short burst. the afterglow evolution was then studied within the frameworkof the fireball model. we find that the majority (18) of the 27 afterglow lightcurves are compatible with a constant density medium (ism case). only 6 of the27 afterglows show evidence for a wind profile at late times. in particular, weset upper limits on the wind termination-shock radius, $r_t$, for grb fireballswhich are propagating into an ism profile and lower limits on $r_t$ for thosewhich were found to propagate through a wind medium. observational evidence forism profiles dominates in grb afterglow studies, implying that most grbprogenitors might have relatively small wind termination-shock radii. a smallergroup of progenitors, however, seems to be characterised by notably moreextended wind regions.

1011.0618	the nature of "dark" gamma-ray bursts	context: thirteen years after the discovery of the first afterglows, thenature of dark gamma-ray bursts (grb) still eludes explanation: while eachng-duration grb typically has an x-ray afterglow, optical/nir emission is onlyseen for 40-60% of them. aim: here we use the afterglow detection statistics ofthe systematic follow-up observations performed with grond since mid-2007 inorder to derive the fraction of "dark bursts" according to different methods,and to distinguish between various scenarios for "dark bursts". method:observations were performed with the 7-channel "gamma-ray optical andnear-infrared detector" (grond) at the 2.2m mpi/eso telescope. we used theafterglow detection rate in dependence on the delay time between grb and thefirst grond exposure. results: for long-duration swift bursts with a detectedx-ray afterglow, we achieve a 90% (35/39) detection rate of optical/nirafterglows whenever our observations started within less than 240\,min afterthe burst. complementing our grond data with swift/xrt spectra we constructbroad-band spectral energy distributions and derive rest-frame extinctions. edetect 25-40% "dark bursts", depending on the definition used. the faintoptical afterglow emission of "dark bursts" is mainly due to a combination oftwo contributing factors: (i) moderate intrinsic extinction at moderateredshifts, and (ii) about 22% of "dark" bursts at redshift $&gt;$5.

1011.1205	photometric redshifts for grb afterglows from grond and swift/uvot	we present a framework to obtain photometric redshifts (photo-zs) forgamma-ray burst afterglows. using multi-band photometry from grond andswift/uvot, photo-zs are derived for five grbs for which spectroscopicredshifts are not available. we use uv/optical/nir data and syntheticphotometry based on afterglow observations and theory to derive the photometricredshifts of grbs and their accuracy. taking into account the afterglowsynchrotron emission properties, we investigate the application of photometryto derive redshifts in a theoretical range between z~1 and z~12. themeasurement of photo-zs for grb afterglows provides a quick, robust andreliable determination of the distance scale to the burst, particularly inthose cases where spectroscopic observations in the optical/nir range cannot beobtained. given a sufficiently bright and mildly reddened afterglow, therelative photo-z accuracy is better than 10% between z=1.5 and z~7 and betterthan 5% between z=2 and z=6. we detail the approach on 5 sources withoutspectroscopic redshifts observed with uvot on-board swift and/or grond. thedistance scale to those same afterglows is measured to be$z=4.31^{+0.14}_{-0.15}$ for grb 080825b, $z=2.13^{+0.14}_{-0.20}$ for grb080906, $z=3.44^{+0.15}_{-0.32}$ for grb 081228, $z=2.03^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$ forgrb 081230 and $z=1.28^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$ for grb 090530. combining the responsefrom uvot with ground-based observatories and in particular grond operating inthe optical/nir wavelength regime, reliable photo-zs can be obtained from z ~1.0 out to z ~ 10, and possibly even at higher redshifts in some favorablecases, provided that these grbs exist, are localized quickly, have sufficientlybright afterglows and are not heavily obscured.

1012.0328	the two-component jet of grb 080413b	the quick and precise localization of grbs by the swift telescope allows theearly evolution of the afterglow light curve to be captured by ground-basedtelescopes. with grond measurements we can investigate theoptical/near-infrared light curve of the afterglow of gamma-ray burst 080413bin the context of late rebrightening. multi-wavelength follow-up observationswere performed on the afterglow of grb 080413b. x-ray emission was detected bythe x-ray telescope onboard the swift satellite and obtained from the publicarchive. optical and near-infrared photometry was performed with theseven-channel imager grond mounted at the mpg/eso 2.2 m telescope andadditionally with the rem telescope, both in la silla, chile. the light curvemodel was constructed using the obtained broad-band data. the broad-band lightcurve of the afterglow of grb 080413b is well fitted with an on-axistwo-component jet model. the narrow ultra-relativistic jet is responsible forthe initial decay, while the rise of the moderately relativistic wider jet nearits deceleration time is the cause of the rebrightening of the light curve. thelater evolution of the optical/nir light curve is then dominated by the widecomponent, the signature of which is almost negligible in the x-raywavelengths. these components have opening angles of theta(narrow) ~1.7 degreesand theta(wide) ~9 degrees, and lorentz factors of gamma(narrow) &gt;188 andgamma(wide) ~18.5. we calculated the beaming-corrected energy release to be 7.9x 10^48 erg.

1012.5232	orbit determination of space objects based on sparse optical data	while building up a catalog of earth orbiting objects, if the availableoptical observations are sparse, not deliberate follow ups of specific objects,no orbit determination is possible without previous correlation of observationsobtained at different times. this correlation step is the most computationallyintensive, and becomes more and more difficult as the number of objects to bediscovered increases. in this paper we tested two different algorithms (and therelated prototype software) recently developed to solve the correlation problemfor objects in geostationary orbit (geo), including the accurate orbitdetermination by full least squares solutions with all six orbital elements.because of the presence in the geo region of a significant subpopulation ofhigh area to mass objects, strongly affected by non-gravitationalperturbations, it was actually necessary to solve also for dynamical parametersdescribing these effects, that is to fit between 6 and 8 free parameters foreach orbit. the validation was based upon a set of real data, acquired from theesa space debris telescope (esasdt) at the teide observatory (canary islands).we proved that it is possible to assemble a set of sparse observations into aset of objects with orbits, starting from a sparse time distribution ofobservations, which would be compatible with a survey capable of covering theregion of interest in the sky just once per night. this could result in asignificant reduction of the requirements for a future telescope network, withrespect to what would have been required with the previously known algorithmfor correlation and orbit determination.

1105.1312	grb 090426: discovery of a jet break in a short burst afterglow	context: the link between the duration of grbs and the nature of theirprogenitors remains disputed. short bursts (with durations of less than ~2 s)are less frequently observed, technically more difficult to localize, andexhibit significantly fainter afterglows. aims: it is of critical importance toestablish whether the burst duration can reliably distinguish the different grbpopulation models of collapsars and compact stellar mergers. the swift grb090426 provides an unique opportunity to address this question. its duration(t_90=1.28 s) places grb 090426 firmly in the short burst population, while thehigh redshift (z=2.609), host galaxy properties, and prompt emission spectralcharacteristics are more similar to those of long-duration grbs. methods: onthe basis of data obtained with the tautenburg 2m telescope (germany) and the7-channel imager grond (la silla, chile), we compiled the most finely sampledlight curve available for a short burst optical/nir afterglow. the light curvewas then analysed in a standard fashion. grond and xrt data were used todetermine the broad-band spectral energy distribution of the afterglow acrossmore than three orders of magnitude. results: our data show that a light curvebreak exists at 0.4 days, which is followed by a steep decay. this light curvedecay is achromatic in the optical/nir bands, and interpreted as a post-jetbreak phase. the x-ray data do not disagree with this interpretation.conclusions: the half-opening angle of the suspected jet as well as theluminosity of the optical afterglow provide additional evidence that grb 090426is probably linked to the death of a massive star rather than to the merger oftwo compact objects.

1108.0674	the seds and host galaxies of the dustiest grb afterglows	(abridged) until recently the information inferred from gamma-ray burstfollow-up observations was mostly limited to optically bright afterglows,biasing all demographic studies against sight-lines that contain large amountsof dust. here, we present grb afterglow and host observations for a sample ofbursts that are exemplary of previously missed ones because of high visualextinction along the sight-line. this facilitates an investigation of theproperties, geometry and location of the absorbing dust of thesepoorly-explored host galaxies, and a comparison to hosts fromoptically-selected samples. the hosts of the dustiest afterglows are diverse intheir properties, but on average redder, more luminous and massive than thehosts of optically-bright events. we hence probe a different galaxy population,suggesting that previous host samples miss most of the massive,chemically-evolved and metal-rich members. this also indicates that the dustalong the sight-line is often related to host properties, and thus probablylocated in the diffuse ism or interstellar clouds and not in the immediate grbenvironment. some of the hosts in our sample, are blue, young or of smallstellar mass illustrating that even apparently non-extinguished galaxiespossess very dusty sight-lines due to a patchy dust distribution. the presentedobservations establish a population of luminous, massive and correspondinglychemically-evolved grb hosts. this suggests that grbs trace the globalstar-formation rate better than studies based on optically-selected hostsamples indicate, and the previously-claimed deficiency of high-mass hostgalaxies was at least partially a selection effect.

1110.3218	the dust extinction curves of gamma-ray burst host galaxies	the composition and amount of interstellar dust within gamma-ray burst (grb)host galaxies is of key importance when addressing selection effects in the grbredshift distribution, and when studying the properties of their host galaxies.as well as the implications for grb research, probing the dust within thehigh-z hosts of grbs also contributes to our understanding of the conditions ofthe interstellar medium and star-formation in the distant universe.nevertheless, the physical properties of dust within grb host galaxiescontinues to be a highly contended issue. in this paper we explore the meanextinction properties of dust within the host galaxies of a sample of 17 grbswith total host galaxy visual extinction av&lt;1 (&lt;av&gt;=0.4), covering a redshiftrange z=0.7-3.1. we find the average host extinction curve to have anultraviolet slope comparable to that of the lmc, but with little evidence of a2175angs dust extinction feature as observed along milky way and lmcsightlines. we cannot at present rule out the presence of a 2175angs feature,and both the standard smc and lmc extinction curves also provide good fits toour data. however, we can reject an extinction curve that has a uv slope asflat as the mean milky way extinction curve, whilst also having a 2175angsfeature as prominent as seen in the mean milky way extinction curve. this is incontrast to the clear detection of a 2175angs bump and the flatter extinctioncurves of some more heavily extinguished grbs (av&gt;1), which may be indicativeof there being a dependence between dust abundance and the wavelengthdependence of dust extinction, as has been previously speculated.

1201.3885	the late-time afterglow of the extremely energetic short burst grb  090510 revisited	the discovery of the short grb 090510 has raised considerable attentionmainly because it had a bright optical afterglow and it is among the mostenergetic events detected so far within the entire grb population. theafterglow was observed with swift/uvot and swift/xrt and evidence of a jetbreak around 1.5 ks after the burst has been reported in the literature,implying that after this break the optical and x-ray light curve should fadewith the same decay slope. as noted by several authors, the post-break decayslope seen in the uvot data is much shallower than the steep decay in the x-rayband, pointing to an excess of optical flux at late times. we reduced andanalyzed new afterglow light-curve data obtained with the multichannel imagergrond. based on the densely sampled data set obtained with grond, we find thatthe optical afterglow of grb 090510 did indeed enter a steep decay phasestarting around 22 ks after the burst. during this time the grond optical lightcurve is achromatic, and its slope is identical to the slope of the x-ray data.in combination with the uvot data this implies that a second break must haveoccurred in the optical light curve around 22 ks post burst, which, however,has no obvious counterpart in the x-ray band, contradicting the interpretationthat this could be another jet break. the grond data provide the missing pieceof evidence that the optical afterglow of grb 090510 did follow a post-jetbreak evolution at late times.

1202.1434	a deep search for the host galaxies of grbs with no detected optical  afterglow	gamma-ray bursts can provide information about star formation at highredshifts. even in the absence of a optical/near-infrared/radio afterglow, thehigh detection rate of x-ray afterglows by swift/xrt and its localizationprecision of 2-3 arcsec facilitates the identification and study of grb hostgalaxies. we focus on the search for the host galaxies of a sample of 17 burstswith xrt error circles but no detected long-wavelength afterglow. three ofthese events can also be classified as truly dark bursts: the observed upperlimit on the optical flux of the afterglow was less than expected based on thex-ray flux. our study is based on deep r and k-band observations performed witheso/vlt instruments, supported by grond and newfirm. to be conservative, wesearched for host galaxies in an area with a radius twice the 90% swift/xrterror circle. for 15 of the 17 bursts we find at least one galaxy inside thedoubled xrt error circle. in seven cases we discover extremely red objects inthe error circles. the most remarkable case is the host of grb 080207 which asa colour of r-k~4.7 mag (ab), one of the reddest galaxies ever associated witha grb. as a by-product of our study we identify the optical afterglow of grb070517a. optically dim afterglows result from cosmological lyman drop out anddust extinction, but the former process is only equired for a minority of cases(&lt;1/3). extinction by dust in the host galaxies might explain all other events.thereby, a seemingly non-negligible fraction of these hosts are globallydust-enshrouded, extremely red galaxies. this suggests that bursts withoptically dim afterglows trace a subpopulation of massive starburst galaxies,which are markedly different from the main body of the grb host galaxypopulation, namely the blue, subluminous, compact galaxies.

1203.4265	detailed optical and near-infrared polarimetry, spectroscopy and  broadband photometry of the afterglow of grb 091018: polarisation evolution	[abridged] a number of phenomena have been observed in grb afterglows thatdefy explanation by simple versions of the standard fireball model, leading toa variety of new models. polarimetry can be a major independent diagnostic ofafterglow physics, probing the magnetic field properties and internal structureof the grb jets. in this paper we present the first high quality multi-nightpolarimetric light curve of a swift grb afterglow, aimed at providing a wellcalibrated dataset of a typical afterglow to serve as a benchmark system formodelling afterglow polarisation behaviour. in particular, our dataset of theafterglow of grb 091018 (at redshift z=0.971) comprises optical linearpolarimetry (r band, 0.13 - 2.3 days after burst); circular polarimetry (rband) and near-infrared linear polarimetry (ks band). we add to that highquality optical and near-infrared broadband light curves and spectral energydistributions as well as afterglow spectroscopy. the linear polarisation variesbetween 0 and 3%, with both long and short time scale variability visible. wefind an achromatic break in the afterglow light curve, which corresponds tofeatures in the polarimetric curve. we find that the data can be reproduced byjet break models only if an additional polarised component of unknown nature ispresent in the polarimetric curve. we probe the ordered magnetic fieldcomponent in the afterglow through our deep circular polarimetry, findingp_circ &lt; 0.15% (2 sigma), the deepest limit yet for a grb afterglow, suggestingordered fields are weak, if at all present. our simultaneous r and ks bandpolarimetry shows that dust induced polarisation in the host galaxy is likelynegligible.

1205.7075	the afterglow and environment of the short grb111117a	we present multi-wavelength observations of the afterglow of the shortgrb111117a, and follow-up observations of its host galaxy. from rapid opticaland radio observations we place limits of r \gtrsim 25.5 mag at \deltat \approx0.55 d and f_nu(5.8 ghz) &lt; 18 \mujy at \deltat \approx 0.50 d, respectively.however, using a chandra observation at t~3.0 d we locate the absolute positionof the x-ray afterglow to an accuracy of 0.22" (1 sigma), a factor of about 6times better than the swift-xrt position. this allows us to robustly identifythe host galaxy and to locate the burst at a projected offset of 1.25 +/- 0.20"from the host centroid. using optical and near-ir observations of the hostgalaxy we determine a photometric redshift of z=1.3 (+0.3,-0.2), one of thehighest for any short grb, and leading to a projected physical offset for theburst of 10.5 +/- 1.7 kpc, typical of previous short grbs. at this redshift,the isotropic gamma-ray energy is e_{gamma,iso} \approx 3\times10^51 erg(rest-frame 23-2300 kev) with a peak energy of e_{pk} \approx 850-2300 kev(rest-frame). in conjunction with the isotropic x-ray energy, grb111117aappears to follow our recently-reported e_x,iso-e_gamma,iso-e_pk universalscaling. using the x-ray data along with the optical and radio non-detectionswe find that for a blastwave kinetic energy of e_{k,iso} \approx e_{gamma,iso},the circumburst density is n_0 \sim 3x10^(-4)-1 cm^-3 (for a range ofepsilon_b=0.001-0.1). similarly, from the non-detection of a break in the x-raylight curve at t&lt;3 d, we infer a minimum opening angle for the outflow oftheta_j&gt; 3-10 degrees (depending on the circumburst density). we conclude thatchandra observations of short grbs are effective at determining precisepositions and robust host galaxy associations in the absence of optical andradio detections.

1206.0745	the structure and emission model of the relativistic jet in the quasar  3c 279 inferred from radio to high-energy gamma-ray observations in 2008-2010	we present time-resolved broad-band observations of the quasar 3c 279obtained from multi-wavelength campaigns conducted during the first two yearsof the fermi gamma-ray space telescope mission. while investigating thepreviously reported gamma-ray/optical flare accompanied by a change in opticalpolarization, we found that the optical emission appears delayed with respectto the gamma-ray emission by about 10 days. x-ray observations reveal a pair of`isolated' flares separated by ~90 days, with only weak gamma-ray/opticalcounterparts. the spectral structure measured by spitzer reveals a synchrotroncomponent peaking in the mid-infrared band with a sharp break at thefar-infrared band during the gamma-ray flare, while the peak appears in themm/sub-mm band in the low state. selected spectral energy distributions arefitted with leptonic models including comptonization of external radiationproduced in a dusty torus or the broad-line region. adopting the interpretationof the polarization swing involving propagation of the emitting region along acurved trajectory, we can explain the evolution of the broad-band spectraduring the gamma-ray flaring event by a shift of its location from ~ 1 pc to ~4 pc from the central black hole. on the other hand, if the gamma-ray flare isgenerated instead at sub-pc distance from the central black hole, thefar-infrared break can be explained by synchrotron self-absorption. we alsomodel the low spectral state, dominated by the mm/sub-mm peaking synchrotroncomponent, and suggest that the corresponding inverse-compton componentexplains the steady x-ray emission.

1207.5832	observation of time reversal violation in the b0 meson system	although cp violation in the b meson system has been well established by theb factories, there has been no direct observation of time reversal violation.the decays of entangled neutral b mesons into definite flavor states ($b^0$ or$\bar{b}^0$), and $j/\psi k_s^0$ or $c\bar{c} k_s^0$ final states (referred toas $b_+$ or $b_-$), allow comparisons between the probabilities of four pairsof t-conjugated transitions, for example, $\bar{b}^0 \rightarrow b_-$ and $b_-\rightarrow \bar{b}^0$, as a function of the time difference between the two bdecays. using 468 million $b\bar{b}$ pairs produced in $\upsilon(4s)$ decayscollected by the babar detector at slac, we measure t-violating parameters inthe time evolution of neutral b mesons, yielding $\delta s_t^+ = -1.37 \pm 0.14(stat.) \pm 0.06 (syst.)$ and $\delta s_t^- = 1.17 \pm 0.18 (stat.) \pm 0.11(syst.)$. these nonzero results represent the first direct observation of tviolation through the exchange of initial and final states in transitions thatcan only be connected by a t-symmetry transformation.

1207.6088	galaxy counterparts of intervening high-z sub-dlas/dlas and mgii  absorbers towards gamma-ray bursts	we present the first search for galaxy counterparts of intervening high-z(2&lt;z&lt; 3.6) sub-dlas and dlas towards grbs. our final sample comprises of fiveintervening sub-dlas and dlas in four grb fields. to identify candidate galaxycounterparts of the absorbers we use deep optical and near-infrared imaging,and low-, mid- and high-resolution spectroscopy acquired with 6 to 10-m classtelescopes, the hubble and the spitzer space telescopes. furthermore, we usethe spectroscopic information and spectral-energy-distribution fittingtechniques to study them in detail. our main result is the detection andspectroscopic confirmation of the galaxy counterpart of the intervening dla atz=3.096 in the field of grb 070721b (z_grb=3.6298) as proposed by otherauthors. we also identify good candidates for the galaxy counterparts of thetwo strong mgii absorbers at z=0.6915 and 1.4288 towards grb 050820a(z_grb=2.615). the properties of the detected dla galaxy are typical forlyman-break galaxies (lbgs) at similar redshifts; a young, highly starforminggalaxy that shows evidence for a galactic outflow. this supports the hypothesisthat a dla can be the gaseous halo of an lbg. in addition, we report a redshiftcoincidence of different objects associated with metal lines in the same field,separated by 130-161 kpc. the high detection rate of three correlatedstructures on a length scale as small as ~150 kpc in two pairs of lines ofsight is intriguing. the absorbers in each of these are most likely not part ofthe same gravitationally bound structure. they more likely represent groups ofgalaxies.

0712.2186	the afterglows of swift-era gamma-ray bursts. i. comparing pre-swift and  swift era long/soft (type ii) grb optical afterglows	we have gathered optical photometry data from the literature on a largesample of swift-era gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows including grbs up toseptember 2009, for a total of 76 grbs, and present an additional threepre-swift grbs not included in an earlier sample. furthermore, we publish 840additional new photometry data points on a total of 42 grb afterglows,including large data sets for grbs 050319, 050408, 050802, 050820a, 050922c,060418, 080413a and 080810. we analyzed the light curves of all grbs in thesample and derived spectral energy distributions for the sample with the bestdata quality, allowing us to estimate the host galaxy extinction. wetransformed the afterglow light curves into an extinction-corrected z=1 systemand compared their luminosities with a sample of pre-swift afterglows. theresults of a former study, which showed that grb afterglows clustered andexhibited a bimodal distribution in luminosity space, is weakened by the largersample. we found that the luminosity distribution of the two afterglow samples(swift-era and pre-swift) are very similar, and that a subsample for which wewere not able to estimate the extinction, which is fainter than the mainsample, can be explained by assuming a moderate amount of line-of-sight hostextinction. we derived bolometric isotropic energies for all grbs in oursample, and found only a tentative correlation between the prompt energyrelease and the optical afterglow luminosity at one day after the grb in thez=1 system. a comparative study of the optical luminosities of grb afterglowswith echelle spectra (which show a high number of foreground absorbing systems)and those without reveals no indication that the former are statisticallysignificantly more luminous.

1304.5852	the unusual afterglow of the gamma-ray burst 100621a	in order to constrain the broad-band spectral energy distribution of theafterglow of grb 100621a, dedicated observations were performed in theoptical/near-infrared with the 7-channel "gamma-ray burst optical andnear-infrared detector" (grond) at the 2.2m mpg/eso telescope, in thesub-millimeter band with the large bolometer array laboca at apex, and at radiofrequencies with atca. utilizing also swift x-ray observations, we attempt aninterpretation of the observational data within the fireball scenario.  the afterglow of grb 100621a shows a very complex temporal as well asspectral evolution. we identify three different emission components, the mostspectacular one causing a sudden intensity jump about one hour after the promptemission. the spectrum of this component is much steeper than the canonicalafterglow. we interpret this component using the prescription of vlasis et al.(2011) for a two-shell collision after the first shell has been decelerated bythe circumburst medium. we use the fireball scenario to derive constraints onthe microphysical parameters of the first shell. long-term energy injectioninto a narrow jet seems to provide an adequate description. another noteworthyresult is the large ($a_v$ = 3.6 mag) line-of-sight host extinction of theafterglow in an otherwise extremely blue host galaxy.

1304.7003	molecular hydrogen in the damped lyman-alpha system towards grb 120815a  at z=2.36	we present the discovery of molecular hydrogen (h_2), including the presenceof vibrationally-excited h_2^* in the optical spectrum of the afterglow of grb120815a at z=2.36 obtained with x-shooter at the vlt. simultaneous photometricbroad-band data from grond and x-ray observations by swift/xrt place furtherconstraints on the amount and nature of dust along the sightline. the galacticenvironment of grb 120815a is characterized by a strong dla withlog(n(h)/cm^-2) = 21.95 +/- 0.10, prominent h_2 absorption in the lyman-wernerbands (log(n(h_2)/cm^-2) = 20.53 +/- 0.13) and thus a molecular gas fractionlog f(h_2)=-1.14 +/- 0.15. the distance d between the absorbing neutral gas andgrb 120815a is constrained via photo-excitation modeling of fine-structure andmeta-stable transitions of feii and niii to d = 0.5 +/- 0.1 kpc. the dlametallicity ([zn/h] = -1.15 +/- 0.12), visual extinction (a_v &lt; 0.15 mag) anddust depletion ([zn/fe] = 1.01 +/- 0.10) are intermediate between the values ofwell-studied, h_2-deficient grb-dlas observed at high spectral resolution, andthe approximately solar metallicity, highly-obscured and h_2-rich grb 080607sightline. with respect to n(h), metallicity, as well as dust-extinction anddepletion, grb 120815a is fairly representative of the average properties ofgrb-dlas. this demonstrates that molecular hydrogen is present in at least afraction of the more typical grb-dlas, and h_2 and h_2^* are probably morewide-spread among grb-selected systems than the few examples of previousdetections would suggest.

1306.0892	the low-extinction afterglow in the solar-metallicity host galaxy of  gamma-ray burst 110918a	metallicity is theoretically thought to be a fundamental driver in gamma-rayburst (grb) explosions and energetics, but is still, even after more than adecade of extensive studies, not fully understood. this is largely related totwo phenomena: a dust-extinction bias, that prevented high-mass and thus likelyhigh-metallicity grb hosts to be detected in the first place, and a lack ofefficient instrumentation, that limited spectroscopic studies includingmetallicity measurements to the low-redshift end of the grb host population.the subject of this work is the very energetic grb 110918a, for which wemeasure a redshift of z=0.984. grb 110918a gave rise to a luminous afterglowwith an intrinsic spectral slope of b=0.70, which probed a sight-line withlittle extinction (a_v=0.16 mag) typical of the established distributions ofafterglow properties. photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations ofthe galaxy hosting grb 110918a, including optical/nir photometry with grond andspectroscopy with vlt/x-shooter, however, reveal an all but average grb host incomparison to the z~1 galaxies selected through similar afterglows to date. ithas a large spatial extent with a half-light radius of ~10 kpc, the higheststellar mass for z&lt;1.9 (log(m_*/m_sol) = 10.68+-0.16), and an halpha-based starformation rate of 41 m_sol/yr. we measure a gas-phase extinction of ~1.8 magthrough the balmer decrement and one of the largest host-integratedmetallicities ever of around solar (12 + log(o/h) = 8.93+/-0.13). this presentsone of the very few robust metallicity measurements of grb hosts at z~1, andestablishes that grb hosts at z~1 can also be very metal rich. it conclusivelyrules out a metallicity cut-off in grb host galaxies and argues against ananti-correlation between metallicity and energy release in grbs.

1311.6466	spatially-resolved dust properties of the grb 980425 host galaxy	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been proposed as a tool for studying starformation in the universe, so it is crucial to investigate whether their hostgalaxies and immediate environments are in any way special compared with otherstar-forming galaxies. here we present spatially resolved maps of dust emissionof the host galaxy of the closest known grb 980425 at z=0.0085 using our newhigh-resolution observations from herschel, atacama pathfinder experiment(apex), atacama large millimeter array (alma) and australia telescope compactarray (atca). we modelled the spectral energy distributions of the host and ofthe star-forming region displaying the wolf-rayet signatures in the spectrum(wr region), located 800 pc from the grb position. the host is characterised bylow dust content and a high fraction of uv-visible star formation, similar toother dwarf galaxies. these galaxies are abundant in the local universe, so itis not surprising to find a grb in one of them, assuming the correspondencebetween the grb rate and star formation. the wr region contributessubstantially to the host emission at the far-infrared, millimetre, and radiowavelengths and we propose that this is a consequence of its high gas density.if dense environments are also found close to the positions of other grbs, thenthe ism density should also be considered, along with metallicity, an importantfactor influencing whether a given stellar population can produce a grb.

1312.1335	afterglow rebrightenings as a signature of a long-lasting central engine  activity? the emblematic case of grb 100814a	in the past few years the number of well-sampled optical to nir light curvesof long gamma-ray bursts (grbs) has greatly increased particularly due tosimultaneous multi-band imagers such as grond. combining these densely sampledground-based data sets with the swift uvot and xrt space observations unveils amuch more complex afterglow evolution than what was predicted by the mostcommonly invoked theoretical models. grb 100814a represents a remarkableexample of these interesting well-sampled events, showing a prominent late-timerebrightening in the optical to nir bands and a complex spectral evolution.this represents a unique laboratory to test the different afterglow emissionmodels. here we study the nature of the complex afterglow emission of grb100814a in the framework of different theoretical models. moreover, we comparethe late-time chromatic rebrightening with those observed in other well-sampledlong grbs. we analysed the optical and nir observations obtained with theseven-channel gamma-ray burst optical and near-infrared detector at the 2.2 mmpg/eso telescope together with the x-ray and uv data detected by theinstruments onboard the swift observatory. the broad-band afterglow evolution,achieved by constructing multi-instrument light curves and spectral energydistributions, will be discussed in the framework of different theoreticalmodels. we find that the standard models that describe the broad-band afterglowemission within the external shock scenario fail to describe the complexevolution of grb 100814a, and therefore more complex scenarios must be invoked.[abridged]

1312.4547	prompt emission of grb 121217a from gamma-rays to the nir	the mechanism that causes the prompt-emission episode of gamma-ray bursts(grbs) is still widely debated despite there being thousands of promptdetections. the favoured internal shock model relates this emission tosynchrotron radiation. however, it does not always explain the spectral indicesof the shape of the spectrum, often fit with empirical functions.multi-wavelength observations are therefore required to help investigate thepossible underlying mechanisms that causes the prompt emission. we present grb121217a, for which we were able to observe its near-infrared (nir) emissionduring a secondary prompt-emission episode with the gamma-ray burst opticalnear-infrared detector (grond) in combination with the swift and fermisatellites, covering an energy range of 0.001 kev to 100 kev. we determine aphotometric redshift of z=3.1+/-0.1 with a line-of-sight extinction of a_v~0mag, utilising the optical/nir sed. from the afterglow, we determine a bulklorentz factor of gamma~250 and an emission radius of r&lt;10^18 cm. theprompt-emission broadband spectral energy distribution is well fit with abroken power law with b1=-0.3+/-0.1, b2=0.6+/-0.1 that has a break ate=6.6+/-0.9 kev, which can be interpreted as the maximum injection frequency.self-absorption by the electron population below energies of e_a&lt;6 kev suggesta magnetic field strength of b~10^5 g. however, all the best fit modelsunderpredict the flux observed in the nir wavelengths, which also onlyrebrightens by a factor of ~2 during the second prompt emission episode, instark contrast to the x-ray emission, which rebrightens by a factor of ~100,suggesting an afterglow component is dominating the emission. we present grb121217a one of the few grbs for which there are multi-wavelength observationsof the prompt-emission period and show that it can be understood with asynchrotron radiation model.

1312.5099	simultaneous optical/gamma-ray observations of grb 121217's prompt  emission	since the advent of the swift satellite it has been possible to obtainprecise localisations of grb positions of sub-arcsec accuracy within seconds,facilitating ground-based robotic telescopes to automatically slew to thetarget within seconds. this has yielded a plethora of observational data forthe afterglow phase of the grb, but the quantity of data (&lt;2 kev) covering theinitial prompt emission still remains small. only in a handful of cases has itbeen possible obtain simultaneous coverage of the prompt emission in amulti-wavelength regime (gamma-ray to optical), as a result of: observing thefield by chance prior to the grb (e.g. 080319b/naked-eye burst), long-promptemission (e.g., 080928, 110205a) or triggered on a pre-cursor (e.g., 041219a,050820a, 061121). this small selection of bursts have shown both correlated anduncorrelated gamma-ray and optical light curve behaviour, and themulti-wavelength emission mechanism remains far from resolved (i.e. singlepopulation synchrotron self-component, electron distributions, additionalneutron components or residual collisions). such multi-wavelength observationsduring the grb prompt phase are pivotal in providing further insight on thepoorly understood prompt emission mechanism. we add to this small sample theswift burst 121217a that had two distinct periods of prompt emission separatedby ~700 s, observed by swift/bat, swift/xrt and fermi/gbm. as a result of thetime delay of the second emission, it enabled optical imaging (from 3 to 7bands) to be taken with the grond instrument to a resolution as fine as 10s.this multi-wavelength data will hopefully allow us to shed more light on thecurrent picture of prompt emission physics.

1401.3774	grb 120422a/sn 2012bz: bridging the gap between low- and high-luminosity  grbs	at low redshift, a handful of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been discoveredwith peak luminosities ($l_{\rm iso} &lt; 10^{48.5}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$)substantially lower than the average of the more distant ones ($l_{\rm iso} &gt;10^{49.5}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$). the properties of several low-luminosity(low-$l$) grbs indicate that they can be due to shock break-out, as opposed tothe emission from ultrarelativistic jets. owing to this, it is highly debatedhow both populations are connected, and whether there is a continuum betweenthem. the burst at redshift $z=0.283$ from 2012 april 22 is one of the very fewexamples of intermediate-$l$ grbs with a $\gamma$-ray luminosity of$l\sim10^{48.9}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$ that have been detected up to now. togetherwith the robust detection of its accompanying supernova sn 2012bz, it has thepotential to answer important questions on the origin of low- and high-$l$ grbsand the grb-sn connection. we carried out a spectroscopy campaign using medium-and low-resolution spectrographs at 6--10-m class telescopes, covering the timespan of 37.3 days, and a multi-wavelength imaging campaign from radio to x-rayenergies over a duration of $\sim270$ days. furthermore, we used a tuneablefilter centred at h$\alpha$ to map star formation in the host galaxy and thesurrounding galaxies. we used these data to extract and model the properties ofdifferent radiation components and incorporate spectral-energy-distributionfitting techniques to extract the properties of the host galaxy. modelling thelight curve and spectral energy distribution from the radio to the x-raysrevealed the blast-wave to expand with an initial lorentz factor of$\gamma_0\sim60$, low for a high-$l$ grb, and that the afterglow had anexceptional low peak luminosity-density of$\lesssim2\times10^{30}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}\,\rm{hz}^{-1}$ in the sub-mm.[abridged]

1402.4006	new light on gamma-ray burst host galaxies with herschel	until recently, dust emission has been detected in very few host galaxies ofgamma-ray bursts (grbhs). with herschel, we have now observed 17 grbhs up toredshift z~3 and detected seven of them at infrared (ir) wavelengths. thisrelatively high detection rate (41%) may be due to the composition of oursample which at a median redshift of 1.1 is dominated by the hosts of darkgrbs. although the numbers are small, statistics suggest that dark grbs aremore likely to be detected in the ir than their optically-bright counterparts.combining our ir data with optical, near-infrared, and radio data from our owndatasets and from the literature, we have constructed spectral energydistributions (seds) which span up to 6 orders of magnitude in wavelength. byfitting the seds, we have obtained stellar masses, dust masses, star-formationrate (sfr), and extinctions for our sample galaxies. we find that grbhs aregalaxies that tend to have a high specfic sfr (ssfr), and like otherstar-forming galaxies, their ratios of dust-to-stellar mass are well correlatedwith ssfr. we incorporate our herschel sample into a larger compilation ofgrbhs, and compare this combined sample to sfr-weighted median stellar massesof the widest, deepest galaxy survey to date. this is done in order toestablish whether or not grbs can be used as an unbiased tracer of cosmiccomoving sfr density (sfrd) in the universe. in contrast with previous results,this comparison shows that grbhs are medium-sized galaxies with relatively highssfrs; stellar masses and ssfrs of grbhs as a function of redshift are similarto what is expected for star-forming galaxy populations at similar redshifts.we conclude that there is no strong evidence that grbs are biased tracers ofsfrd; thus they should be able to reliably probe the sfrd to early epochs.

1404.6654	diversity of grb energetics vs. sn homogeneity: supernova 2013cq  associated with the gamma-ray burst 130427a	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been found to be associated withbroad-lined type-ic supernovae (sne), but only a handful of cases have beenstudied in detail. prompted by the discovery of the exceptionally bright,nearby grb130427a (redshift z=0.3399), we aim at characterising the propertiesof its associated sn2013cq. this is the first opportunity to test directly theprogenitors of high-luminosity grbs. we monitored the field of the swift longduration grb130427a using the 3.6-m tng and the 8.2-m vlt during the timeinterval between 3.6 and 51.6 days after the burst. photometric andspectroscopic observations revealed the presence of the type ic sn2013cq.spectroscopic analysis suggests that sn2013cq resembles two previous grb-sne,sn1998bw and sn2010bh associated with grb980425 and xrf100316d, respectively.the bolometric light curve of sn2013cq, which is significantly affected by thehost galaxy contribution, is systematically more luminous than that of sn2010bh($\sim$ 2 mag at peak), but is consistent with sn1998bw. the comparison withthe light curve model of another grb-connected sn2003dh, indicates thatsn2013cq is consistent with the model when brightened by 20%. this suggests asynthesised radioactive $^{56}$ni mass of $\sim 0.4 m_\odot$.grb130427a/sn2013cq is the first case of low-z grb-sn connection where the grbenergetics are extreme ($e_{\rm \gamma, iso} \sim 10^{54}$ erg). we show thatthe maximum luminosities attained by sne associated with grbs span a verynarrow range, but those associated with xrfs are significantly less luminous.on the other hand the isotropic energies of the accompanying grbs span 6 ordersof magnitude (10$^{48}$ erg $&lt; e_{\rm \gamma, iso} &lt;$ 10$^{54}$ erg), althoughthis range is reduced when corrected for jet collimation. the grb totalradiated energy is in fact a small fraction of the sn energy budget.

1405.7396	grb 120711a: an intense integral burst with long-lasting soft gamma-ray  emission and a powerful optical flash	a long and intense gamma-ray burst (grb) was detected by integral on july 112012 with a duration of ~115s and fluence of 2.8x10^-4 erg cm^-2 in the 20kev-8 mev energy range. grb 120711a was at z~1.405 and produced soft gamma-rayemission (&gt;20 kev) for at least ~10 ks after the trigger. the grb was observedby several ground-based telescopes that detected a powerful optical flashpeaking at an r-band brightness of ~11.5 mag at ~126 s after the trigger. wepresent a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis of the long-lasting softgamma-ray emission detected in the 20-200 kev band with integral, the fermi/latpost-grb detection above 100 mev, the soft x-ray afterglow from xmm-newton,chandra, and swift and the optical/nir detections from watcher, skynet, grond,and rem. we modelled the long-lasting soft gamma-ray emission using thestandard afterglow scenario, which indicates a forward shock origin. thecombination of data extending from the nir to gev energies suggest that theemission is produced by a broken power-law spectrum consistent with synchrotronradiation. the afterglow is well modelled using a stratified wind-likeenvironment with a density profile k~1.2, suggesting a massive star progenitor(i.e. wolf-rayet). the analysis of the reverse and forward shock emissionreveals an initial lorentz factor of ~120-340, a jet half-opening angle of~2deg-5deg, and a baryon load of ~10^-5-10^-6 msun consistent with theexpectations of the fireball model when the emission is highly relativistic.long-lasting soft gamma-ray emission from other integral grbs with high peakfluxes, such as grb 041219a, was not detected, suggesting that a combination ofhigh lorentz factor, emission above 100 mev, and possibly a powerful reverseshock are required. similar long-lasting soft gamma-ray emission has recentlybeen observed from the nearby and extremely bright fermi/lat burst grb 130427a.

1406.5027	low delta-v near-earth asteroids: a survey of suitable targets for space  missions	in the last decades near-earth objects (neos) have become very importanttargets to study, since they can give us clues to the formation, evolution andcomposition of the solar system. in addition, they may represent either athreat to humankind, or a repository of extraterrestrial resources for suitablespace-borne missions. within this framework, the choice of next-generationmission targets and the characterisation of a potential threat to our planetdeserve special attention. to date, only a small part of the 11,000 discoveredneos have been physically characterised. from ground and space-basedobservations one can determine some basic physical properties of these objectsusing visible and infrared spectroscopy. we present data for 13 objectsobserved with different telescopes around the world (nasa-irtf, eso-ntt, tng)in the 0.4 - 2.5 um spectral range, within the neosurface survey(http://www.oa-roma.inaf.it/planet/neosurface.html). objects are chosen fromamong the more accessible for a rendez-vous mission. all of them arecharacterised by a delta-v (the change in velocity needed for transferring aspacecraft from low-earth orbit to rendez-vous with neos) lower than 10.5 km/s,well below the solar system escape velocity (12.3 km/s). we taxonomicallyclassify 9 of these objects for the first time. 11 objects belong to thes-complex taxonomy; the other 2 belong to the c-complex. we constrain thesurface composition of these objects by comparing their spectra with meteoritesfrom the relab database. we also compute olivine and pyroxene mineralogy forasteroids with a clear evidence of pyroxene bands. mineralogy confirms thesimilarity with the already found h, l or ll ordinary chondrite analogues.

1409.3123	simulations and measurements of beam loss patterns at the cern large  hadron collider	the cern large hadron collider (lhc) is designed to collide proton beams ofunprecedented energy, in order to extend the frontiers of high-energy particlephysics. during the first very successful running period in 2010--2013, the lhcwas routinely storing protons at 3.5--4 tev with a total beam energy of up to146 mj, and even higher stored energies are foreseen in the future. this putsextraordinary demands on the control of beam losses. an un-controlled loss ofeven a tiny fraction of the beam could cause a superconducting magnet toundergo a transition into a normal-conducting state, or in the worst case causematerial damage. hence a multi-stage collimation system has been installed inorder to safely intercept high-amplitude beam protons before they are lostelsewhere. to guarantee adequate protection from the collimators, a detailedtheoretical understanding is needed. this article presents results of numericalsimulations of the distribution of beam losses around the lhc that have leakedout of the collimation system. the studies include tracking of protons throughthe fields of more than 5000 magnets in the 27 km lhc ring over hundreds ofrevolutions, and monte-carlo simulations of particle-matter interactions bothin collimators and machine elements being hit by escaping particles. thesimulation results agree typically within a factor 2 with measurements of beamloss distributions from the previous lhc run. considering the complexsimulation, which must account for a very large number of unknownimperfections, and in view of the total losses around the ring spanning over 7orders of magnitude, we consider this an excellent agreement. our results giveconfidence in the simulation tools, which are used also for the design offuture accelerators.

1505.04415	super-solar metallicity at the position of the ultra-long grb130925a	over the last decade there has been immense progress in the follow-up ofshort and long grbs, resulting in a significant rise in the detection rate ofx-ray and optical afterglows, in the determination of grb redshifts, and of theidentification of the underlying host galaxies. nevertheless, our theoreticalunderstanding on the progenitors and central engines powering these vastexplosions is lagging behind, and a newly identified class of `ultra-long' grbshas fuelled speculation on the existence of a new channel of grb formation. inthis paper we present high signal-to-noise x-shooter observations of the hostgalaxy of grb130925a, which is the fourth unambiguously identified ultra-longgrb, with prompt gamma-ray emission detected for ~20ks. the grb line of sightwas close to the host galaxy nucleus, and our spectroscopic observations coverboth this region along the bulge/disk of the galaxy, in addition to a brightstar-forming region within the outskirts of the galaxy. from our broadwavelength coverage we obtain accurate metallicity and dust-extinctionmeasurements at both the galaxy nucleus, and an outer star-forming region, andmeasure a super-solar metallicity at both locations, placing this galaxy withinthe 10-20% most metal-rich grb host galaxies. such a high metal enrichment hasimplications on the progenitor models of both long and ultra-long grbs,although the edge-on orientation of the host galaxy does not allow us to ruleout a large metallicity variation along our line of sight. the spatiallyresolved spectroscopic data presented in this paper offer important insightinto variations in the metal and dust abundance within grb host galaxies. theyalso illustrate the need for ifu observations on a larger sample of grb hostgalaxies at varies metallicities to provide a more quantitative view on therelation between the grb circumburst and the galaxy-whole properties.

1508.03094	massive stars formed in atomic hydrogen reservoirs: hi observations of  gamma-ray burst host galaxies	long gamma-ray bursts (grbs), among the most energetic events in theuniverse, are explosions of massive and short-lived stars, so they pinpointlocations of recent star formation. however, several grb host galaxies haverecently been found to be deficient in molecular gas (h2), believed to be thefuel of star formation. moreover, optical spectroscopy of grb afterglowsimplies that the molecular phase constitutes only a small fraction of the gasalong the grb line-of-sight. here we report the first ever 21 cm lineobservations of grb host galaxies, using the australia telescope compact array,implying high levels of atomic hydrogen (hi), which suggests that theconnection between atomic gas and star formation is stronger than previouslythought, with star formation being potentially directly fuelled by atomic gas(or with very efficient hi-to-h2 conversion and rapid exhaustion of moleculargas), as has been theoretically shown to be possible. this can happen in lowmetallicity gas near the onset of star formation, because cooling of gas(necessary for star formation) is faster than the hi-to-h2 conversion. indeed,large atomic gas reservoirs, together with low molecular gas masses, stellarand dust masses are consistent with grb hosts being preferentially galaxieswhich have very recently started a star formation episode after accretingmetal-poor gas from the intergalactic medium. this provides a natural route forforming grbs in low-metallicity environments. the gas inflow scenario is alsoconsistent with the existence of the companion hi object with no opticalcounterpart ~19 kpc from the grb 060505 host, and with the fact that the hicentroids of the grb 980425 and 060505 hosts do not coincide with opticalcentres of these galaxies, but are located close to the grb positions.
