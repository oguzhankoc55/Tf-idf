0902.2794	sn 2008ha: an extremely low luminosity and extremely low energy  supernova	we present ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared photometry as well asoptical spectra of the peculiar supernova (sn) 2008ha. sn 2008ha had a very lowpeak luminosity, reaching only m_v = -14.2 mag, and low line velocities of only~2000 km/s near maximum brightness, indicating a very small kinetic energy perunit mass of ejecta. spectroscopically, sn 2008ha is a member of the sn2002cx-like class of sne, a peculiar subclass of sne ia; however, sn 2008ha isthe most extreme member, being significantly fainter and having lower linevelocities than the typical member, which is already ~2 mag fainter and hasline velocities ~5000 km/s smaller (near maximum brightness) than a normal snia. sn 2008ha had a remarkably short rise time of only ~10 days, significantlyshorter than either sn 2002cx-like objects (~15 days) or normal sne ia (~19.5days). the bolometric light curve of sn 2008ha indicates that sn 2008ha peakedat l_peak = (9.5 +/- 1.4) x 10^40 ergs/s, making sn 2008ha perhaps the leastluminous sn ever observed. from its peak luminosity and rise time, we inferthat sn 2008ha generated (3.0 +/- 0.9) x 10^-3 m_sun of 56ni, had a kineticenergy of ~2 x 10^48 ergs, and ejected 0.15 m_sun of material. we classifythree new (and one potential) members of the sn 2002cx-like class, expandingthe sample to 14 (and one potential) members. the host-galaxy morphologydistribution of the class is consistent with that of sne ia, ib, ic, and ii.several models for generating low-luminosity sne can explain the observationsof sn 2008ha; however, if a single model is to describe all sn 2002cx-likeobjects, either electron capture in ne-mg white dwarfs causing a core collapse,or deflagration of c-o white dwarfs with sn 2008ha being a partial deflagrationand not unbinding the progenitor star, are preferred. abridged.

0904.1596	luminous thermal flares from quiescent supermassive black holes	a dormant supermassive black hole lurking in the center of a galaxy will berevealed when a star passes close enough to be torn apart by tidal forces, anda flare of electromagnetic radiation is emitted when the bound fraction of thestellar debris falls back onto the black hole and is accreted. here we presentthe third candidate tidal disruption event discovered in the galex deep imagingsurvey: a 1.6x10^{43} erg s^{-1} uv/optical flare from a star-forming galaxy atz=0.1855. the uv/optical sed during the peak of the flare measured by galex andpalomar lfc imaging can be modeled as a single temperature blackbody witht_{bb}=1.7x10^{5} k and a bolometric luminosity of 3x10^{45} erg s^{-1},assuming an internal extinction with e(b-v)_{gas}=0.3. the chandra upper limiton the x-ray luminosity during the peak of the flare, l_{x}(2-10 kev)&lt; 10^{41}erg s^{-1}, is 2 orders of magnitude fainter than expected from the ratios ofuv to x-ray flux density observed in active galaxies. we compare the lightcurves and broadband properties of all three tidal disruption candidatesdiscovered by galex, and find that (1) the light curves are well fitted by thepower-law decline expected for the fallback of debris from a tidally disruptedsolar-type star, and (2) the uv/optical seds can be attributed to thermalemission from an envelope of debris located at roughly 10 times the tidaldisruption radius of a ~10^{7} m_sun central black hole. we use the observedpeak absolute optical magnitudes of the flares (-17.5 &gt; m_{g} &gt; -18.9) topredict the detection capabilities of upcoming optical synoptic surveys.(abridged)

0906.5355	exploring the optical transient sky with the palomar transient factory	the palomar transient factory (ptf) is a wide-field experiment designed toinvestigate the optical transient and variable sky on time scales from minutesto years. ptf uses the cfh12k mosaic camera, with a field of view of 7.9 deg^2and a plate scale of 1 asec/pixel, mounted on the the palomar observatory48-inch samuel oschin telescope. the ptf operation strategy is devised to probethe existing gaps in the transient phase space and to search for theoreticallypredicted, but not yet detected, phenomena, such as fallback supernovae,macronovae, .ia supernovae and the orphan afterglows of gamma-ray bursts. ptfwill also discover many new members of known source classes, from cataclysmicvariables in their various avatars to supernovae and active galactic nuclei,and will provide important insights into understanding galactic dynamics(through rr lyrae stars) and the solar system (asteroids and near-earthobjects). the lessons that can be learned from ptf will be essential for thepreparation of future large synoptic sky surveys like the large synoptic surveytelescope. in this paper we present the scientific motivation for ptf anddescribe in detail the goals and expectations for this experiment.

0907.1661	grb 090426: the environment of a rest-frame 0.35-second gamma-ray burst  at redshift z=2.609	we present the discovery of an absorption-line redshift of z = 2.609 for grb090426, establishing the first firm lower limit to a redshift for a gamma-rayburst with an observed duration of &lt;2 s. with a rest-frame burst duration oft_90z = 0.35 s and a detailed examination of the peak energy of the event, wesuggest that this is likely (at &gt;90% confidence) a member of the short/hardphenomenological class of grbs. from analysis of the optical-afterglow spectrumwe find that the burst originated along a very low hi column density sightline,with n_hi &lt; 3.2 x 10^19 cm^-2. our grb 090426 afterglow spectrum also appearsto have weaker low-ionisation absorption (si ii, c ii) than ~95% of previousafterglow spectra. finally, we also report the discovery of a blue, veryluminous, star-forming putative host galaxy (~2 l*) at a small angular offsetfrom the location of the optical afterglow. we consider the implications ofthis unique grb in the context of burst duration classification and ourunderstanding of grb progenitor scenarios.

0910.4367	discovery of radio afterglow from the most distant cosmic explosion	we report the discovery of radio afterglow emission from the gamma-ray burstgrb 090423, which exploded at a redshift of 8.3, making it the object with thehighest known redshift in the universe. by combining our radio measurementswith existing x-ray and infrared observations, we estimate the kinetic energyof the afterglow, the geometry of the outflow and the density of thecircumburst medium. our best fit model is a quasi-spherical, high-energyexplosion in a low, constant-density medium. \event had a similar energyrelease to the other well-studied high redshift grb 050904 ($z=6.26$), buttheir circumburst densities differ by two orders of magnitude. we compare theproperties of \event with a sample of grbs at moderate redshifts. we find thatthe high energy and afterglow properties of \event are not sufficientlydifferent from other grbs to suggest a different kind of progenitor, such as apopulation iii star. however, we argue that it is not clear that the afterglowproperties alone can provide convincing identification of population iiiprogenitors. we suggest that the millimeter and centimeter radio detections of\event at early times contained emission from a reverse shock component. thishas important implications for the detection of high redshift grbs by the nextgeneration of radio facilities.

1004.0615	core-collapse supernovae from the palomar transient factory: indications  for a different population in dwarf galaxies	we use the first compilation of 72 core-collapse supernovae (sne) from thepalomar transient factory (ptf) to study their observed subtype distribution indwarf galaxies compared to giant galaxies. our sample is the largestsingle-survey, untargeted, spectroscopically classified, homogeneous collectionof core-collapse events ever assembled, spanning a wide host-galaxy luminosityrange (down to m_r ~ -14 mag) and including a substantial fraction (&gt;20%) ofdwarf (m_r &gt;= -18 mag) hosts. we find more core-collapse sne in dwarf galaxiesthan expected and several interesting trends emerge. we use detailedsubclassifications of stripped-envelope core-collapse sne and find that alltype i core-collapse events occurring in dwarf galaxies are either sne ib orbroad-lined sne ic (sne ic-bl), while "normal" sne ic dominate in giantgalaxies. we also see a significant excess of sne iib in dwarf hosts. wehypothesize that in lower metallicity hosts, metallicity-driven mass loss isreduced, allowing massive stars that would have appeared as "normal" sne ic inmetal-rich galaxies to retain some he and h, exploding as ib/iib events. at thesame time, another mechanism allows some stars to undergo extensive strippingand explode as sne ic-bl (and presumably also as long-duration gamma-raybursts). our results are still limited by small-number statistics, and ourmeasurements of the observed n(ib/c)/n(ii) number ratio in dwarf and gianthosts (0.25_{-0.15}^{+0.3} and 0.23_{-0.08}^{+0.11}, respectively; 1 sigmauncertainties) are consistent with previous studies and theoreticalpredictions. as additional ptf data accumulate, more robust statisticalanalyses will be possible, allowing the evolution of massive stars to be probedvia the dwarf-galaxy sn population.

1005.1455	ptf10fqs: a luminous red nova in the spiral galaxy messier 99	the palomar transient factory (ptf) is systematically charting the opticaltransient and variable sky. a primary science driver of ptf is building acomplete inventory of transients in the local universe (distance less than 200mpc). here, we report the discovery of ptf10fqs, a transient in the luminosity"gap" between novae and supernovae. located on a spiral arm of messier 99, ptf10fqs has a peak luminosity of mr = -12.3, red color (g-r = 1.0) and is slowlyevolving (decayed by 1 mag in 68 days). it has a spectrum dominated byintermediate-width h (930 km/s) and narrow calcium emission lines. theexplosion signature (the light curve and spectra) is overall similar to thatofm85ot2006-1, sn2008s, and ngc300ot. the origin of these events is shrouded inmystery and controversy (and in some cases, in dust). ptf10fqs shows someevidence of a broad feature (around 8600a) that may suggest very largevelocities (10,000 km/s) in this explosion. ongoing surveys can be expected tofind a few such events per year. sensitive spectroscopy, infrared monitoringand statistics (e.g. disk versus bulge) will eventually make it possible forastronomers to unravel the nature of these mysterious explosions.

1009.0960	rapidly decaying supernova 2010x: a candidate ".ia" explosion	we present the discovery, photometric and spectroscopic follow-upobservations of sn 2010x (ptf 10bhp). this supernova decays exponentially withtau_d=5 days, and rivals the current recordholder in speed, sn 2002bj. sn 2010xpeaks at m_r=-17mag and has mean velocities of 10,000 km/s. our light curvemodeling suggests a radioactivity powered event and an ejecta mass of 0.16msun. if powered by nickel, we show that the nickel mass must be very small(0.02 msun) and that the supernova quickly becomes optically thin togamma-rays. our spectral modeling suggests that sn 2010x and sn 2002bj havesimilar chemical compositions and that one of aluminum or helium is present. ifaluminum is present, we speculate that this may be an accretion inducedcollapse of an o-ne-mg white dwarf. if helium is present, all observables of sn2010x are consistent with being a thermonuclear helium shell detonation on awhite dwarf, a ".ia" explosion. with the 1-day dynamic-cadence experiment onthe palomar transient factory, we expect to annually discover a few suchevents.

1010.1002	a mature dusty star-forming galaxy hosting grb080607 at z=3.036	we report the discovery of the host galaxy of dark burst grb080607 atz_grb=3.036. grb080607 is a unique case of a highly extinguished (a_v~3 mag)afterglow that was yet sufficiently bright for high-quality absorption-linespectroscopy. the host galaxy is clearly resolved in deep hst wf3/ir f160wimages and well detected in the spitzer irac 3.5 micron and 4.5 micronchannels, while displaying little/no fluxes in deep optical images from keckand magellan. the extremely red optical-infrared colors are consistent with thelarge extinction seen in the afterglow light, suggesting that the large amountof dust and gas surface mass density seen along the afterglow sightline is notmerely local but likely reflects the global dust content across the entire hostgalaxy. adopting the dust properties and metallicity of the host ism derivedfrom studies of early-time afterglow light and absorption-line spectroscopy, weperform a stellar population synthesis analysis of the observed spectral energydistribution to constrain the intrinsic luminosity and stellar population ofthis dark burst host. the host galaxy is best described by an exponentiallydeclining star formation rate of e-folding time tau=2 gyr and an age of ~2 gyr.we also derive an extinction corrected star formation rate of sfr 125 h^{-2}m_sun/yr and a total stellar mass of m_* ~ 4x10^11 h^{-2} m_sun. our studyprovides an example of massive, dusty star-forming galaxies contributing to thegrb host galaxy population, supporting the notion that long-duration grbs tracethe bulk of cosmic star formation.

1010.2211	hubble space telescope studies of nearby type ia supernovae: the mean  maximum light ultraviolet spectrum and its dispersion	we present the first results of an ongoing campaign using the stisspectrograph on-board the hubble space telescope (hst) whose primary goal isthe study of near ultraviolet (uv) spectra of local type ia supernovae (sneia). using events identified by the palomar transient factory and subsequentlyverified by ground-based spectroscopy, we demonstrate the ability to locate andclassify sne ia as early as 16 days prior to maximum light. this enables us totrigger hst in a non-disruptive mode to obtain near uv spectra within a fewdays of maximum light for comparison with earlier equivalent ground-basedspectroscopic campaigns conducted at intermediate redshifts, z ~ 0.5. weanalyze the spectra of 12 type ia supernovae located in the hubble flow with0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.08. although a fraction of our eventual sample, these data,together with archival data, already provide a substantial advance over thatpreviously available. restricting samples to those of similar phase andstretch, the mean uv spectrum agrees reasonably closely with that atintermediate redshift, although some differences are found in the metallicabsorption features. a larger sample will determine whether these differencesreflect possible sample biases or are a genuine evolutionary effect.significantly, the wavelength-dependent dispersion, which is larger in the uv,follows similar trends to that observed at intermediate redshift and is driven,in part, by differences in the various metallic features. while the origin ofthe uv dispersion remains uncertain, our comparison suggests that it mayreflect compositional variations amongst our sample rather than beingpredominantly an evolutionary effect.

1010.2689	caltech core-collapse project (cccp) observations of type iin  supernovae: typical properties and implications for their progenitor stars	type iin supernovae (sne iin) are rare events, constituting only a fewpercent of all core-collapse sne, and the current sample of well observed sneiin is small. here, we study the four sne iin observed by the caltechcore-collapse project (cccp). the cccp sn sample is unbiased to the extent thatobject selection was not influenced by target sn properties. therefore, theseevents are representative of the observed population of sne iin. we find that anarrow p-cygni profile in the hydrogen balmer lines appears to be a ubiquitousfeature of sne iin. our light curves show a relatively long rise time (&gt;20days) followed by a slow decline stage (0.01 to 0.15 mag/day), and a typicalv-band peak magnitude of m_v=-18.4 +/- 1.0 mag. we measure the progenitor starwind velocities (600 - 1400 km/s) for the sne in our sample and derivepre-explosion mass loss rates (0.026 - 0.12 solar masses per year). we compilesimilar data for sne iin from the literature, and discuss our results in thecontext of this larger sample. our results indicate that typical sne iin arisefrom progenitor stars that undergo lbv-like mass-loss shortly before theyexplode.

1011.2063	evidence for an fu orionis-like outburst from a classical t tauri star	we present pre- and post-outburst observations of the new fu orionis-likeyoung stellar object ptf 10qpf (also known as lkha 188-g4 and hbc 722). priorto this outburst, lkha 188-g4 was classified as a classical t tauri star on thebasis of its optical emission-line spectrum superposed on a k8-typephotosphere, and its photometric variability. the mid-infrared spectral indexof lkha 188-g4 indicates a class ii-type object. lkha 188-g4 exhibited a steadyrise by ~1 mag over ~11 months starting in aug. 2009, before a subsequent moreabrupt rise of &gt; 3 mag on a time scale of ~2 months. observations taken duringthe eruption exhibit the defining characteristics of fu orionis variables: (i)an increase in brightness by &gt; 4 mag, (ii) a bright optical/near-infraredreflection nebula appeared, (iii) optical spectra are consistent with a gsupergiant and dominated by absorption lines, the only exception being halphawhich is characterized by a p cygni profile, (iv) near-infrared spectraresemble those of late k--m giants/supergiants with enhanced absorption seen inthe molecular bands of co and h_2o, and (v) outflow signatures in h and he areseen in the form of blueshifted absorption profiles. lkha 188-g4 is the firstmember of the fu orionis-like class with a well-sampled optical to mid-infraredspectral energy distribution in the pre-outburst phase. the association of theptf 10qpf outburst with the previously identified classical t tauri star lkha188-g4 (hbc 722) provides strong evidence that fu orionis-like eruptionsrepresent periods of enhanced disk accretion and outflow, likely triggered byinstabilities in the disk. the early identification of ptf 10qpf as an fuorionis-like variable will enable detailed photometric and spectroscopicobservations during its post-outburst evolution for comparison with other knownoutbursting objects.

1011.2565	ptf10nvg: an outbursting class i protostar in the pelican/north american  nebula	during a synoptic survey of the north american nebula region, the palomartransient factory (ptf) detected an optical outburst (dubbed ptf10nvg)associated with the previously unstudied flat or rising spectrum infraredsource iras 20496+4354. the ptf r-band light curve reveals that ptf10nvgbrightened by more than 5 mag during the current outburst, rising to a peakmagnitude of r~13.5 in 2010 sep. follow-up observations indicate ptf10nvg hasundergone a similar ~5 mag brightening in the k band, and possesses a richemission-line spectrum, including numerous lines commonly assumed to trace massaccretion and outflows. many of these lines are blueshifted by ~175 km/s fromthe north american nebula's rest velocity, suggesting that ptf10nvg is drivingan outflow. optical spectra of ptf10nvg show several tio/vo bandheads fully inemission, indicating the presence of an unusual amount of dense (&gt; 10^10cm^-3), warm (1500-4000 k) circumstellar material. near-infrared spectra ofptf10nvg appear quite similar to a spectrum of mcneil's nebula/v1647 ori, ayoung star which has undergone several brightenings in recent decades, and06297+1021w, a class i protostar with a similarly rich near--infrared emissionline spectrum. while further monitoring is required to fully understand thisevent, we conclude that the brightening of ptf10nvg is indicative of enhancedaccretion and outflow in this class-i-type protostellar object, similar to thebehavior of v1647 ori in 2004-2005.

1103.0779	ptf10iya: a short-lived, luminous flare from the nuclear region of a  star-forming galaxy	we present the discovery and characterisation of ptf10iya, a short-lived (dt~ 10 d, with an optical decay rate of ~ 0.3 mag per d), luminous (m_g ~ -21mag) transient source found by the palomar transient factory. theultraviolet/optical spectral energy distribution is reasonably well fit by ablackbody with t ~ 1-2 x 10^4 k and peak bolometric luminosity l_bb ~ 1-5 x10^44 erg per s (depending on the details of the extinction correction). acomparable amount of energy is radiated in the x-ray band that appears toresult from a distinct physical process. the location of ptf10iya is consistentwith the nucleus of a star-forming galaxy (z = 0.22405 +/- 0.00006) to within350 mas (99.7 per cent confidence radius), or a projected distance of less than1.2 kpc. at first glance, these properties appear reminiscent of thecharacteristic "big blue bump" seen in the near-ultraviolet spectra of manyactive galactic nuclei (agns). however, emission-line diagnostics of the hostgalaxy, along with a historical light curve extending back to 2007, show noevidence for agn-like activity. we therefore consider whether the tidaldisruption of a star by an otherwise quiescent supermassive black hole mayaccount for our observations. though with limited temporal information,ptf10iya appears broadly consistent with the predictions for the early"super-eddington" phase of a solar-type star disrupted by a ~ 10^7 m_sun blackhole. regardless of the precise physical origin of the accreting material, thelarge luminosity and short duration suggest that otherwise quiescent galaxiescan transition extremely rapidly to radiate near the eddington limit; many suchoutbursts may have been missed by previous surveys lacking sufficient cadence.

1103.2773	large highly-ionized nebulae around ultra-luminous x-ray sources	we present the results of deep optical spectroscopic observations using thelris spectrograph on the keck i 10-m telescope of three ultra-luminous x-raysources (ulxs), ho ix x-1; m81 x-6; and ho ii x-1. our observations reveal theexistence of large (100 - 200 pc diameter) highly-ionized nebulae, identifiedby diffuse he ii (4686 angstrom) emission, surrounding these sources. ourresults are the first to find highly-ionized nebulae of this extent, and thedetection in all three objects indicates this may be a common feature of ulxs.in addition to the extended emission, ho ix x-1 has an unresolved centralcomponent containing about one-third of the total he ii flux, with asignificant velocity dispersion of ~ 370 km/s, suggestive of the existence of aphoto-ionized accretion disk or an extremely hot early-type stellarcounterpart. most of the he ii emission appears to be surrounded bysignificantly more extended hbeta emission, and the intensity ratios betweenthe two lines, which range from 0.12 - 0.33, indicate that photo-ionization isthe origin of the he ii emission. sustaining these extended nebulae requiressubstantial x-ray emission, in the range ~ 10^{39} - 10^{40} ergs/s, comparableto the measured x-ray luminosities of the sources. this favors models where thex-ray emission is isotropic, rather than beamed, which includes theinterpretation that ulxs harbor intermediate-mass black holes.

1106.2897	the progenitor of supernova 2011dh/ptf11eon in messier 51	we have identified a luminous star at the position of supernova (sn)2011dh/ptf11eon, in pre-sn archival, multi-band images of the nearby, nearlyface-on galaxy messier 51 (m51) obtained by the hubble space telescope with theadvanced camera for surveys. this identification has been confirmed, to thehighest available astrometric precision, using a keck-ii adaptive-optics image.the available early-time spectra and photometry indicate that the sn is astripped-envelope, core-collapse type iib, with a more compact progenitor(radius ~1e11 cm) than was the case for the well-studied sn iib 1993j. we inferthat the extinction to sn 2011dh and its progenitor arises from a low galacticforeground contribution, and that the sn environment is of roughly solarmetallicity. the detected object has absolute magnitude m_v^0 ~ -7.7 andeffective temperature ~6000 k. the star's radius, ~1e13 cm, is more extendedthan what has been inferred for the sn progenitor. we speculate that thedetected star is either an unrelated star very near the position of the actualprogenitor, or, more likely, the progenitor's companion in a mass-transferbinary system. the position of the detected star in a hertzsprung-russelldiagram is consistent with an initial mass of 17--19 msun. the light of thisstar could easily conceal, even in the ultraviolet, the presence of a stripped,compact, very hot (~1e5 k), nitrogen-rich wolf-rayet star progenitor.

1106.3570	the palomar transient factory orion project: eclipsing binaries and  young stellar objects	the palomar transient factory (ptf) orion project is an experiment within thebroader ptf survey, a systematic automated exploration of the sky for opticaltransients. taking advantage of the wide field of view available using the ptfcamera at the palomar 48" telescope, 40 nights were dedicated in december2009-january 2010 to perform continuous high-cadence differential photometry ona single field containing the young (7-10myr) 25 ori association. the primarymotivation for the project is to search for planets around young stars in thisregion. the unique data set also provides for much ancillary science. in thisfirst paper we describe the survey and data reduction pipeline, and presentinitial results from an inspection of the most clearly varying stars relatingto two of the ancillary science objectives: detection of eclipsing binaries andyoung stellar objects. we find 82 new eclipsing binary systems, 9 of which weare candidate 25 ori- or orion ob1a-association members. of these, 2 arepotential young w uma type systems. we report on the possible low-mass (m-dwarfprimary) eclipsing systems in the sample, which include 6 of the candidateyoung systems. 45 of the binary systems are close (mainly contact) systems; oneshows an orbital period among the shortest known for w uma binaries, at0.2156509 \pm 0.0000071d, with flat-bottomed primary eclipses, and a deriveddistance consistent with membership in the general orion association. one ofthe candidate young systems presents an unusual light curve, perhapsrepresenting a semi-detached binary system with an inflated low-mass primary ora star with a warped disk, and may represent an additional young orion member.finally, we identify 14 probable new classical t-tauri stars in our data, alongwith one previously known (cvso 35) and one previously reported as a candidateweak-line t-tauri star (sdss j052700.12+010136.8).

1107.4039	the factory and the beehive i. rotation periods for low-mass stars in  praesepe	stellar rotation periods measured from single-age populations are criticalfor investigating how stellar angular momentum content evolves over time, howthat evolution depends on mass, and how rotation influences the stellar dynamoand the magnetically heated chromosphere and corona. we report rotation periodsfor 40 late-k to mid-m stars members of the nearby, rich, intermediate-age(~600 myr) open cluster praesepe. these rotation periods were derived from ~200observations taken by the palomar transient factory of four cluster fields from2010 february to may. our measurements indicate that praesepe's mass-periodrelation transitions from a well-defined singular relation to a more scattereddistribution of both fast and slow rotators at ~0.6 msun. the location of thistransition is broadly consistent with expectations based on observations ofyounger clusters and the assumption that stellar-spin down is the dominantmechanism influencing angular momentum evolution at 600 myr. however, acomparison to data recently published for the hyades, assumed to be coeval topraesepe, indicates that the divergence from a singular mass-period relationoccurs at different characteristic masses, strengthening the finding thatpraesepe is the younger of the two clusters. we also use previously publishedrelations describing the evolution of rotation periods as a function of colorand mass to evolve the sample of praesepe periods in time. comparing theresulting predictions to periods measured in m35 and ngc 2516 (~150 myr) andfor kinematically selected young and old field star populations suggests thatstellar spin-down may progress more slowly than described by these relations.

1107.5307	swift j2058.4+0516: discovery of a possible second relativistic tidal  disruption flare?	we report the discovery by the swift hard x-ray monitor of the transientsource swift j2058.4+0516 (sw j2058+05). our multi-wavelength follow-upcampaign uncovered a long-lived (duration &gt;~ months), luminous x-ray (l_x,iso ~3 x 10^47 erg s^-1) and radio (nu l_nu,iso ~ 10^42 erg s^-1) counterpart. theassociated optical emission, however, from which we measure a redshift of1.1853, is relatively faint, and this is not due to a large amount of dustextinction in the host galaxy. based on numerous similarities with the recentlydiscovered grb 110328a / swift j164449.3+573451 (sw j1644+57), we suggest thatsw j2058+05 may be the second member of a new class of relativistic outburstsresulting from the tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole. ifso, the relative rarity of these sources (compared with the expected rate oftidal disruptions) implies that either these outflows are extremely narrowlycollimated (theta &lt; 1 degree), or only a small fraction of tidal disruptionsgenerate relativistic ejecta. analogous to the case of long-duration gamma-raybursts and core-collapse supernovae, we speculate that rapid spin of the blackhole may be a necessary condition to generate the relativistic component.alternatively, if powered by gas accretion (i.e., an active galactic nucleus[agn]), sw j2058+05 would seem to represent a new mode of variability in thesesources, as the observed properties appear largely inconsistent with knownclasses of agns capable of generating relativistic jets (blazars, narrow-lineseyfert 1 galaxies).

1108.2868	sn2010jp (ptf10aaxi): a jet-driven type ii supernova	we present photometry and spectroscopy of the peculiar typeii supernova (sn)2010jp, also named ptf10aaxi. the light curve exhibits a linear decline with arelatively low peak absolute magnitude of only -15.9, and a low radioactivedecay luminosity at late times that suggests a nickel mass below 0.003$m_{\odot}$. spectra of sn2010jp display an unprecedented triple-peakedh$\alpha$ line profile, showing: (1) a narrow (800 km/s) central component thatsuggests shock interaction with dense csm; (2) high-velocity blue and redemission features centered at -12600 and +15400 km/s; and (3) broad wingsextending from -22000 to +25000 km/s. these features persist during 100 daysafter explosion. we propose that this line profile indicates a bipolarjet-driven explosion, with the central component produced by normal sn ejectaand csm interaction at mid latitudes, while the high-velocity bumps and broadline wings arise in a nonrelativistic bipolar jet. two variations of the jetinterpretation seem plausible: (1) a fast jet mixes 56ni to high velocities inpolar zones of the h-rich envelope, or (2) the reverse shock in the jetproduces blue and red bumps in balmer lines when a jet interacts with densecsm. jet-driven sneii are predicted for collapsars resulting from a wide rangeof initial masses above 25 $m_{\odot}$ at sub-solar metallicity. this seemsconsistent with the sn host environment, which is either an extremelylow-luminosity dwarf galaxy or very remote parts of an interacting pair ofstar-forming galaxies. it also seems consistent with the low 56ni mass that mayaccompany black hole formation. we speculate that the jet survives to produceobservable signatures because the star's h envelope was mostly stripped away byprevious eruptive mass loss.

1109.1593	constraints on the progenitor system of the type ia supernova sn  2011fe/ptf11kly	type ia supernovae (sne) serve as a fundamental pillar of modern cosmology,owing to their large luminosity and a well-defined relationship betweenlight-curve shape and peak brightness. the precision distance measurementsenabled by sne ia first revealed the accelerating expansion of the universe,now widely believed (though hardly understood) to require the presence of amysterious "dark" energy. general consensus holds that type ia sne result fromthermonuclear explosions of a white dwarf (wd) in a binary system; however,little is known of the precise nature of the companion star and the physicalproperties of the progenitor system. here we make use of extensive historicalimaging obtained at the location of sn 2011fe/ptf11kly, the closest sn iadiscovered in the digital imaging era, to constrain the visible-lightluminosity of the progenitor to be 10-100 times fainter than previous limits onother sn ia progenitors. this directly rules out luminous red giants and thevast majority of helium stars as the mass-donating companion to the explodingwhite dwarf. any evolved red companion must have been born with mass less than3.5 times the mass of the sun. these observations favour a scenario where theexploding wd of sn 2011fe/ptf11kly, accreted matter either from another wd, orby roche-lobe overflow from a subgiant or main-sequence companion star.

1111.6109	calcium-rich gap transients in the remote outskirts of galaxies	from the first two seasons of the palomar transient factory, we identifythree peculiar transients (ptf09dav, ptf10iuv, ptf11bij) with fivedistinguishing characteristics: peak luminosity in the gap between novae andsupernovae (m_r = 15.5 to -16.5), rapid photometric evolution (rise-time~12--15 days), large photospheric velocities (~6000 to 11000 km/s), earlyspectroscopic evolution into nebular phase (~1 to 3 months) and peculiarnebular spectra dominated by calcium. we also culled the extensive decade-longlick observatory supernova search database and identified an additional memberof this group, sn 2007ke. our choice of photometric and spectroscopicproperties was motivated by sn 2005e (perets et al. 2010). to our surprise, asin the case of sn 2005e, all four members of this group are also clearly offsetfrom the bulk of their host galaxy. given the well-sampled early and late-timelight curves, we derive ejecta masses in the range of 0.4--0.7 msun.spectroscopically, we find that there may be a diversity in the photosphericphase, but the commonality is in the unusual nebular spectra. our extensivefollow-up observations rule out standard thermonuclear and standardcore-collapse explosions for this class of "calcium-rich gap" transients. ifthe progenitor is a white dwarf, we are likely seeing a detonation of the whitedwarf core and perhaps, even shockfront interaction with a previously ejectednova shell. in the less likely scenario of a massive star progenitor, a verynon-standard channel specific to a low-metallicity environment needs to beinvoked (e.g., ejecta fallback leading to black hole formation). detection (orlack thereof) of a faint underlying host (dwarf galaxy, cluster) will provide acrucial and decisive diagnostic to choose between these alternatives.

1209.6320	the unprecedented 2012 outburst of sn 2009ip: a luminous blue variable  becomes a true supernova	some reports of supernova (sn) discoveries turn out not to be truecore-collapse explosions. one such case was sn 2009ip, which was recognized tobe a luminous blue variable (lbv) eruption. this source had a massive hotprogenitor star identified in pre-explosion data, it had documented evidence ofpre-outburst variability, and it was subsequently discovered to have a 2ndoutburst in 2010. this same source rebrightened again in 2012, and earlyspectra showed the same narrow-line profiles as before, suggesting anotherlbv-like eruption. we present new photometry and spectroscopy of sn 2009ip,indicating that it has transitioned into a true sn. the most striking discoveryin these data is that unlike previous reports, the spectrum exhibited balmerlines with very broad p-cygni profiles characteristic of normal type iisupernovae (sne ii), in addition to narrow emission lines seen in sne iin andlbvs. emission components have fwhm 8000 km/s, while the p-cygni absorptioncomponent has blue wings extending to -13,000 km/s. these velocities aretypical of sne ii, but have never been associated with emission lines from anonterminal lbv-like eruption. initially, the peak absolute magnitude seemedfainter than that of normal sne. however, after a brief period of fading, thesource quickly brightened again to m_r=-17.5 mag over a couple days. the broadlines mostly disappeared, and the spectrum began to resemble the earlyoptically thick phases of sne iin. two weeks later the source leveled off near-18 mag, after which broad emission lines again developed in the spectrum asthe source faded. we conclude that the 2012 outburst of sn 2009ip was theresult of a true core-collapse sn iin that occured when the progenitor star wasin an lbv-like outburst phase, and where the sn was initially faint and thenrapidly brightened due to interaction with circumstellar material (abridged).

1210.0020	late time radio emission from x-ray selected tidal disruption events	we present new observations with the karl g. jansky very large array of sevenx-ray-selected tidal disruption events (tdes). the radio observations werecarried out between 9 and 22 years after the initial x-ray discovery, and,thus, probe the late-time formation of relativistic jets and jet interactionswith the interstellar medium in these systems. we detect a compact radio sourcein the nucleus of the galaxy ic 3599 and a compact radio source that is apossible counterpart to rx j1420.4+5334. we find no radio counterparts for fiveother sources with flux density upper limits between 51 and 200 microjy (3sigma). if the detections truly represent late radio emission associated with atde, then our results suggest that a fraction &gt;~ 10% of x-ray-detected tdes areaccompanied by relativistic jets. we explore several models for producing lateradio emission, including interaction of the jet with gas in the circumnuclearenvironment (blast wave model), and emission from the core of the jet itself.upper limits on the radio flux density from archival observations suggest thatthe jet formation may have been delayed for years after the tde, possiblytriggered by the accretion rate dropping below a critical threshold of ~10^{-2} -- 10^{-3} mdot_edd. the non-detections are also consistent with thisscenario; deeper radio observations can determine whether relativistic jets arepresent in these systems. the emission from rx j1420.4+5334 is also consistentwith the predictions of the blast wave model, however the radio emission fromic 3599 is substantially underluminous, and its spectral slope is too flat,relative to the blast wave model expectations. future radio monitoring of ic3599 and rx j1420.4+5334 will help to better constrain the nature of the jetsin these systems.

1302.3221	demographics of the galaxies hosting short-duration gamma-ray bursts	we present observations of the afterglows and host galaxies of threeshort-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs): 100625a, 101219a and 110112a. we findthat grb 100625a occurred in a z=0.452 early-type galaxy with a stellar mass of4.6e9 m_sun and a stellar population age of 0.7 gyr, and grb 101219a originatedin a star-forming galaxy at z=0.718 with a stellar mass of 1.4e9 m_sun, a starformation rate of 16 m_sun yr^-1, and a stellar population age of 50 myr. wealso report the discovery of the optical afterglow of grb 110112a, which lacksa coincident host galaxy to i&gt;26 mag and we cannot conclusively identify anyfield galaxy as a possible host. the bursts have inferred circumburst densitiesof ~1e-4-1 cm^-3, and isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray and kinetic energies of1e50-1e51 erg. these events highlight the diversity of galaxies that host shortgrbs. to quantify this diversity, we use the sample of 36 swift short grbs withrobust associations to an environment (~1/2 of 68 short bursts detected byswift to may 2012) and classify them as follows: late-type (50%), early-type(15%), inconclusive (20%), and host-less (lacking a coincident host galaxy tolimits of &gt;26 mag; 15%). to find likely ranges for the true late- andearly-type fractions, we assign each of the host-less bursts to the late- orearly-type category using probabilistic arguments, and consider the scenariothat all hosts in the inconclusive category are early-type galaxies to set anupper bound on the early-type fraction. the most likely ranges for the late-and early-type fractions are ~60-80% and ~20-40%, respectively. we find noclear trend between gamma-ray duration and host type, and no change to thefractions when excluding events recently claimed as possible contaminants fromthe long grb/collapsar population. our reported demographics are consistentwith a short grb rate driven by both stellar mass and star formation.

1303.7234	late-time spectral observations of the strongly interacting type ia  supernova ptf11kx	ptf11kx was a type ia supernova (sn ia) that showed time-variable absorptionfeatures, including saturated ca ii h&amp;k lines that weakened and eventually wentinto emission. the strength of the emission component of h{\alpha} increased,implying that the sn was undergoing significant interaction with itscircumstellar medium (csm). these features were blueshifted slightly and showeda p-cygni profile, likely indicating that the csm was directly related to, andprobably previously ejected by, the progenitor system itself. these and otherobservations led dilday et al. (2012) to conclude that ptf11kx came from asymbiotic nova progenitor like rs oph. in this work we extend the spectralcoverage of ptf11kx to 124-680 rest-frame days past maximum brightness. thesespectra of ptf11kx are dominated by h{\alpha} emission (with widths of ~2000km/s), strong ca ii emission features (~10,000 km/s wide), and a blue"quasi-continuum" due to many overlapping narrow lines of fe ii. emission fromoxygen, he i, and balmer lines higher than h{\alpha} is weak or completelyabsent at all epochs, leading to large observed h{\alpha}/h{\beta} intensityratios. the broader (~2000 km/s) h{\alpha} emission appears to increase instrength with time for ~1 yr, but it subsequently decreases significantly alongwith the ca ii emission. our latest spectrum also indicates the possibility ofnewly formed dust in the system as evidenced by a slight decrease in the redwing of h{\alpha}. during the same epochs, multiple narrow emission featuresfrom the csm temporally vary in strength. the weakening of the h{\alpha} and caii emission at late times is possible evidence that the sn ejecta haveovertaken the majority of the csm and agrees with models of other stronglyinteracting sne ia. the varying narrow emission features, on the other hand,may indicate that the csm is clumpy or consists of multiple thin shells.

1304.0248	late-time circumstellar interaction in a spitzer selected sample of type  iin supernovae	type iin supernovae (sne iin) are a rare (&lt; 10%) subclass of core-collapsesne that exhibit relatively narrow emission lines from a dense, pre-existingcircumstellar medium (csm). in 2009, a warm spitzer survey observed 30 sne iindiscovered in 2003 - 2008 and detected 10 sne at distances out to 175 mpc withunreported late-time infrared emission, in some cases more than 5 yearspost-discovery. for this single epoch of data, the warm-dust parameters suggestthe presence of a radiative heating source consisting of optical/x-ray emissioncontinuously generated by ongoing csm interaction. here we presentmulti-wavelength follow-up observations of this sample of 10 sne iin and thewell-studied type iin sn 2010jl. a recent epoch of spitzer observations revealsongoing mid-infrared emission from nine of the sne in this sample. we alsodetect three of the sne in archival wise data, in addition to sne 1987a,2004dj, and 2008iy. for at least five of the sne in the sample, optical and/orx-ray emission confirms the presence of radiative emission from ongoing csminteraction. the two spitzer nondetections are consistent with the forwardshock overrunning and destroying the dust shell, a result that places upperlimits on the dust-shell size. the optical and infrared observations confirmthe radiative heating model and constrain a number of model parameters,including progenitor mass-loss characteristics. all of the sne in this sampleexperienced an outburst on the order of tens to hundreds of years prior to thesn explosion followed by periods of less intense mass loss. although allevidence points to massive progenitors, the variation in the data highlightsthe diversity in sn iin progenitor evolution. while these observations do notidentify a particular progenitor system, they demonstrate that future,coordinated, multi-wavelength campaigns can constrain theoretical mass-lossmodels.

1304.0763	type ia supernovae strongly interacting with their circumstellar medium	owing to their utility for measurements of cosmic acceleration, type iasupernovae (sne) are perhaps the best-studied class of sne, yet the progenitorsystems of these explosions largely remain a mystery. a rare subclass of sne iashow evidence of strong interaction with their circumstellar medium (csm), andin particular, a hydrogen-rich csm; we refer to them as sne ia-csm. in thefirst systematic search for such systems, we have identified 16 sne ia-csm, andhere we present new spectra of 13 of them. six sne ia-csm have beenwell-studied previously, three were previously known but are analyzed in-depthfor the first time here, and seven are new discoveries from the palomartransient factory. the spectra of all sne ia-csm are dominated by h{\alpha}emission (with widths of ~2000 km/s) and exhibit large h{\alpha}/h{\beta}intensity ratios (perhaps due to collisional excitation of hydrogen via the snejecta overtaking slower-moving csm shells); moreover, they have an almostcomplete lack of he i emission. they also show possible evidence of dustformation through a decrease in the red wing of h{\alpha} 75-100 d past maximumbrightness, and nearly all sne ia-csm exhibit strong na i d absorption from thehost galaxy. the absolute magnitudes (uncorrected for host-galaxy extinction)of sne ia-csm are found to be -21.3 &lt;= m_r &lt;= -19 mag, and they also seem toshow ultraviolet emission at early times and strong infrared emission at latetimes (but no detected radio or x-ray emission). finally, the host galaxies ofsne ia-csm are all late-type spirals similar to the milky way, or dwarfirregulars like the large magellanic cloud, which implies that these objectscome from a relatively young stellar population. this work represents the mostdetailed analysis of the sn ia-csm class to date.

1304.4236	discovery of a cosmological, relativistic outburst via its rapidly  fading optical emission	we report the discovery by the palomar transient factory (ptf) of thetransient source ptf11agg, which is distinguished by three primarycharacteristics: (1) bright, rapidly fading optical transient emission; (2) afaint, blue quiescent optical counterpart; and (3) an associated year-long,scintillating radio transient. we argue that these observed properties areinconsistent with any known class of galactic transients, and instead suggest acosmological origin. the detection of incoherent radio emission at suchdistances implies a large emitting region, from which we infer the presence ofrelativistic ejecta. the observed properties are all consistent with thepopulation of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs), marking the first timesuch an outburst has been discovered in the distant universe independent of ahigh-energy trigger. we searched for possible high-energy counterparts toptf11agg, but found no evidence for associated prompt emission. we thereforeconsider three possible scenarios to account for a grb-like afterglow without ahigh-energy counterpart: an "untriggered" grb (lack of satellite coverage), an"orphan" afterglow (viewing-angle effects), and a "dirty fireball" (suppressedhigh-energy emission). the observed optical and radio light curves appearinconsistent with even the most basic predictions for off-axis afterglowmodels. the simplest explanation, then, is that ptf11agg is a normal, on-axislong-duration grb for which the associated high-energy emission was simplymissed. however, we have calculated the likelihood of such a serendipitousdiscovery by ptf and find that it is quite small (~ 2.6%). while notdefinitive, we nonetheless speculate that ptf11agg may represent a new, morecommon (&gt; 4 times the on-axis grb rate at 90% confidence) class of relativisticoutbursts lacking associated high-energy emission.

1304.4643	the lick agn monitoring project 2011: fe ii reverberation from the outer  broad-line region	the prominent broad fe ii emission blends in the spectra of active galacticnuclei have been shown to vary in response to continuum variations, but pastattempts to measure the reverberation lag time of the optical fe ii lines havemet with only limited success. here we report the detection of fe iireverberation in two seyfert 1 galaxies, ngc 4593 and mrk 1511, based on datafrom a program carried out at lick observatory in spring 2011. light curves foremission lines including h-beta and fe ii were measured by applying a fittingroutine to decompose the spectra into several continuum and emission-linecomponents, and we use cross-correlation techniques to determine thereverberation lags of the emission lines relative to v-band light curves. inboth cases the measured lag (t_cen) of fe ii is longer than that of h-beta,although the inferred lags are somewhat sensitive to the choice of fe iitemplate used in the fit. for spectral decompositions done using the fe iitemplate of veron-cetty et al. (2004), we find t_cen(fe ii)/t_cen(h-beta) =1.9+-0.6 in ngc 4593 and 1.5+-0.3 in mrk 1511. the detection of highlycorrelated variations between fe ii and continuum emission demonstrates thatthe fe ii emission in these galaxies originates in photoionized gas, locatedpredominantly in the outer portion of the broad-line region.

1306.5755	ptf12gzk - a rapidly declining, high-velocity type ic radio supernova	only a few cases of type ic supernovae (sne) with high-velocity ejecta havebeen discovered and studied. here we present our analysis of radio and x-rayobservations of a type ic sn, ptf12gzk. the radio emission rapidly declinedless than 10 days after explosion, suggesting sn ejecta expanding at highvelocity (~0.3c). the radio data also indicate that the density of thecircumstellar material (csm) around the supernova is lower by a factor of ~10than the csm around normal type ic sne. our observations of this rapidlydeclining radio sn at a distance of 58 mpc demonstrates the potential to detectmany additional radio sne, given the new capabilities of the vla (improvedsensitivity and dynamic scheduling), that are currently missed, leading to abiased view of radio sne ic. early optical discovery followed by rapid radioobservations would provide a full description of the ejecta velocitydistribution and csm densities around stripped massive star explosions, as wellas strong clues about the nature of their progenitor stars.

1312.3984	the type iib supernova 2013df and its cool supergiant progenitor	we have obtained early-time photometry and spectroscopy of supernova (sn)2013df in ngc 4414. the sn is clearly of type iib, with notable similarities tosn 1993j. from its luminosity at secondary maximum light, it appears that less$^{56}$ni ($\lesssim 0.06\ m_{\odot}$) was synthesized in the sn 2013dfexplosion than was the case for the sne iib 1993j, 2008ax, and 2011dh. based ona comparison of the light curves, the sn 2013df progenitor must have been moreextended in radius prior to explosion than the progenitor of sn 1993j. thetotal extinction for sn 2013df is estimated to be $a_v=0.30$ mag. themetallicity at the sn location is likely to be solar. we have conducted hubblespace telescope (hst) target of opportunity observations of the sn with thewide field camera 3, and from a precise comparison of these new observations toarchival hst observations of the host galaxy obtained 14 years prior toexplosion, we have identified the progenitor of sn 2013df to be a yellowsupergiant, somewhat hotter than a red supergiant progenitor for a normal typeii-plateau sn. from its observed spectral energy distribution, assuming thatthe light is dominated by one star, the progenitor had effective temperature$t_{\rm eff} = 4250 \pm 100$ k and a bolometric luminosity $l_{\rmbol}=10^{4.94 \pm 0.06}\ l_{\odot}$. this leads to an effective radius $r_{\rmeff} = 545 \pm 65\ r_{\odot}$. the star likely had an initial mass in the rangeof 13 to 17 $m_{\odot}$; however, if it was a member of an interacting binarysystem, detailed modeling of the system is required to estimate this mass moreaccurately. the progenitor star of sn 2013df appears to have been relativelysimilar to the progenitor of sn 1993j.

1401.5468	precursors prior to type iin supernova explosions are common: precursor  rates, properties, and correlations	there is a growing number of supernovae (sne), mainly of type iin, whichpresent an outburst prior to their presumably final explosion. these precursorsmay affect the sn display, and are likely related to some poorly chartedphenomena in the final stages of stellar evolution. here we present a sample of16 sne iin for which we have palomar transient factory (ptf) observationsobtained prior to the sn explosion. by coadding these images taken prior to theexplosion in time bins, we search for precursor events. we find five type iinsne that likely have at least one possible precursor event, three of which arereported here for the first time. for each sn we calculate the control time.based on this analysis we find that precursor events among sne iin are common:at the one-sided 99% confidence level, more than 50% of sne iin have at leastone pre-explosion outburst that is brighter than absolute magnitude -14, takingplace up to 1/3 yr prior to the sn explosion. the average rate of suchprecursor events during the year prior to the sn explosion is likely largerthan one per year, and fainter precursors are possibly even more common. wealso find possible correlations between the integrated luminosity of theprecursor, and the sn total radiated energy, peak luminosity, and rise time.these correlations are expected if the precursors are mass-ejection events, andthe early-time light curve of these sne is powered by interaction of the snshock and ejecta with optically thick circumstellar material.

1401.7978	type ia supernova rate measurements to redshift 2.5 from candels :  searching for prompt explosions in the early universe	the cosmic assembly near-infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey (candels)was a multi-cycle treasury program on the hubble space telescope (hst) thatsurveyed a total area of ~0.25 deg^2 with ~900 hst orbits spread across 5fields over 3 years. within these survey images we discovered 65 supernovae(sn) of all types, out to z~2.5. we classify ~24 of these as type ia sn (sn ia)based on host-galaxy redshifts and sn photometry (supplemented by grismspectroscopy of 6 sn). here we present a measurement of the volumetric sn iarate as a function of redshift, reaching for the first time beyond z=2 andputting new constraints on sn ia progenitor models. our highest redshift binincludes detections of sn that exploded when the universe was only ~3 gyr oldand near the peak of the cosmic star-formation history. this gives the candelshigh-redshift sample unique leverage for evaluating the fraction of sn ia thatexplode promptly after formation (&lt;500 myr). combining the candels rates withall available sn ia rate measurements in the literature we find that thisprompt sn ia fraction is fp=0.53 +0.09 -0.10 (stat) +0.10 -0.26 (sys),consistent with a delay time distribution that follows a simple t^{-1} powerlaw for all times t&gt;40 myr. however, a mild tension is apparent betweenground-based low-z surveys and space-based high-z surveys. in both candels andthe sister hst program clash, we find a low rate of sn ia at z&gt;1. this could bea hint that prompt progenitors are in fact relatively rare, accounting for only~20% of all sn ia explosions -- though further analysis and larger samples willbe needed to examine that suggestion.

0802.2748	a comprehensive study of grb 070125, a most energetic gamma ray burst	we present a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis of the bright, longduration gamma-ray burst grb 070125, comprised of observations in $\gamma$-ray,x-ray, optical, millimeter and centimeter wavebands. simultaneous fits to theoptical and x-ray light curves favor a break on day 3.78, which we interpret asthe jet break from a collimated outflow. independent fits to optical and x-raybands give similar results in the optical bands but shift the jet break toaround day 10 in the x-ray light curve. we show that for the physicalparameters derived for grb 070125, inverse compton scattering effects areimportant throughout the afterglow evolution. while inverse compton scatteringdoes not affect radio and optical bands, it may be a promising candidate todelay the jet break in the x-ray band. radio light curves show rapid fluxvariations, which are interpreted as due to interstellar scintillation, and areused to derive an upper limit of $2.4 \times 10^{17}$ cm on the radius of thefireball in the lateral expansion phase of the jet. radio light curves andspectra suggest a high synchrotron self absorption frequency indicative of theafterglow shock wave moving in a dense medium. our broadband modeling favors aconstant density profile for the circumburst medium over a wind-like profile($r^{-2}$). however, keeping in mind the uncertainty of the parameters, it isdifficult to unambiguously distinguish between the two density profiles. ourbroadband fits suggest that \event is a burst with high radiative efficiency($&gt; 60 %$).

1403.4250	constraints on the progenitor system of the type ia supernova 2014j from  pre-explosion hubble space telescope imaging	we constrain the properties of the progenitor system of the highly reddenedtype ia supernova (sn) 2014j in messier 82 (m82; d ~ 3.5 mpc). we determine thesn location using keck-ii k-band adaptive optics images, and we find noevidence for flux from a progenitor system in pre-explosion near-ultravioletthrough near-infrared hubble space telescope (hst) images. our upper limitsexclude systems having a bright red giant companion, including symbiotic novaewith luminosities comparable to that of rs ophiuchi. while the flux constraintsare also inconsistent with predictions for comparatively cool he-donor systems(t &lt; ~35,000 k), we cannot preclude a system similar to v445 puppis. theprogenitor constraints are robust across a wide range of r_v and a_v values,but significantly greater values than those inferred from the sn light curveand spectrum would yield proportionally brighter luminosity limits. thecomparatively faint flux expected from a binary progenitor system consisting ofwhite dwarf stars would not have been detected in the pre-explosion hstimaging. infrared hst exposures yield more stringent constraints on theluminosities of very cool (t &lt; 3000 k) companion stars than was possible in thecase of sn ia 2011fe.

1404.5967	temporal correlations between optical and gamma-ray activity in blazars	we have been using the 0.76-m katzman automatic imaging telescope (kait) atlick observatory to optically monitor a sample of 157 blazars that are brightin gamma rays, being detected with high significance ($\ge 10\sigma$) in oneyear by the large area telescope (lat) on the {\it fermi gamma-ray spacetelescope}. we attempt to observe each source on a 3-day cadence with kait,subject to weather and seasonal visibility. the gamma-ray coverage isessentially continuous. kait observations extend over much of the 5-year {\itfermi} mission for several objects, and most have $&gt;100$ optical measurementsspanning the last three years. these blazars (flat-spectrum radio quasars andbl~lac objects) exhibit a wide range of flaring behavior. using the discretecorrelation function (dcf), here we search for temporal relationships betweenoptical and gamma-ray light curves in the 40 brightest sources in hopes ofplacing constraints on blazar acceleration and emission zones. we find strongoptical--gamma-ray correlation in many of these sources at time delays of $\sim1$ to $\sim 10$ days, ranging between $-40$ and +30 days. a stacked average dcfof the 40 sources verifies this correlation trend, with a peak above 99%significance indicating a characteristic time delay consistent with 0 days.these findings strongly support the widely accepted leptonic models of blazaremission. however, we also find examples of apparently uncorrelated flares(optical flares with no gamma-ray counterpart and gamma-ray flares with nooptical counterpart) that challenge simple, one-zone models of blazar emission.moreover, we find that flat-spectrum radio quasars tend to have gamma raysleading the optical, while intermediate and high synchrotron peak blazars withthe most significant peaks have smaller lags/leads.

1405.1415	a continuum of h- to he-rich tidal disruption candidates with a  preference for e+a galaxies	we present the results of a palomar transient factory (ptf) archival searchfor blue transients which lie in the magnitude range between "normal"core-collapse and superluminous supernovae (i.e. with$-21\,{\leq}m_{r\,(peak)}\,{\leq}-19$). of the six events found after excludingall interacting type~iin and ia-csm supernovae, three (ptf09ge, 09axc and09djl) are coincident with the centers of their hosts, one (10iam) is offsetfrom the center, and for two (10nuj and 11glr) a precise offset can not bedetermined. all the central events have similar rise times to the he-rich tidaldisruption candidate ps1-10jh, and the event with the best-sampled light curvealso has similar colors and power-law decay. spectroscopically, ptf09ge ishe-rich, while ptf09axc and 09djl display broad hydrogen features around peakmagnitude. all three central events are in low star-formation hosts, two ofwhich are e+a galaxies. our spectrum of the host of ps1-10jh displays similarproperties. ptf10iam, the one offset event, is different photometrically andspectroscopically from the central events and its host displays a higher starformation rate. finding no obvious evidence for ongoing galactic nucleiactivity or recent star formation, we conclude that the three centraltransients likely arise from the tidal disruption of a star by a super-massiveblack hole. we compare the spectra of these events to tidal disruptioncandidates from the literature and find that all of these objects can beunified on a continuous scale of spectral properties. the accumulated evidenceof this expanded sample strongly supports a tidal disruption origin for thisclass of nuclear transients.

1405.4863	uncovering the putative b-star binary companion of the sn 1993j  progenitor	the type iib supernova (sn) 1993j is one of only a few stripped-envelopesupernovae with a progenitor star identified in pre-explosion images. sn iibmodels typically invoke h envelope stripping by mass transfer in a binarysystem. for the case of sn 1993j, the models suggest that the companion grew to22 m_solar and became a source of ultraviolet (uv) excess. located in m81, at adistance of only 3.6 mpc, sn 1993j offers one of the best opportunities todetect the putative companion and test the progenitor model. previouslypublished near-uv spectra in 2004 showed evidence for absorption linesconsistent with a hot (b2 ia) star, but the field was crowded and dominated byflux from the sn. here we present hubble space telescope (hst) cosmic originsspectrograph (cos) and wide-field camera 3 (wfc3) observations of sn 1993j from2012, at which point the flux from the sn had faded sufficiently to potentiallymeasure the uv continuum properties from the putative companion. the resultinguv spectrum is consistent with contributions from both a hot b star and the sn,although we cannot rule out line-of-sight coincidences.

1405.7409	slow-speed supernovae from the palomar transient factory: two channels	since the discovery of the unusual prototype sn 2002cx, the eponymous classof low-velocity, hydrogen-poor supernovae has grown to include at most anothertwo dozen members identified from several heterogeneous surveys, in some casesambiguously. here we present the results of a systematic study of 1077hydrogen-poor supernovae discovered by the palomar transient factory, leadingto nine new members of this peculiar class. moreover we find there are twodistinct subclasses based on their spectroscopic, photometric, and host galaxyproperties: the "sn 2002cx-like" supernovae tend to be in later-type or moreirregular hosts, have more varied and generally dimmer luminosities, havelonger rise times, and lack a ti ii trough when compared to the "sn2002es-like" supernovae. none of our objects show helium, and we counter aprevious claim of two such events. we also find that these transients comprise5.6+17-3.7% (90% confidence) of all sne ia, lower compared to earlierestimates. combining our objects with the literature sample, we propose thatthese subclasses have two distinct physical origins.

1408.6239	on the nature of type ia-csm supernovae: optical and near-infrared  spectra of sn 2012ca and sn 2013dn	a growing subset of type ia supernovae (sne ia) show evidence for unexpectedinteraction with a dense circumstellar medium (sne ia-csm). the precise natureof the progenitor, however, remains debated owing to spectral ambiguitiesarising from a strong contribution from the csm interaction. late-time spectraoffer potential insight if the post-shock cold, dense shell becomessufficiently thin and/or the ejecta begin to cross the reverse shock. to date,few high-quality spectra of this kind exist. here we report on the late-timeoptical and infrared spectra of the sne~ia-csm 2012ca and 2013dn. these sneia-csm spectra exhibit low [fe iii]/[fe ii] ratios and strong [ca ii] at lateepochs. such characteristics are reminiscent of the super-chandrasekhar-mass(sc) candidate sn 2009dc, for which these features suggested a low-ionisationstate due to high densities, although the broad fe features admittedly showsimilarities to the blue "quasi-continuum" observed in some core-collapse sneibn and iin. neither sn 2012ca nor any of the other sne ia-csm show evidencefor broad oxygen, carbon, or magnesium in their spectra. similar to theinteracting type iin sn 2005ip, a number of high-ionisation lines areidentified in sn 2012ca, including [s iii], [ar iii], [ar x], [fe viii], [fex], and possibly [fe xi]. the total bolometric energy output does not exceed10^51 erg, but does require a large kinetic-to-radiative conversion efficiency.all of these observations taken together suggest that sne ia-csm are moreconsistent with a thermonuclear explosion than a core-collapse event, althoughdetailed radiative transfer models are certainly necessary to confirm theseresults.

1501.00495	the needle in the 100 deg2 haystack: uncovering afterglows of fermi grbs  with the palomar transient factory	the fermi gamma-ray space telescope has greatly expanded the number andenergy window of observations of gamma-ray bursts (grbs). however, the coarselocalizations of tens to a hundred square degrees provided by the fermi grbmonitor instrument have posed a formidable obstacle to locating the bursts'host galaxies, measuring their redshifts, and tracking their panchromaticafterglows. we have built a target-of-opportunity mode for the intermediatepalomar transient factory in order to perform targeted searches for fermiafterglows. here, we present the results of one year of this program: 8afterglow discoveries out of 35 searches. two of the bursts with detectedafterglows (grbs 130702a and 140606b) were at low redshift (z=0.145 and 0.384respectively) and had spectroscopically confirmed broad-line type icsupernovae. we present our broadband follow-up including spectroscopy as wellas x-ray, uv, optical, millimeter, and radio observations. we study possibleselection effects in the context of the total fermi and swift grb samples. weidentify one new outlier on the amati relation. we find that two bursts areconsistent with a mildly relativistic shock breaking out from the progenitorstar, rather than the ultra-relativistic internal shock mechanism that powersstandard cosmological bursts. finally, in the context of the zwicky transientfacility, we discuss how we will continue to expand this effort to find opticalcounterparts of binary neutron star mergers that may soon be detected byadvanced ligo and virgo.

1501.02820	ptf11iqb: cool supergiant mass loss that bridges the gap between type  iin and normal supernovae	ptf11iqb was initially classified as a typeiin event caught very early afterexplosion. it showed narrow wolf-rayet (wr) spectral features on day 2, but thenarrow emission weakened quickly and the spectrum morphed to resemble those oftypes ii-l and ii-p. at late times, halpha emission exhibited a complex,multipeaked profile reminiscent of sn1998s. in terms of spectroscopicevolution, we find that ptf11iqb was a near twin of sn~1998s, although withweaker interaction with circumstellar material (csm) at early times, andstronger csm interaction at late times. we interpret the spectral changes ascaused by early interaction with asymmetric csm that is quickly (by day 20)enveloped by the expanding sn ejecta photosphere, but then revealed again afterthe end of the plateau when the photosphere recedes. the light curve can bematched with a simple model for weak csm interaction added to the light curveof a normal sn~ii-p. this plateau requires that the progenitor had an extendedh envelope like a red supergiant, consistent with the slow progenitor windspeed indicated by narrow emission. the cool supergiant progenitor issignificant because ptf11iqb showed wr features in its early spectrum ---meaning that the presence of such wr features in an early sn spectrum does notnecessarily indicate a wr-like progenitor. [abridged] overall, ptf11iqb bridgessne~iin with weaker pre-sn mass loss seen in sne ii-l and ii-p, implying acontinuum between these types.

1501.03162	evryscope science: exploring the potential of all-sky gigapixel-scale  telescopes	low-cost mass-produced sensors and optics have recently made it feasible tobuild telescope arrays which observe the entire accessible sky simultaneously.in this article we discuss the scientific motivation for these telescopes,including exoplanets, stellar variability and extragalactic transients. toprovide a concrete example we detail the goals and expectations for theevryscope, an under-construction 780 mpix telescope which covers 8,660 squaredegrees in each two-minute exposure; each night, 18,400 square degrees will becontinuously observed for an average of approximately 6 hours. despite itssmall 61mm aperture, the system's large field of view provides an etendue whichis ~10% of lsst. the evryscope, which places 27 separate individual telescopesinto a common mount which tracks the entire accessible sky with only one movingpart, will return 1%-precision, many-year-length, high-cadence light curves forevery accessible star brighter than mv=16.5, with brighter stars havingfew-millimagnitude photometric precision in long-term light curves. it will becapable of searching for transiting giant planets around the brightest and mostnearby stars, where the planets are much easier to characterize; it will alsosearch for small planets nearby m-dwarfs, for planetary occultations of whitedwarfs, and will perform comprehensive nearby microlensing and eclipse-timingsearches for exoplanets inaccessible to other planet-finding methods. theevryscope will also monitor outbursting young stars, white dwarf activity, andstellar activity of all types, along with finding a large sample ofvery-long-period m-dwarf eclipsing binaries. when relatively rare transientsevents occur, such as gamma-ray bursts (grbs), nearby supernovae, or evengravitational wave detections, the array will return minute-by-minute lightcurves without needing pointing towards the event as it occurs.

1503.05247	a spectroscopic study of the extreme black widow psr j1311-3430	we report on a series of spectroscopic observations of psr j1311-3430, anextreme black-widow gamma-ray pulsar with a helium-star companion. in aprevious study we estimated the neutron star mass as m_ns= 2.68+/-0.14m_sun(statistical error), based on limited spectroscopy and a basic (direct heating)light curve model; however, much larger model-dependent systematics dominatethe mass uncertainty. our new spectroscopy reveals a range of complex sourcebehavior. the variable he i companion wind emission lines can dominatebroad-band photometry, especially in red filters or near minimum brightness,and the wind flux should complete companion evaporation in a spin-down time.the heated companion face also undergoes dramatic flares, reaching 40,000k over20% of the star; this is likely powered by a magnetic field generated in thecompanion. the companion center-of-light radial velocity is now well measuredwith k_col = 615.4+/-5.km/s. we detect non-sinusoidal velocity components dueto the heated face flux distribution. using our spectra to excise flares andwind lines, we generate substantially improved light curves for companioncontinuum fitting. we show that the inferred inclination and neutron star mass,however, remain sensitive to the poorly constrained heating pattern. theneutron star's mass, m_ns, is likely less than the direct heating value andcould range as low as 1.8m_sun for extreme equatorial heating concentration.while we cannot yet pin down m_ns, our data imply that an intrabinary shockreprocesses the pulsar emission and heats the companion. improved spectra and,especially, models that include such shock heating are needed for preciseparameter measurement.

1510.06348	flows of x-ray gas reveal the disruption of a star by a massive black  hole	tidal forces close to massive black holes can violently disrupt stars thatmake a close approach. these extreme events are discovered via bright x-ray andoptical/uv flares in galactic centers. prior studies based on modeling decayingflux trends have been able to estimate broad properties, such as the massaccretion rate. here we report the detection of flows of highly ionized x-raygas in high-resolution x-ray spectra of a nearby tidal disruption event.variability within the absorption-dominated spectra indicates that the gas isrelatively close to the black hole. narrow line widths indicate that the gasdoes not stretch over a large range of radii, giving a low volume fillingfactor. modest outflow speeds of a few hundred kilometers per second areobserved, significantly below the escape speed from the radius set byvariability. the gas flow is consistent with a rotating wind from the inner,super-eddington region of a nascent accretion disk, or with a filament ofdisrupted stellar gas near to the apocenter of an elliptical orbit. flows ofthis sort are predicted by fundamental analytical theory and more recentnumerical simulations.

1512.00733	type ii supernova energetics and comparison of light curves to  shock-cooling models	during the first few days after explosion, type ii supernovae (sne) aredominated by relatively simple physics. theoretical predictions regardingearly-time sn light curves in the ultraviolet (uv) and optical bands are thusquite robust. we present, for the first time, a sample of $57$ $r$-band type iisn light curves that are well monitored during their rise, having $&gt;5$detections during the first 10 days after discovery, and a well-constrainedtime of explosion to within $1-3$ days. we show that the energy per unit mass($e/m$) can be deduced to roughly a factor of five by comparing early-timeoptical data to the model of rabinak &amp; waxman (2011), while the progenitorradius cannot be determined based on $r$-band data alone. we find that type iisn explosion energies span a range of $e/m=(0.2-20)\times 10^{51} \;\rm{erg/(10 m}_\odot$), and have a mean energy per unit mass of $\left\langlee/m \right\rangle = 0.85\times 10^{51} \; \rm{erg/(10 m}_\odot$), corrected formalmquist bias. assuming a small spread in progenitor masses, this indicates alarge intrinsic diversity in explosion energy. moreover, $e/m$ is positivelycorrelated with the amount of $^{56}\rm{ni}$ produced in the explosion, aspredicted by some recent models of core-collapse sne. we further presentseveral empirical correlations. the peak magnitude is correlated with thedecline rate ($\delta m_{15}$), the decline rate is weakly correlated with therise time, and the rise time is not significantly correlated with the peakmagnitude. faster declining sne are more luminous and have longer rise times.this limits the possible power sources for such events.

astro-ph;0411312	photometric typing analyses of three young supernovae with the robotic  palomar 60-inch telescope	we present photometric typing analyses of three young supernovae observedwith the robotic 60-inch telescope at palomar observatory (p60). thisrepresents the first time that such photo-typing has been attempted, in a blindfashion, on newly-discovered supernovae. for one of the target supernovae,sn2004cs, our photometry provided the first constraint on the sn type, which wepredicted would be type ia. to the contrary, however, our subsequent keckspectroscopy shows it to be an unusual type ii supernova. for each of the othertwo supernovae, sn2004dh (type ii) and sn2004dk (type ib), our photo-typingresults are consistent with the known type of the event as determined fromground-based spectroscopy; however, the colors of sn2004dk are also consistentwith a type ic or type ii classification. we discuss our approach to thechallenges of photo-typing - contamination by host galaxy light and the unknownphotometric quality of the data - in the case where it is desirable to completethe analysis with just one night of observations. the growing interest in theproperties and behavior of very young supernovae, and the increased discoveryrate for such events, mean that prompt photo-typing analyses can provide usefulinput to observational campaigns. our results demonstrate the value andfeasibility of such a project for p60, at the same time illustrating its chiefinherent shortcoming: an inability to identify new and unusual events as suchwithout later spectroscopic observations.

astro-ph;0609092	observational limits on x-ray bursts from rrat j1911+00	(abridged) the high radio-flux brightness temperature of the recentlydiscovered class of sources known as rotating radio transients (rrats)motivates detailed study in the x-ray band. we describe analyses of historicalx-ray data, searching for x-ray phenomena (sources, behaviors), finding nosources or behaviors which may unequivocally be associated with rrat j1911+00.we put forward a candidate x-ray counterpart to rrat j1911+00, discovered in achandra observation in feb 2001, which fades by a factor &gt;5 prior to april2004. the x-ray flux and optical (f_x/f_r&gt;12) and near infra-red (f_x/f_j&gt;35)limits, as well as the x-ray flux itself, are consistent with an agn origin,unrelated to rrat j1911+00. searches for msec x-ray bursts found no evidencefor such a signal, and we place the first observational upper-limit on thex-ray to radio flux ratio of rrat bursts: f_x/f_{radio} &lt;6e-11 ergs cm-2 s-1mjy-1. the upper-limit on the x-ray burst flux (corresponding to &lt;2.2e37 (d/3.3kpc)^2 erg s-1, 2-10 kev) requires a limit on the spectral energy densitypower-law slope of \alpha&lt;-0.3 between the radio and x-ray bands. we place alimit on the time-average x-ray burst luminosity, associated with radio bursts,of &lt; 3.4e30 (d/3.3 kpc)^2 erg s-1.

0810.4923	improved standardization of type ii-p supernovae: application to an  expanded sample	in the epoch of precise and accurate cosmology, cross-confirmation using avariety of cosmographic methods is paramount to circumvent systematicuncertainties. owing to progenitor histories and explosion physics differingfrom those of type ia sne (sne ia), type ii-plateau supernovae (sne ii-p) areunlikely to be affected by evolution in the same way. based on a new analysisof 17 sne ii-p, and on an improved methodology, we find that sne ii-p are goodstandardizable candles, almost comparable to sne ia. we derive a tight hubblediagram with a dispersion of 10% in distance, using the simple correlationbetween luminosity and photospheric velocity introduced by hamuy &amp; pinto 2002.we show that the descendent method of nugent et al. 2006 can be furthersimplified and that the correction for dust extinction has low statisticalimpact. we find that our sn sample favors, on average, a very steep dust lawwith total to selective extinction r_v&lt;2. such an extinction law has beenrecently inferred for many sne ia. our results indicate that a distancemeasurement can be obtained with a single spectrum of a sn ii-p during theplateau phase combined with sparse photometric measurements.
