0901.4372	subaru weak lensing measurements of four strong lensing clusters: are  lensing clusters over-concentrated?	we derive radial mass profiles of four strong lensing selected clusters whichshow prominent giant arcs (abell 1703, sdss j1446+3032, sdss j1531+3414, andsdss j2111-0115), by combining detailed strong lens modeling with weak lensingshear measured from deep subaru suprime-cam images. weak lensing signals aredetected at high significance for all four clusters, whose redshifts range fromz=0.28 to 0.64. we demonstrate that adding strong lensing information withknown arc redshifts significantly improves constraints on the mass densityprofile, compared to those obtained from weak lensing alone. while the massprofiles are well fitted by the universal form predicted in n-body simulationsof the lcdm model, all four clusters appear to be slightly more centrallyconcentrated (the concentration parameters c_vir \sim 8) than theoreticalpredictions, even after accounting for the bias toward higher concentrationsinherent in lensing selected samples. our results are consistent with previousstudies which similarly detected a concentration excess, and increases thetotal number of clusters studied with the combined strong and weak lensingtechnique to ten. combining our sample with previous work, we find thatclusters with larger einstein radii are more anomalously concentrated. we alsopresent a detailed model of the lensing cluster a1703 with constraints frommultiple image families, and find the dark matter inner density profile to becuspy with the slope consistent with -1, in agreement with expectations.

0908.3907	binary quasars at high redshift i: 24 new quasar pairs at z ~ 3-4	the clustering of quasars on small scales yields fundamental constraints onmodels of quasar evolution and the buildup of supermassive black holes. thispaper describes the first systematic survey to discover high redshift binaryquasars. using color-selection and photometric redshift techniques, we searched8142 deg^2 of sdss imaging data for binary quasar candidates, and confirmedthem with follow-up spectroscopy. our sample of 27 high redshift binaries (24of them new discoveries) at redshifts 2.9 &lt; z &lt; 4.3 with proper transverseseparations 10 kpc &lt; r_{\perp} &lt; 650 kpc increases the number of such objectsknown by an order of magnitude. eight members of this sample are very closepairs with r_{\perp} &lt; 100 kpc, and of these close systems four are at z &gt; 3.5.the completeness and efficiency of our well-defined selection algorithm arequantified using simulated photometry and we find that our sample is ~ 50%complete. our companion paper uses this knowledge to make the first measurementof the small scale clustering (r &lt; 1 mpc/h comoving) of high-redshift quasars.high redshift binaries constitute exponentially rare coincidences of twoextreme (m &gt;~ 10^9 msun) supermassive black holes. at z ~ 4 there is about oneclose binary per 10 gpc^3, thus these could be the highest sigma peaks, theanalogs of superclusters, in the early universe.

1002.2642	selecting quasars by their intrinsic variability	we present a new and simple technique for selecting extensive, complete andpure quasar samples, based on their intrinsic variability. we parametrize thesingle-band variability by a power-law model for the light-curve structurefunction, with amplitude a and power-law index gamma. we show that quasars canbe efficiently separated from other non-variable and variable sources by thelocation of the individual sources in the a-gamma plane. we use ~60 epochs ofimaging data, taken over ~5 years, from the sdss stripe 82 (s82) survey, whereextensive spectroscopy provides a reference sample of quasars, to demonstratethe power of variability as a quasar classifier in multi-epoch surveys. foruv-excess selected objects, variability performs just as well as the standardsdss color selection, identifying quasars with a completeness of 90% and apurity of 95%. in the redshift range 2.5&lt;z&lt;3, where color selection is known tobe problematic, variability can select quasars with a completeness of 90% and apurity of 96%. this is a factor of 5-10 times more pure than existingcolor-selection of quasars in this redshift range. selecting objects from abroad griz color box without u-band information, variability selection in s82can afford completeness and purity of 92%, despite a factor of 30 morecontaminants than quasars in the color-selected feeder sample. this confirmsthat the fraction of quasars hidden in the 'stellar locus' of color-space issmall. to test variability selection in the context of pan-starrs 1 (ps1) wecreated mock ps1 data by down-sampling the s82 data to just 6 epochs over 3years. even with this much sparser time sampling, variability is anencouragingly efficient classifier. for instance, a 92% pure and 44% completequasar candidate sample is attainable from the above $griz$-selected catalog.

1010.6060	the redshift distribution of giant arcs in the sloan giant arcs survey	we measure the redshift distribution of a sample of 28 giant arcs discoveredas a part of the sloan giant arcs survey (sgas). gemini/gmos-north spectroscopyprovides precise redshifts for 24 arcs, and "redshift desert" constraints forthe remaining four. this is a direct measurement of the redshift distributionof a uniformly selected sample of bright giant arcs, which is an observablethat can be used to inform efforts to predict giant arc statistics. our primarygiant arc sample has a median redshift z=1.821 and nearly two thirds of thearcs - 64% - are sources at z \gtrsim 1.4, indicating that the population ofbackground sources that are strongly lensed into bright giant arcs residesprimarily at high redshift. we also analyze the distribution of redshifts for19 secondary strongly lensed background sources that are not visually apparentin sdss imaging, but were identified in deeper follow-up imaging of the lensingcluster fields. our redshift sample for the secondary sources is notspectroscopically complete, but combining it with our primary giant arc samplesuggests that a large fraction of all background galaxies which are stronglylensed by foreground clusters reside at z \gtrsim 1.4. kolmogorov-smirnov (ks)tests indicate that our well-selected, spectroscopically complete primary giantarc redshift sample can be reproduced with a model distribution that isconstructed from a combination of results from studies of strong lensingclusters in numerical simulations, and observational constraints on the galaxyluminosity function.

1105.0606	the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey: quasar target  selection for data release nine	the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), a five-yearspectroscopic survey of 10,000 deg^2, achieved first light in late 2009. one ofthe key goals of boss is to measure the signature of baryon acousticoscillations in the distribution of ly-alpha absorption from the spectra of asample of ~150,000 z&gt;2.2 quasars. along with measuring the angular diameterdistance at z\approx2.5, boss will provide the first direct measurement of theexpansion rate of the universe at z &gt; 2. one of the biggest challenges inachieving this goal is an efficient target selection algorithm for quasars over2.2 &lt; z &lt; 3.5, where their colors overlap those of stars. during the first yearof the boss survey, quasar target selection methods were developed and testedto meet the requirement of delivering at least 15 quasars deg^-2 in thisredshift range, out of 40 targets deg^-2. to achieve these surface densities,the magnitude limit of the quasar targets was set at g &lt;= 22.0 or r&lt;=21.85.while detection of the bao signature in the ly-alpha absorption in quasarspectra does not require a uniform target selection, many other astrophysicalstudies do. we therefore defined a uniformly-selected subsample of 20 targetsdeg^-2, for which the selection efficiency is just over 50%. this "core"subsample will be fixed for years two through five of the survey. in this paperwe describe the evolution and implementation of the boss quasar targetselection algorithms during the first two years of boss operations. we analyzethe spectra obtained during the first year. 11,263 new z&gt;2.2 quasars werespectroscopically confirmed by boss. our current algorithms select an averageof 15 z &gt; 2.2 quasars deg^-2 from 40 targets deg^-2 using single-epoch sdssimaging. multi-epoch optical data and data at other wavelengths can furtherimprove the efficiency and completeness of boss quasar target selection.[abridged]

1105.3975	photometric redshifts and quasar probabilities from a single,  data-driven generative model	we describe a technique for simultaneously classifying and estimating theredshift of quasars. it can separate quasars from stars in arbitrary redshiftranges, estimate full posterior distribution functions for the redshift, andnaturally incorporate flux uncertainties, missing data, and multi-wavelengthphotometry. we build models of quasars in flux-redshift space by applying theextreme deconvolution technique to estimate the underlying density. byintegrating this density over redshift one can obtain quasar flux-densities indifferent redshift ranges. this approach allows for efficient, consistent, andfast classification and photometric redshift estimation. this is achieved bycombining the speed obtained by choosing simple analytical forms as the basisof our density model with the flexibility of non-parametric models through theuse of many simple components with many parameters. we show that this techniqueis competitive with the best photometric quasar classificationtechniques---which are limited to fixed, broad redshift ranges and highsignal-to-noise ratio data---and with the best photometric redshift techniqueswhen applied to broadband optical data. we demonstrate that the inclusion of uvand nir data significantly improves photometric quasar--star separation andessentially resolves all of the redshift degeneracies for quasars inherent tothe ugriz filter system, even when included data have a low signal-to-noiseratio. for quasars spectroscopically confirmed by the sdss 84 and 97 percent ofthe objects with galex uv and ukidss nir data have photometric redshifts within0.1 and 0.3, respectively, of the spectroscopic redshift; this amounts to abouta factor of three improvement over ugriz-only photometric redshifts. our codeto calculate quasar probabilities and redshift probability distributions ispublicly available.

1109.2594	combined strong and weak lensing analysis of 28 clusters from the sloan  giant arcs survey	we study the mass distribution of a sample of 28 galaxy clusters using strongand weak lensing observations. the clusters are selected via their stronglensing properties as part of the sloan giant arcs survey (sgas) from the sloandigital sky survey (sdss). mass modelling of the strong lensing informationfrom the giant arcs is combined with weak lensing measurements from deepsubaru/suprime-cam images to primarily obtain robust constraints on theconcentration parameter and the shape of the mass distribution. we find thatthe concentration c_vir is a steep function of the mass, c_vir \proptom_vir^-0.59\pm0.12, with the value roughly consistent with thelensing-bias-corrected theoretical expectation for high mass (10^15 h^-1 m_sun)clusters. however, the observationally inferred concentration parameters appearto be much higher at lower masses (10^14 h^-1 m_sun), possibly a consequence ofthe modification to the inner density profiles provided by baryon cooling. thesteep mass-concentration relation is also supported from direct stackinganalysis of the tangential shear profiles. in addition, we explore thetwo-dimensional shape of the projected mass distribution by stacking weaklensing shear maps of individual clusters with prior information on theposition angle from strong lens modelling, and find significant evidence for alarge mean ellipticity with the best-fit value of e = 0.47 \pm 0.06 for themass distribution of the stacked sample. we find that the luminous clustermember galaxy distribution traces the overall mass distribution very well,although the distribution of fainter cluster galaxies appears to be moreextended than the total mass.

1211.6131	a substantial mass of cool, metal-enriched gas surrounding the  progenitors of modern-day ellipticals	the hosts of luminous z~2 quasars evolve into today's massive ellipticalgalaxies. current theories predict that the circum-galactic medium (cgm) ofthese massive, dark-matter halos (m~10^12.5 msun) should be dominated by at~10^7 k virialized plasma. we test this hypothesis with observations of 74close-projected quasar pairs, using spectra of the background qso tocharacterize the cgm of the foreground one. surprisingly, our measurementsreveal a cool (t~10^4 k), massive (m_cgm &gt; 10^10 msun), and metal-enriched (z &gt;~0.1 zsun) medium extending to at least the expected virial radius (r_vir = 160kpc). the average equivalent widths of hi lya (&lt;w_lya&gt; = 2.1 pm 0.15ang forimpact parameters r&lt;200 kpc) and cii 1334 (&lt;w_1334&gt; = 0.7 pm 0.1ang) exceed thecorresponding cgm measurements of these transitions from all galaxy populationsstudied previously. furthermore, we conservatively estimate that the quasar cgmhas a 64% covering fraction of optically thick gas (n_hi&gt;10^17.2) within r_vir;this covering factor is twice that of the contemporaneous lyman break galaxypopulation. this unexpected reservoir of cool gas is rarely detected"down-the-barrel" to quasars, and hence it is likely that our backgroundsightlines intercept gas which is shadowed from the quasar ionizing radiationby the same obscuring medium often invoked in models of agn unification.because the high-z halos inhabited by quasars predate modern groups andclusters, these observations are also relevant to the formation and enrichmenthistory of the intragroup/intracluster medium.

1301.4201	chemical enrichment of damped lyman alpha systems as a direct constraint  on population iii star formation	damped ly-alpha absorbers (dlas) can be used to measure gas-phasemetallicities at large cosmological lookback times with high precision.relative abundances can still be measured accurately deep into the reionizationepoch (z &gt; 6) using transitions redward of ly-alpha. here we study chemicalevolution of dlas using a constrained model for evolution of galaxies and igmto determine the degree to which dla abundance measurements can probepopulation iii enrichment. we find that if the critical metallicity ofpopulation iii to ii transition is &lt; 10^-4 zsun, the cosmic population iii sfris zero for z&lt;8. nevertheless, at high redshift (z ~ 6) population iii chemicalsignatures are retained in low-mass galaxies (halo mass &lt; 10^9 msun). this isbecause photoionization feedback suppresses star formation in these galaxiesuntil relatively low redshift (z ~ 10), and the chemical record of earlypopulation iii star formation is retained. we model dlas as these galaxies byassigning to them a mass-dependent h i absorption cross section and predictdistribution of dla abundance ratios. we find that these distributions areanchored towards abundance ratios set by population ii yields, but exhibit atail that depends on the population iii imf for z &gt; 5. thus, a sample of dlaabundance measurements at high redshift holds the promise to constrainpopulation iii imf. a sample of just 10 dlas with relative abundances measuredto an accuracy of 0.1 dex is sufficient to constrain the population iii imf at4-sigma. these constraints may prove stronger than other probes such asmetal-poor stars and individual dlas. our results provide a global picture ofthe cosmic thermal, ionization, and chemical evolution, and can rule outcertain population iii scenarios.

1303.2708	quasars probing quasars iv: joint constraints on the circumgalactic  medium from absorption and emission	we have constructed a sample of 29 close projected quasar pairs where thebackground quasar spectrum reveals absorption from optically thick hi gasassociated with the foreground quasar. these unique sightlines allow us tostudy the quasar circumgalactic medium (cgm) in absorption and emissionsimultaneously, because the background quasar pinpoints large concentrations ofgas where ly-a emission, resulting from quasar-powered fluorescence, resonantly-a scattering, and/or cooling radiation, is expected. a sensitiveslit-spectroscopic search (1-sigma limits of sb_lya ~= 3e-18erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2) for diffuse ly-a emission in the environments of theforeground quasars is conducted. we fail to detect large-scale ~ 100 kpc ly-aemission, either at the location of the optically thick absorbers or in theforeground quasar halos, in all cases except a single system. we interpretthese non-detections as evidence that the gas detected in absorption isshadowed from the quasar uv radiation due to obscuration effects, which arefrequently invoked in unified models of agn. small-scale r_perp &lt;~ 50 kpcextended ly-a nebulosities are detected in 34% of our sample, which are likelythe high-redshift analogs of the extended emission-line regions commonlyobserved around low-redshift (z &lt; 0.5) quasars. we also detect a compact highrest-frame equivalent width (w_lya &gt; 50 a) ly-alpha-emitter with luminosityl_lya =2.1+-0.32e41 erg/s at small impact parameter r_perp=134 kpc from oneforeground quasar, and argue that it is more likely to result fromquasar-powered fluorescence, than simply be a star-forming galaxy clusteredaround the quasar. our observations imply that much deeper integrations withupcoming integral-field spectrometers such as muse and kcwi will be able toroutinely detect a diffuse ly-a glow around bright quasars on scales r ~ 100kpc and thus directly image the cgm.

1305.0210	a new method to directly measure the jeans scale of the intergalactic  medium using close quasar pairs	although the baryons in the intergalactic medium (igm) trace dark matter onmpc scales, small-scale (~100 kpc) fluctuations are suppressed by pressuresupport, analogous to the classical jeans argument. this jeans filtering scalehas fundamental cosmological implications: it provides a thermal record of heatinjected by uv photons during reionization events, determines the clumpiness ofthe igm, and sets the minimum mass scale for gravitational collapse, a keyquantity in galaxy formation. unfortunately, it is extremely challenging tomeasure via the standard analysis of purely longitudinal lyman-alpha forestspectra, because the thermal doppler broadening of absorption lines is highlydegenerate with jeans pressure smoothing. in this work we show that the jeansscale can be directly measured by characterizing the coherence of correlatedlyman-alpha absorption in quasar pairs with separations small enough to resolveit. we present a novel technique for this purpose, based on the probabilitydistribution function (pdf) of phase angle differences of homologouslongitudinal fourier modes in close quasar pair spectra. a bayesian formalismis introduced based on the phase angle pdf, and mcmc techniques are used tocharacterize the precision of a future jeans scale measurement, and exploredegeneracies with other thermal parameters governing the igm. a semi-analyticalmodel of the igm is used to generate a grid of 500 thermal models from a darkmatter simulation. our full parameter study indicates that a realistic sampleof only 20 close quasar pair spectra can pinpoint the jeans scale to ~ 5%precision, independent of the parameters governing the temperature-densityrelation of the igm. we show that this new method is insensitive to a batteryof systematics such as continuum fitting errors, imprecise knowledge of thenoise and spectral resolution, and metal-line absorption.

1307.6588	metal-poor, cool gas in the circumgalactic medium of a z = 2.4  star-forming galaxy: direct evidence for cold accretion?	in our current galaxy formation paradigm, high-redshift galaxies arepredominantly fuelled by accretion of cool, metal-poor gas from theintergalactic medium. hydrodynamical simulations predict that this materialshould be observable in absorption against background sightlines within agalaxy's virial radius, as optically thick lyman-limit systems (llss) with lowmetallicities. here we report the discovery of exactly such a strong metal-poorabsorber at an impact parameter r_perp = 58 kpc from a star-forming galaxy at z= 2.44. besides strong neutral hydrogen [n(hi) = 10^(19.50 +/- 0.16) cm^-2] wedetect neutral deuterium and oxygen, allowing a precise measurement of themetallicity: log10(z / zsolar) = -2.0 +/- 0.17, or (7-15) x 10^-3 solar.furthermore, the narrow deuterium linewidth requires a cool temperature &lt;20,000 k. given the striking similarities between this system and thepredictions of simulations, we argue that it represents the direct detection ofa high redshift cold-accretion stream. the low-metallicity gas cloud is asingle component of an absorption system exhibiting a complex velocity,ionization, and enrichment structure. two other components have metallicities &gt;0.1 solar, ten times larger than the metal-poor component. we conclude that thephotoionized circumgalactic medium (cgm) of this galaxy is highlyinhomogeneous: the majority of the gas is in a cool, metal-poor andpredominantly neutral phase, but the majority of the metals are in ahighly-ionized phase exhibiting weak neutral hydrogen absorption but strongmetal absorption. if such inhomogeneity is common, then high-resolution spectraand detailed ionization modelling are critical to accurately appraise thedistribution of metals in the high-redshift cgm.

1308.1669	confronting simulations of optically thick gas in massive halos with  observations at z=2-3	cosmological hydrodynamic simulations predict the physical state of baryonsin the circumgalactic medium (cgm), which can be directly tested via quasarabsorption line observations. we use high resolution "zoom-in" simulations of21 galaxies to characterize the distribution of neutral hydrogen around halosin the mass range m_vir~ 2x10^11 - 4x10^12 m_sun at z~2. we find that both themass fraction of cool (t &lt;= 3x10^4 k) gas and the covering fraction ofoptically-thick lyman limit systems (llss) depend only weakly on halo mass,even around the critical value for the formation of stable virial shocks. thecovering fraction of llss interior to the virial radius varies between f_c~0.05- 0.2, with significant scatter among halos. our simulations of massive halos(m_vir &gt;= 10^12 m_sun) underpredict the covering fraction of optically-thickgas observed in the quasar cgm by a large factor. the reason for thisdiscrepancy is unclear, but several possibilities are discussed. in the lowermass halos (m_vir &gt;= 5x10^11 m_sun) hosting star-forming galaxies, thepredicted covering factor agrees with observations, however current samples ofquasar-galaxy pairs are too small for a conclusive comparison. to overcome thislimitation, we propose a new observable: the small-scale auto-correlationfunction of optically-thick absorbers detected in the foreground of closequasar pairs. we show that this new observable can constrain the underlyingdark halos hosting llss at z~2-3, as well as the characteristic size andcovering factor of the cgm.

1308.6222	quasars probing quasars vi. excess hi absorption within one proper mpc  of z~2 quasars	with close pairs of quasars at different redshifts, a background quasarsightline can be used to study a foreground quasar's environment in absorption.we use a sample of 650 projected quasar pairs to study the hi lya absorptiontransverse to luminous, z~2 quasars at proper separations of 30kpc &lt; r &lt; 1mpc.in contrast to measurements along the line-of-sight, regions transverse toquasars exhibit enhanced hi lya absorption and a larger variance than theambient intergalactic medium, with increasing absorption and variance towardsmaller scales. analysis of composite spectra reveals excess absorptioncharacterized by a lya equivalent width profile w = 2.3a (r/100kpc)^-0.46. wealso observe a high (~60%) covering factor of strong, optically thick hiabsorbers (hi column log nhi &gt; 17.3) at separations r&lt;200kpc, which decreasesto ~20% at r~1mpc, but still represents a significant excess over the cosmicaverage. this excess of optically thick absorption can be described by aquasar-absorber cross-correlation function xi_qa(r) = (r/r_0)^gamma with alarge correlation length r_0 = 12.5+2.7-1.4 mpc/h (comoving) and gamma =1.68+0.14-0.30. the hi absorption measured around quasars exceeds that of anypreviously studied population, consistent with quasars being hosted by massivedark matter halos mhalo~10^12.5 msun at z~2.5. the environments of thesemassive halos are highly biased towards producing optically thick gas, and mayeven dominate the cosmic abundance of lyman limit systems and hence theintergalactic opacity to ionizing photons at z~2.5. the anisotropic absorptionaround quasars implies the transverse direction is much less likely to beilluminated by ionizing radiation than the line-of-sight, which we interpret interms of the same obscuration effects frequently invoked in unified models ofactive galactic nuclei.

1310.0684	chemical constraints on the contribution of population iii stars to  cosmic reionization	recent studies have highlighted that galaxies at z = 6-8 fall short ofproducing enough ionizing photons to reionize the igm, and suggest thatpopulation iii stars could resolve this tension, because their harder spectracan produce ~10x more ionizing photons than population ii. but this argumentdepends critically on the duration of the population iii era, and becausepopulation iii stars form from pristine gas, in turn depends on the rate ofgalactic enrichment. we use a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation whichtracks galactic chemical evolution, to gauge the impact of population iii starson reionization. population iii sne produce distinct metal abundances, and weargue that the duration of the population iii era can be constrained by preciserelative abundance measurements in high-z damped ly{\alpha} absorbers (dlas),which provide a chemical record of past star-formation. we find that a singlegeneration of population iii stars can self-enrich galaxies above the criticalmetallicity zcrit=10^-4 zsun for the population iii-to-ii transition, on a veryshort timescale of ~10^6 yr, owing to the large metal yields and shortlifetimes of population iii stars. this subsequently terminates the populationiii era, hence they contribute &gt;~ 50% of the ionizing photons only for z &gt;~ 30,and at z=10 contribute &lt;1%. the population iii contribution can be increased bydelaying metal mixing into the ism. however comparing the resulting metalabundance pattern to existing measurements in z &lt;~ 6 dlas, we show that thefractional contribution of high-mass population iii stars to the ionizationrate must be &lt;~ 10% at z = 10. future abundance measurements of z~7-8 qsos andgrbs should probe the era when the chemical vestiges of population iii starformation become detectable.

1406.4239	metal-enriched, sub-kiloparsec gas clumps in the circumgalactic medium  of a faint z = 2.5 galaxy	we report the serendipitous detection of a 0.2 l$^*$, lyman-$\alpha$ emittinggalaxy at redshift 2.5 at an impact parameter of 50 kpc from a brightbackground qso sightline. a high-resolution spectrum of the qso reveals apartial lyman-limit absorption system ($n_\mathrm{hi}=10^{16.94\pm0.10}$cm$^{-2}$) with many associated metal absorption lines at the same redshift asthe foreground galaxy. using photoionization models that carefully treatmeasurement errors and marginalise over uncertainties in the shape andnormalisation of the ionizing radiation spectrum, we derive the total hydrogencolumn density $n_\mathrm{h}=10^{19.4\pm0.3}$ cm$^{-2}$, and show that all theabsorbing clouds are metal enriched, with $z=0.1$-$0.6 z_\odot$. thesemetallicities and the system's large velocity width ($436$ km$\,$s$^{-1}$)suggest the gas is produced by an outflowing wind. using an expanding shellmodel we estimate a mass outflow rate of $\sim5 m_\odot\,$yr$^{-1}$. ourphotoionization model yields extremely small sizes ($&lt;$100-500 pc) for theabsorbing clouds, which we argue are typical of high column density absorbersin the circumgalactic medium (cgm). given these small sizes and extremekinematics, it is unclear how the clumps survive in the cgm without beingdestroyed by hydrodynamic instabilities. the small cloud sizes imply that evenstate-of-the-art cosmological simulations require more than a $1000$-foldimprovement in mass resolution to resolve the hydrodynamics relevant for coolgas in the cgm.

1407.2944	a deep narrowband imaging search for civ and he ii emission from  ly$\alpha$ blobs	we conduct a deep narrow-band imaging survey of 13 ly$\alpha$ blobs (labs)located in the ssa22 proto-cluster at z~3.1 in the civ and heii emission linesin an effort to constrain the physical process powering the ly$\alpha$ emissionin labs. our observations probe down to unprecedented surface brightness limitsof 2.1 $-$ 3.4 $\times$ 10$^{-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ per 1arcsec$^2$ aperture (5$\sigma$) for the heii$\lambda$1640 and civ$\lambda$1549lines, respectively. we do not detect extended heii and civ emission in any ofthe labs, placing strong upper limits on the heii/ly$\alpha$ and civ/ly$\alpha$line ratios, of 0.11 and 0.16, for the brightest two labs in the field. weconduct detailed photoionization modeling of the expected line ratios and findthat, although our data constitute the deepest ever observations of theselines, they are still not deep enough to rule out a scenario where thely$\alpha$ emission is powered by the ionizing luminosity of an obscured agn.our models can accommodate heii/ly$\alpha$ and civ/ly$\alpha$ ratios as low as$\simeq$0.05 and $\simeq$0.07 respectively, implying that one needs to reachsurface brightness as low as 1 $-$ 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{-18}$ erg s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$ (at 5$\sigma$) in order to rule out a photoionizationscenario. these depths will be achievable with the new generation ofimage-slicing integral field units such as vlt/muse or keck/kcwi. we also modelthe expected heii/ly$\alpha$ and civ/ly$\alpha$ in a different scenario, wherely$\alpha$ emission is powered by shocks generated in a large-scale superwind,but find that our observational constraints can only be met for shockvelocities $v_{\rm s} \gtrsim$ 250 km s$^{-1}$, which appear to be in conflictwith recent observations of quiescent kinematics in labs.

(2014) of the largest (~500 kpc) andluminous ly-alpha nebula associated with the quasar um287 (z=2.279) poses agreat challenge to our current understanding of the astrophysics of the haloshosting massive z~2 galaxies. either an enormous reservoir of cool gas isrequired $m\simeq10^{12}$ $m_{\odot}$, exceeding the expected baryonic massavailable, or one must invoke extreme gas clumping factors not present inhigh-resolution cosmological simulations. however, observations of ly-alphaemission alone cannot distinguish between these two scenarios. we have obtainedthe deepest ever spectroscopic integrations in the heii and civ lines with thegoal of detecting extended line emission, but detect neither line to a3$\sigma$ limiting sb $\simeq10^{-18}$ erg/s/cm$^2$/arcsec$^2$. we constructmodels of the expected emission spectrum in the highly probable scenario thatthe nebula is powered by photoionization from the central hyper-luminousquasar. the non-detection of heii implies that the nebular emission arises froma mass $m_{\rm c}\lesssim6.4\times10^{10}$ $m_{\odot}$ of cool gas on ~200 kpcscales, distributed in a population of remarkably dense ($n_{\rm h}\gtrsim3$cm$^{-3}$) and compact ($r\lesssim20$ pc) clouds, which would clearly beunresolved by current cosmological simulations. given the large gas motionssuggested by the ly-alpha line ($v\simeq$ 500 km/s), it is unclear how theseclouds survive without being disrupted by hydrodynamic instabilities. our studyserves as a benchmark for future deep integrations with current and plannedwide-field ifu such as muse, kcwi, and kmos. our work suggest that a $\simeq$10 hr exposure would likely detect ~10 rest-frame uv/optical emission lines,opening up the possibility of conducting detailed photoionization modeling toinfer the physical state of gas in the cgm.

1509.02833	shadow of a colossus: a z=2.45 galaxy protocluster detected in 3d ly-a  forest tomographic mapping of the cosmos field	using moderate-resolution optical spectra from 58 background lyman-breakgalaxies and quasars at $z\sim 2.3-3$ within a $11.5'\times13.5'$ area of thecosmos field ($\sim 1200\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ projected area density or $\sim2.4\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{mpc}$ mean transverse separation), we reconstruct a 3dtomographic map of the foreground ly$\alpha$ forest absorption at $2.2&lt;z&lt;2.5$with an effective smoothing scale of$\sigma_{3d}\approx3.5\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{mpc}$ comoving. comparing with 61coeval galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the same volume, we find thatthe galaxy positions are clearly biased towards regions with enhanced igmabsorption in the tomographic map. we find an extended igm overdensity withdeep absorption troughs at $z=2.45$ associated with a recently-discoveredgalaxy protocluster at the same redshift. based on simulations matched to ourdata, we estimate the enclosed dark matter mass within this igm overdensity tobe $m_{\rm dm} (z=2.45) = (9\pm4)\times 10^{13}\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{m_\odot}$, andargue based on this mass and absorption strength that it will form at least one$z\sim0$ galaxy cluster with $m(z=0) = (3\pm 2) \times10^{14}\,h^{-1}\mathrm{m_\odot}$, although its elongated nature suggests thatit will likely collapse into two separate clusters. we also point out a compactoverdensity of six mosdef galaxies at $z=2.30$ within a $r\sim1\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{mpc}$ radius and $\delta z\sim 0.006$, which does not appearto have a large associated igm overdensity. these results demonstrate thepotential of ly$\alpha$ forest tomography on larger volumes to study galaxyproperties as a function of environment, as well as revealing the large-scaleigm overdensities associated with protoclusters and other features oflarge-scale structure.

0807.2271	a z = 3 lyman alpha blob associated with a damped lyman alpha system  proximate to its background quasar	we report on the discovery of a bright lyman alpha blob associated with thez=3 quasar sdssj124020.91+145535.6 which is also coincident with strong dampedlyman alpha absorption from a foreground galaxy (a so-called proximate dampedlyman alpha system; pdla). the one dimensional spectrum acquired by the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) shows a broad lyman alpha emission line with a fwhm ~500 km/s and a luminosity of l_{lya} = 3.9e43 erg/s superposed on the trough ofthe pdla. mechanisms for powering this large lyman alpha luminosity arediscussed. we argue against emission from hii regions in the pdla galaxy sincethis requires an excessive star-formation rate ~ 500 msun/yr and wouldcorrespond to the largest lyman alpha luminosity ever measured from a dampedlyman alpha system or starburst galaxy. we use a monte carlo radiative transfersimulation to investigate the possibility that the line emission is fluorescentrecombination radiation from the pdla galaxy powered by the ionizing flux ofthe quasar, but find that the predicted lyman alpha flux is several orders ofmagnitude lower than observed. we conclude that the lyman alpha emission is notassociated with the pdla galaxy at all, but instead is intrinsic to thequasar's host and similar to the extended lyman alpha 'fuzz' which is detectedaround many agn. pdlas are natural coronagraphs that block their backgroundquasar at lyman alpha, and we discuss how systems similar tosdssj124020.91+145535.6 might be used to image the neutral hydrogen in the pdlagalaxy in silhouette against the screen of extended lyman alpha emission fromthe background quasar.

astro-ph;0108203	observational constraints on the self interacting dark matter scenario  and the growth of supermassive black holes	we consider the consequences of sidm for a velocity dependent cross sectionper unit mass. accretion of sidm onto seed black holes can produce supermassiveblack holes that are too large for certain combinations of parameters,which isused to obtain a new constraint on the dark matter interaction. constraints dueto other considerations are presented and previous ones are generalized. theblack hole constraint is extremely sensitive to the slope \alpha, of the innerdensity profile of dark halos. for the most probable value of \alpha=1.3, thereexists a narrow range in parameter space, such that all constraints aresatisfied. however, the adiabatic compression of the dark halo by baryons asthey cool and contract in normal galaxies yields a steeper cusp, \alpha=1.7.this gives a tighter constraint, which would exclude sidm as a possiblesolution to the purported problems with cdm in the absence of other dynamicalprocesses. nevertheless, sidm with parameters consistent with this strongerconstraint, can explain the ubiquity of supermassive black holes in the centersof galaxies. a ``best fit'' model is presented which reproduces thesupermassive black hole masses and their observed correlations with thevelocity dispersion of the host bulges. specifically, the fourth powerdependence of black hole mass on velocity dispersion is a direct consequence ofthe power spectrum having an index of n=-2. although the dark matter collisionrates for this model are too small to directly remedy problems with cdm,mergers between dark halos harboring supermassive black holes at high redshiftcould ameliorate the cuspy halo problem. this scenario also explains the lackof comparable supermassive black holes in bulgeless galaxies like m33.

astro-ph;0309337	beyond the damping tail: cross-correlating the kinetic  sunyaev-zel'dovich effect with cosmic shear	secondary anisotropies of the cmb have the potential to reveal intricatedetails about the history of our universe between the present and recombinationepochs. however, because the cmb we observe is the projected sum of a multitudeof effects, the interpretation of small scale anisotropies by future highresolution experiments will be marred by uncertainty and speculation withoutthe handles provided by other observations. in this paper we show that crosscorrelating the cmb with an overlapping weak lensing survey will isolate theelusive kinetic sunyaev-zel'dovich effect from secondary anisotropies generatedat higher redshifts. we show that if upcoming high angular resolution cmbexperiments, like planck/act/spt, cover the same area of sky as current andfuture weak lensing surveys, like cfthls/snap/lsst, the cross correlation ofcosmic shear with the ksz effect will be detected with high signal to noiseratio, increasing the potential science accessible to both sets of surveys. forexample, if act and a cfhtls like survey were to overlap this cross-correlationwould be detected with a total signal to noise ratio greater than 220, reaching1.8 per individual multipole around l \sim 5000. furthermore, thiscross-correlation probes the three point coupling between the underlying darkmatter and the "momentum" of the ionized baryons in the densest regions of theuniverse at intermediate redshifts. similar to the tsz power spectrum, itsstrength is extremely sensitive to the power spectrum normalization parameter,\sigma_8, scaling roughly as \sigma_8^7. it provides an effective mechanism toisolate any component of anisotropy due to patchy reionization and rule outprimordial small scale anisotropy.

astro-ph;0404349	shear selected cluster cosmology i: tomography and optimal filtering	we study the potential of weak lensing surveys to detect clusters ofgalaxies, using a fast particle mesh cosmological n-body simulation algorithmspecifically tailored to investigate the statistics of these mass-selectedclusters. in particular, we explore the degree to which the radial positions ofgalaxy clusters can be determined tomographically, by using photometricredshifts of background source galaxies. we quantify the errors in thetomographic redshifts, and study their dependence on mass, redshift, detectionsignificance, and filtering scheme. a tomographic matched filtering (tmf)scheme, which combines tomography and matched filtering, is introduced, whichoptimally detects clusters of galaxies in weak lensing surveys. the tmfexploits the extra information provided by photometric redshifts of backgroundsource galaxies, neglected in previous studies, to optimally weight thesources. the efficacy and reliability of the tmf is investigated using a largeensemble of mock observations from our simulations and detailed comparisons aremade to other filters. using photometric redshift information with the tmfenhances the number of clusters detected with s/n &gt; 4.5 by as much as 76%, andit increases the dynamic range of weak lensing searches for clusters, detectingmore high redshift clusters and extending the mass sensitivity down to thescale of large groups. furthermore, we find that coarsely binning sourcegalaxies in as few as three redshift bins is sufficient to realize the gains ofthe tmf. thus, the tomographic filtering techniques presented here can beapplied to current ground based weak lensing data in as few as three bands.cosmological applications of mass selected cluster samples are also discussed.(abridged)

astro-ph;0703594	the sdss-dr5 survey for proximate damped lya systems	using the sloan digital sky survey, data release 5, we survey proximatedamped lya systems (pdlas): absorption line systems with hi column densityn(hi)&gt; 2x10^20 cm^{-2} at velocity separation dv &lt; 3000 km/s from theirbackground quasar. these absorbers are physically associated with theirbackground quasars, and their statistics allow us to study quasar environmentsout to z~5. however, the large ionizing flux emitted by a quasar can ionize theneutral gas in a nearby galaxy possibly giving rise to a ``proximity effect'',analogous to the similar effect observed in the lya forest. from a sample of111 pdlas, we measure the hi frequency distribution f(n), incidence, and gasmass density of the pdlas near luminous quasars over the redshift interval z=2.2 to 5. the incidence and mass density of pdlas at z~3 is approximately twicethat of intervening dlas, but at z&lt;2.5 and z&gt;3.5 the f(n) distribution isconsistent with the intervening population. we interpret the observedenhancement of pdlas around quasars in terms of quasar-galaxy clustering, andcompare the strength of the clustering signal to the expectation fromindependent measures of the respective clustering strengths of dlas andquasars, as well as a complementary analysis of the clustering of absorbersaround quasars in the transverse direction. we find that there are a factor of5-10 fewer pdlas around quasars than expected and interpret this result asevidence for the hypothesis that the ionizing flux from the quasarsphotoevaporates hi in nearby dla galaxies, thus reducing their cross-sectionfor dla absorption. this constitues the first detection of a ``proximityeffect'' for dlas.

0810.4144	quasar clustering from sdss dr5: dependences on physical properties	using a homogenous sample of 38,208 quasars with a sky coverage of $4000 {\rmdeg^2}$ drawn from the sdss data release five quasar catalog, we study thedependence of quasar clustering on luminosity, virial black hole mass, quasarcolor, and radio loudness. at $z&lt;2.5$, quasar clustering depends weakly onluminosity and virial black hole mass, with typical uncertainty levels $\sim10%$ for the measured correlation lengths. these weak dependences areconsistent with models in which substantial scatter between quasar luminosity,virial black hole mass and the host dark matter halo mass has diluted anyclustering difference, where halo mass is assumed to be the relevant quantitythat best correlates with clustering strength. however, the most luminous andmost massive quasars are more strongly clustered (at the $\sim 2\sigma$ level)than the remainder of the sample, which we attribute to the rapid increase ofthe bias factor at the high-mass end of host halos. we do not observe a strongdependence of clustering strength on quasar colors within our sample. on theother hand, radio-loud quasars are more strongly clustered than are radio-quietquasars matched in redshift and optical luminosity (or virial black hole mass),consistent with local observations of radio galaxies and radio-loud type 2 agn.thus radio-loud quasars reside in more massive and denser environments in thebiased halo clustering picture. using the sheth et al.(2001) formula for thelinear halo bias, the estimated host halo mass for radio-loud quasars is $\sim10^{13} h^{-1}m_\odot$, compared to $\sim 2\times 10^{12} h^{-1}m_\odot$ forradio-quiet quasar hosts at $z\sim 1.5$.
