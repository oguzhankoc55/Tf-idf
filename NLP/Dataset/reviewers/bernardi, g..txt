0904.0404	foregrounds for observations of the cosmological 21 cm line: i. first  westerbork measurements of galactic emission at 150 mhz in a low latitude  field	we present the first results from a series of observations conducted with thewesterbork telescope in the 140--160 mhz range with a 2 arcmin resolution aimedat characterizing the properties of the foregrounds for epoch of reionizationexperiments. for the first time we have detected fluctuations in the galacticdiffuse emission on scales greater than 13 arcmin at 150 mhz, in the lowgalactic latitude area known as fan region. those fluctuations have an $rms$ of14 k. the total intensity power spectrum shows a power--law behaviour down to$\ell \sim 900$ with slope $\beta^i_\ell = -2.2 \pm 0.3$. the detection ofdiffuse emission at smaller angular scales is limited by residual pointsources. we measured an $rms$ confusion noise of $\sim$3 mjy beam$^{-1}$.diffuse polarized emission was also detected for the first time at thisfrequency. the polarized signal shows complex structure both spatially andalong the line of sight. the polarization power spectrum shows a power--lawbehaviour down to $\ell \sim 2700$ with slope $\beta^p_\ell = -1.65 \pm 0.15$.the $rms$ of polarization fluctuations is 7.2 k on 4 arcmin scales. byextrapolating the measured spectrum of total intensity emission, we find acontamination on the cosmological signal of $\delta t= \sqrt{\ell (\ell+1)c^i_\ell / 2\pi} \sim 5.7$ k on 5 arcmin scales and a corresponding $rms$ valueof $\sim$18.3 k at the same angular scale. the level of the polarization powerspectrum is $\delta t \sim 3.3$ k on 5 arcmin scales. given its exceptionallybright polarized signal, the fan region is likely to represent an upper limiton the sky brightness at moderate and high galactic latitude.

0907.4861	the parkes galactic meridian survey (pgms): observations and cmb  polarization foreground analysis	we present observations and cmb foreground analysis of the parkes galacticmeridian survey (pgms), an investigation of the galactic latitude behaviour ofthe polarized synchrotron emission at 2.3 ghz with the parkes radio telescope.the survey consists of a 5-deg wide strip along the galactic meridian l=254-degextending from galactic plane to south galactic pole. we identify three zonesdistinguished by polarized emission properties: the disc, the halo, and atransition region connecting them. the halo section lies at latitudes |b| &gt;40-deg and has weak and smooth polarized emission mostly at large scale withsteep angular power spectra of median slope $\beta_{\rm med} \sim -2.6$. thedisc region covers the latitudes |b|&lt;20-deg and has a brighter, more complexemission dominated by the small scales with flatter spectra of median slope$\beta_{\rm med} = -1.8$. the transition region has steep spectra as in thehalo, but the emission increases toward the galactic plane from halo to disclevels. the change of slope and emission structure at $b \sim -20\degr$ issudden, indicating a sharp disc-halo transition. the whole halo section is justone environment extended over 50-deg with very low emission which, once scaledto 70ghz, is equivalent to the cmb b-mode emission for a tensor-to-scalarperturbation power ratio r_halo = 3.3 +/- 0.4 x 10^{-3}. applying aconservative cleaning procedure, we estimate an r detection limit of $\delta r\sim 2\times 10^{-3}$ at 70~ghz (3-sigma c.l.) and, assuming a dust polariztionfraction &lt;12%, $\delta r \sim 1\times 10^{-2}$ at 150~ghz. the 150-ghz limitmatches the goals of planned sub-orbital experiments, which can therefore beconducted at this high frequency. the 70-ghz limit is close to the goal ofproposed next generation space missions, which thus might not strictly requirespace-based platforms.

1002.1957	post-correlation radio frequency interference classification methods	we describe and compare several post-correlation radio frequency interferenceclassification methods. as data sizes of observations grow with new andimproved telescopes, the need for completely automated, robust methods forradio frequency interference mitigation is pressing. we investigated severalclassification methods and find that, for the data sets we used, the mostaccurate among them is the sumthreshold method. this is a new method formedfrom a combination of existing techniques, including a new way of thresholding.this iterative method estimates the astronomical signal by carrying out asurface fit in the time-frequency plane. with a theoretical accuracy of 95%recognition and an approximately 0.1% false probability rate in simplesimulated cases, the method is in practice as good as the human eye in findingrfi. in addition it is fast, robust, does not need a data model before it canbe executed and works in almost all configurations with its default parameters.the method has been compared using simulated data with several other mitigationtechniques, including one based upon the singular value decomposition of thetime-frequency matrix, and has shown better results than the rest.

1002.4177	foregrounds for observations of the cosmological 21 cm line: ii.  westerbork observations of the fields around 3c196 and the north celestial  pole	in the coming years a new insight into galaxy formation and the thermalhistory of the universe is expected to come from the detection of the highlyredshifted cosmological 21 cm line. the cosmological 21 cm line signal isburied under galactic and extragalactic foregrounds which are likely to be afew orders of magnitude brighter. strategies and techniques for effectivesubtraction of these foreground sources require a detailed knowledge of theirstructure in both intensity and polarization on the relevant angular scales of1-30 arcmin. we present results from observations conducted with the westerborktelescope in the 140-160 mhz range with 2 arcmin resolution in two fieldslocated at intermediate galactic latitude, centred around the bright quasar3c196 and the north celestial pole. they were observed with the purpose ofcharacterizing the foreground properties in sky areas where actual observationsof the cosmological 21 cm line could be carried out. the polarization data wereanalysed through the rotation measure synthesis technique. we have computedtotal intensity and polarization angular power spectra. total intensity mapswere carefully calibrated, reaching a high dynamic range, 150000:1 in the caseof the 3c196 field.

1008.3530	deep multi-frequency rotation measure tomography of the galaxy cluster  a2255	we aim to unveil their 3-dimensional geometry of abell 2255 through wsrtobservations at 18, 21, 25, 85, and 200 cm. the polarization images of thecluster were processed through rotation measure (rm) synthesis, producing threefinal rm cubes. the radio galaxies and the filaments at the edges of the haloare detected in the high-frequency rm cube, obtained by combining the data at18, 21, and 25 cm. their faraday spectra show different levels of complexity.the radio galaxies lying near by the cluster center have faraday spectra withmultiple peaks, while those at large distances show only one peak, as do thefilaments. similar rm distributions are observed for the external radiogalaxies and for the filaments, with much lower average rm values and rmvariance than those found in previous works for the central radio galaxies. the85 cm rm cube is dominated by the galactic foreground emission, but it alsoshows features associated with the cluster. at 2 m, no polarized emission froma2255 nor our galaxy is detected. the radial trend observed in the rmdistributions of the radio galaxies and in the complexity of their faradayspectra favors the interpretation that the external faraday screen for all thesources in a2255 is the icm. its differential contribution depends on theamount of medium that the radio signal crosses along the line of sight. thefilaments should therefore be located at the periphery of the cluster, andtheir apparent central location comes from projection effects. their highfractional polarization and morphology suggest that they are relics rather thanpart of a genuine radio halo. their inferred large distance from the clustercenter and their geometry could argue for an association with large-scalestructure (lss) shocks.

1012.3719	subtraction of point sources from interferometric radio images through  an algebraic forward modeling scheme	we present a method for subtracting point sources from interferometric radioimages via forward modeling of the instrument response and involving analgebraic nonlinear minimization. the method is applied to simulated maps ofthe murchison wide-field array but is generally useful in cases where onlyimage data are available. after source subtraction, the residual maps have nostatistical difference to the expected thermal noise distribution at allangular scales, indicating high effectiveness in the subtraction. simulationsindicate that the errors in recovering the source parameters decrease withincreasing signal-to-noise ratio, which is consistent with the theoreticalmeasurement errors. in applying the technique to simulated snapshotobservations with the murchison wide-field array, we found that all 101 sourcespresent in the simulation were recovered with an average position error of 10arcsec and an average flux density error of 0.15%. this led to a dynamic rangeincrease of approximately 3 orders of magnitude. since all the sources weredeconvolved jointly, the subtraction was not limited by source sidelobes but bythermal noise. this technique is a promising deconvolution method for upcomingradio arrays with a huge number of elements, and a candidate for the difficulttask of subtracting foreground sources from observations of the 21 cm neutralhydrogen signal from the epoch of reionization.

1203.1293	a new layout optimization technique for interferometric arrays, applied  to the mwa	antenna layout is an important design consideration for radio interferometersbecause it determines the quality of the snapshot point spread function (psf,or array beam). this is particularly true for experiments targeting the 21 cmepoch of reionization signal as the quality of the foreground subtractiondepends directly on the spatial dynamic range and thus the smoothness of thebaseline distribution. nearly all sites have constraints on where antennas canbe placed---even at the remote australian location of the mwa (murchisonwidefield array) there are rock outcrops, flood zones, heritages areas,emergency runways and trees. these exclusion areas can introduce spatialstructure into the baseline distribution that enhance the psf sidelobes andreduce the angular dynamic range. in this paper we present a new method ofconstrained antenna placement that reduces the spatial structure in thebaseline distribution. this method not only outperforms random placementalgorithms that avoid exclusion zones, but surprisingly outperforms randomplacement algorithms without constraints to provide what we believe are thesmoothest constrained baseline distributions developed to date. we use our newalgorithm to determine antenna placements for the originally planned mwa, andpresent the antenna locations, baseline distribution, and snapshot psf for thisarray choice.

1204.3864	wide-band simultaneous observations of pulsars: disentangling dispersion  measure and profile variations	dispersion in the interstellar medium is a well known phenomenon that followsa simple relationship, which has been used to predict the time delay ofdispersed radio pulses since the late 1960s. we performed wide-bandsimultaneous observations of four pulsars with lofar (at 40-190 mhz), the 76-mlovell telescope (at 1400 mhz) and the effelsberg 100-m telescope (at 8000 mhz)to test the accuracy of the dispersion law over a broad frequency range. inthis paper we present the results of these observations which show that thedispersion law is accurate to better than 1 part in 100000 across our observingband. we use this fact to constrain some of the properties of the ism along theline-of-sight and use the lack of any aberration or retardation effects todetermine upper limits on emission heights in the pulsar magnetosphere. we alsodiscuss the effect of pulse profile evolution on our observations, and theimplications that it could have for precision pulsar timing projects such asthe detection of gravitational waves with pulsar timing arrays.

1205.1082	detection of a radio bridge in abell 3667	we have detected a radio bridge of unpolarized synchrotron emissionconnecting the nw relic of the galaxy cluster abell 3667 to its centralregions. we used data at 2.3 ghz from the s-band polarization all sky survey(s-pass) and at 3.3 ghz from a follow up observation, both conducted with theparkes radio telescope. this emission is further aligned with a diffuse x-raytail, and represents the most compelling evidence for an association betweenintracluster medium turbulence and diffuse synchrotron emission. this is thefirst clear detection of a bridge associated both with an outlying clusterrelic and x-ray diffuse emission. all the indicators point toward thesynchrotron bridge being related to the post-shock turbulent wake trailing theshock front generated by a major merger in a massive cluster. althoughpredicted by simulations, this is the first time such emission is detected withhigh significance and clearly associated with the path of a confirmed shock.although the origin of the relativistic electrons is still unknown, theturbulent re-acceleration model provides a natural explanation for thelarge-scale emission. the equipartition magnetic field intensity of the bridgeis b_eq = 2.2 +/- 0.3 \mu g. we further detect diffuse emission coincident withthe central regions of the cluster for the first time.

1205.3449	imaging neutral hydrogen on large-scales during the epoch of  reionization with lofar	the first generation of redshifted 21 cm detection experiments, carried outwith arrays like lofar, mwa and gmrt, will have a very low signal-to-noiseratio per resolution element (\sim 0.2). in addition, whereas the variance ofthe cosmological signal decreases on scales larger than the typical size ofionization bubbles, the variance of the formidable galactic foregroundsincreases, making it hard to disentangle the two on such large scales. the poorsensitivity on small scales on the one hand, and the foregrounds effect onlarge scales on the other hand, make direct imaging of the epoch ofreionization of the universe very difficult, and detection of the signaltherefore is expected to be statistical.despite these hurdles, in this paper weargue that for many reionization scenarios low resolution images could beobtained from the expected data. this is because at the later stages of theprocess one still finds very large pockets of neutral regions in the igm,reflecting the clustering of the large-scale structure, which stays strong upto scales of \sim 120 comoving mpc/h (\sim 1 degree). the coherence of theemission on those scales allows us to reach sufficient s/n (\sim 3) so as toobtain reionization 21 cm images. such images will be extremely valuable foranswering many cosmological questions but above all they will be a verypowerful tool to test our control of the systematics in the data. the existenceof this typical scale (\sim 120 comoving mpc/h) also argues for designingfuture eor experiments, e.g., with ska, with a field of view of at least 4degree.

1206.6733	first light for the first station of the long wavelength array	the first station of the long wavelength array (lwa1) was completed in april2011 and is currently performing observations resulting from its first call forproposals in addition to a continuing program of commissioning andcharacterization observations. the instrument consists of 258 dual-polarizationdipoles, which are digitized and combined into beams. fourindependently-steerable dual-polarization beams are available, each with two"tunings" of 16 mhz bandwidth that can be independently tuned to any frequencybetween 10 mhz and 88 mhz. the system equivalent flux density for zenithpointing is ~3 kjy and is approximately independent of frequency; thiscorresponds to a sensitivity of ~5 jy/beam (5sigma, 1 s); making it one of themost sensitive meter-wavelength radio telescopes. lwa1 also has two "transientbuffer" modes which allow coherent recording from all dipoles simultaneously,providing instantaneous all-sky field of view. lwa1 provides versatile andunique new capabilities for galactic science, pulsar science, solar andplanetary science, space weather, cosmology, and searches for astrophysicaltransients. results from lwa1 will detect or tightly constrain the presence ofhot jupiters within 50 parsecs of earth. lwa1 will provide excellent resolutionin frequency and in time to examine phenomena such as solar bursts, and pulsarsover a 4:1 frequency range that includes the poorly understood turnover andsteep-spectrum regimes. observations to date have proven lwa1's potential forpulsar observing, and just a few seconds with the completed 256-dipole lwa1provide the most sensitive images of the sky at 23 mhz obtained yet. we areoperating lwa1 as an open skies radio observatory, offering ~2000 beam-hoursper year to the general community.

1209.2615	prospects for detecting the 21cm forest from the diffuse intergalactic  medium with lofar	we discuss the feasibility of the detection of the 21cm forest in the diffuseigm with the radio telescope lofar. the optical depth to the 21cm line has beenderived using simulations of reionization which include detailed radiativetransfer of ionizing photons. we find that the spectra from reionization modelswith similar total comoving hydrogen ionizing emissivity but differentfrequency distribution look remarkably similar. thus, unless the reionizationhistories are very different from each other (e.g. a predominance of uv vs.x-ray heating) we do not expect to distinguish them by means of observations ofthe 21cm forest. because the presence of a strong x-ray background would makethe detection of 21cm line absorption impossible, the lack of absorption couldbe used as a probe of the presence/intensity of the x-ray background and thethermal history of the universe. along a random line of sight lofar coulddetect a global suppression of the spectrum from z&gt;12, when the igm is stillmostly neutral and cold, in contrast with the more well-defined, albeit broad,absorption features visible at lower redshift. sharp, strong absorptionfeatures associated with rare, high density pockets of gas could be detectedalso at z~7 along preferential lines of sight.

1209.5727	lofar insights into the epoch of reionization from the cross power  spectrum of 21cm emission and galaxies	using a combination of n-body simulations, semi-analytic models and radiativetransfer calculations, we have estimated the theoretical cross power spectrumbetween galaxies and the 21cm emission from neutral hydrogen during the epochof reionization. in accordance with previous studies, we find that the 21cmemission is initially correlated with halos on large scales (&gt; 30 mpc),anti-correlated on intermediate (~ 5 mpc), and uncorrelated on small (&lt; 3 mpc)scales. this picture quickly changes as reionization proceeds and the twofields become anti-correlated on large scales. the normalization of the crosspower spectrum can be used to set constraints on the average neutral fractionin the intergalactic medium and its shape can be a tool to study the topologyof reionization. when we apply a drop-out technique to select galaxies and addto the 21cm signal the noise expected from the lofar telescope, we find thatwhile the normalization of the cross power spectrum remains a useful tool forprobing reionization, its shape becomes too noisy to be informative. on theother hand, for a lyalpha emitter (lae) survey both the normalization and theshape of the cross power spectrum are suitable probes of reionization. a closerlook at a specific planned lae observing program using subaru hyper-suprime camreveals concerns about the strength of the 21cm signal at the plannedredshifts. if the ionized fraction at z ~ 7 is lower that the one estimatedhere, then using the cross power spectrum may be a useful exercise given thatat higher redshifts and neutral fractions it is able to distinguish between twotoy models with different topologies.

1210.0393	the lofar radio environment	aims: this paper discusses the spectral occupancy for performing radioastronomy with the low-frequency array (lofar), with a focus on imagingobservations. methods: we have analysed the radio-frequency interference (rfi)situation in two 24-h surveys with dutch lofar stations, covering 30-78 mhzwith low-band antennas and 115-163 mhz with high-band antennas. this is asubset of the full frequency range of lofar. the surveys have been observedwith a 0.76 khz / 1 s resolution. results: we measured the rfi occupancy in thelow and high frequency sets to be 1.8% and 3.2% respectively. these values arefound to be representative values for the lofar radio environment. between dayand night, there is no significant difference in the radio environment. we findthat lowering the current observational time and frequency resolutions of lofarresults in a slight loss of flagging accuracy. at lofar's nominal resolution of0.76 khz and 1 s, the false-positives rate is about 0.5%. this rate increasesapproximately linearly when decreasing the data frequency resolution.conclusions: currently, by using an automated rfi detection strategy, the lofarradio environment poses no perceivable problems for sensitive observing. itremains to be seen if this is still true for very deep observations thatintegrate over tens of nights, but the situation looks promising. reasons forthe low impact of rfi are the high spectral and time resolution of lofar;accurate detection methods; strong filters and high receiver linearity; and theproximity of the antennas to the ground. we discuss some strategies that can beused once low-level rfi starts to become apparent. it is important that thefrequency range of lofar remains free of broadband interference, such as dabstations and windmills.

1210.1346	m87 at metre wavelengths: the lofar picture	m87 is a giant elliptical galaxy located in the centre of the virgo cluster,which harbours a supermassive black hole of mass 6.4x10^9 m_sun, whose activityis responsible for the extended (80 kpc) radio lobes that surround the galaxy.the energy generated by matter falling onto the central black hole is ejectedand transferred to the intra-cluster medium via a relativistic jet andmorphologically complex systems of buoyant bubbles, which rise towards theedges of the extended halo. here we present the first observations made withthe new low-frequency array (lofar) of m87 at frequencies down to 20 mhz.images of m87 were produced at low radio frequencies never explored before atthese high spatial resolution and dynamic range. to disentangle differentsynchrotron models and place constraints on source magnetic field, age andenergetics, we also performed a detailed spectral analysis of m87 extendedradio-halo using these observations together with archival data. we do not findany sign of new extended emissions; on the contrary the source appears wellconfined by the high pressure of the intra-cluster medium. a continuousinjection of relativistic electrons is the model that best fits our data, andprovides a scenario in which the lobes are still supplied by fresh relativisticparticles from the active galactic nuclei. we suggest that the discrepancybetween the low-frequency radio-spectral slope in the core and in the haloimplies a strong adiabatic expansion of the plasma as soon as it leaves thecore area. the extended halo has an equipartition magnetic field strength of~10 ug, which increases to ~13 ug in the zones where the particle flows aremore active. the continuous injection model for synchrotron ageing provides anage for the halo of ~40 myr, which in turn provides a jet kinetic power of6-10x10^44 erg/s.

1303.5627	probing reionization with lofar using 21-cm redshift space distortions	one of the most promising ways to study the epoch of reionization (eor) isthrough radio observations of the redshifted 21-cm line emission from neutralhydrogen. these observations are complicated by the fact that the mapping ofredshifts to line-of-sight positions is distorted by the peculiar velocities ofthe gas. such distortions can be a source of error if they are not properlyunderstood, but they also encode information about cosmology and astrophysics.we study the effects of redshift space distortions on the power spectrum of21-cm radiation from the eor using large scale $n$-body and radiative transfersimulations. we quantify the anisotropy introduced in the 21-cm power spectrumby redshift space distortions and show how it evolves as reionizationprogresses and how it relates to the underlying physics. we go on to study theeffects of redshift space distortions on lofar observations, taking instrumentnoise and foreground subtraction into account. we find that lofar should beable to directly observe the power spectrum anisotropy due to redshift spacedistortions at spatial scales around $k \sim 0.1$ mpc$^{-1}$ after $\gtrsim$1000 hours of integration time. at larger scales, sample errors become alimiting factor, while at smaller scales detector noise and foregrounds makethe extraction of the signal problematic. finally, we show how theastrophysical information contained in the evolution of the anisotropy of the21-cm power spectrum can be extracted from lofar observations, and how it canbe used to distinguish between different reionization scenarios.

1303.6230	calibrating high-precision faraday rotation measurements for lofar and  the next generation of low-frequency radio telescopes	faraday rotation measurements using the current and next generation oflow-frequency radio telescopes will provide a powerful probe of astronomicalmagnetic fields. however, achieving the full potential of these measurementsrequires accurate removal of the time-variable ionospheric faraday rotationcontribution. we present ionfr, a code that calculates the amount ofionospheric faraday rotation for a specific epoch, geographic location, andline-of-sight. ionfr uses a number of publicly available, gps-derived totalelectron content maps and the most recent release of the internationalgeomagnetic reference field. we describe applications of this code for thecalibration of radio polarimetric observations, and demonstrate the highaccuracy of its modeled ionospheric faraday rotations using lofar pulsarobservations. these show that we can accurately determine some of thehighest-precision pulsar rotation measures ever achieved. precision rotationmeasures can be used to monitor rotation measure variations - either intrinsicor due to the changing line-of-sight through the interstellar medium. thiscalibration is particularly important for nearby sources, where the ionospherecan contribute a significant fraction of the observed rotation measure. we alsodiscuss planned improvements to ionfr, as well as the importance of ionosphericfaraday rotation calibration for the emerging generation of low-frequency radiotelescopes, such as the ska and its pathfinders.

1307.5580	the brightness and spatial distributions of terrestrial radio sources	faint undetected sources of radio-frequency interference (rfi) might becomevisible in long radio observations when they are consistently present overtime. thereby, they might obstruct the detection of the weak astronomicalsignals of interest. this issue is especially important for epoch ofreionisation (eor) projects that try to detect the faint redshifted hi signalsfrom the time of the earliest structures in the universe. we explore the rfisituation at 30-163 mhz by studying brightness histograms of visibility dataobserved with lofar, similar to radio-source-count analyses that are used incosmology. an empirical rfi distribution model is derived that allows thesimulation of rfi in radio observations. the brightness histograms show an rfidistribution that follows a power-law distribution with an estimated exponentaround -1.5. with several assumptions, this can be explained with a uniformdistribution of terrestrial radio sources whose radiation follows existingpropagation models. extrapolation of the power law implies that the currentlofar eor observations should be severely rfi limited if the strength of rfisources remains strong after time integration. this is in contrast with actualobservations, which almost reach the thermal noise and are thought not to belimited by rfi. therefore, we conclude that it is unlikely that there areundetected rfi sources that will become visible in long observations.consequently, there is no indication that rfi will prevent an eor detectionwith lofar.

1308.2804	studying galactic interstellar turbulence through fluctuations in  synchrotron emission: first lofar galactic foreground detection	the characteristic outer scale of turbulence and the ratio of the random toordered components of the magnetic field are key parameters to characterisemagnetic turbulence in the interstellar gas, which affects the propagation ofcosmic rays within the galaxy. we provide new constraints to those twoparameters. we use the low frequency array (lofar) to image the diffusecontinuum emission in the fan region at (l,b) (137.0,+7.0) at 80"x70"resolution in the range [146,174] mhz. we detect multi-scale fluctuations inthe galactic synchrotron emission and compute their power spectrum. applyingtheoretical estimates and derivations from the literature for the first time,we derive the outer scale of turbulence and the ratio of random to orderedmagnetic field from the characteristics of these fluctuations . we obtain thedeepest image of the fan region to date and find diffuse continuum emissionwithin the primary beam. the power spectrum of the foreground synchrotronfluctuations displays a power law behaviour for scales between 100 and 8 arcminwith a slope of (-1.84+/-0.19). we find an upper limit of about 20 pc for theouter scale of the magnetic interstellar turbulence toward the fan region. wealso find a variation of the ratio of random to ordered field as a function ofgalactic coordinates, supporting different turbulent regimes. we use powerspectra fluctuations from lofar as well as earlier gmrt and wsrt observationsto constrain the outer scale of turbulence of the galactic synchrotronforeground, finding a range of plausible values of 10-20 pc. then, we use thisinformation to deduce lower limits of the ratio of ordered to random magneticfield strength. these are found to be 0.3, 0.3, and 0.5 for the lofar, wsrt andgmrt fields considered respectively. both these constraints are in agreementwith previous estimates.

1404.0887	foreground model and antenna calibration errors in the measurement of  the sky-averaged \lambda 21 cm signal at z~20	the most promising near-term observable of the cosmic dark age prior towidespread reionization (z~15-200) is the sky-averaged \lambda 21 cm backgroundarising from hydrogen in the intergalactic medium. though an individual antennacould in principle detect the line signature, data analysis must separateforegrounds that are orders of magnitude brighter than the \lambda 21 cmbackground (but that are anticipated to vary monotonically and gradually withfrequency). using more physically motivated models for foregrounds than inprevious studies, we show that the intrinsic "spectral smoothness" of theforegrounds is likely not a concern, and that data analysis for an idealantenna should be able to detect the \lambda 21 cm signal after deprojecting a~5th order polynomial in log(\nu). however, we find that the foreground signalis corrupted by the frequency-dependent response of a real antenna. thefrequency dependence complicates modeling of foregrounds commonly based on theassumption of spectral smoothness. much of our study focuses on thelarge-aperture experiment to detect the dark age (leda), which combines bothradiometric and interferometric measurements. we show that statisticaluncertainty remaining after fitting antenna gain patterns to interferometricmeasurements does not compromise extraction of the \lambda 21 cm signal for arange of cosmological models after fitting a 7th order polynomial toradiometric data. our results generalize to most efforts to measure thesky-averaged spectrum.

1404.3907	the shape of the radio wavefront of extensive air showers as measured  with lofar	extensive air showers, induced by high energy cosmic rays impinging on theearth's atmosphere, produce radio emission that is measured with the lofarradio telescope. as the emission comes from a finite distance of a fewkilometers, the incident wavefront is non-planar. a spherical, conical orhyperbolic shape of the wavefront has been proposed, but measurements ofindividual air showers have been inconclusive so far. for a selectedhigh-quality sample of 161 measured extensive air showers, we havereconstructed the wavefront by measuring pulse arrival times to sub-nanosecondprecision in 200 to 350 individual antennas. for each measured air shower, wehave fitted a conical, spherical, and hyperboloid shape to the arrival times.the fit quality and a likelihood analysis show that a hyperboloid is the bestparametrization. using a non-planar wavefront shape gives an improved angularresolution, when reconstructing the shower arrival direction. furthermore, adependence of the wavefront shape on the shower geometry can be seen. thissuggests that it will be possible to use a wavefront shape analysis to get anadditional handle on the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum, which issensitive to the mass of the primary particle.

1404.6077	galactic interstellar turbulence in the southern sky seen through  spatial gradients of the polarization vector	radio synchrotron polarization maps of the galaxy can be used to infer theproperties of interstellar turbulence in the diffuse warm ionized medium (wim).in this paper, we investigate the spatial gradient of linearly polarizedsynchrotron emission ($|\nabla\textbf{p}|/|\textbf{p}|$) as a tracer ofturbulence, the relationship of the gradient to the sonic mach number of thewim, and changes in morphology of the gradient as a function of galacticposition in the southern sky. we use data from the s-band polarization all skysurvey (s-pass) to image the spatial gradient of the linearly polarizedsynchrotron emission ($|\nabla \textbf{p}|/|\textbf{p}|$) of the entiresouthern sky at $2.3$~ghz. the spatial gradient of linear polarization revealsrapid changes of the density and magnetic fluctuations in the wim due tomagnetic turbulence as a function of galactic position; we make comparisons ofthese data to ideal mhd numerical simulations. in order to constrain the sonicmach number ($m_{s}$), we apply a high order moments analysis to theobservations and to the simulated diffuse, isothermal ism with idealmagneto-hydrodynamic turbulence. we find that polarization gradient maps revealelongated structures, which we associate with turbulence in the ism. ouranalysis corroborates the view of a turbulent wim in a transonic regime$m_{s}\lesssim 2$. filamentary structures with typical widths down to theangular resolution are seen and the observed morphologies match closely withnumerical simulations and in some cases h$\alpha$ contours. the $|\nabla\textbf{p}|/|\textbf{p}|$ intensity is found to be approximately log-normaldistributed. no systematic variations of the sonic mach number are observed asa function of galactic coordinates, which is consistent with turbulence in thewim inferred by the analysis of h$\alpha$ data.

1409.5437	lofar low-band antenna observations of the 3c295 and bootes fields:  source counts and ultra-steep spectrum sources	we present lofar low band observations of the bootes and 3c295 fields. ourimages made at 34, 46, and 62 mhz reach noise levels of 12, 8, and 5 mjybeam$^{-1}$, making them the deepest images ever obtained in this frequencyrange. in total, we detect between 300 and 400 sources in each of these images,covering an area of 17 to 52 deg$^{2}$. from the observations we deriveeuclidean-normalized differential source counts. the 62 mhz source counts agreewith previous gmrt 153 mhz and vla 74 mhz differential source counts, scalingwith a spectral index of $-0.7$. we find that a spectral index scaling of$-0.5$ is required to match up the lofar 34 mhz source counts. this result isalso in agreement with source counts from the 38 mhz 8c survey, indicating thatthe average spectral index of radio sources flattens towards lower frequencies.we also find evidence for spectral flattening using the individual fluxmeasurements of sources between 34 and 1400 mhz and by calculating the spectralindex averaged over the source population. to select ultra-steep spectrum($\alpha &lt; -1.1$) radio sources, that could be associated with massive highredshift radio galaxies, we compute spectral indices between 62 mhz, 153 mhzand 1.4 ghz for sources in the bo\"otes field. we cross-correlate these radiosources with optical and infrared catalogues and fit the spectral energydistribution to obtain photometric redshifts. we find that most of theseultra-steep spectrum sources are located in the $ 0.7 \lesssim z \lesssim 2.5$range.

1412.4216	the spectral variability of the ghz-peaked spectrum radio source pks  1718-649 and a comparison of absorption models	using the new wideband capabilities of the australia telescope compact array(atca), we obtain spectra for pks 1718-649, a well-known gigahertz-peakedspectrum radio source. the observations, between approximately 1 and 10 ghzover three epochs spanning approximately 21 months, reveal variability bothabove the spectral peak at ~3 ghz and below the peak. the combination of thelow and high frequency variability cannot be easily explained using a singleabsorption mechanism, such as free-free absorption or synchrotronself-absorption. we find that the pks 1718-649 spectrum and its variability arebest explained by variations in the free-free optical depth on ourline-of-sight to the radio source at low frequencies (below the spectral peak)and the adiabatic expansion of the radio source itself at high frequencies(above the spectral peak). the optical depth variations are found to beplausible when x-ray continuum absorption variability seen in samples of activegalactic nuclei is considered. we find that the cause of the peaked spectrum inpks 1718-649 is most likely due to free-free absorption. in agreement withprevious studies, we find that the spectrum at each epoch of observation isbest fit by a free-free absorption model characterised by a power-lawdistribution of free-free absorbing clouds. this agreement is extended tofrequencies below the 1 ghz lower limit of the atca by considering newobservations with parkes at 725 mhz and 199 mhz observations with the newlyoperational murchison widefield array. these lower frequency observations argueagainst families of absorption models (both free-free and synchrotronself-absorption) that are based on simple homogenous structures.

1412.5940	cluster radio halos at the crossroads between astrophysics and cosmology  in the ska era	giant radio halos (rh) are diffuse, mpc-sized, synchrotron radio sourcesobserved in a fraction of merging galaxy clusters. the current scenario for theorigin of rhs assumes that turbulence generated during cluster mergersre-accelerates pre-existing fossil and/or secondary electrons in theintra-cluster-medium (icm) to the energies necessary to produce the observedradio emission. moreover, more relaxed clusters could host diffuse "off state"halos produced by secondary electrons. in this chapter we use monte carlosimulations, that combine turbulent-acceleration physics and the generation ofsecondaries in the icm, to calculate the occurrence of rhs in the universe,their spectral properties and connection with properties of the hostingclusters. predictions for ska1 surveys are presented at low (100-300 mhz) andmid (1-2 ghz) frequencies assuming the expected sensitivities and spatialresolutions of ska1. ska1 will step into an unexplored territory allowing us tostudy the formation and evolution of rhs in a totally new range of clustermasses and redshift, allowing firm tests of the current theoretical hypothesis.in particular, the combination of ska1-low and sur will allow the discovery of~1000 ultrasteep- spectrum halos and to detect for the very first time "offstate" rhs. we expect that at least ~2500 giant rhs will be discovered byska1-low surveys up to z~0.6. remarkably these surveys will be sensitive to rhsin a cluster mass range (down to ~10^14 solar masses) and redshifts (up to ~1)that are unexplored by current observations. ska1 surveys will be highlycompetitive with present and future sz-surveys in the detection ofhigh-redshift massive objects.

1502.07596	foregrounds in wide-field redshifted 21 cm power spectra	detection of 21~cm emission of hi from the epoch of reionization, atredshifts z&gt;6, is limited primarily by foreground emission. we investigate thesignatures of wide-field measurements and an all-sky foreground model using thedelay spectrum technique that maps the measurements to foreground objectlocations through signal delays between antenna pairs. we demonstrateinterferometric measurements are inherently sensitive to all scales, includingthe largest angular scales, owing to the nature of wide-field measurements.these wide-field effects are generic to all observations but antenna shapesimpact their amplitudes substantially. a dish-shaped antenna yields the mostdesirable features from a foreground contamination viewpoint, relative to adipole or a phased array. comparing data from recent murchison widefield arrayobservations, we demonstrate that the foreground signatures that have thelargest impact on the hi signal arise from power received far away from theprimary field of view. we identify diffuse emission near the horizon as asignificant contributing factor, even on wide antenna spacings that usuallyrepresent structures on small scales. for signals entering through the primaryfield of view, compact emission dominates the foreground contamination. thesetwo mechanisms imprint a characteristic "pitchfork" signature on the"foreground wedge" in fourier delay space. based on these results, we proposethat selective down-weighting of data based on antenna spacing and time canmitigate foreground contamination substantially by a factor ~100 withnegligible loss of sensitivity.

1503.01644	polarization leakage in epoch of reionization windows: i. lofar  observations of the 3c196 field	detection of the 21-cm signal coming from the epoch of reionization (eor) ischallenging especially because, even after removing the foregrounds, theresidual stokes $i$ maps contain leakage from polarized emission that can mimicthe signal. here, we discuss the instrumental polarization of lofar and presentrealistic simulations of the leakages between stokes parameters. from the lofarobservations of polarized emission in the 3c196 field, we have quantified thelevel of polarization leakage caused by the nominal model beam of lofar, andcompared it with the eor signal using power spectrum analysis. we found that at134--166 mhz, within the central 4$^\circ$ of the field the $(q,u)\rightarrowi$ leakage power is lower than the eor signal at $k&lt;0.3$ mpc$^{-1}$. theleakage was found to be localized around a faraday depth of 0, and the rms ofthe leakage as a fraction of the rms of the polarized emission was shown tovary between 0.2-0.3\%, both of which could be utilized in the removal ofleakage. moreover, we could define an `eor window' in terms of the polarizationleakage in the cylindrical power spectrum above the psf-induced wedge and below$k_\parallel\sim 0.5$ mpc$^{-1}$, and the window extended up to$k_\parallel\sim 1$ mpc$^{-1}$ at all $k_\perp$ when 70\% of the leakage hadbeen removed. these lofar results show that even a modest polarimetriccalibration over a field of view of $\lesssim 4^\circ$ in the future arrayslike ska will ensure that the polarization leakage remains well below theexpected eor signal at the scales of 0.02-1 mpc$^{-1}$.

1507.04830	simultaneous observations of giant pulses from the crab pulsar, with the  murchison widefield array and parkes radio telescope: implications for the  giant pulse emission mechanism	we report on observations of giant pulses from the crab pulsar performedsimultaneously with the parkes radio telescope and the incoherent combinationof the murchison widefield array (mwa) antenna tiles. the observations wereperformed over a duration of approximately one hour at a center frequency of1382 mhz with 340 mhz bandwidth at parkes, and at a center frequency of 193 mhzwith 15 mhz bandwidth at the mwa. our analysis has led to the detection of 55giant pulses at the mwa and 2075 at parkes above a threshold of 3.5$\sigma$ and6.5$\sigma$ respectively. we detected 51$\%$ of the mwa giant pulses at theparkes radio telescope, with spectral indices in the range of $-3.6&gt;\alpha&gt;-4.9$ ($s_{\rm \nu} \propto \nu^\alpha$). we present a monte carlo analysissupporting the conjecture that the giant pulse emission in the crab isintrinsically broadband, the less than $100\%$ correlation being due to therelative sensitivities of the two instruments and the width of the spectralindex distribution. our observations are consistent with the hypothesis thatthe spectral index of giant pulses is drawn from normal distribution ofstandard deviation 0.6, but with a mean that displays an evolution withfrequency from -3.00 at 1382 mhz, to -2.85 at 192 mhz.

1507.07496	lofar tied-array imaging and spectroscopy of solar s bursts	context. the sun is an active source of radio emission that is oftenassociated with energetic phenomena ranging from nanoflares to coronal massejections (cmes). at low radio frequencies (&lt;100 mhz), numerous millisecondduration radio bursts have been reported, such as radio spikes or solar sbursts (where s stands for short). to date, these have neither been studiedextensively nor imaged because of the instrumental limitations of previousradio telescopes. aims. here, low frequency array (lofar) observations wereused to study the spectral and spatial characteristics of a multitude of sbursts, as well as their origin and possible emission mechanisms. methods. weused 170 simultaneous tied-array beams for spectroscopy and imaging of sbursts. since s bursts have short timescales and fine frequency structures,high cadence (~50 ms) tied-array images were used instead of standardinterferometric imaging, that is currently limited to one image per second.results. on 9 july 2013, over 3000 s bursts were observed over a time period of~8 hours. s bursts were found to appear as groups of short-lived (&lt;1 s) andnarrow-bandwidth (~2.5 mhz) features, the majority drifting at ~3.5 mhz/s and awide range of circular polarisation degrees (2-8 times more polarised than theaccompanying type iii bursts). extrapolation of the photospheric magnetic fieldusing the potential field source surface (pfss) model suggests that s burstsare associated with a trans-equatorial loop system that connects an activeregion in the southern hemisphere to a bipolar region of plage in the northernhemisphere. conclusions. we have identified polarised, short-lived solar radiobursts that have never been imaged before. they are observed at a height andfrequency range where plasma emission is the dominant emission mechanism,however they possess some of the characteristics of electron-cyclotron maseremission.

1508.00965	quantifying ionospheric effects on time-domain astrophysics with the  murchison widefield array	refraction and diffraction of incoming radio waves by the ionosphere inducetime variability in the angular positions, peak amplitudes and shapes of radiosources, potentially complicating the automated cross-matching andidentification of transient and variable radio sources. in this work, weempirically assess the effects of the ionosphere on data taken by the murchisonwidefield array (mwa) radio telescope. we directly examine 51 hours of dataobserved over 10 nights under quiet geomagnetic conditions (global storm indexkp &lt; 2), analysing the behaviour of short-timescale angular position and peakflux density variations of around ten thousand unresolved sources. we find thatwhile much of the variation in angular position can be attributed toionospheric refraction, the characteristic displacements (10-20 arcsec) at 154mhz are small enough that search radii of 1-2 arcmin should be sufficient forcross-matching under typical conditions. by examining bulk trends in amplitudevariability, we place upper limits on the modulation index associated withionospheric scintillation of 1-3% for the various nights. for sources fainterthan ~1 jy, this variation is below the image noise at typical mwasensitivities. our results demonstrate that the ionosphere is not a significantimpediment to the goals of time-domain science with the mwa at 154 mhz.

1509.06396	wide-band, low-frequency pulse profiles of 100 radio pulsars with lofar	lofar offers the unique capability of observing pulsars across the 10-240 mhzfrequency range with a fractional bandwidth of roughly 50%. this spectral rangeis well-suited for studying the frequency evolution of pulse profile morphologycaused by both intrinsic and extrinsic effects: such as changing emissionaltitude in the pulsar magnetosphere or scatter broadening by the interstellarmedium, respectively. the magnitude of most of these effects increases rapidlytowards low frequencies. lofar can thus address a number of open questionsabout the nature of radio pulsar emission and its propagation through theinterstellar medium. we present the average pulse profiles of 100 pulsarsobserved in the two lofar frequency bands: high band (120-167 mhz, 100profiles) and low band (15-62 mhz, 26 profiles). we compare them withwesterbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt) and lovell telescope observationsat higher frequencies (350 and1400 mhz) in order to study the profileevolution. the profiles are aligned in absolute phase by folding with a new setof timing solutions from the lovell telescope, which we present along withprecise dispersion measures obtained with lofar. we find that the profileevolution with decreasing radio frequency does not follow a specific trend but,depending on the geometry of the pulsar, new components can enter into, or behidden from, view. nonetheless, in general our observations confirm thewidening of pulsar profiles at low frequencies, as expected fromradius-to-frequency mapping or birefringence theories. we offer this catalog oflow-frequency pulsar profiles in a user friendly way via the epn database ofpulsar profiles (http://www.epta.eu.org/epndb/).

1511.01022	kat-7 observations of a mass-selected sample of galaxy clusters	the presence of megaparsec-scale radio halos in galaxy clusters has alreadybeen established by many observations over the last two decades. the emergingexplanation for the formation of these giant sources of diffuse synchrotronradio emission is that they trace turbulent regions in the intracluster medium,where particles are trapped and accelerated during cluster mergers. our currentobservational knowledge is, however, mainly limited to massive systems. here wepresent observations of a sample of 14 mass-selected galaxy clusters, i.e.$m_{\rm 500} &gt; 4\times10^{14}$~m${_\odot}$, in the southern hemisphere, aimedto study the occurrence of radio halos in low mass clusters and test thecorrelation between the radio halo power at 1.4 ghz $p_{\rm 1.4}$ and thecluster mass $m_{\rm 500}$. our observations were performed with the 7-elementkaroo array telescope at 1.86 ghz. we found three candidates to host diffusecluster-scale emission and derived upper limits at the level of $0.6 - 1.9\times 10^{24}$~watt~hz$^{-1}$ for $\sim 50\%$ of the clusters in the sample,significantly increasing the number of clusters with radio halo information inthe considered mass range. our results confirm that bright radio halos in lessmassive galaxy clusters are statistically rare.

astro-ph;0503043	polarized diffuse emission at 2.3 ghz in a high galactic latitude area	polarized diffuse emission observations at 2.3 ghz in a high galacticlatitude area are presented. the 2\degr x 2\degr field, centred in(\alpha=5^h,\delta=-49\degr), is located in the region observed by theboomerang experiment. our observations has been carried out with the parkesradio telescope and represent the highest frequency detection done to date inlow emission areas. because of a weaker faraday rotation action, the highfrequency allows an estimate of the galactic synchrotron contamination of thecosmic microwave background polarization (cmbp) that is more reliable than thatdone at 1.4 ghz. we find that the angular power spectra of the e- and b-modeshave slopes of \beta_e = -1.46 +/- 0.14 and \beta_b = -1.87 +/- 0.22,indicating a flattening with respect to 1.4 ghz. extrapolated up to 32 ghz, thee-mode spectrum is about 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of the cmbp,allowing a clean detection even at this frequency. the best improvementconcerns the b-mode, for which our single-dish observations provide the firstestimate of the contamination on angular scales close to the cmbp peak (about 2degrees). we find that the cmbp b-mode should be stronger than synchrotroncontamination at 90 ghz for models with t/s &gt; 0.01. this low level could movedown to 60-70 ghz the optimal window for cmbp measures.

(2005).  the dominant point source emission allows us to estimate the contamination ofthe cmb by extragalactic foregrounds. we computed the power spectrum of theircontribution and its extrapolation to 30 ghz provides a framework where the cmbsignal should dominate. however, our results do not match the conclusions ofthe dasi team about the negligibility of point source contamination, suggestingto take into account a source subtraction from the dasi data.
