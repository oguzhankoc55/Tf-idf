0706.2768	towards a holistic view of the heating and cooling of the intracluster  medium	(abridged) x-ray clusters are conventionally divided into two classes: "coolcore" (cc) clusters and "non-cool core" (ncc) clusters. yet relatively littleattention has been given to the origins of this dichotomy and, in particular,to the energetics and thermal histories of the two classes. we develop a modelfor the entropy profiles of clusters starting from the configurationestablished by gravitational shock heating and radiative cooling. at largeradii, gravitational heating accounts for the observed profiles and theirscalings well. however, at small and intermediate radii, radiative cooling andgravitational heating cannot be combined to explain the observed profiles ofeither type of cluster. the inferred entropy profiles of ncc clusters requirethat material is preheated prior to cluster collapse in order to explain theabsence of low entropy (cool) material in these systems. we show that a similarmodification is also required in cc clusters in order to match their propertiesat intermediate radii. in cc clusters, this modification is unstable, and anadditional process is required to prevent cooling below a temperature of a fewkev. we show that this can be achieved by adding a self-consistent agn feedbackloop in which the lowest-entropy, most rapidly cooling material is heated sothat it rises buoyantly to mix with material at larger radii. the resultingmodel does not require fine tuning and is in excellent agreement with a widevariety of observational data. some of the other implications of this model arebriefly discussed.

0908.0750	the accretion of galaxies into groups and clusters	we use the galaxy stellar mass and halo merger tree information from thesemi-analytic model galaxy catalogue of font et al. (2009) to examine theaccretion of galaxies into a large sample of groups and clusters, covering awide range in halo mass (10e12.9 to 10e15.3 msun/h), and selected from each offour redshift epochs (z=0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5). we find that clusters at allexamined redshifts have accreted a significant fraction of their final galaxypopulations through galaxy groups. a 10e14.5 msun/h mass cluster at z=0 has, onaverage, accreted ~ 40% of its galaxies (mstellar &gt; 10e9 msun/h) from haloswith masses greater than 10e13 msun/h. further, the galaxies which are accretedthrough groups are more massive, on average, than galaxies accreted throughsmaller halos or from the field population. we find that at a given epoch, thefraction of galaxies accreted from isolated environments is independent of thefinal cluster or group mass. in contrast, we find that observing a cluster ofthe same halo mass at each redshift epoch implies different accretion rates ofisolated galaxies, from 5-6 % per gyr at z=0 to 15% per gyr at z=1.5. we findthat combining the existence of a butcher oemler effect at z=0.5 and theobservations that galaxies within groups display significant environmentaleffects with galaxy accretion histories justifies striking conclusions. namely,that the dominant environmental process must begin to occur in halos of 10e12-- 10e13 msun/h, and act over timescales of &gt; 2 gyrs. this argues in favor of amechanism like "strangulation", in which the hot halo of a galaxy is strippedupon infalling into a more massive halo . this simple model predicts that byz=1.5 galaxy groups and clusters will display little to no environmentaleffects.

0910.2417	probing the cosmic web: inter-cluster filament detection using  gravitational lensing	the problem of detecting dark matter filaments in the cosmic web isconsidered. weak lensing is an ideal probe of dark matter, and therefore formsthe basis of particularly promising detection methods. we consider and developa number of weak lensing techniques that could be used to detect filaments inindividual or stacked cluster fields, and apply them to synthetic lensing datasets in the fields of clusters from the millennium simulation. these techniquesare multipole moments of the shear and convergence, mass reconstruction, andparameterized fits to filament mass profiles using a markov chain monte carloapproach. in particular, two new filament detection techniques are explored(multipole shear filters and markov chain monte carlo mass profile fits), andwe outline the quality of data required to be able to identify and quantifyfilament profiles. we also consider the effects of large scale structure onfilament detection. we conclude that using these techniques, there will berealistic prospects of detecting filaments in data from future space-basedmissions. the methods presented in this paper will be of great use in theidentification of dark matter filaments in future surveys.

0911.2641	the case for agn feedback in galaxy groups	[abridged] the relatively recent insight that energy input from supermassiveblack holes (bhs) can have a substantial effect on the star formation rates(sfrs) of galaxies motivates us to examine its effects on the scale of galaxygroups. at present, groups contain most of the galaxies and a significantfraction of the overall baryon content of the universe. to explore the effectsof bh feedback on groups, we analyse two high resolution cosmological hydrosimulations from the overwhelmingly large simulations project. while bothinclude galactic winds driven by supernovae, only one includes feedback frombhs. we compare the properties of the simulated groups to a wide range ofobservational data, including hot gas radial profiles and gas mass fractions(fgas), luminosity-mass-temperature (l-m-t) scaling relations, k-bandluminosity of the group and its central brightest galaxy (cbg), sfrs and agesof the cbg, and gas/stellar metallicities. both runs yield entropy profilessimilar to the data, while the run without agn feedback yields highly peakedtemperature profiles, in discord with the observations. energy input from bhssignificantly reduces fgas for groups with masses less than ~10^14 msun,yielding fgas-t and l-t relations that are in agreement with the data. the runwithout agn feedback suffers from the well known overcooling problem; theresulting k-band luminosities are much larger than observed. by contrast, therun that includes bh feedback yields k-band luminosities and cbg sfrs and agesin agreement with current estimates. both runs yield very similar gas-phasemetallicities that match x-ray data, but they predict very different stellarmetallicities. based on the above, galaxy groups provide a compelling case thatbh feedback is a crucial ingredient in the formation of massive galaxies.

1005.1642	x-ray coronae in simulations of disc galaxy formation	the existence of x-ray luminous gaseous coronae around massive disc galaxiesis a long-standing prediction of galaxy formation theory in the cold darkmatter cosmogony. this prediction has garnered little observational support,with non-detections commonplace and detections for only a relatively smallnumber of galaxies which are much less luminous than expected. we investigatethe coronal properties of a large sample of bright, disc-dominated galaxiesextracted from the gimic suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulationsrecently presented by crain et al. remarkably, the simulations reproduce theobserved scalings of x-ray luminosity with k-band luminosity and star formationrate and, when account is taken of the density structure of the halo, with discrotation velocity as well. most of the star formation in the simulated galaxies(which have realistic stellar mass fractions) is fuelled by gas cooling from aquasi-hydrostatic hot corona. however, these coronae are more diffuse, and of alower luminosity, than predicted by the analytic models of white &amp; frenkbecause of a substantial increase in entropy at z ~ 1-3. both the removal oflow entropy gas by star formation and energy injection from supernovaecontribute to this increase in entropy, but the latter is dominant for halomasses m_200 &lt;~ 10^(12.5) msun. only a small fraction of the mass of the hotgas is outflowing as a wind but, because of its high density and metallicity,it contributes disproportionally to the x-ray emission. the bulk of the x-rayemission, however, comes from the diffuse quasi-hydrostatic corona whichsupplies the fuel for ongoing star formation in discs today. future deep x-rayobservations with high spectral resolution (e.g. with next/astro-h or ixo)should be able to map the velocity structure of the hot gas and test thisfundamental prediction of current galaxy formation theory.

1008.4799	gas expulsion by quasar-driven winds as a solution to the over-cooling  problem in galaxy groups and clusters	galaxy groups are not scaled down versions of massive galaxy clusters - thehot gas in groups (known as the intragroup medium, igrm for short) is, onaverage, less dense than the intracluster medium, implying that one or morenon-gravitational processes (e.g., radiative cooling, star formation, and/orfeedback) has had a relatively larger effect on groups. in the present study,we compare a number of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that form part ofthe overwhelmingly large simulations project to isolate and quantify theeffects of cooling and feedback from supernovae (sne) and active galacticnuclei (agn) on the gas. this is achieved by comparing lagrangian thermalhistories of the gas in the different runs, which were all started fromidentical initial conditions. while radiative cooling, star formation, and snfeedback are all necessary ingredients, only runs that also include agnfeedback are able to successfully reproduce the optical and x-ray properties ofgroups and low-mass clusters. we isolate how, when, and exactly what gas isheated by agn. interestingly, we find that the gas that constitutes thepresent-day igrm is that which was not strongly heated by agn. instead, the lowmedian density/high median entropy of the gas in present-day groups is achievedby the ejection of lower entropy gas from low-mass progenitor galaxies at highredshift (primarily 2 &lt; z &lt; 4). this corresponds to the epoch when supermassiveblack holes accreted most of their mass, typically at a rate that is close tothe eddington limit (i.e., when the black holes are in a `quasar mode').

1011.1906	the similarity of observed x-ray coronae associated with l* disc and  elliptical galaxies	the existence of hot, x-ray luminous gaseous coronae surrounding present dayl* galaxies is a generic prediction of galaxy formation theory in the cold darkmatter cosmogony. while extended x-ray emission has been known to exist aroundelliptical galaxies for a long time, diffuse extra-planar emission has onlyrecently been detected around disc galaxies. we compile samples of ellipticaland disc galaxies that have chandra and xmm-newton measurements, and comparethe scaling of the coronal x-ray luminosity (l_x) with both the k-bandluminosity (l_k) and the coronal x-ray temperature (t_x). the x-ray fluxmeasurements are corrected for non-thermal point source contamination byspatial excision and spectral subtraction for resolved and unresolved sourcesrespectively. we find that the properties of the extended x-ray emission fromgalaxies of different morphological types are similar: for both elliptical anddisc galaxies, the l_x - l_k and l_x - t_x relations have similar slope,normalisation and scatter. the observed universality of coronal x-rayproperties suggests that the bulk of this emission originates from gas that hasbeen accreted, shock-heated and compressed during the assembly of the galaxyand that outflows triggered by stellar processes make only a minor contributionto the x-ray emission. this reservoir of cooling gas is a potential source ofmorphological transformation; it provides a fresh supply of material for discsto grow around galaxies of all morphological types.

1102.2526	cosmological simulations of the formation of the stellar haloes around  disc galaxies	we use the galaxies-intergalactic medium interaction calculation (gimic)suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the formation ofstellar spheroids of milky way-mass disc galaxies. the simulations containaccurate treatments of metal-dependent radiative cooling, star formation,supernova feedback, and chemodynamics, and the large volumes that have beensimulated yield an unprecedentedly large sample of ~400 simulated l_* discgalaxies. the simulated galaxies are surrounded by low-mass, low-surfacebrightness stellar haloes that extend out to ~100 kpc and beyond. the diffusestellar distributions bear a remarkable resemblance to those observed aroundthe milky way, m31 and other nearby galaxies, in terms of mass density, surfacebrightness, and metallicity profiles. we show that in situ star formationtypically dominates the stellar spheroids by mass at radii of r &lt; 30 kpc,whereas accretion of stars dominates at larger radii and this change in origininduces a change in slope of the surface brightness and metallicity profiles,which is also present in the observational data. the system-to-system scatterin the in situ mass fractions of the spheroid, however, is large and spans overa factor of 4. consequently, there is a large degree of scatter in the shapeand normalisation of the spheroid density profile within r &lt; 30 kpc (e.g., whenfit by a spherical powerlaw profile the indices range from -2.6 to -3.4). weshow that the in situ mass fraction of the spheroid is linked to the formationepoch of the system. dynamically older systems have, on average, largercontributions from in situ star formation, although there is significantsystem-to-system scatter in this relationship. thus, in situ star formationlikely represents the solution to the longstanding failure of pureaccretion-based models to reproduce the observed properties of the innerspheroid.

1103.0024	the population of milky way satellites in the lambdacdm cosmology	we present a model for the satellites of the milky way in which galaxyformation is followed using semi-analytic techniques applied to the sixhigh-resolution n-body simulations of galactic halos of the aquarius project.the model, calculated using the galform code, incorporates improved treatmentsof the relevant physics in the lambdacdm cosmogony, particularly aself-consistent calculation of reionization by uv photons emitted by theforming galaxy population, including the progenitors of the central galaxy.along the merger tree of each halo, the model calculates gas cooling (bycompton scattering off cosmic microwave background photons, molecular hydrogenand atomic processes), gas heating (from hydrogen photoionization and supernovaenergy), star formation and evolution. the evolution of the intergalacticmedium is followed simultaneously with that of the galaxies. star formation inthe more massive progenitor subhalos is suppressed primarily by supernovafeedback, while for smaller subhalos it is suppressed primarily byphotoionization due to external and internal sources. the model is constrainedto match a wide range of properties of the present day galaxy population as awhole, but at high redshift it requires an escape fraction of uv photons nearunity in order completely to reionize the universe by redshift z ~ 8. in themost successful model the local sources photoionize the pre-galactic regioncompletely by z ~ 10. in addition to the luminosity function of milky waysatellites, the model matches their observed luminosity-metallicity relation,their radial distribution and the inferred values of the mass within 300 pc,which in the models increase slowly but significantly with luminosity. there isa large variation in satellite properties from halo to halo, with theluminosity function, for example, varying by a factor of ~ 2 among the sixsimulations.

1105.1075	quantifying the effect of baryon physics on weak lensing tomography	we use matter power spectra from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations toquantify the effect of baryon physics on the weak gravitational lensing shearsignal. the simulations consider a number of processes, such as radiativecooling, star formation, supernovae and feedback from active galactic nuclei(agn). van daalen et al. (2011) used the same simulations to show that baryonphysics, in particular the strong feedback that is required to solve theovercooling problem, modifies the matter power spectrum on scales relevant forcosmological weak lensing studies. as a result, the use of power spectra fromdark matter simulations can lead to significant biases in the inferredcosmological parameters. we show that the typical biases are much larger thanthe precision with which future missions aim to constrain the dark energyequation of state, w_0. for instance, the simulation with agn feedback, whichreproduces x-ray and optical properties of groups of galaxies, gives rise to a~40% bias in w_0. we demonstrate that the modification of the power spectrum isdominated by groups and clusters of galaxies, the effect of which can bemodelled. we consider an approach based on the popular halo model and show thatsimple modifications can capture the main features of baryonic feedback.despite its simplicity, we find that our model, when calibrated on thesimulations, is able to reduce the bias in w_0 to a level comparable to thesize of the statistical uncertainties for a euclid-like mission. whileobservations of the gas and stellar fractions as a function of halo mass can beused to calibrate the model, hydrodynamic simulations will likely still beneeded to extend the observed scaling relations down to halo masses of 10 ^12m_sun/h.

1106.2046	mock weak lensing analysis of simulated galaxy clusters: bias and  scatter in mass and concentration	(abridged) we quantify the bias and scatter in galaxy cluster masses andconcentrations derived from an idealised mock weak gravitational lensing (wl)survey, and their effect on the cluster mass-concentration relation. for this,we simulate wl distortions on a population of background galaxies due to alarge (~3000) sample of galaxy cluster haloes extracted from the millenniumsimulation at z~0.2. this study takes into account the influence of shapenoise, cluster substructure and asphericity as well as correlated large-scalestructure, but not uncorrelated large-scale structure along the line of sightand observational effects. we find a small, but non-negligble, negative medianbias in both mass and concentration at a level of ~5%, the exact valuedepending both on cluster mass and radial survey range. both the mass andconcentration derived from wl show considerable scatter about their truevalues. this scatter has, even for the highest mass clusters of m200 &gt; 10^14.8m_sun, a level of ~30% and ~20% for concentration and mass respectively andincreases strongly with decreasing cluster mass. for a typical survey analysing30 galaxies per arcmin^2 over a radial range from 30" to 15' from the clustercentre, the derived m200-c relation has a slope and normalisation too lowcompared to the underlying true (3d) relation by ~40% and ~15% respectively.the scatter and bias in mass are shown to reflect a departure at large radii ofthe true wl shear/matter distribution of the simulated clusters from the nfwprofile adopted in modelling the mock observations. orientation of the triaxialcluster haloes dominates the concentration scatter (except at low masses, wheregalaxy shape noise becomes dominant), while the bias in c is mostly due tosubstructure within the virial radius.

0710.0964	ram pressure stripping the hot gaseous halos of galaxies in groups and  clusters	we use a large suite of carefully controlled full hydrodynamic simulations tostudy the ram pressure stripping of the hot gaseous halos of galaxies as theyfall into massive groups and clusters. the sensitivity of the results to theorbit, total galaxy mass, and galaxy structural properties is explored. fortypical structural and orbital parameters, we find that ~30% of the initial hotgalactic halo gas can remain in place after 10 gyr. we propose a physicallysimple analytic model that describes the stripping seen in the simulationsremarkably well. the model is analogous to the original formulation of gunn &amp;gott (1972), except that it is appropriate for the case of a spherical (hot)gas distribution (as opposed to a face-on cold disk) and takes into accountthat stripping is not instantaneous but occurs on a characteristic timescale.the model reproduces the results of the simulations to within approximately 10%at almost all times for all the orbits, mass ratios, and galaxy structuralproperties we have explored. the one exception involves unlikely systems wherethe orbit of the galaxy is highly non-radial and its mass exceeds about 10% ofthe group or cluster into which it is falling (in which case the modelunder-predicts the stripping following pericentric passage). the proposed modelhas several interesting applications, including modelling the ram pressurestripping of both observed and cosmologically-simulated galaxies and as a wayto improve current semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. one immediateconsequence is that the colours and morphologies of satellite galaxies ingroups and clusters will differ significantly from those predicted with thestandard assumption of complete stripping of the hot coronae.

1111.1747	global structure and kinematics of stellar haloes in cosmological  hydrodynamic simulations	we use the galaxies-intergalactic medium interaction calculation (gimic)suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to study the global structureand kinematics of stellar spheroids of milky way mass disc galaxies. font etal. have recently demonstrated that these simulations are able to successfullyreproduce the satellite luminosity functions and the metallicity and surfacebrightness profiles of the spheroids of the milky way and m31. a key to thesuccess of the simulations is a significant contribution to the spheroid fromstars that formed in situ. while the outer halo is dominated by accreted stars,stars formed in the main progenitor of the galaxy dominate at r &lt; ~30 kpc. inthe present study we show that this component was primarily formed in aproto-disc at high redshift and was subsequently liberated from the disc bydynamical heating associated with mass accretion. as a consequence of itsorigin, the in situ component of the spheroid has different kinematics (namelynet prograde rotation with respect to the disc) than that of the spheroidcomponent built from the disruption of satellites. in addition, the in situcomponent has a flattened distribution, that is due in part to its rotation. wemake comparisons with measurements of the shape and kinematics of localgalaxies, including the milky way and m31, and stacked observations of moredistant galaxies. we find that the simulated disc galaxies have spheroids ofthe correct shape (oblate with a median axis ratio of ~0.6 at radii of &lt; ~30kpc, but note there is significant system-to-system scatter in this quantity)and that the kinematics show evidence for two components (due to in situ vs.accreted), as observed. our findings therefore add considerable weight to theimportance of dissipative processes in the formation of stellar haloes and tothe notion of a 'dual stellar halo'.

1202.3787	the xmm cluster survey: the interplay between the brightest cluster  galaxy and the intra-cluster medium via agn feedback	using a sample of 123 x-ray clusters and groups drawn from the xmm-clustersurvey first data release, we investigate the interplay between the brightestcluster galaxy (bcg), its black hole, and the intra-cluster/group medium (icm).it appears that for groups and clusters with a bcg likely to host significantagn feedback, gas cooling dominates in those with tx &gt; 2 kev while agn feedbackdominates below. this may be understood through the sub-unity exponent found inthe scaling relation we derive between the bcg mass and cluster mass over thehalo mass range 10^13 &lt; m500 &lt; 10^15msol and the lack of correlation betweenradio luminosity and cluster mass, such that bcg agn in groups can haverelatively more energetic influence on the icm. the lx - tx relation forsystems with the most massive bcgs, or those with bcgs co-located with the peakof the icm emission, is steeper than that for those with the least massive andmost offset, which instead follows self-similarity. this is evidence that acombination of central gas cooling and powerful, well fuelled agn causes thedeparture of the icm from pure gravitational heating, with the steepenedrelation crossing self-similarity at tx = 2 kev. importantly, regardless oftheir black hole mass, bcgs are more likely to host radio-loud agn if they arein a massive cluster (tx &gt; 2 kev) and again co-located with an effective fuelsupply of dense, cooling gas. this demonstrates that the most massive blackholes appear to know more about their host cluster than they do about theirhost galaxy. the results lead us to propose a physically motivated, empiricaldefinition of 'cluster' and 'group', delineated at 2 kev.

1204.5195	rotation rates, sizes, and star formation efficiencies of a  representative population of simulated disc galaxies	we examine the rotation rates, sizes, and star formation (sf) efficiencies ofa representative population of simulated disc galaxies extracted from thegalaxies-intergalactic medium interaction calculation (gimic) suite ofcosmological hydrodynamic simulations. these simulations include efficient, butenergetically feasible supernova feedback, but have not been tuned in any wayto produce 'realistic' disc galaxies. yet, they generate a large number ofdiscs, without requiring extremely high resolution. over the wide galaxystellar mass range, 9.0 &lt; log10[mstar (msun)] &lt; 10.5, the simulations reproducethe observed tully-fisher relation, the rotation curves of disc galaxies inbins of stellar mass, the mass-size relation of disc galaxies, the opticalrotation to virial circular velocity ratio (vopt/vvir), and the sf efficienciesof disc galaxies as inferred from stacked weak lensing and stacked satellitekinematics observations. they also reproduce the specific star formation ratesof ~l* galaxies but predict too low levels of star formation for low-massgalaxies, which is plausibly due to the finite resolution of the simulations.at higher stellar masses, log10[mstar (\msun)] &gt; 10.6, the simulated galaxiesare too concentrated and have too high sf efficiencies. we conjecture that thisshortcoming reflects the neglect of feedback from accreting supermassive blackholes in these simulations. we conclude that it is possible to generate arepresentative population of disc galaxies that reproduces many of the observedtrends of local disc galaxies using standard numerical hydrodynamic techniquesand a plausible implementation of the "subgrid" astrophysical processes thoughtto be relevant to galaxy formation.

1205.2549	the competition between confinement and ram pressure and its  implications for galaxies in groups and clusters	ram pressure stripping of the hot gas that surrounds normal galaxies as theyfall into groups and clusters (also referred to as `strangulation' or`starvation') is generally thought to shut down star formation on a time scaleof a few gyr. however, it has recently been suggested, on the basis ofx-ray-optical scaling relations of galaxies in the field and the group/clusterenvironment, that confinement pressure by the intra-cluster medium can actuallylead to an increase in the mass of hot gas surrounding these galaxies. weinvestigate the competition between pressure confinement and ram pressurestripping for satellite galaxies in orbit about galaxy groups and clustersusing simple analytic models and detailed cosmological hydrodynamicsimulations. it is found that, independent of host mass, ram pressure isgenerally dominant over confinement pressure --- only ~16 % of galaxies findthemselves in the reverse situation. furthermore, these galaxies have, onaverage, less hot gas than ram-pressure dominated ones, contrary to simpleexpectations. this is explained by the fact that the small number of galaxieswhich are confinement dominated are typically at first or second apocentre andhave therefore already been maximally affected by ram pressure stripping aroundfirst pericentre. our results are shown to be insensitive to host halo mass; weargue that the same is true for uncertain sub-grid processes, such as feedback.

1210.8407	why does the environmental influence on group and cluster galaxies  extend beyond the virial radius?	in the local universe, galaxies in groups and clusters contain less gas andare less likely to be forming stars than their field counterparts. this effectis not limited to the central group/cluster regions, but is shown by recentobservations to persist out to several virial radii. to gain insight into theextent and cause of this large-scale environmental influence, we use a suite ofhigh-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to analyse galaxiesaround simulated groups and clusters of a wide range of mass (log m/m_sun =[13.0, 15.2]). in qualitative agreement with the observations, we find asystematic depletion of both hot and cold gas and a decline in the star formingfraction of galaxies as far out as ~ 5 r200 from the host centre. while asubstantial fraction of these galaxies are on highly elliptical orbits and arenot infalling for the first time (~ 50 per cent at 2 r200, independent of hostmass) or are affected by `pre-processing' (less than 10 per cent of galaxiesaround groups, increasing to ~ 50 per cent around a massive cluster), even acombination of these indirect mechanisms does not fully account for theenvironmental influence, particularly in the case of the hot gas content.direct ram pressure interaction with an extended gas `halo' surrounding groupsand clusters is shown to be sufficiently strong to strip the hot gasatmospheres of infalling galaxies out to ~ 5 r200. we show that this influenceis highly anisotropic, with ram pressure along filaments enhanced by up to afactor of 100 despite significant co-flow of gas and galaxies.

1304.4730	enriching the hot circumgalactic medium	models of galaxy formation in a cdm universe predict that massive galaxiesare surrounded by a hot, quasi-hydrostatic circumgalactic corona of slowlycooling gas, predominantly accreted from the igm. this prediction is borne outby the cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of crain et al., which reproducescaling relations between the x-ray and optical properties of nearby discgalaxies. such coronae are metal poor, but observations of the x-ray emittingcircumgalactic medium (cgm) of local galaxies typically indicate enrichment tonear-solar iron abundance, potentially signalling a shortcoming in galaxyformation models. we show here that, while the hot cgm of galaxies formed inthe simulations is metal poor in a mass-weighted sense, its x-rayluminosity-weighted metallicity is often close to solar. this bias arisesbecause the soft x-ray emissivity of a typical 0.1 kev corona is dominated bycollisionally-excited metal ions that are synthesised in stars and recycledinto the hot cgm. we find that these metals are ejected primarily by stars thatform in-situ to the main progenitor of the galaxy, rather than in satellites orexternal galaxies. the enrichment of the hot cgm therefore proceeds in aninside-out fashion throughout the assembly of the galaxy: metals aretransported from the central galaxy by sne-driven winds and convection overseveral gigayears, establishing a strong negative radial metallicity gradient.whilst metal ions synthesised by stars are necessary to produce the x-rayemissivity that enables the hot cgm of isolated galaxies to be detected, theelectrons that collisionally excite them are equally important. since oursimulations indicate that the electron density of hot coronae is dominated bythe metal-poor gas accreted from the igm, we infer that the hot cgm observedvia x-ray emission is the outcome of both hierarchical accretion and stellarrecycling.

0801.0990	testing cold dark matter with the hierarchical buildup of stellar light	(abridged) we demonstrate that the tenet of hierarchical structure growthleads directly to a robust, falsifiable prediction for the correlation betweenstellar fraction (fstar) and total system mass (m500) of galaxy groups andclusters. this prediction is relatively insensitive to the details of baryonicphysics or cosmological parameters. in particular, if the fstar-m500 relationis fixed and does not evolve with redshift, cdm models predict the logarithmicslope of this relation to be b&gt;-0.3. this constraint can be weakened if thefstar-m500 relation evolves strongly, but this implies more stars must beformed in situ in groups at low redshift. conservatively requiring that atleast half the stars in groups were formed by z=1, the constraint fromevolution models is b&gt;-0.35. since the most massive clusters (m500=1e15 msun)are observed to have fstar=0.01, this means that groups with m500=5e13 msunmust have fstar&lt;0.03. recent observations by gonzalez et al. (2007) indicate amuch steeper relation, with fstar&gt;0.04 in groups, leading to b=-0.64. ifconfirmed, this would rule out hierarchical structure formation models: today'sclusters could not have been built from today's groups, or even from thehigher-redshift progenitors of those groups. we perform a careful analysis ofthese and other data to identify the most important systematic uncertainties intheir measurements. although correlated uncertainties on stellar and totalmasses might explain the steep observed relation, the data are only consistentwith theory if the observed group masses are systematically underestimated.

1310.7571	the impact of baryonic processes on the two-point correlation functions  of galaxies, subhaloes and matter	the observed clustering of galaxies and the cross-correlation of galaxies andmass provide important constraints on both cosmology and models of galaxyformation. even though the dissipation and feedback processes associated withgalaxy formation are thought to affect the distribution of matter, essentiallyall models used to predict clustering data are based on collisionlesssimulations. here, we use large hydrodynamical simulations to investigate howgalaxy formation affects the autocorrelation functions of galaxies andsubhaloes, as well as their cross-correlation with matter. we show that thechanges due to the inclusion of baryons are not limited to small scales and areeven present in samples selected by subhalo mass. samples selected by subhalomass cluster ~10% more strongly in a baryonic run on scales r &gt; 1mpc/h, andthis difference increases for smaller separations. while the inclusion ofbaryons boosts the clustering at fixed subhalo mass on all scales, the sign ofthe effect on the cross-correlation of subhaloes with matter can vary withradius. we show that the large-scale effects are due to the change in subhalomass caused by the strong feedback associated with galaxy formation and maytherefore not affect samples selected by number density. however, on scales r &lt;r_vir significant differences remain after accounting for the change in subhalomass. we conclude that predictions for galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-mass clusteringfrom models based on collisionless simulations will have errors greater than10% on sub-mpc scales, unless the simulation results are modified to correctlyaccount for the effects of baryons on the distributions of mass and satellites.

1312.5341	the thermal sunyaev zel'dovich effect power spectrum in light of planck	(abridged) the amplitude of the thermal sunyaev zel'dovich effect (tsz) powerspectrum is extremely sensitive to the abundance of galaxy clusters andtherefore to fundamental cosmological parameters that control their growth,such as sigma_8 and omega_m. here we explore the sensitivity of the tsz powerspectrum to important non-gravitational ('sub-grid') physics by employing thecosmo-owls suite of large-volume cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, runin both the planck and wmap7 best-fit cosmologies. on intermediate and smallangular scales (ell &gt; ~1000, or theta &lt; ~10 arcmin), accessible with the southpole telescope and the atacama cosmology telescope, the predicted tsz powerspectrum is highly model dependent, with agn feedback having a particularlylarge effect. however, at large scales, observable with the planck telescope,the effects of sub-grid physics are minor. comparing the simulations withobservations, we find a significant amplitude offset on all measured angularscales (including large scales), if the planck best-fit cosmology is assumed bythe simulations. this is shown to be a generic result for all current tszmodels. by contrast, if the wmap7 cosmology is adopted, there is fullconsistency with the planck power spectrum measurements on large scales andagreement at the 2 sigma level with the spt/act measurements at intermediatescales for our fiducial agn model, which le brun et al.

1312.5462	towards a realistic population of simulated galaxy groups and clusters	we present a new suite of large-volume cosmological hydrodynamicalsimulations called cosmo-owls. they form an extension to the overwhelminglylarge simulations (owls) project, and have been designed to help improve ourunderstanding of cluster astrophysics and non-linear structure formation, whichare now the limiting systematic errors when using clusters as cosmologicalprobes. starting from identical initial conditions in either the planck orwmap7 cosmologies, we systematically vary the most important `sub-grid'physics, including feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei (agn).we compare the properties of the simulated galaxy groups and clusters to a widerange of observational data, such as x-ray luminosity and temperature, gas massfractions, entropy and density profiles, sunyaev-zel'dovich flux, i-bandmass-to-light ratio, dominance of the brightest cluster galaxy, and centralmassive black hole (bh) masses, by producing synthetic observations andmimicking observational analysis techniques. these comparisons demonstrate thatsome agn feedback models can produce a realistic population of galaxy groupsand clusters, broadly reproducing both the median trend and, for the firsttime, the scatter in physical properties over approximately two decades in mass($10^{13} \lesssim m_{500} \lesssim 10^{15}~\textrm{m}_{\odot}$) and 1.5decades in radius ($0.05 \lesssim r/r_{500} \lesssim 1.5$). however, in othermodels, the agn feedback is too violent (even though they reproduce theobserved bh scaling relations), implying calibration of the models is required.the production of realistic populations of simulated groups and clusters, aswell as models that bracket the observations, opens the door to the creation ofsynthetic surveys for assisting the astrophysical and cosmologicalinterpretation of cluster surveys, as well as quantifying the impact ofselection effects.

1402.4461	the impact of galaxy formation on the total mass, mass profile and  abundance of haloes	we use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to investigate how theinclusion of physical processes relevant to galaxy formation (star formation,metal-line cooling, stellar winds, supernovae and feedback from active galacticnuclei, agn) change the properties of haloes, over four orders of magnitude inmass. we find that gas expulsion and the associated dark matter (dm) expansioninduced by supernova-driven winds are important for haloes with masses m200 &lt;10^13 msun, lowering their masses by up to 20% relative to a dm-only model. agnfeedback, which is required to prevent overcooling, has a significant impact onhalo masses all the way up to cluster scales (m200 ~ 10^15 msun). baryonicphysics changes the total mass profiles of haloes out to several times thevirial radius, a modification that cannot be captured by a change in the haloconcentration. the decrease in the total halo mass causes a decrease in thehalo mass function of about 20%. this effect can have important consequencesfor abundance matching technique as well as for most semi-analytic models ofgalaxy formation. we provide analytic fitting formulae, derived fromsimulations that reproduce the observed baryon fractions, to correct halomasses and mass functions from dm-only simulations. the effect of baryonicphysics (agn feedback in particular) on cluster number counts is about as largeas changing the cosmology from wmap7 to planck, even when a moderately highmass limit of m500 ~ 10^14 msun is adopted. thus, for precision cosmology theeffects of baryons must be accounted for.

1404.3724	bent by baryons: the low mass galaxy-halo relation	the relation between galaxies and dark matter halos is of vital importancefor evaluating theoretical predictions of structure formation and galaxyformation physics. we show that the widely used method of abundance matchingbased on dark matter only simulations fails at the low mass end because two ofits underlying assumptions are broken: only a small fraction of low mass (below10^9.5 solar masses) halos host a visible galaxy, and halos grow at a lowerrate due to the effect of baryons. in this regime, reliance on dark matter onlysimulations for abundance matching is neither accurate nor self-consistent. wefind that the reported discrepancy between observational estimates of the halomasses of dwarf galaxies and the values predicted by abundance matching doesnot point to a failure of lcdm, but simply to a failure to account for baryoniceffects. our results also imply that the local group contains only a fewhundred observable galaxies in contrast with the thousands of faint dwarfs thatabundance matching would suggest. we show how relations derived from abundancematching can be corrected, so that they can be used self-consistently tocalibrate models of galaxy formation.

1410.8161	star formation quenching in simulated group and cluster galaxies: when,  how, and why?	star formation is observed to be suppressed in group and cluster galaxiescompared to the field. to gain insight into the quenching process, we haveanalysed ~2000 galaxies formed in the gimic suite of cosmologicalhydrodynamical simulations. the time of quenching varies from ~2 gyr beforeaccretion (first crossing of r200,c) to &gt;4 gyr after, depending on satelliteand host mass. once begun, quenching is rapid (&gt;~ 500 myr) in low-mass galaxies(m* &lt; 10^10 m_sun), but significantly more protracted for more massivesatellites. the simulations predict a substantial role of outflows driven byram pressure -- but not tidal forces -- in removing the star-forminginterstellar matter (ism) from satellite galaxies, especially dwarfs (m* ~ 10^9m_sun) where they account for nearly two thirds of ism loss in both groups andclusters. immediately before quenching is complete, this fraction rises to ~80%even for milky way analogues (m* ~ 10^10.5 m_sun) in groups (m_host ~ 10^13.5m_sun). we show that (i) ism stripping was significantly more effective atearly times than at z = 0; (ii) approximately half the gas is stripped from`galactic fountains' and half directly from the star forming disk; (iii)galaxies undergoing stripping experience ram pressure up to ~100 times theaverage at a given group/cluster-centric radius, because they arepreferentially located in overdense icm regions. remarkably, stripping causesat most half the loss of the extended gas haloes surrounding our simulatedsatellites. these results contrast sharply with the current picture ofstrangulation -- removal of the ism through star formation after stripping ofthe hot halo -- being the dominant mechanism quenching group and clustersatellites.

0804.1552	the impact of mergers on relaxed x-ray clusters - iii. effects on  compact cool cores	(abridged) we use the simulations presented in poole et al. 2006 to examinethe effects of mergers on compact cool cores in x-ray clusters. we propose ascheme for classifying the morphology of clusters based on their surfacebrightness and entropy profiles. three dominant morphologies emerge: twohosting compact cores and central temperatures which are cool (ccc systems) orwarm (cwc systems) and one hosting extended cores which are warm (ewc systems).we find that ccc states are disrupted only after direct collisions betweencluster cores in head-on collisions or during second pericentric passage inoff-axis mergers. by the time they relax, our remnant cores have generally beenheated to warm core (cwc or ewc) states but subsequently recover ccc states.the only case resulting in a long-lived ewc state is a slightly off-axis 3:1merger for which the majority of shock heating occurs during the accretion of alow-entropy stream formed from the disruption of the secondary's core.compression prevents core temperatures from falling until after relaxation thusexplaining the observed population of relaxed cwc systems with no need toinvoke agn feedback. the morphological segregation observed in the l_x-t_x andbeta-r_c scaling relations is reflected in our simulations as well. however,none of the cases we have studied produce sufficiently high remnant centralentropies to account for the most under-luminous ewc systems observed. lastly,systems which initially host central metallicity gradients do not yield mergerremnants with flat metallicity profiles. taken together, these results suggestthat once formed, compact core systems are remarkably stable against disruptionfrom mergers. it remains to be demonstrated exactly how the sizable observedpopulation of extended core systems was formed.

1501.01311	the eagle simulations of galaxy formation: calibration of subgrid  physics and model variations	we present results from thirteen cosmological simulations that explore theparameter space of the "evolution and assembly of galaxies and theirenvironments" (eagle) simulation project. four of the simulations follow theevolution of a periodic cube l = 50 cmpc on a side, and each employs adifferent subgrid model of the energetic feedback associated with starformation. the relevant parameters were adjusted so that the simulations eachreproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass function at z = 0.1. three of thesimulations fail to form disc galaxies as extended as observed, and we showanalytically that this is a consequence of numerical radiative losses thatreduce the efficiency of stellar feedback in high-density gas. such losses aregreatly reduced in the fourth simulation - the eagle reference model - byinjecting more energy in higher density gas. this model produces galaxies withthe observed size distribution, and also reproduces many galaxy scalingrelations. in the remaining nine simulations, a single parameter or process ofthe reference model was varied at a time. we find that the properties ofgalaxies with stellar mass &lt;~ m* (the "knee" of the galaxy stellar massfunction) are largely governed by feedback associated with star formation,while those of more massive galaxies are also controlled by feedback fromaccretion onto their central black holes. both processes must be efficient inorder to reproduce the observed galaxy population. in general, simulations thathave been calibrated to reproduce the low-redshift galaxy stellar mass functionwill still not form realistic galaxies, but the additional requirement thatgalaxy sizes be acceptable leads to agreement with a large range ofobservables.

1501.05666	testing sunyaev-zel'dovich measurements of the hot gas content of dark  matter haloes using synthetic skies	the thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich (tsz) effect offers a means of probing the hotgas in and around massive galaxies and galaxy groups and clusters, which isthought to constitute a large fraction of the baryon content of the universe.the planck collaboration recently performed a stacking analysis of a largesample of `locally brightest galaxies' (lbgs) and, surprisingly, inferred anapproximately self-similar relation between the tsz flux and halo mass. at facevalue, this implies that the hot gas mass fraction is independent of halo mass,a result which is in apparent conflict with resolved x-ray observations. wetest the robustness of the inferred trend using synthetic tsz maps generatedfrom cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and using the same tools andassumptions applied in the planck study. we show that, while the detection andthe estimate of the `total' flux (within $5 r_{500}$) is reasonably robust, theinferred flux originating from within $r_{500}$ (i.e. the limiting radius towhich x-ray observations typically probe) is highly sensitive to the assumedpressure distribution of the gas. using our most realistic simulations with agnfeedback, that reproduce a wide variety of x-ray and optical properties ofgroups and clusters, we estimate that the derived tsz flux within $r_{500}$ isbiased high by up to to an order of magnitude for haloes with masses $m_{500}\sim 10^{13}$ m$_{\odot}$. moreover, we show that the agn simulations areconsistent with the total tsz flux-mass relation observed with planck, whereasa self-similar model is ruled out.

1503.06065	nifty galaxy cluster simulations i: dark matter &amp; non-radiative models	we have simulated the formation of a galaxy cluster in a $\lambda$cdmuniverse using twelve different codes modeling only gravity and non-radiativehydrodynamics (\art, \arepo, \hydra\ and 9 incarnations of gadget). this rangeof codes includes particle based, moving and fixed mesh codes as well as botheulerian and lagrangian fluid schemes. the various gadget implementations spantraditional and advanced smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (sph) schemes. thegoal of this comparison is to assess the reliability of cosmologicalhydrodynamical simulations of clusters in the simplest astrophysically relevantcase, that in which the gas is assumed to be non-radiative. we compare imagesof the cluster at $z=0$, global properties such as mass, and radial profiles ofvarious dynamical and thermodynamical quantities. the underlying gravitationalframework can be aligned very accurately for all the codes allowing a detailedinvestigation of the differences that develop due to the various gas physicsimplementations employed. as expected, the mesh-based codes art and arepo formextended entropy cores in the gas with rising central gas temperatures. thosecodes employing traditional sph schemes show falling entropy profiles all theway into the very centre with correspondingly rising density profiles andcentral temperature inversions. we show that methods with modern sph schemesthat allow entropy mixing span the range between these two extremes and thelatest sph variants produce gas entropy profiles that are essentiallyindistinguishable from those obtained with grid based methods.

1504.04025	the alignment and shape of dark matter, stellar, and hot gas  distributions in the eagle and cosmo-owls simulations	we report the alignment and shape of dark matter, stellar, and hot gasdistributions in the eagle and cosmo-owls simulations. the combination of thesestate-of-the-art hydro-cosmological simulations enables us to span four ordersof magnitude in halo mass ($11 &lt; log_{10}(m_{200}/ [h^{-1}m_\odot]) &lt; 15$), awide radial range ($-2.3 &lt; log_{10}(r/[h^{-1}mpc ]) &lt; 1.3$) and redshifts $0 &lt;z &lt; 1$. the shape parameters of the dark matter, stellar and hot gasdistributions follow qualitatively similar trends: they become more aspherical(and triaxial) with increasing halo mass, radius and redshift. we measure themisalignment of the baryonic components (hot gas and stars) of galaxies withtheir host halo as a function of halo mass, radius, redshift, and galaxy type(centrals vs satellites and early- vs late-type). overall, galaxies align wellwith the local distribution of the total (mostly dark) matter. however, thestellar distributions on galactic scales exhibit a median misalignment of about45-50 degrees with respect to their host haloes. this misalignment is reducedto 25-30 degrees in the most massive haloes ($13 &lt; log_{10}(m_{200}/[h^{-1}m_\odot ]) &lt; 15$). half of the disc galaxies in the eagle simulationshave a misalignment angle with respect to their host haloes larger than 40degrees. we present fitting functions and tabulated values for the probabilitydistribution of galaxy-halo misalignment to enable a straightforward inclusionof our results into models of galaxy formations based on purely collisionlessn-body simulations.

1504.04374	colours and luminosities of z=0.1 simulated galaxies in the eagle  simulations	we calculate the colours and luminosities of redshift z = 0.1 galaxies fromthe eagle simulation suite using the galaxev population synthesis models. wetake into account obscuration by dust in birth clouds and diffuse ism using atwo-component screen model, following the prescription of charlot and fall. wecompare models in which the dust optical depth is constant to models where itdepends on gas metallicity, gas fraction and orientation. the colours of eaglegalaxies for the more sophisticated models are in broad agreement with those ofobserved galaxies. in particular, eagle produces a red sequence of passivegalaxies and a blue cloud of star forming galaxies, with approximately thecorrect fraction of galaxies in each population and with g-r colours within 0.1magnitudes of those observed. luminosity functions from uv to nir wavelengthsdiffer from observations at a level comparable to systematic shifts resultingfrom a choice between petrosian and kron photometric apertures. despite thegenerally good agreement there are clear discrepancies with observations. theblue cloud of eagle galaxies extends to somewhat higher luminosities than inthe data, consistent with the modest underestimate of the passive fraction inmassive eagle galaxies. there is also a moderate excess of bright blue galaxiescompared to observations. the overall level of agreement with the observedcolour distribution suggests that eagle galaxies at z = 0.1 have ages,metallicities and levels of obscuration that are comparable to those ofobserved galaxies.

1506.02772	the evolution of galaxy metallicity scaling relations in cosmological  hydrodynamical simulations	the evolution of the metal content of galaxies and its relations to otherglobal properties [such as total stellar mass (m*), circular velocity, starformation rate (sfr), halo mass, etc.] provides important constraints on modelsof galaxy formation. here we examine the evolution of metallicity scalingrelations of simulated galaxies in the galaxies-intergalactic mediuminteraction calculation suite of cosmological simulations. we make comparisonsto observations of the correlation of gas-phase abundances with m* (themass-metallicity relation, mzr), as well as with both m* and sfr or gas massfraction (the so-called 3d fundamental metallicity relations, fmrs). thesimulated galaxies follow the observed local mzr and fmrs over an order ofmagnitude in m*, but overpredict the metallicity of massive galaxies (log m* &gt;10.5), plausibly due to inefficient feedback in this regime. we discuss theorigin of the mzr and fmrs in the context of galactic outflows and gasaccretion. we examine the evolution of mass-metallicity relations defined usingdifferent elements that probe the three enrichment channels (snii, snia, andagb stars). relations based on elements produced mainly by snii evolve weakly,whereas those based on elements produced preferentially in snia/agb exhibitstronger evolution, due to the longer timescales associated with thesechannels. finally, we compare the relations of central and satellite galaxies,finding systematically higher metallicities for satellites, as observed. weshow this is due to the removal of the metal poor gas reservoir that normallysurrounds galaxies and acts to dilute their gas-phase metallicity (viacooling/accretion onto the disk), but is lost due to ram pressure stripping forsatellites.

1509.05056	the eagle simulations of galaxy formation: the importance of the  hydrodynamics scheme	we present results from a subset of simulations from the "evolution andassembly of galaxies and their environments" (eagle) suite in which theformulation of the hydrodynamics scheme is varied. we compare simulations thatuse the same subgrid models without re-calibration of the parameters butemploying the standard gadget flavour of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph)instead of the more recent state-of-the-art anarchy formulation of sph that wasused in the fiducial eagle runs. we find that the properties of most galaxies,including their masses and sizes, are not significantly affected by the detailsof the hydrodynamics solver. however, the star formation rates of the mostmassive objects are affected by the lack of phase mixing due to spurioussurface tension in the simulation using standard sph. this affects theefficiency with which agn activity can quench star formation in these galaxiesand it also leads to differences in the intragroup medium that affect the x-rayemission from these objects. the differences that can be attributed to thehydrodynamics solver are, however, likely to be less important at lowerresolution. we also find that the use of a time step limiter is important forachieving the feedback efficiency required to match observations of thelow-mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function.

1511.03731	nifty galaxy cluster simulations ii: radiative models	we have simulated the formation of a massive galaxy cluster (m$_{200}^{\rmcrit}$ = 1.1$\times$10$^{15}h^{-1}m_{\odot}$) in a $\lambda$cdm universe using10 different codes (ramses, 2 incarnations of arepo and 7 of gadget), modelinghydrodynamics with full radiative subgrid physics. these codes includesmoothed-particle hydrodynamics (sph), spanning traditional and advanced sphschemes, adaptive mesh and moving mesh codes. our goal is to study theconsistency between simulated clusters modeled with different radiativephysical implementations - such as cooling, star formation and agn feedback. wecompare images of the cluster at $z=0$, global properties such as mass, andradial profiles of various dynamical and thermodynamical quantities. we findthat, with respect to non-radiative simulations, dark matter is more centrallyconcentrated, the extent not simply depending on the presence/absence of agnfeedback. the scatter in global quantities is substantially higher than fornon-radiative runs. intriguingly, adding radiative physics seems to have washedaway the marked code-based differences present in the entropy profile seen fornon-radiative simulations in sembolini et al. (2015): radiative physics +classic sph can produce entropy cores. furthermore, the inclusion/absence ofagn feedback is not the dividing line -as in the case of describing the stellarcontent- for whether a code produces an unrealistic temperature inversion and afalling central entropy profile. however, agn feedback does strongly affect theoverall stellar distribution, limiting the effect of overcooling and reducingsensibly the stellar fraction.

1512.03857	the xxl survey iv. mass-temperature relation of the bright cluster  sample	the xxl survey is the largest survey carried out by xmm-newton. covering anarea of 50deg$^2$, the survey contains $\sim450$ galaxy clusters out to aredshift $\sim$2 and to an x-ray flux limit of$\sim5\times10^{-15}erg\,s^{-1}cm^{-2}$. this paper is part of the firstrelease of xxl results focussed on the bright cluster sample. we investigatethe scaling relation between weak-lensing mass and x-ray temperature for thebrightest clusters in xxl. the scaling relation is used to estimate the mass ofall 100 clusters in xxl-100-gc. based on a subsample of 38 objects that liewithin the intersection of the northern xxl field and the publicly availablecfhtlens catalog, we derive the $m_{wl}$ of each system with carefulconsiderations of the systematics. the clusters lie at $0.1&lt;z&lt;0.6$ and span arange of $ t\simeq1-5kev$. we combine our sample with 58 clusters from theliterature, increasing the range out to 10kev. to date, this is the largestsample of clusters with $m_{wl}$ measurements that has been used to study themass-temperature relation. the fit ($m\propto t^b$) to the xxl clusters returnsa slope $b=1.78^{+0.37}_{-0.32}$ and intrinsic scatter $\sigma_{\lnm|t}\simeq0.53$; the scatter is dominated by disturbed clusters. the fit to thecombined sample of 96 clusters is in tension with self-similarity,$b=1.67\pm0.12$ and $\sigma_{\ln m|t}\simeq0.41$. overall our resultsdemonstrate the feasibility of ground-based weak-lensing scaling relationstudies down to cool systems of $\sim1kev$ temperature and highlight that thecurrent data and samples are a limit to our statistical precision. as such weare unable to determine whether the validity of hydrostatic equilibrium is afunction of halo mass. an enlarged sample of cool systems, deeper weak-lensingdata, and robust modelling of the selection function will help to explore theseissues further.

0807.0001	the colours of satellite galaxies in groups and clusters	current models of galaxy formation predict satellite galaxies in groups andclusters that are redder than observed. we investigate the effect on thecolours of satellite galaxies produced by the ram pressure stripping of theirhot gaseous atmospheres as the satellites orbit within their parent halo. weincorporate a model of the stripping process based on detailed hydrodynamicsimulations within the durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. thesimulations show that the environment in groups and clusters is less aggressivethan previously assumed. the main uncertainty in the model is the treatment ofgas expelled by supernovae. with reasonable assumptions for the stripping ofthis material, we find that satellite galaxies are able to retain a significantfraction of their hot gas for several gigayears, thereby replenishing theirreservoirs of cold, star forming gas and remaining blue for a relatively longperiod of time. a bimodal distribution of galaxy colours, similar to thatobserved in sdss data, is established and the colours of the satellite galaxiesare in good agreement with the data. in addition, our model naturally accountsfor the observed dependence of satellite colours on environment, from smallgroups to high mass clusters.

astro-ph;0111282	non-thermal x-ray emission: an alternative to cluster cooling flows?	we report the results of experiments aimed at reducing the major problem withcooling flow models of rich cluster x-ray sources: the fact that most of thecooled gas or its products have not been found. here we show that much of thex-ray emission usually attributed to cooling flows can, in fact, be modeled bya power-law component which is indicative of a source(s) other than thermalbremsstrahlung from the intracluster medium. we find that adequate simultaneousfits to rosat pspcb and asca gis/sis spectra of the central regions of tenclusters are obtained for two-component models that include a thermal plasmacomponent that is attributable to hot intracluster gas and a power-lawcomponent that is likely generated by compact sources and/or extendednon-thermal emission. for five of the clusters that purportedly have massivecooling flows, the best-fit models have power-law components that contribute$\sim$ 30 % of the total flux (0.14 - 10.0 kev) within the central 3arcminutes. because cooling flow mass deposition rates are inferred from x-rayfluxes, our finding opens the possibility of significantly reducing coolingrates.

astro-ph;0203189	the cluster gas mass - temperature relation: evidence for a high level  of preheating	recent x-ray observations have been used to demonstrate that the cluster gasmass-temperature relation is steeper than theoretical self-similar predictionsdrawn from numerical simulations that consider the evolution of the cluster gasthrough the effects of gravity and shock heating alone. one possibleexplanation for this is that the gas mass fraction is not constant acrossclusters of different temperature, as is usually assumed. observationally,however, there is no compelling evidence for gas mass fraction variation,especially in the case of hot clusters. seeking an alternative physicalexplanation for the observed trends, we investigate the role in the cluster gasmass - temperature relation of the preheating of the intracluster medium bysome arbitrary source for clusters with emission-weighted mean temperatures ofgreater than about 3 kev. making use of the physically-motivated, analyticmodels developed in 2002 by babul and coworkers, we find that preheating does,indeed, lead to a steeper relation. this is in agreement with previoustheoretical studies on the relation. however, in apparent conflict with thesestudies, we argue that a ``high'' level of entropy injection is required tomatch observations. in particular, an entropy floor of greater than about 300kev cm^2 is required. we also present a new test, namely, the study of therelation within different fixed radii. this allows one to indirectly probe thedensity profiles of clusters, since it samples different fractions of thevirial radius for clusters of different temperature. this test also confirmsthat a high level of preheating is required to match observations.

astro-ph;0302087	cluster sunyaev-zeldovich effect scaling relations	x-ray observations of an "entropy floor" in nearby groups and clusters ofgalaxies offer evidence that important non-gravitational processes, such asradiative cooling and/or "preheating", have strongly influenced the evolutionof the intracluster medium (icm). we examine how the presence of an entropyfloor modifies the thermal sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) effect. a detailed analysisof scaling relations between x-ray and sz effect observables and also betweenthe two primary sz effect observables is presented. we find that relationshipsbetween the central compton parameter and the temperature or mass of a clusterare extremely sensitive to the presence of an entropy floor. the same is truefor correlations between the integrated compton parameter and the x-rayluminosity or the central compton parameter. in fact, if the entropy floor isas high as inferred in recent analyses of x-ray data, a comparison of thesecorrelations with both current and future sz effect observations should show aclear signature of this excess entropy. moreover, because the sz effect isredshift-independent, the relations can potentially be used to track theevolution of the cluster gas and possibly discriminate between the possiblesources of the excess entropy. to facilitate comparisons with observations, weprovide analytic fits to these scaling relations.

astro-ph;0303270	on the relationship between cooling flows and bubbles	a common feature of the x-ray bubbles observed in chandra images of some"cooling flow" clusters is that they appear to be surrounded by bright, coolshells. temperature maps of a few nearby luminous clusters reveal that theshells consist of the coolest gas in the clusters -- much cooler than thesurrounding medium. using simple models, we study the effects of this coolemission on the inferred cooling flow properties of clusters. we find that theintroduction of bubbles into model clusters that do not have cooling flowsresults in temperature and surface brightness profiles that resemble those seenin nearby "cooling flow" clusters. they also approximately reproduce the recentxmm-newton and chandra observations of a high minimum temperature of 1-3 kev.hence, bubbles, if present, must be taken into account when inferring thephysical properties of the icm. in the case of some clusters, bubbles mayaccount entirely for these observed features, calling into question theirdesignation as clusters with cooling flows. however, since not all nearby"cooling flow" clusters show bubble-like features, we suggest that there may bea diverse range of physical phenomena that give rise to the same observedfeatures.

astro-ph;0303451	the sz effect signature of excess entropy in distant, massive clusters	studies of cluster x-ray scaling relations have led to suggestions thatnon-gravitational processes, e.g., radiative cooling and/or "preheating", havesignificantly modified the entropy of the intracluster medium (icm). for thefirst time, we test this hypothesis through a comparison of predicted thermalsunyaev-zeldovich (sz) effect scaling relations with available data from theliterature. one of the relations that we explore, in principle, depends solelyon sz effect observations, thus offering an x-ray independent probe of the icm.a detailed comparison of the theoretical relations with the largest compilationof high redshift sz effect data to date indicates that the presence of anentropy floor is favored by the data. furthermore, the inferred level of thatfloor, 300 kev cm^2 or higher, is comparable to that found in studies of x-rayscaling relations of nearby massive clusters. thus, we find no evidence forsignificant evolution of the entropy floor out to z = 0.7. we furtherdemonstrate that the high quality data to be obtained from the upcomingsunyaev-zeldovich array (sza) and the (soon-to-be) upgraded owens valley radioobservatory (ovro) array will open powerful new windows into the properties ofthe icm. specifically, the new measurements will allow for accuratemeasurements of the icm entropy for even the most distant galaxy clusters.

0808.2994	the flip-side of galaxy formation: a combined model of galaxy formation  and cluster heating	only ~10% of baryons in the universe are in the form of stars, yet mostmodels of luminous structure formation have concentrated on the properties ofthe luminous stellar matter. in this paper we focus on the "flip side" ofgalaxy formation and investigate the properties of the material that is notpresently locked up in galaxies. this "by-product" of galaxy formation can beobserved as an x-ray emitting plasma (the intracluster medium, hereafter icm)in groups and clusters, and we present a version of the durham semi-analyticgalaxy formation model galform that allows us to investigate the properties ofthe icm. as we would expect on the basis of gravitational scaling arguments,the previous model (presented in bower et al. 2006) fails to reproduce even themost basic observed properties of the icm; however, we present a simplemodification to the model to allow for heat input into the icm from the agn"radio mode" feedback. this heating acts to expel gas from the x-ray luminouscentral regions of the host halo. with this modification, the model reproducesthe observed gas mass fractions and luminosity-temperature relation of groupsand clusters. introducing the heating process into the model requires changesto a number of model parameters in order to retain a good match to the observedgalaxy properties. with the revised parameters, the best fitting luminosityfunction is comparable to that presented in bower et al. (2006). the new modelmakes a fundamental step forward, providing a unified model of galaxy andcluster icm formation. however, the detailed comparison with the data is notcompletely satisfactory, and we highlight key areas for improvement.

astro-ph;0402241	photoevaporation of circumstellar disks around young stars	we examine the ability of photoevaporative disk winds to explain thelow-velocity components observed in the forbidden line spectra of low-mass ttauri stars. using the analytic model of shu, johnstone, &amp; hollenbach (1993)and hollenbach et al. (1994) as a basis, we examine the characteristics ofphotoevaporative outflows with hydrodynamic simulations. general results fromthe simulations agree well with the analytic predictions, although some smalldifferences are present. most importantly, the flow of material from the disksurface develops at smaller radii than in the analytic approximations and theflow-velocity from the disk surface is only one-third the sound speed. adetailed presentation of observational consequences of the model is given,including predicted line widths, blue-shifts, and integrated luminosities ofobservable sulfur and nitrogen emission lines. we demonstrate that thesepredictions are in agreement with current observational data on thelow-velocity forbidden line emission of ionized species from t tauri stars.this is in contrast with magnetic wind models, which systematicallyunder-predict these forbidden line luminosities. however, the present modelcannot easily account for the luminosities of neutral oxygen lines in t tauristars.

astro-ph;0406329	models of the icm with heating and cooling: explaining the global and  structural x-ray properties of clusters	(abridged) theoretical models that include only gravitationally-drivenprocesses fail to match the observed mean x-ray properties of clusters. as aresult, there has recently been increased interest in models in which eitherradiative cooling or entropy injection play a central role in mediating theproperties of the intracluster medium. both sets of models give reasonable fitsto the mean properties of clusters, but cooling only models result in fractionsof cold baryons in excess of observationally established limits and thesimplest entropy injection models do not treat the "cooling core" structurepresent in many clusters and cannot account for entropy profiles revealed byrecent x-ray observations. we consider models that marry radiative cooling withentropy injection, and confront model predictions for the global and structuralproperties of massive clusters with the latest x-ray data. the modelssuccessfully and simultaneously reproduce the observed l-t and l-m relations,yield detailed entropy, surface brightness, and temperature profiles inexcellent agreement with observations, and predict a cooled gas fraction thatis consistent with observational constraints. the model also provides apossible explanation for the significant intrinsic scatter present in the l-tand l-m relations and provides a natural way of distinguishing between clustersclassically identified as "cooling flow" clusters and dynamically relaxed"non-cooling flow" clusters. the former correspond to systems that had onlymild levels (&lt; 300 kev cm^2) of entropy injection, while the latter areidentified as systems that had much higher entropy injection. this is borne outby the entropy profiles derived from chandra and xmm-newton.

astro-ph;0501137	the effects of radiative cooling on the entropy distribution of  intracluster gas	high resolution x-ray observations indicate that the entropy profiles in thecentral regions of some massive cooling flow clusters are well approximated bypowerlaws. mccarthy and coworkers recently accounted for this trend with ananalytic model that includes the detailed effects of radiative cooling.interestingly, these authors found that cooling (and subsequent inflow of thegas) naturally establishes approximate steady-state powerlaw entropy profilesin the cores of clusters. however, the origin of this behavior and itsdependence on initial conditions have yet to be elucidated. in the presentstudy, we explain this trend in the context of the self-similar cooling wavemodel developed previously by bertschinger (1989). it is shown that thelogarithmic slope of the entropy profile in the cores of relaxed cooling flowclusters is given by a simple analytic function that depends only on thelogarithmic slopes of the local gravitational potential and the coolingfunction. we discuss a number of potentially interesting uses of the aboveresult, including: (1) a way of measuring the shapes of gravitationalpotentials of cooling flow clusters (which may, for example, be compared withthe results of the standard hydrostatic equilibrium method); (2) a simplemethod for constructing realistic analytic cluster models that include theeffects of radiative cooling; and (3) a test of the reliability of coolingroutines implemented in analytic models and hydrodynamic simulations.

astro-ph;0511768	an analytic investigation of the scatter in the integrated x-ray  properties of galaxy groups and clusters	(abridged) we revisit the scaling relationships between the dark matter massand observed x-ray luminosity and temperature of galaxy clusters and groups inthe local universe. specifically, we compare recent observations with analyticmodels of the intracluster medium in which the gas entropy distribution hasbeen shifted by a variable amount, k0, to investigate the origin of the scatterin these scaling relations, and its influence on the luminosity and temperaturefunctions. we find that variations in halo concentration or formation epoch(which might determine the time available for low entropy gas to cool out) areinsufficient to explain the amount of scatter in the mass-luminosity relation.instead, a range of entropy floors at a fixed halo mass, spanning approximately50 kev sq.cm to 700 kev sq.cm, is required to match the data. this range islikely related to the variance in heating and/or cooling efficiency from haloto halo. we demonstrate that these models are consistent with the observedtemperature and luminosity functions of clusters, if scatter in themass-luminosity relation is accounted for. finally, we present predictions forthe redshift evolution of these scaling relations and luminosity/temperaturefunctions. comparison with recent data at z&lt;0.7 shows reasonable agreement witha model that assumes a median entropy floor of k0=200 kev sq.cm. whenobservations are extended to group scales (kt &lt; 1 kev), this evolution willhave the potential to discriminate between an entropy floor that is independentof redshift (for example, in a preheating scenario) and one that depends on thecooling time of the halo.

astro-ph;0608560	the impact of mergers on relaxed x-ray clusters - i. dynamical evolution  and emergent transient structures	we report on the analysis of a suite of sph simulations (incorporatingcooling and star formation) of mergers involving idealised x-ray clusters whoseinitial conditions resemble relaxed clusters with cool compact cores observedby chandra and xmm. the simulations sample the most interesting, theoreticallyplausible, range of impact parameters and progenitor mass ratios. we find thatall mergers evolve via a common progression. we illustrate this progression inthe projected gas density, x-ray surface brightness, sz, temperature, and gasentropy maps. several different classes of transient ``cold front''-likefeatures can arise over the course of a merger. we find that all of theseclasses are present in chandra and xmm observations of merging systems andpropose a naming scheme for these features: ``comet-like'' tails, bridges,plumes, streams and edges. in none of the cases considered do the initial coolcompact cores of the primary and the secondary get destroyed during the courseof the mergers. we quantify the evolving morphology of our mergers usingcentroid variance, power ratios and offset between the x-ray and the projectedmass maps. we find that the centroid variance best captures the dynamical stateof the cluster. placing the system at z=0.1, we find that all easily identifiedobservable traces of the secondary disappear from a simulated 50 ks chandraimage following the second pericentric passage. the system, however, takesapproximately 2 additional gyrs to relax and virialize. temperaturefluctuations at the level of 20% can persist in the final systems well past thepoint of virialization, suggesting that that the existence of temperaturefluctuations, in and of themselves, do not necessarily indicate a disturbed orunrelaxed system.

astro-ph;0609314	revisiting the baryon fractions of galaxy clusters: a comparison with  wmap 3-year results	the universal baryonic mass fraction (omega_b/omega_m) can be sensitivelyconstrained using x-ray observations of galaxy clusters. in this paper, wecompare the baryonic mass fraction inferred from measurements of the cosmicmicrowave background with the gas mass fractions (f_gas) of a large sample ofclusters taken from the recent literature. in systems cooler than 4 kev, f_gasdeclines as the system temperature decreases. however, in higher temperaturesystems, f_gas(r500) converges to approx. (0.12 +/- 0.02)(h/0.72)^{-1.5}, wherethe uncertainty reflects the systematic variations between clusters at r500.this is significantly lower than the maximum-likelihood value of the baryonfraction from the recently released wmap 3-year results. we investigatepossible reasons for this discrepancy, including the effects of radiativecooling and non-gravitational heating, and conclude that the most likelysolution is that omega_m is higher than the best-fit wmap value (we findomega_m = 0.36^{+0.11}_{-0.08}), but consistent at the 2-sigma level.degeneracies within the wmap data require that sigma_8 must also be greaterthan the maximum likelihood value for consistency between the data sets.

astro-ph;0610602	the baryon fraction of lambdacdm haloes	we investigate the baryon fraction in dark matter haloes formed innon-radiative gas-dynamical simulations of the lambdacdm cosmogony. bycombining a realisation of the millennium simulation (springel et al.) with asimulation of a smaller volume focussing on dwarf haloes, our study spans fivedecades in halo mass, from 10^10 msun/h to 10^15 msun/h. we find that thebaryon fraction within the halo virial radius is typically 90% of the cosmicmean, with an rms scatter of 6%, independently of redshift and of halo massdown to the smallest resolved haloes. our results show that, contrary to theproposal of mo et al. (2005), pre-virialisation gravitational heating is unableto prevent the collapse of gas within galactic and proto-galactic haloes, andconfirm the need for non-gravitational feedback in order to reduce theefficiency of gas cooling and star formation in dwarf galaxy haloes.simulations including a simple photoheating model (where a gas temperaturefloor of t_{floor} = 2x10^4 k is imposed from z=11) confirm earlier suggestionsthat photoheating can only prevent the collapse of baryons in systems withvirial temperatures t_{200} &lt; ~2.2 t_{floor} ~ 4.4x10^4 k (corresponding to avirial mass of m_{200} ~ 10^10 msun/h and a circular velocity of v_{200} ~ 35km/s). photoheating may thus help regulate the formation of dwarf spheroidalsand other galaxies at the extreme faint-end of the luminosity function, but itcannot, on its own, reconcile the abundance of sub-l* galaxies with the vastnumber of dwarf haloes expected in the lambdacdm cosmogony. the lack ofevolution or mass dependence seen in the baryon fraction augurs well for x-raycluster studies that assume a universal and non-evolving baryon fraction toplace constraints on cosmological parameters.

astro-ph;0701335	modelling shock heating in cluster mergers: i. moving beyond the  spherical accretion model	(abridged) the thermal history of the intracluster medium (icm) is complex.heat input from cluster mergers, agn, and galaxy winds offsets and may evenhalt the cooling of the icm. consequently, the processes that set theproperties of the icm play a key role in determining how galaxies form. in thispaper we focus on the shock heating of the icm during cluster mergers, with theeventual aim of incorporating this mechanism into semi-analytic models ofgalaxy formation.  we use a suite of hydrodynamic simulations to track the evolution of the icmin idealised two-body mergers. we find the heating of the icm can be understoodrelatively simply by considering the evolution of the gas entropy during themergers. we examine the processes that generate the entropy in order tounderstand why previous analytic shock heating models failed. we find that: (1)the energy that is thermalised in the collision greatly exceeds the kineticenergy available when the systems first touch. the smaller system penetratesdeep into the potential well before it is disrupted. (2) for unequal massmergers, most of the energy is thermalised in the more massive component. theheating of the smaller system is minor and its gas sinks to the centre of thefinal system. (3) the bulk of the entropy generation occurs in two distinctepisodes. the first episode occurs following core collision, when a shock waveis generated that propagates outwards from the centre. this causes the combinedsystem to expand rapidly and overshoot hydrostatic equilibrium. the secondepisode occurs as this material is shock heated as it re-collapses. thisrevised model for entropy generation significantly improves our physicalunderstanding of cosmological gas simulations.

astro-ph;0701586	the impact of mergers on relaxed x-ray clusters - ii. effects on global  x-ray and sz properties and their scaling relations	we use the suite of simulations presented in poole et al (2006) to examineglobal x-ray and sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) observables for systems of mergingrelaxed x-ray clusters. in all of the scaling relations generated from theproperties we have studied, we observe a generic evolution (in good qualitativeagreement with previous authors): a rapid transient roughly along the massscaling relations, a subsequent slow drift across the scatter untilvirialization, followed by a slow evolution along and up the mass scalingrelations as cooling recovers in the cluster cores. however, this drift is notsufficient to account for the observed scatter in the scaling relations. wealso study the effects of mergers on several theoretical temperature measuresof the intracluster medium: emission weighted measures (t_ew), thespectroscopic-like measure proposed by mazzotta et al (2004; t_sl) and plasmamodel fits to the integrated spectrum of the system (t_spec). we find that t_sltracks t_spec for the entire duration of our mergers, illustrating that itremains a good tool for observational comparison even for highly disturbedsystems. furthermore, the transient temperature increases produced during firstand second pericentric passage are 15-40% larger for t_ew than for t_sl ort_spec. this suggests that the effects of transient temperature increases onsigma_8 and omega_m derived by randall et al (2002) are over estimated. lastly,we examine the x-ray sz proxy proposed by kravtsov et al (2006) and find thatthe tight mass scaling relation they predict remains secure through the entireduration of a merger event, independent of projection effects.

astro-ph;0702727	the sunyaev-zeldovich background	the cosmic background due to the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) effect is expected tobe the largest signal at mm and cm wavelengths at a resolution of a fewarcminutes. we investigate some simple statistics of sz maps and their scalingwith the normalization of the matter power spectrum, sigma_8, as well as theeffects of the unknown physics of the intracluster medium on these statistics.we show that the sz background provides a significant background for sz clustersearches, with the onset of confusion occurring around 10^{14} h^{-1} solarmasses in a cosmology-dependent way, where confusion is defined as typicalerrors in recovered flux larger than 20%. the confusion limit, corresponds tothe mass at which there are roughly ten clusters per square degree, with thisnumber nearly independent of cosmology and cluster gas physics. typical errorsgrow quickly as lower mass objects are included in the catalog.  we also point out that there is nothing in particular about the rms of thefiltered map that makes it especially well-suited for capturing aspects of thesz effect, and other indicators of the one-point sz probability distributionfunction are at least as well suited for the task. for example, the full widthat half maximum of the one point probability distribution has a field-to-fieldscatter that is about 60% that of the rms.  the simplest statistics of sz maps are largely unaffected by cluster physicssuch aspreheating, although the impact of preheating is clear by eye in themaps.studies aimed at learning about the physics of the intracluster mediumwill apparently require more specialized statistical indicators.
