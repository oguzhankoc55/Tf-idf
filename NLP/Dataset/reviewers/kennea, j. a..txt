0902.1988	swift and supergiant fast x-ray transients: a novel monitoring approach	we describe our monitoring strategy which best exploits the sensitivity andflexibility of swift to study the long-term behaviour of supergiant fast x-raytransients (sfxts). we present observations of the recent outbursts from twoobjects of this class. igr j16479-4514, underwent an outburst on 2008 march 19,reaching a peak luminosity of about 6e37 erg/s (0.5-100kev; at a distance of4.9 kpc). we obtained a simultaneous broad-band spectrum (0.3-100 kev), thefirst for the sfxt class, which is fit with a heavily absorbed (column density5e22 cm^-2) hard power-law with a high energy cut-off at about 7kev. thisspectrum shows properties similar to the ones of accreting pulsars, although nox-ray pulsations were found. igr j11215-5952, one of the only two periodic sfxtknown to date, was observed with swift several times, first with an intense23-day long monitoring campaign around the 2007 february 9 outburst; then witha 26-day long monitoring around the unexpected july 24 outburst; finally with adeep exposure during the 2008 june 16 outburst. we present the whole dataset,which also includes observations which allowed us to firmly establish theoutburst period at p~165 days. thanks to our combined observations commoncharacteristics to this class of objects are emerging, i.e., outburst lengthswell in excess of hours, often with a multiple peaked structure, dynamic range~3 orders of magnitude, and periodicities are starting to be found.

0905.2815	supergiant fast x-ray transients in outburst: new swift observations of  xtej1739-302, igrj17544-2619, and igrj08408-4503	we report on new x-ray outbursts observed with swift from three supergiantfast x-ray transients (sfxts): xtej1739-302, igrj17544-2619 and igrj08408-4503.the former two outbursts were caught during the monitoring campaign we havebeen performing with the swift satellite since october 2007: xtej1739-302underwent a new outburst on 2008, august 13, igrj17544-2619 on 2008, september4, while igrj08408-4503 on 2008, september 21. while xtej1739-302 andigrj08408-4503 bright emission triggered the swift/burst alert telescope,igrj17544-2619 did not, thus we could perform a spectral investigation only ofthe spectrum below 10 kev. the broad band spectra from xtej1739-302 andigrj08408-4503 were compatible with the x-ray spectral shape displayed duringthe previous flares. a variable absorbing column density during the flare wasobserved in xtej1739-302 for the first time. the broad band spectrum ofigrj08408-4503 requires the presence of two distinct photon populations, a coldone (0.3 kev) most likely from a thermal halo around the neutron star and ahotter one (1.4-1.8 kev) from the accreting column. the outburst fromxtej1739-302 could be monitored with a very good sampling, thus revealing ashape which can be explained with a second wind component in this sfxt, inanalogy to what we have suggested in the periodic sfxt igrj11215-5952. theoutburst recurrence timescale in igrj17544-2619 during our monitoring campaignwith swift suggests a long orbital period of ~150 days (in an highly eccentricorbit), compatible with what previously observed with integral.

0907.0764	swift observations of hard x-ray emitting white dwarfs in symbiotic  stars	the x-ray emission from most accreting white dwarfs (wds) in symbiotic binarystars is quite soft. several symbiotic wds, however, produce strong x-rayemission at energies greater than ~20 kev. the swift bat instrument hasdetected hard x-ray emission from 4 such accreting wds in symbiotic stars: rtcru, t crb, cd -57 3057, and ch cyg. in one case (rt cru), swift detectedx-rays out to greater than 50 kev at a &gt; 5 sigma confidence level. combiningdata from the xrt and bat detectors, we find that the 0.3-150 kev spectra of rtcru, t crb, and cd -57 3057 are well described by emission from asingle-temperature, optically thin thermal plasma, plus an unresolved 6.4-6.9kev fe line complex. the x-ray spectrum of ch cyg contains an additional brightsoft component. for all 4 systems, the spectra suffer high levels of absorptionfrom material that both fully and partially covers the source of hard x-rays.the xrt data did not show any of the rapid, periodic variations that one wouldexpect if the x-ray emission were due to accretion onto a rotating, highlymagnetized wd. the x-rays were thus more likely from the accretion-diskboundary layer around a massive, non-magnetic wd in each binary. the x-rayemission from rt cru varied on timescales of a few days. this variability isconsistent with being due to changes in the absorber that partially covers thesource, suggesting localized absorption from a clumpy medium moving into theline of sight. the x-ray emission from cd -57 3057 and t crb also varied duringthe 9 months of swift observations, in a manner that was also consistent withvariable absorption.

0907.1289	monitoring supergiant fast x-ray transients with swift. results from the  first year	swift has allowed the possibility to give supergiant fast x-ray transients(sfxts), the new class of high mass x-ray binaries discovered by integral, nonserendipitous attention throughout all phases of their life. we present ourresults based on the first year of intense swift monitoring of four sfxts, igrj16479-4514, xte j1739-302, igr j17544-2619 and ax j1841.0-0536. we obtain thefirst assessment of how long each source spends in each state using asystematic monitoring with a sensitive instrument. the duty-cycle of inactivityis 17, 28, 39, 55% (5% uncertainty), for igr j16479-4514, ax j1841.0-0536, xtej1739-302, and igr j17544-2619, respectively, so that true quiescence is a rarestate. this demonstrates that these transients accrete matter throughout theirlife at different rates. ax j1841.0-0536 is the only source which has notundergone a bright outburst during our campaign. although individual sourcesbehave somewhat differently, common x-ray characteristics of this class areemerging such as outburst lengths well in excess of hours, with a multiplepeaked structure. a high dynamic range (including bright outbursts) of 4 ordersof magnitude has been observed. we performed out-of-outburst intensity-basedspectroscopy. spectral fits with an absorbed blackbody always result inblackbody radii of a few hundred meters, consistent with being emitted from asmall portion of the neutron star surface, very likely the neutron star polarcaps. we also present the uvot data of these sources.

0907.4041	the first broad-band x-ray study of the supergiant fast x-ray transient  saxj1818.6-1703 in outburst	the supergiant fast x-ray transient (sfxt) saxj1818.6-1703 underwent anoutburst on 2009 may 6 and was observed with swift. we report on theseobservations which, for the first time, allow us to study the broad-bandspectrum from soft to hard x-rays of this source. no x-ray spectral informationwas available on this source before the swift monitoring. the spectrum can bedeconvolved well with models usually adopted to describe the emission from highmass x-ray binary x-ray pulsars, and is characterized by a very highabsorption, a flat power law (photon index ~0.1-0.5) and a cutoff at about 7-12kev. alternatively, the saxj1818.6-1703 emission can be described with acomptonized emission from a cold and optically thick corona, with an electrontemperature kte=5-7 kev, a hot seed photon temperature, kt0, of 1.3-1.4 kev,and an optical depth for the comptonizing plasma of about 10. the 1-100 kevluminosity at the peak of the flare is 3e36 erg/s (assuming the opticalcounterpart distance of 2.5 kpc). these properties of saxj1818.6-1703 resemblethose of the prototype of the sfxt class, xtej1739-302. the monitoring withswift/xrt reveals an outburst duration of about 5 days, similarly to othermembers of the class of sfxts, confirming saxj1818.6-1703 as a member of thisclass.

0907.4578	multi-wavelength observations of the energetic grb 080810: detailed  mapping of the broadband spectral evolution	grb 080810 was one of the first bursts to trigger both swift and the fermigamma-ray space telescope. it was subsequently monitored over the x-ray anduv/optical bands by swift, in the optical by rotse and a host of othertelescopes and was detected in the radio by the vla. the redshift of z= 3.355+/- 0.005 was determined by keck/hires and confirmed by rtt150 and not. theprompt gamma/x-ray emission, detected over 0.3-10^3 kev, systematically softensover time, with e_peak moving from ~600 kev at the start to ~40 kev around 100s after the trigger; alternatively, this spectral evolution could be identifiedwith the blackbody temperature of a quasithermal model shifting from ~60 kev to~3 kev over the same time interval. the first optical detection was made at 38s, but the smooth, featureless profile of the full optical coverage impliesthat this originated from the afterglow component, not the pulsed/flaringprompt emission.  broadband optical and x-ray coverage of the afterglow at the start of thefinal x-ray decay (~8 ks) reveals a spectral break between the optical andx-ray bands in the range 10^15 - 2x10^16 hz. the decay profiles of the x-rayand optical bands show that this break initially migrates blueward to thisfrequency and then subsequently drifts redward to below the optical band by~3x10^5 s. grb 080810 was very energetic, with an isotropic energy output forthe prompt component of 3x10^53 erg and 1.6x10^52 erg for the afterglow; thereis no evidence for a jet break in the afterglow up to six days following theburst.

0909.5109	swift/xrt monitoring of the supergiant fast x-ray transient igr  j18483-0311 for an entire orbital period	igr j18483-0311 is an x-ray pulsar with transient x-ray activity, belongingto the new class of high mass x-ray binaries called supergiant fast x-raytransients. this system is one of the two members of this class, together withigr j11215-5952, where both the orbital (18.52d) and spin period (21s) areknown. we report on the first complete monitoring of the x-ray activity alongan entire orbital period of a supergiant fast x-ray transient. these swiftobservations, lasting 28d, cover more than one entire orbital phaseconsecutively. they are a unique data-set, which allows us to constrain thedifferent mechanisms proposed to explain the nature of this new class of x-raytransients. we applied the new clumpy wind model for blue supergiants developedby ducci et al. (2009), to the observed x-ray light curve. assuming aneccentricity of e=0.4, the x-ray emission from this source can be explained interms of the accretion from a spherically symmetric clumpy wind, composed ofclumps with different masses, ranging from 10^{18}g to 5x 10^{21}g.

0912.0127	swift monitoring of the new accreting millisecond x-ray pulsar  igrj17511-3057 in outburst	a new accreting millisecond x-ray pulsar, igr j17511-3057, was discovered inoutburst on 2009 september 12 during the integral galactic bulge monitoringprogramme. to study the evolution of the source x-ray flux and spectralproperties during the outburst, we requested a swift monitoring ofigrj17511-3057. in this paper we report on the results of the first two weeksof monitoring the source. the persistent emission of igr j17511-3057 during theoutburst is modeled well with an absorbed blackbody (kt~0.9 kev) and apower-law component (photon index~1-2), similar to what has been observed fromother previously known millisecond pulsars. swift also detected three type-ixray bursts from this source. by assuming that the peak luminosity of thesebursts is equal to the eddington value for a pure helium type-i x-ray burst, wederived an upper limit to the source distance of ~10 kpc. the theoretical,expected recurrence time of the bursts according to the helium burst hypothesisis 0.2-0.9 days, in agreement with the observations.

1004.5099	grb 090926a and bright late-time fermi lat grb afterglows	grb 090926a was detected by both the gbm and lat instruments on-board thefermi gamma-ray space telescope. swift follow-up observations began ~13 hoursafter the initial trigger. the optical afterglow was detected for nearly 23days post trigger, placing it in the long lived category. the afterglow is ofparticular interest due to its brightness at late times, as well as thepresence of optical flares at t0+10^5 s and later, which may indicate late-timecentral engine activity. the lat has detected a total of 16 grbs; 9 of thesebursts, including grb 090926a, also have been observed by swift. of the 9 swiftobserved lat bursts, 6 were detected by uvot, with 5 of the bursts havingbright, long-lived optical afterglows. in comparison, swift has been operatingfor 5 years and has detected nearly 500 bursts, but has only seen ~30% ofbursts with optical afterglows that live longer than 10^5 s. we have calculatedthe predicted gamma-ray fluence, as would have been seen by the bat on-boardswift, of the lat bursts to determine whether this high percentage oflong-lived optical afterglows is unique, when compared to bat-triggered bursts.we find that, with the exception of the short burst grb 090510a, the predictedbat fluences indicate the lat bursts are more energetic than 88% of all swiftbursts, and also have brighter than average x-ray and optical afterglows.

1009.1146	two years of monitoring supergiant fast x-ray transients with swift	we present two years of intense swift monitoring of three sfxts, igrj16479-4514, xte j1739-302, and igr j17544-2619 (since october 2007).out-of-outburst intensity-based x-ray (0.3-10kev) spectroscopy yields absorbedpower laws with by hard photon indices (g~1-2). their outburst broad-band(0.3-150 kev) spectra can be fit well with models typically used to describethe x-ray emission from accreting nss in hmxbs. we assess how long each sourcespends in each state using a systematic monitoring with a sensitive instrument.these sources spend 3-5% of the total in bright outbursts. the most probableflux is 1-2e-11 erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} (2-10 kev, unabsorbed), corresponding toluminosities in the order of a few 10^{33} to 10^{34} erg s^{-1} (two orders ofmagnitude lower than the bright outbursts). the duty-cycle of inactivity is 19,39, 55%, for igr j16479-4514, xte j1739-302, and igr j17544-2619, respectively.we present a complete list of bat on-board detections further confirming thecontinued activity of these sources. this demonstrates that true quiescence isa rare state, and that these transients accrete matter throughout their life atdifferent rates. x-ray variability is observed at all timescales andintensities we can probe. superimposed on the day-to-day variability isintra-day flaring which involves variations up to one order of magnitude thatcan occur down to timescales as short as ~1ks, and whichcan be explained by theaccretion of single clumps composing the donor wind with massesm_cl~0.3-2x10^{19} g.

1012.0028	confirmation of the supergiant fast x-ray transient nature of ax  j1841.0-0536 from swift outburst observations	swift observed an outburst from the supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxt)ax j1841.0-0536 on 2010 june 5, and followed it with xrt for 11 days. the x-raylight curve shows an initial flare followed by a decay and subsequent increase,as often seen in other sfxts, and a dynamical range of ~1600. our observationsallow us to analyse the simultaneous broad-band (0.3-100 kev) spectrum of thissource, for the first time down to 0.3 kev, can be fitted well with modelsusually adopted to describe the emission from accreting neutron stars inhigh-mass x-ray binaries, and is characterized by a high absorption(n_h~2x10^22 cm-2), a flat power law (gamma~0.2), and a high energy cutoff. allof these properties resemble those of the prototype of the class, igrj17544-2619, which underwent an outburst on 2010 march 4, whose observations wealso discuss. we show how well ax j1841.0-0536 fits in the sfxt class, based onits observed properties during the 2010 outburst, its large dynamical range inx-ray luminosity, the similarity of the light curve (length and shape) to thoseof the other sfxts observed by swift, and the x-ray broad-band spectralproperties.

1101.6055	swift follow-up observations of maxi discovered galactic transients	we describe the results of the first year of a program to localize newgalactic transient sources discovered by maxi with nasa's swift mission. swiftis ideally suited for follow-up of maxi discovered transients as its x-raytelescope (xrt) field of view (~0.2 degrees radius) is closely matched to thetypical maxi error circle. the xrt is capable of localizing new sources to anaccuracy of up to 1.5 arc-seconds radius (90% confidence), and the swiftoptical/uv telescope also provides optical imaging of any optical counterpartof the x-ray source. if no optical counterpart is found with swift (usually dueto absorption), the xrt position is good enough to allow for ground based irtelescopes to positively identify the optical counterpart. althoughlocalization and identification of maxi transients is the main aim of theprogram, these are often followed up by long term monitoring of the source. wepresent here results from 2 of these monitoring programs: the black-holecandidate maxi j1659-152, and the be/x-ray binary candidate maxi j1409-619.

1104.4787	discovery of the onset of rapid accretion by a dormant massive black  hole	massive black holes are believed to reside at the centres of most galaxies.they can be- come detectable by accretion of matter, either continuously from alarge gas reservoir or impulsively from the tidal disruption of a passing star,and conversion of the gravitational energy of the infalling matter to light.continuous accretion drives active galactic nuclei (agn), which are known to bevariable but have never been observed to turn on or off. tidal disruption ofstars by dormant massive black holes has been inferred indirectly but the on-set of a tidal disruption event has never been observed. here we report thefirst discovery of the onset of a relativistic accretion-powered jet in the newextragalactic transient, swift j164449.3+573451. the behaviour of this newsource differs from both theoretical models of tidal disruption events andobservations of the jet-dominated agn known as blazars. these differences maystem from transient effects associated with the onset of a powerful jet. suchan event in the massive black hole at the centre of our milky way galaxy couldstrongly ionize the upper atmosphere of the earth, if beamed towards us.

1108.5049	recovering swift-xrt energy resolution through ccd charge trap mapping	the x-ray telescope on board the swift satellite for gamma-ray burstastronomy has been exposed to the radiation of the space environment sincelaunch in november 2004. radiation causes damage to the detector, with thegeneration of dark current and charge trapping sites that result in thedegradation of the spectral resolution and an increase of the instrumentalbackground. the swift team has a dedicated calibration program with the goal ofrecovering a significant proportion of the lost spectroscopic performance.calibration observations of supernova remnants with strong emission lines areanalysed to map the detector charge traps and to derive position-dependentcorrections to the measured photon energies. we have achieved a substantialrecovery in the xrt resolution by implementing these corrections in an updatedversion of the swift xrt gain file and in corresponding improvements to theswift xrt heasoft software. we provide illustrations of the impact of theenhanced energy resolution, and show that we have recovered most of thespectral resolution lost since launch.

1204.5840	maxi j1659-152: the shortest orbital period black-hole transient in  outburst	maxi j1659-152 is a bright x-ray transient black-hole candidate binary systemdiscovered in september 2010. we report here on maxi, rxte, swift, andxmm-newton observations during its 2010/2011 outburst. we find that during thefirst one and a half week of the outburst the x-ray light curves display dropsin intensity at regular intervals, which we interpret as absorption dips. aboutthree weeks into the outbursts, again drops in intensity are seen. these dipshave, however, a spectral behaviour opposite to that of the absorption dips,and are related to fast spectral state changes (hence referred to as transitiondips). the absorption dips recur with a period of 2.414+/-0.005 hrs, which weinterpret as the orbital period of the system. this implies that maxi j1659-152is the shortest period black-hole candidate binary known to date. theinclination of the accretion disk with respect to the line of sight isestimated to be 65-80 degrees. we propose the companion to the black-holecandidate to be close to an m5 dwarf star, with a mass and radius of about0.15-0.25 m_sun and 0.2-0.25 r_sun, respectively. we derive that the companionhad an initial mass of about 1.5 m_sun, which evolved to its current mass inabout 5-6 billion years. the system is rather compact (orbital separation oflarger than ~1.33 r_sun), and is located at a distance of 8.6+/-3.7 kpc, with aheight above the galactic plane of 2.4+/-1.0 kpc. the characteristics of shortorbital period and high galactic scale height are shared with two othertransient black-hole candidate x-ray binaries, i.e., xte j1118+480 and swiftj1735.5-0127. we suggest that all three are kicked out of the galactic planeinto the halo, rather than being formed in a globular cluster.

1205.1124	swift follow-up observations of candidate gravitational-wave transient  events	we present the first multi-wavelength follow-up observations of two candidategravitational-wave (gw) transient events recorded by ligo and virgo in their2009-2010 science run. the events were selected with low latency by the networkof gw detectors and their candidate sky locations were observed by the swiftobservatory. image transient detection was used to analyze the collectedelectromagnetic data, which were found to be consistent with background.off-line analysis of the gw data alone has also established that the selectedgw events show no evidence of an astrophysical origin; one of them isconsistent with background and the other one was a test, part of a "blindinjection challenge". with this work we demonstrate the feasibility of rapidfollow-ups of gw transients and establish the sensitivity improvement jointelectromagnetic and gw observations could bring. this is a first step toward anelectromagnetic follow-up program in the regime of routine detections with theadvanced gw instruments expected within this decade. in that regimemulti-wavelength observations will play a significant role in completing theastrophysical identification of gw sources. we present the methods and resultsfrom this first combined analysis and discuss its implications in terms ofsensitivity for the present and future instruments.

1205.7059	swift observations of two supergiant fast x-ray transient prototypes in  outburst	we report on the results from observations of the most recent outbursts ofxte j1739-302 and igr j17544-2619, which are considered to be the prototypes ofthe supergiant fast x-ray transient (sfxt) class. they triggered the swift/baton 2011 february 22 and march 24, respectively, and each time a prompt swiftslew allowed us to obtain the rich broad-band data we present. the xrt lightcurves show the descending portion of very bright flares that reachedluminosities of ~2x10^{36} and ~5x10^{36} erg/s, respectively. the broad-bandspectra, when fit with the usual phenomenological models adopted for accretingneutron stars, yield values of both high energy cut-off and e-folding energyconsistent with those obtained from previously reported outbursts from thesesources. in the context of more physical models, the spectra of both sourcescan be well fitted either with a two-blackbody model, or with a singleunsaturated comptonization model. in the latter case, the model can be either aclassical static comptonization model, such as comptt, or the recentlydeveloped compmag model, which includes thermal and bulk comptonization forcylindrical accretion onto a magnetized neutron star. we discuss the possibleaccretion scenarios derived by the different models, and we also emphasize thefact that the electron density derived from the comptonization models, in theregions where the x-ray spectrum presumably forms, is lower than that estimatedusing the continuity equation at the magnetospheric radius and the source x-rayluminosity, and we give some possible explanations.

0704.3682	igr j16194-2810: a new symbiotic x-ray binary	we here report on the multiwavelength study which led us to theidentification of x-ray source igr j16194-2810 as a new symbiotic x-ray binary(syxb), that is, a rare type of low mass x-ray binary (lmxb) composed of am-type giant and a compact object. using the accurate x-ray position allowed byswift/xrt data, we pinpointed the optical counterpart, a m2 iii star. besides,the combined use of the spectral information afforded by xrt and integral/ibisshows that the 0.5-200 kev spectrum of this source can be described with anabsorbed comptonization model, usually found in lmxbs and, in particular, insyxbs. no long-term (days to months) periodicities are detected in the ibisdata. the time coverage afforded by xrt reveals shot-noise variability typicalof accreting galactic x-ray sources, but is not good enough to explore thepresence of x-ray short-term (seconds to hours) oscillations in detail. byusing the above information, we infer important parameters for this source suchas its distance (about 3.7 kpc) and x-ray luminosity (about 1.4e35 erg/s in the0.5-200 kev band), and we give a description for this system (typical of syxbs)in which a compact object (possibly a neutron star) accretes from the wind ofits m-type giant companion. we also draw some comparisons between igrj16194-2810 and other sources belonging to this subclass, finding that thisobject resembles syxbs 4u 1700+24 and 4u 1954+31.

0711.3753	swift captures the spectrally evolving prompt emission of grb 070616	the origins of gamma-ray burst prompt emission are currently not wellunderstood and in this context long, well-observed events are particularlyimportant to study. we present the case of grb 070616, analysing theexceptionally long-duration multipeaked prompt emission, and later afterglow,captured by all the instruments on-board swift and by suzaku wam. the highenergy light curve remained generally flat for several hundred seconds beforegoing into a steep decline. spectral evolution from hard to soft is clearlytaking place throughout the prompt emission, beginning at 285 s after thetrigger and extending to 1200 s. we track the movement of the spectral peakenergy, whilst observing a softening of the low energy spectral slope. thesteep decline in flux may be caused by a combination of this strong spectralevolution and the curvature effect. we investigate origins for the spectralevolution, ruling out a superposition of two power laws and considering insteadan additional component dominant during the late prompt emission. we alsodiscuss origins for the early optical emission and the physics of theafterglow. the case of grb 070616 clearly demonstrates that both broadbandcoverage and good time resolution are crucial to pin down the origins of thecomplex prompt emission in grbs.

1210.4652	timing accuracy of the swift x-ray telescope in wt mode	the x-ray telescope (xrt) on board swift was mainly designed to providedetailed position, timing and spectroscopic information on gamma-ray burst(grb) afterglows. during the mission lifetime the fraction of observing timeallocated to other types of source has been steadily increased. in this paper,we report on the results of the in-flight calibration of the timingcapabilities of the xrt in windowed timing read-out mode. we use observationsof the crab pulsar to evaluate the accuracy of the pulse period determinationby comparing the values obtained by the xrt timing analysis with the valuesderived from radio monitoring. we also check the absolute time reconstructionmeasuring the phase position of the main peak in the crab profile and comparingit both with the value reported in literature and with the result that weobtain from a simultaneous rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte) observation. wefind that the accuracy in period determination for the crab pulsar is of theorder of a few picoseconds for the observation with the largest data time span.the absolute time reconstruction, measured using the position of the crab mainpeak, shows that the main peak anticipates the phase of the position reportedin literature for rxte by ~270 microseconds on average (~150 microseconds whendata are reduced with the attitude file corrected with the uvot data). theanalysis of the simultaneous swift-xrt and rxte proportional counter array(pca) observations confirms that the xrt crab profile leads the pca profile by~200 microseconds. the analysis of xrt photodiode mode data and bat event datashows a main peak position in good agreement with the rxte, suggesting thediscrepancy observed in xrt data in windowed timing mode is likely due to asystematic offset in the time assignment for this xrt read out mode.

0712.2885	bat x-ray survey - i: methodology and x-ray identification	we applied the maximum likelihood method, as an image reconstructionalgorithm, to the bat x-ray survey (bxs). this method was specifically designedto preserve the full statistical information in the data and to avoidmosaicking of many exposures with different pointing directions, thus reducingsystematic errors when co-adding images. we reconstructed, in the 14-170 kevenergy band, the image of a 90x90 deg$^2$ sky region, centered on(ra,dec)=105$^{\circ}$,-25$^{\circ}$, which bat surveyed with an exposure timeof $\sim1$ ms (in nov. 2005). the best sensitivity in our image is $\sim0.85$mcrab or $2.0\times 10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$. we detect 49 hard x-ray sourcesabove the 4.5 $\sigma$ level; of these, only 12 were previously known as hardx-ray sources ($&gt;$15 kev). swift/xrt observations allowed us to firmly identifythe counterparts for 15 objects, while 2 objects have einstein ipc counterparts\citep{harris90}; in addition to those, we found a likely counterpart for 13objects by correlating our sample with the rosat all-sky survey bright sourcecatalog \citep{voges99}. 7 objects remain unidentified. analysis of the noiseproperties of our image shows that $\sim75$% of the area is surveyed to a fluxlimit of $\sim$1 mcrab. this study shows that the coupling of the maximumlikelihood method to the most sensitive, all-sky surveying, hard x-rayinstrument, bat, is able to probe for the first time the hard x-ray sky to themcrab flux level. the successful application of this method to bat demonstratesthat it could also be applied with advantage to similar instruments likeintegral-ibis.

1305.2128	swift discovery of a new soft gamma repeater, sgr j1745-29, near  sagittarius a*	starting in 2013 february, swift has been performing short daily monitoringobservations of the g2 gas cloud near sgr a* with the x-ray telescope todetermine whether the cloud interaction leads to an increase in the flux fromthe galactic center. on 2013 april 24 swift detected an order of magnitude risein the x-ray flux from the region near sgr a*. initially thought to be a flarefrom sgr a*, detection of a short hard x-ray burst from the same region by theburst alert telescope suggested that the flare was from an unresolved new softgamma repeater, sgr j1745-29. here we present the discovery of sgr j1745-29 byswift, including analysis of data before, during, and after the burst. we findthat the spectrum in the 0.3-10 kev range is well fit by an absorbed blackbodymodel with ktbb ~ 1 kev and absorption consistent with previously measuredvalues from the quiescent emission from sgr a*, strongly suggesting that thissource is at a similar distance. only one sgr burst has been detected so farfrom the new source, and the persistent light curve shows little evidence ofdecay in approximately 2 weeks of monitoring after outburst. we discuss thislight curve trend and compare it with those of other well covered sgroutbursts. we suggest that sgr j1745-29 belongs to an emerging subclass ofmagnetars characterized by low burst rates and prolonged steady x-ray emission1-2 weeks after outburst onset.

1305.6894	an anti-glitch in a magnetar	magnetars are neutron stars showing dramatic x-ray and soft $\gamma$-rayoutbursting behaviour that is thought to be powered by intense internalmagnetic fields. like conventional young neutron stars in the form of radiopulsars, magnetars exhibit "glitches" during which angular momentum is believedto be transferred between the solid outer crust and the superfluid component ofthe inner crust. hitherto, the several hundred observed glitches in radiopulsars and magnetars have involved a sudden spin-up of the star, duepresumably to the interior superfluid rotating faster than the crust. here wereport on x-ray timing observations of the magnetar 1e 2259+586 which we showexhibited a clear "anti-glitch" -- a sudden spin down. we show that this event,like some previous magnetar spin-up glitches, was accompanied by multiple x-rayradiative changes and a significant spin-down rate change. this event, if oforigin internal to the star, is unpredicted in models of neutron star spin-downand is suggestive of differential rotation in the neutron star, furthersupporting the need for a rethinking of glitch theory for all neutron stars.

1403.4079	grb 130925a: an ultra-long gamma ray burst with a dust-echo afterglow,  and implications for the origin of the ultra-long grbs	grb 130925a was an unusual grb, consisting of 3 distinct episodes ofhigh-energy emission spanning $\sim$20 ks, making it a member of the proposedcategory of `ultra-long' bursts. it was also unusual in that its late-timex-ray emission observed by swift was very soft, and showed a stronghard-to-soft spectral evolution with time. this evolution, rarely seen in grbafterglows, can be well modelled as the dust-scattered echo of the promptemission, with stringent limits on the contribution from the normal afterglow(i.e. external shock) emission. we consider and reject the possibility that grb130925a was some form of tidal disruption event, and instead show that if thecircumburst density around grb 130925a is low, the long duration of the burstand faint external shock emission are naturally explained. indeed, we suggestthat the ultra-long grbs as a class can be explained as those with lowcircumburst densities, such that the deceleration time (at which point thematerial ejected from the nascent black hole is decelerated by the circumburstmedium) is $\sim$20 ks, as opposed to a few hundred seconds for the normal longgrbs. the increased deceleration radius means that more of the ejected shellscan interact before reaching the external shock, naturally explaining both theincreased duration of grb 130925a, the duration of its prompt pulses, and thefainter-than-normal afterglow.

1410.4841	high-resolution x-ray spectroscopy of the bursting pulsar gro j1744-28	the bursting pulsar gro j1744-28 is a galactic low-mass x-ray binary thatdistinguishes itself by displaying type-ii x-ray bursts: brief, bright flashesof x-ray emission that likely arise from spasmodic accretion. combined with itscoherent 2.1 hz x-ray pulsations and relatively high estimated magnetic field,it is a particularly interesting source to study the physics of accretion flowsaround neutron stars. here we report on chandra/hetg observations obtained nearthe peak of its bright 2014 accretion outburst. spectral analysis suggests thepresence of a broad iron emission line centered at e_l ~ 6.7 kev. fits with adisk reflection model yield an inclination angle of i ~ 52 degrees and an innerdisk radius of r_in ~ 85 gm/c^2, which is much further out than typically foundfor neutron star low-mass x-ray binaries. assuming that the disk is truncatedat the magnetospheric radius of the neutron star, we estimate a magnetic fieldstrength of b ~ (2-6)e10 g. furthermore, we identify an absorption feature near~6.85 kev could correspond to blue-shifted fe xxv and point to a fast disk windwith an outflow velocity of v_out ~ (7.5-8.2)e3 km/s (~0.025c-0.027c). if thecovering fraction and filling factor are large, this wind could beenergetically important and perhaps account for the fact that the companionstar lost significant mass while the magnetic field of the neutron starremained strong.

1502.04717	giant outburst from the supergiant fast x-ray transient igr j17544-2619:  accretion from a transient disc?	supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxts) are high mass x-ray binariesassociated with ob supergiant companions and characterised by an x-ray flaringbehaviour whose dynamical range reaches 5 orders of magnitude on timescales ofa few hundred to thousands of seconds. current investigations concentrate onfinding possible mechanisms to inhibit accretion in sfxts and explain theirunusually low average x-ray luminosity. we present the swift observations of anexceptionally bright outburst displayed by the sfxt igr j17544-2619 on 2014october 10 when the source achieved a peak luminosity of $3\times10^{38}$ ergs$^{-1}$. this extends the total source dynamic range to $\gtrsim$10$^6$, thelargest (by a factor of 10) recorded so far from an sfxt. tentative evidencefor pulsations at a period of 11.6 s is also reported. we show that theseobservations challenge, for the first time, the maximum theoretical luminosityachievable by an sfxt and propose that this giant outburst was due to theformation of a transient accretion disc around the compact object.

1506.01381	the complex accretion geometry of gx 339-4 as seen by nustar and swift	we present spectral analysis of five nustar and swift observations of gx339-4 taken during a failed outburst in summer 2013. these observations covereddington luminosity fractions in the range ~0.9-6%. throughout this outburst,gx 339-4 stayed in the hard state, and all five observations show similar x-rayspectra with a hard power-law with a photon index near 1.6 and significantcontribution from reflection. using simple reflection models we findunrealistically high iron abundances. allowing for different photon indices forthe continuum incident on the reflector relative to the underlying observedcontinuum results in a statistically better fit and reduced iron abundances.with a photon index around 1.3, the input power-law on the reflector issignificantly harder than that which is directly observed. we study theinfluence of different emissivity profiles and geometries and consistently findan improvement when using separate photon indices. the inferred inner accretiondisk radius is strongly model dependent, but we do not find evidence for atruncation radius larger than 100 r_g in any model. the data do not allowindependent spin constraints but the results are consistent with the literature(i.e., a&gt;0). our best-fit models indicate an inclination angle in the range40-60 degrees, consistent with limits on the orbital inclination but higherthan reported in the literature using standard reflection models. the iron linearound 6.4 kev is clearly broadened, and we detect a superimposed narrow coreas well. this core originates from a fluorescence region outside the influenceof the strong gravity of the black hole and we discuss possible geometries.

0808.2414	properties of x-ray selected broad absorption line quasars	broad absorption line quasars (commonly termed balqsos) contain the mostdramatic examples of agn-driven winds. the high absorbing columns in thesewinds, ~10^24 cm^-2, ensure that balqsos are generally x-ray faint. this highx-ray absorption means that almost all balqsos have been discovered throughoptical surveys, and so what little we know about their x-ray properties isderived from very bright optically-selected sources. a small number of x-rayselected balqsos (xbalqsos) have, however, recently been found in deep x-raysurvey fields. in this paper we investigate the x-ray and rest-frame uvproperties of five xbalqsos for which we have obtained xmm-newton epic x-rayspectra and deep optical imaging and spectroscopy. we find that, although thexbalqsos have an alpha_ox steeper by ~0.5 than normal qsos, their medianalpha_ox is nevertheless flatter by 0.30 than that of a comparable sample ofoptically selected balqsos (obalqsos). we rule out the possibility that thehigher x-ray to optical flux ratio is due to intrinsic optical extinction. wefind that the amount of x-ray and uv absorption due to the wind in xbalqsos issimilar, or perhaps greater than, the corresponding wind absorption inobalqsos, so the flatter alpha_ox cannot be a result of weaker wind absorption.we conclude that these xbalqsos have intrinsically higher x-ray to optical fluxratios than the obalqso sample with which we compare them.

astro-ph;0506453	prompt and afterglow early x-ray phases in the comoving frame. evidence  for universal properties?	we analyze the swift xrt light curves and spectra of the gamma-ray bursts(grbs) for which the redshift has been measured. the sample consists of sevengrbs. the soft x-ray light curves of all these grbs are separated into at leasttwo morphological classes: 1) those starting off with a very steep light curvedecay and 2) those showing a rather mild initial decay. this initial decay isfollowed by a flattening and by a further steepening. during these transitionsthe soft x-ray spectrum of these grbs remains constant within the observationalerrors (except for one case, grb050319). for the first time we are able toexploit the early light curve of grb afterglows in the comoving frame. besidesthe temporal and spectral behavior we find that the energy of the afterglowemitted in the (rest frame) time interval 20-200 s and 1300-12600 s after thetrigger correlates with the mean energy of the prompt emission, hinting at aclose link between the two. averaging over the bursts that have a rather wellsampled light curve and starting immediately after the prompt phase, the energyemitted in the soft x-rays is about 3% of the energy emitted during the promptphase, except for grb050315, where the soft x-ray emission is as high as 14% ofthe prompt emission.

astro-ph;0508071	the swift x-ray telescope	the swift gamma-ray explorer is designed to make prompt multiwavelengthobservations of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) and grb afterglows. the x-ray telescope(xrt) enables swift to determine grb positions with a few arcseconds accuracywithin 100 seconds of the burst onset.  the xrt utilizes a mirror set built for jet-x and an xmm/epic mos ccddetector to provide a sensitive broad-band (0.2-10 kev) x-ray imager witheffective area of &gt; 120 cm^2 at 1.5 kev, field of view of 23.6 x 23.6arcminutes, and angular resolution of 18 arcseconds (hpd). the detectionsensitivity is 2x10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in 10^4 seconds. the instrument isdesigned to provide automated source detection and position reporting within 5seconds of target acquisition. it can also measure the redshifts of grbs withfe line emission or other spectral features. the xrt operates in anauto-exposure mode, adjusting the ccd readout mode automatically to optimizethe science return for each frame as the source intensity fades. the xrt willmeasure spectra and lightcurves of the grb afterglow beginning about a minuteafter the burst and will follow each burst for days or weeks.

astro-ph;0508332	evidence for a canonical grb afterglow light curve in the swift/xrt data	we present new observations of the early x-ray afterglows of the first 27gamma-ray bursts (grbs) detected with the swift x-ray telescope (xrt). theearly x-ray afterglows show a canonical behavior, where the light curve broadlyconsists of three distinct power law segments: (i) an initial very steep decay(t^{-alpha} with 3&lt;alpha_1&lt;5), followed by (ii) a very shallow decay(0.2&lt;alpha_2&lt;0.8), and finally (iii) a somewhat steeper decay (1&lt;alpha_3&lt;1.5).these power law segments are separated by two corresponding break times,300s&lt;t_{break,1}&lt;500s and 10^3s&lt;t_{break,2}&lt;10^4s. on top of this canonicalbehavior of the early x-ray light curve, many events have superimposed x-rayflares, which are most likely caused by internal shocks due to long lastingsporadic activity of the central engine, up to several hours after the grb. wefind that the initial steep decay is consistent with it being the tail of theprompt emission, from photons that are radiated at large angles relative to ourline of sight. the first break in the light curve (t_{break,1}) takes placewhen the forward shock emission becomes dominant, with the intermediate shallowflux decay (alpha_2) likely caused by the continuous energy injection into theexternal shock. when this energy injection stops, a second break is thenobserved in the light curve (t_{break,2}). this energy injection increases theenergy of the afterglow shock by at least a factor of f&gt;4, and augments thealready severe requirements for the efficiency of the prompt gamma-rayemission.

astro-ph;0509164	swift xrt observations of the breaking x-ray afterglow of grb 050318	we report the results of swift x-ray telescope (xrt) observations of grb050318. this event triggered the burst alert telescope (bat) aboard swift andwas followed-up with xrt and uvot for 11 consecutive orbits starting from 54minutes after the trigger. a previously unknown fading x-ray source wasdetected and accurately monitored. the source was found to decrease inintensity with time and a clear temporal break occurring at ~18000 s after thetrigger was observed. the x-ray light curve was found to be consistent with abroken power-law with decay indices -1.17 +/- 0.08 and -2.10 (+0.22) (-0.24)before and after the break. the spectrum of the x-ray afterglow was welldescribed by a photoelectrically absorbed power-law with energy index of -1.09+/-0.09. no evidence of spectral evolution was found. we compare these resultswith those obtained with uvot and separately reported and refine the dataanalysis of bat. we discuss our results in the framework of a collimatedfireball model and a synchrotron radiation emission mechanism. assuming the grbredshift derived from the farthest optical absorption complex (z = 1.44), theevent is fully consistent with the e_p-e_iso correlation.

astro-ph;0509273	very early optical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts: evidence for relative  paucity of detection	very early observations with the swift satellite of gamma-ray burst (grb)afterglows reveal that the optical component is not detected in a large numberof cases. this is in contrast to the bright optical flashes previouslydiscovered in some grbs (e.g. grb 990123 and grb 021211). comparisons of thex-ray afterglow flux to the optical afterglow flux and prompt gamma-ray fluenceis used to quantify the seemingly deficient optical, and in some cases x-ray,light at these early epochs. this comparison reveals that some of these burstsappear to have higher than normal gamma-ray efficiencies. we discuss possiblemechanisms and their feasibility for explaining the apparent lack of earlyoptical emission. the mechanisms considered include: foreground extinction,circumburst absorption, ly-alpha blanketing and absorption due to highredshift, low density environments, rapid temporal decay, and intrinsicweakness of the reverse shock. of these, foreground extinction, circumburstabsorption, and high redshift provide the best explanations for most of thenon-detections in our sample. there is tentative evidence of suppression of thestrong reverse shock emission. this could be because of apoynting-flux-dominated flow or a pure non-relativistic hydrodynamical reverseshock.

astro-ph;0509737	detection of a huge explosion in the early universe	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are bright flashes of high energy photons that canlast from about 10 milliseconds to 10 minutes. their origin and nature havepuzzled the scientific community for about 25 years until 1997, when the firstx-ray afterglows of long (&gt; 2 s duration) bursts were detected and the firstoptical and radio counterparts were found. these measurements established thatlong grbs are typically at high redshift (z 1.6) and are in sub-luminousstar-forming host galaxies. they are likely produced in core-collapseexplosions of a class of massive stars that give rise to highly relativisticjets (collapsar model). internal inhomogeneities in the velocity field of therelativistic expanding flow lead to collisions between fast moving and slowmoving fluid shells and to the formation of internal shock waves. these shocksare believed to produce the observed prompt emission in the form of irregularlyshaped and spaced pulses of gamma-rays, each pulse corresponding to a distinctinternal collision. the expansion of the jet outward into the circumstellarmedium is believed to give rise to ``external'' shocks, responsible forproducing the smoothly fading afterglow emission seen in the x-ray, optical andradio bands. here we report on the gamma-ray and x-ray observation of the mostdistant gamma-ray burst ever observed: its redshift of 6.29 translates to adistance of 13 billion light-years from earth, corresponding to a time when theuniverse was just 700 million to 750 million years old. the discovery of agamma-ray burst at such a large redshift implies the presence of massive starsonly 700 million years after the big bang. the very high redshift burstsrepresent a good way to study the re-ionization era soon after the universecame out of the dark ages.

astro-ph;0511579	an origin for short g-ray bursts unassociated with current star  formation	two short (&lt;2 s) g-ray bursts (grbs) have recently been localized and fadingafterglow counterparts detected. the combination of these two results leftunclear the nature of the host galaxies of the bursts, because one was astar-forming dwarf, while the other was probably an elliptical galaxy. here wereport the x-ray localization of a short burst (grb 050724) with unusual g-rayand x-ray properties. the x-ray afterglow lies off the centre of an ellipticalgalaxy at a redshift of z=0.258, coincident with the position determined byground-based optical and radio observations. the low level of star formationtypical for elliptical galaxies makes it unlikely that the burst originated n asupernova explosion. a supernova origin was also ruled out for grb 050709, eventhough that burst took place in a galaxy with current star formation. theisotropic energy for the short bursts is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower han thatfor the long bursts. our results therefore suggest that an alternative sourceof bursts -- the of binary systems of neutron stars or a neutron star-blackhole pair -- are the progenitors of short bursts.

astro-ph;0512358	grb 050911: a black hole - neutron star merger or a naked grb	grb 050911, discovered by the swift burst alert telescope, was not seen 4.6hr later by the swift x-ray telescope, making it one of the very few x-raynon-detections of a gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglow at early times. thegamma-ray light-curve shows at least three peaks, the first two of which (~t_0- 0.8 and t_0 + 0.2 s, where t_0 is the trigger time) were short, each lasting0.5 s. this was followed by later emission 10-20 s post-burst. the upper limiton the unabsorbed x-ray flux was 1.7 x 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (integrating 46 ksof data taken between 11 and 18 september), indicating that the decay must havebeen rapid. all but one of the long bursts detected by swift were above thislimit at ~4.6 hr, whereas the afterglows of short bursts became undetectablemore rapidly. deep observations with gemini also revealed no optical afterglow12 hr after the burst, down to r=24.0 (5-sigma limit). we speculate that grb050911 may have been formed through a compact object (black hole-neutron star)merger, with the later outbursts due to a longer disc lifetime linked to alarge mass ratio between the merging objects. alternatively, the burst may haveoccured in a low density environment, leading to a weak, or non-existent,forward shock - the so-called 'naked grb' model.

astro-ph;0512615	the giant x-ray flare of grb 050502b: evidence for late-time internal  engine activity	until recently, x-ray flares during the afterglow of gamma ray bursts (grbs)were a rarely detected phenomenon, thus their nature is unclear. during theafterglow of grb 050502b, the largest x-ray flare ever recorded rose rapidlyabove the afterglow lightcurve detected by the swift x-ray telescope. the peakflux of the flare was &gt;500 times that of the underlying afterglow, and itoccurred at &gt;12 minutes after the nominal prompt burst emission. the fluence ofthis x-ray flare, (1.0 +/- 0.05) x 10^{-6} erg cm^{-2} in the 0.2-10.0 kevenergy band, exceeded the fluence of the nominal prompt burst. the spectraduring the flare were significantly harder than those measured before and afterthe flare. later in time, there were additional flux increases detected abovethe underlying afterglow, as well as a break in the afterglow lightcurve. allevidence presented below, including spectral and particularly timinginformation during and around the giant flare, suggests that this giant flarewas the result of internal dissipation of energy due to late central engineactivity, rather than an afterglow-related effect. we also find that the dataare consistent with a second central engine activity episode, in which theejecta is moving slower than that of the initial episode, causing the giantflare and then proceeding to overtake and refresh the afterglow shock, thuscausing additional activity at even later times in the lightcurve.

astro-ph;0601125	the early x-ray emission from grbs	we present observations of the early x-ray emission for a sample of 40gamma-ray bursts (grbs) obtained using the swift satellite for which thenarrow-field instruments were pointed at the burst within 10 minutes of thetrigger. using data from the burst alert and x-ray telescopes, we show that thex-ray light curve can be well described by an exponential that relaxes into apower law, often with flares superimposed. the transition time between theexponential and the power law provides a physically defined timescale for theburst duration. in most bursts the power law breaks to a shallower decay withinthe first hour, and a late emission "hump" is observed which can last for manyhours. in other grbs the hump is weak or absent. the observed variety in theshape of the early x-ray light curve can be explained as a combination of threecomponents: prompt emission from the central engine; afterglow; and the latehump. in this scenario, afterglow emission begins during or soon after theburst and the observed shape of the x-ray light curve depends on the relativestrengths of the emission due to the central engine and that of the afterglow.there is a strong correlation such that those grbs with stronger afterglowcomponents have brighter early optical emission. the late emission hump canhave a total fluence equivalent to that of the prompt phase. grbs with thestrongest late humps have weak or no x-ray flares.

(2005b). weinterpret the bat and xrt data as a single continuous observation of the promptemission from a very long grb. the peculiarities observed in grb050904 could bedue to its origin within one of the first star-forming regions in the universe;very low metallicities of the progenitor at these epochs may provide anexplanation.

astro-ph;0612494	panchromatic study of grb 060124: from precursor to afterglow	we present observations of grb 060124, the first event for which both theprompt and the afterglow emission could be observed simultaneously and in theirentirety by the three swift instruments and by konus-wind. thanks to theseexceptional circumstances, the temporal and spectral properties of the promptemission could be studied in the optical, x-ray and gamma-ray ranges (up to 2mev). while the x-ray emission (0.2-10 kev) clearly tracks the gamma-ray burst,the optical component follows a different pattern, likely indicating adifferent origin, possibly the onset of external shocks. the prompt grbspectrum shows significant spectral evolution, with both the peak energy andthe spectral index varying. as observed in several long grbs, significant lagsare measured between the hard- and low-energy components, showing that thisbehaviour extends over 3 decades in energy. the grb peaks are also much broaderat soft energies. this is related to the temporal evolution of the spectrum,and can be accounted for by the softening of the electron spectral index withtime. the burst energy (e_iso~5x10^{53} erg at z=2.297) and average peak energy(e_p~300 kev) make grb 060124 consistent with the amati relation. the x-rayafterglow is characterized by a decay which presents a break at t_b~10^5s.

0810.1180	multiple flaring activity in the supergiant fast x-ray transient igr  j08408-4503 observed with swift	igr j08408-4503 is a supergiant fast x-ray transient discovered in 2006 witha confirmed association with a o8.5ib(f) supergiant star, hd 74194. we reporton the analysis of two outbursts caught by swift/bat on 2006 october 4 and 2008july 5, and followed up at softer energies with swift/xrt. the 2008 xrt lightcurve shows a multiple-peaked structure with an initial bright flare thatreached a flux of ~1e-9 erg/cm2/s (2-10 kev), followed by two equally brightflares within 75 ks. the spectral characteristics of the flares differdramatically, with most of the difference, as derived via time-resolvedspectroscopy, being due to absorbing column variations. we observe a gradualdecrease of the nh, derived with a fit using absorbed power law model, as timepasses. we interpret these nh variations as due to an ionization effectproduced by the first flare, resulting in a significant decrease in themeasured column density towards the source. the durations of the flares, aswell as the times of the outbursts suggest that the orbital period is ~35 days,if the flaring activity is interpreted within the framework of the sidoli et al2007 model with the outbursts triggered by the neutron star passage inside anequatorial wind inclined with respect to the orbital plane.

0810.5446	swift monitoring of supergiant fast x-ray transients: the  out-of-outburst behaviour and the flares from igrj17544-2916 and xtej1739-302	supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxts) are a sub-class of high mass x-raybinaries (hmxbs) associated with ob supergiant companions and displayingtransient x-ray activity. this behaviour is quite surprising since hmxbshosting supergiants were known to be persistent sources, until the integraldiscoveries obtained by means of the monitoring of the galactic plane. we havebeen performing a monitoring campaign with swift of four sfxts with the mainaim of characterizing both the long-term behaviour of these transients and theproperties during bright outbursts. here we discuss the properties of the x-rayemission observed outside the outbursts as well as the flares observed from twosfxts: igrj17544-2916 and xtej1739-302. contrarily to what previously thought,swift allowed us to discover that sfxts spend most of the time in accretion ata low level, even outside the bright outbursts, with an accretion luminosity of1e33-1e34 erg/s, and that the quiescent level at ~1e32 erg/s is a much rarerstate.

0811.4246	modelling the spectral response of the swift-xrt ccd camera: experience  learnt from in-flight calibration	(abbreviated) we show that the xrt spectral response calibration wascomplicated by various energy offsets in photon counting (pc) and windowedtiming (wt) modes related to the way the ccd is operated in orbit (variation intemperature during observations, contamination by optical light from the sunlitearth and increase in charge transfer inefficiency). we describe how theseeffects can be corrected for in the ground processing software. we show thatthe low-energy response, the redistribution in spectra of absorbed sources, andthe modelling of the line profile have been significantly improved since launchby introducing empirical corrections in our code when it was not possible touse a physical description. we note that the increase in cti became noticeablein june 2006 (i.e. 14 months after launch), but the evidence of a more seriousdegradation in spectroscopic performance (line broadening and change in thelow-energy response) due to large charge traps (i.e. faults in the si crystal)became more significant after march 2007. we describe efforts to handle suchchanges in the spectral response. finally, we show that the commanded increasein the substrate voltage from 0 to 6v on 2007 august 30 reduced the darkcurrent, enabling the collection of useful science data at higher ccdtemperature (up to -50c). we also briefly describe the plan to recalibrate thexrt response files at this new voltage.

0812.3662	methods and results of an automatic analysis of a complete sample of  swift-xrt observations of grbs	we present a homogeneous x-ray analysis of all 318 gamma ray bursts detectedby the x-ray telescope on the swift satellite up to 2008 july 23; thisrepresents the largest sample of x-ray grb data published to date. in sections2--3 we detail the methods which the swift-xrt team has developed to producethe enhanced positions, light curves, hardness ratios and spectra presented inthis paper. software using these methods continues to create such products forall new grbs observed by the swift-xrt. we also detail web-based tools allowingusers to create these products for any object observed by the xrt, not justgrbs. in sections 4--6 we present the results of our analysis of grbs,including probability distribution functions of the temporal and spectralproperties of the sample. we demonstrate evidence for a consistent underlyingbehaviour which can produce a range of light curve morphologies, and attempt tointerpret this behaviour in the framework of external forward shock emission.we find several difficulties, in particular that reconciliation of our datawith the forward shock model requires energy injection to continue for days toweeks.
