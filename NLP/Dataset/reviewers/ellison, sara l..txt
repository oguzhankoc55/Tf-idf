0903.4684	the mass-metallicity relation in galaxy clusters: the relative  importance of cluster membership versus local environment	using a large (14,857), homogenously selected sample of cluster galaxiesidentified in the sloan digital sky survey data release 4 (sdss dr4), weinvestigate the impact of cluster membership and local density on the stellarmass-gas phase metallicity relation (mzr). we show that stellar metallicitiesare not suitable for this work, being relatively insensitive to subtle changesin the mzr. accurate nebular abundances can be obtained for 1318 clustergalaxies in our sample and we show that these galaxies are drawn from clustersthat are fully repesentative of the parent sample in terms of mass, size,velocity dispersion and richness. by comparing the mzr of the cluster galaxieswith a sample control of galaxies matched in mass, redshift, fibre coveringfraction and rest-frame g-r colour cluster galaxies are found to have, onaverage, higher metallicities by up to 0.04 dex. the magnitude of this offsetdoes not depend strongly on galactic half-light radius or cluster propertiessuch as velocity dispersion or cluster mass. the effect of local density on themzr is investigated, using the presence of a near neighbour and both two- andthree-dimensional density estimators. for all three metrics, it is found thatthe cluster galaxies in locally rich environments have higher medianmetallicities by up to ~ 0.05 dex than those in locally poor environments (orwithout a near neighbour). control (non-cluster) galaxies at locally highdensities exhibit similar metal-enhancements. taken together, these resultsshow that galaxies in clusters are, on average, slightly more metal-rich thanthe field, but that this effect is driven by local overdensity and not simplycluster membership.

0904.2531	revisiting the origin of the high metallicities of sub-damped  lyman-alpha systems	sub-damped lyman-alpha systems (sub-dlas) have previously been found toexhibit a steeper metallicity evolution than the classical damped lyman-alphasystems (dlas), evolving to close to solar metallicity by z~1. from newhigh-resolution spectra of 17 sub-dlas we have increased the number ofmeasurements of [fe/h] at z&lt;1.7 by 25% and compiled the most completeliterature sample of sub-dla and dla abundances to date. we find that sub-dlasare indeed significantly more metal-rich than dlas, but only at z&lt;1.7; themetallicity distributions of sub-dlas and dlas at z&gt;1.7 are statisticallyconsistent. we also present the first evidence that sub-dlas follow a velocitywidth-metallicity correlation over the same velocity range as dlas, but therelation is offset to higher metallicities than the dla relation. on the basisof these results, we revisit the previous explanation that the systematicallyhigher metallicities observed in sub-dlas are indicative of higher host galaxymasses. we discuss the various problems that this interpretation encounters andconclude that in general sub-dlas are not uniquely synonymous with massivegalaxies. we rule out physically related sources of bias (dust, environment,ionization effects) and examine systematics associated with the selection andanalysis of low-redshift sub-dlas. we propose that the high metallicities ofsub-dlas at z&lt;1.7 that drives an apparently steep evolution may be due to theselection of most low-redshift sub-dlas based on their high mgii equivalentwidths.

0904.3330	assessing the dust selection bias in quasar absorbers at 0.7 &lt; z&lt; 1.6:  zn/fe abundances in a radio-selected sample	the complete optical and radio absorption line system (corals) survey haspreviously been used to demonstrate that the number density, gas and metalscontent of z&gt;1.6 damped lyman alpha systems is not significantlyunder-estimated in magnitude limited surveys. in this paper, a sample of strongmgii absorbers selected from the optically complete 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.6 corals sampleof ellison et al. is used to assess the potential of dust bias at intermediateredshifts. from echelle spectra of all corals absorbers with mgii lambda 2796and feii lambda 2600 rest equivalent widths &gt; 0.5 a in the redshift range 0.7 &lt;z &lt; 1.6, we determine column densities of zn, cr, fe, mn and si. the range ofdust-to-metals ratios and inferred number density of dlas from the d-index areconsistent with optical samples. we also report the discovery of 4 newabsorbers in the echelle data in the redshift range 1.7 &lt; z&lt; 2.0, two of whichare confirmed dlas and one is a sub-dla, whilst the lya line is not covered forthe fourth.

0906.0983	on the absence of high metallicity-high column density damped lyman  alpha systems: molecule formation in a two-phase interstellar medium	we argue that the lack of observed damped lyman alpha (dla) systems thatsimultaneously have high hi columns densities and high metallicities resultsnaturally from the formation of molecules in the cold phase of a two-phaseatomic medium in pressure balance. our result applies equally well in diffusesystems where the ultraviolet radiation field is dominated by the extragalacticbackground and in dense star-forming ones, where the local radiation field islikely to be orders of magnitude higher. we point out that such aradiation-insensitive model is required to explain the absence of high column -high metallicity systems among dlas observed using gamma-ray burst afterglows,since these are likely subjected to strong radiation fields created by activestar formation in the grb host galaxy. moreover, we show that the observedrelationship between the maximum atomic gas column in dlas sets a firm upperlimit on the fraction of the mass in these systems that can be in the warm,diffuse phase. finally, we argue that our result explains the observed lack ofin situ star formation in dla systems.

0707.0490	the galactic deuterium abundance and dust depletion: insights from an  expanded ti/h sample	the primordial abundance of deuterium (d/h) yields a measure of the densityof baryons in the universe and is an important complement to determinationsfrom cosmic microwave background (cmb) experiments. indeed, the current smallsample of high redshift d/h measurements from quasar absorption line studiesare in excellent agreement with cmb-derived values. conversely, absorption linemeasurements of the galactic d/h ratio in almost 50 stellar sightlines show apuzzlingly large scatter outside the local bubble which is difficult to explainsimply by astration from the primordial value. here, we investigate the dustdepletion scenario by studying the correlation between d/h and the abundance oftitanium, one of the most refractory elements readily observed in the ism. witha sample 3 times larger than previous work, we confirm a correlation betweenti/h and d/h at the 97% confidence level. however, the magnitude of thisdependence is difficult to reconcile with a simple model of dust depletion fortwo reasons. first, contrary to what is expected from local depletion rates,the gradient of the highly refractory ti is much shallower than that observedfor fe and si. second, we do not observe the established tight, steepcorrelation between [ti/h] and the mean volume density of hydrogen. therefore,whilst dust remains a plausible explanation for the local d/h variations, theabundances of at least some of the refractory elements do not provide unanimoussupport for this scenario. we also argue that the correlations of [si/h],[fe/h], and [ti/h] with d/h are inconsistent with a simple infall model of lowmetallicity gas with approximately solar abundances as the dominant cause for dvariations.

1002.4418	galaxy pairs in the sloan digital sky survey - ii: the effect of  environment on interactions	we use a sample of close galaxy pairs selected from the sloan digital skysurvey data release 4 (sdss dr4) to investigate in what environments galaxymergers occur and how the results of these mergers depend on differences inlocal galaxy density. the galaxies are quantified morphologically usingtwo-dimensional bulge-plus-disk decompositions and compared to a control samplematched in stellar mass, redshift and local projected density. lower densityenvironments have fractionally more galaxy pairs with small projectedseparations (r_p) and relative velocities (delta v), but even high densityenvironments contain significant populations of pairs with parameters thatshould be conducive to interactions. metrics of asymmetry and colour are usedto identify merger activity and triggered star formation. the location of starformation is inferred by distinguishing bulge and disk colours and calculatingbulge fractions from the sdss images. galaxies in the lowest densityenvironments show the largest changes in star formation rate, asymmetry andbulge-total fractions at small separations, accompanied by bluer bulge colours.at the highest local densities, the only galaxy property to show an enhancementin the closest pairs is asymmetry. we interpret these results as evidence thatwhilst interactions (leading to tidal distortions) occur at all densities,triggered star formation is seen only in low-to-intermediate densityenvironments. we suggest that this is likely due to the typically higher gasfractions of galaxies in low density environments. finally, bycross-correlating our sample of galaxy pairs with a cluster catalogue, weinvestigate the dependence of interactions on clustercentric distance. it isfound that for close pairs the fraction of asymmetric galaxies is highest inthe cluster centres.

0704.1816	coincident, 100 kpc-scale damped lyman alpha absorption towards a binary  qso: how large are galaxies at z ~ 3?	we report coincident damped lyman alpha (dla) and sub-dla absorption at z =2.66 and z = 2.94 towards the z ~ 3 13.8 arcsecond separation binary quasarsdss 1116+4118 ab. at the redshifts of the absorbers, this angular separationcorresponds to a proper transverse separation of ~ 110 kpc. a third absorber, asub-dla at z = 2.47, is detected towards sdss 1116+4118 b, but no correspondinghigh column density absorber is present towards sdss 1116+4118 a. we use highresolution galaxy simulations and a clustering analysis to interpret thecoincident absorption and its implications for galaxy structure at z ~ 3. weconclude that the common absorption in the two lines of sight is unlikely toarise from a single galaxy, or a galaxy plus satellite system, and is morefeasibly explained by a group of two or more galaxies with separations ~ 100kpc. the impact of these findings on single line of sight observations is alsodiscussed; we show that abundances of dlas may be affected by up to a fewtenths of a dex by line of sight dla blending. from a keck esi spectrum of thetwo quasars, we measure metal column densities for all five absorbers anddetermine abundances for the three absorbers with log n(hi) &gt; 20. for the twohighest n(hi) absorbers, we determine high levels of metal enrichment,corresponding to 1/3 and 1/5 solar. these metallicities are amongst the highestmeasured for dlas at any redshift and are consistent with values measured inlyman break galaxies at 2 &lt; z &lt; 3. for the dla at z = 2.94 we also infer anapproximately solar ratio of alpha-to-fe peak elements from [s/zn] = +0.05, andmeasure an upper limit for the molecular fraction in this particular line ofsight of log f(h_2)&lt; -5.5.

1004.2715	the nature of proximate damped lyman alpha systems	we present high resolution echelle spectra of 7 proximate damped lyman alpha(pdla) systems whose relative velocity separation from the background quasar isdelta v &lt; 3000 km/s. combining our sample with a further 9 pdlas from theliterature we compare the chemical properties of the proximate systems with acontrol sample of intervening dlas. taken at face value, the sample of 16 pdlasexhibits a wide range of metallicities, ranging from z ~ 1/3 z_sun down to z ~1/1000 z_sun, including the dla with the lowest n(siii)/n(hi) yet reported inthe literature. we find several pieces of evidence that indicate enhancedionization and the presence of a hard ionizing spectrum in pdlas which lead toproperties that contrast with the intervening dlas, particularly when the n(hi)is low. the abundances of zn, si and s in pdlas with log n(hi) &gt; 21, whereionization corrections are minimized, are systematically higher than theintervening population by a factor of around 3. we also find possible evidencefor a higher fraction of nv absorbers amongst the pdlas, although thestatistics are still modest. 6/7 of our echelle sample show high ionizationspecies (siiv, civ, ovi or nv) offset by &gt;100 km/s from the main low ionabsorption. we analyse fine-structure transitions of cii* and siii* toconstrain the pdla distance from the qso. lower limits range from tens of kpcup to &gt;160 kpc for the most stringent limit. we conclude that (at least some)pdlas do exhibit different characteristics relative to the interveningpopulation out to 3000 km/s (and possibly beyond). nonetheless, the pdlasappear distinct from lower column density associated systems and the inferredqso-absorber separations mean they are unlikely to be associated with the qsohost. we speculate that the pdlas preferentially sample more massive galaxiesin more highly clustered regions of the high redshift universe.

1004.3319	h i column densities, metallicities, and dust extinction of metal-strong  damped lya systems	with the blue channel spectrograph (bcs) on the mmt telescope, we haveobtained spectra to the atmospheric cutoff of quasars previously known to showat least one absorption system at z&gt;1.6 with very strong metal lines (candidatemetal-strong damped lya systems; cmsdlas). the bcs/mmt spectra yield preciseestimates of the hi column densities (nhi) of the systems through voigt profileanalysis of their lya transitions. nearly all of the cmsdlas (41/43) satisfythe nhi criterion of dlas, 10^20.3. as a population, these systems havesystematically higher nhi values than dlas chosen randomly from quasarsightlines. combining our nhi measurements with previously measured metalcolumn densities, we estimate metallicities for the msdlas. these systems havesignificantly higher values than randomly selected dlas; at z~2, the msdlasshow a median metallicity [m/h] ~ -0.67 that is 0.6dex higher than acorresponding control sample. this establishes msdlas as having amongst themost metal-rich gas in the high z universe. our measurements extend theobserved correlation between siii 1526 equivalent width and the gas metallicityto higher values. if interpreted as a mass-metallicity relation, this impliesthe msdlas are the high mass subset of the dla population. we demonstrate thatdust in the msdlas reddens their background quasars, with a median shift in thespectral slope of da = 0.29. assuming an smc extinction law, this implies amedian reddening e(b-v)=0.025mag and visual extinction a_v=0.076mag. futurestudies of msdlas offer the opportunity to study the extinction,nucleosynthesis, and kinematics of the most chemically evolved, gas-richgalaxies at high z.

1007.0014	ionization corrections in a multi-phase interstellar medium: lessons  from a z~2 sub-dla	we present a high resolution (fwhm=2.7 km/s), high s/n echelle spectrum forthe z = 2.26 qso j2123-0050 and determine elemental abundances for the z = 2.06sub-dla in its line of sight. this high redshift sub-dla has a complexkinematic structure and harbours detections of neutral (si, ci), singly (e.g.cii, sii) and multiply ionized (e.g. civ, siiv) species as well as molecular hand hd. the plethora of detected transitions in various ionization stages isindicative of a complex multi-phase structure present in this high redshiftgalaxy. we demonstrate that the ionization corrections in this sub-dla aresignificant (up to ~0.7 dex). for example, if no ionization correction isapplied, a super-solar metallicity is derived ([s/h] = +0.36), whereas a singlephase ionization correction reduces this to [s/h] = -0.19. the theoreticalimpact of a multi-phase medium is investigated through cloudy modelling and itis found that the abundances of si, s and fe are always over-estimated (by upto 0.15 dex in our experiments) if a single-phase is assumed. therefore,although cloudy models improve estimates of metal column densities, thesimplification of a single phase medium leaves a systematic error in theresult, so that even ionization-corrected abundances may still be too high.without ionization corrections the properties of this sub-dla appear to requireextreme scenarios of nucleosynthetic origins. after ionization corrections areapplied the ism of this galaxy appears to be similar to some of the sightlinesthrough the milky way.

1007.2457	transverse sizes of civ absorption systems measured from multiple qso  sightlines	we present tomography of the circum-galactic metal distribution at redshift1.7 to 4.5 derived from echellete spectroscopy of binary quasars. we find civsystems at similar redshifts in paired sightlines more often than expected forsightline-independent redshifts. as the separation of the sightlines increasesfrom 36 kpc to 907 kpc, the amplitude of this clustering decreases. at thelargest separations, the civ systems cluster similar to lyman-break galaxies(adelberger et al. 2005a). the civ systems are significantly less correlatedthan these galaxies, however, at separations less than r_1 ~ 0.42 +/- 0.15 h-1comoving mpc. measured in real space, i.e., transverse to the sightlines, thislength scale is significantly smaller than the break scale estimated from theline-of-sight correlation function in redshift space (scannapieco et al.2006a). using a simple model, we interpret the new real-space measurement as anindication of the typical physical size of enriched regions. we adopt this sizefor enriched regions and fit the redshift-space distortion in the line-of-sightcorrelation function. the fitted velocity kick is consistent with the peculiarvelocity of galaxies as determined by the underlying mass distribution andplaces an upper limit on the outflow (or inflow) speed of metals. the impliedtime scale for dispersing metals is larger than the typical stellar ages oflyman-break galaxies (shapley et al. 2001), and we argue that enrichment bygalaxies at z &gt; 4.3 played a greater role in dispersing metals. to furtherconstrain the growth of enriched regions, we discuss empirical constraints onthe evolution of the civ correlation function with cosmic time. this studydemonstrates the potential of tomography for measuring the metal enrichmenthistory of the circum-galactic medium.

1010.5244	metallicities and dust content of proximate damped lyman alpha systems  in the sloan digital sky survey	composite spectra of 85 proximate absorbers (log n(hi)&gt;20 and velocitydifference between the absorption and emission redshift, dv&lt;10,000 km/s) in thesdss are used to investigate the trends of metal line strengths with velocityseparation from the qso. we construct composites in 3 velocity bins: dv&lt;3000km/s, 3000&lt;dv&lt;6000 km/s and dv&gt;6000 km/s, with further sub-samples toinvestigate the metal line dependence on n(hi) and qso luminosity. low (e.g.siii and feii) and high ionization (e.g. siiv and civ) species alike haveequivalent widths (ews) that are larger by factors of 1.5 -- 3 in the dv&lt;3000km/s composite, compared to the dv&gt;6000 km/s spectrum. the ews show an evenstronger dependence on dv if only the highest neutral hydrogen column density(log n(hi)&gt;20.7) absorbers are considered. we conclude that pdlas generallyhave higher metallicities than intervening absorbers, with the enhancementbeing a function of both dv and n(hi). it is also found that absorbers nearqsos with lower rest-frame uv luminosities have significantly stronger metallines. we speculate that absorbers near to high luminosity qsos may have hadtheir star formation prematurely quenched. finally, we search for the signatureof dust reddening by the pdlas, based on an analysis of the qso continuumslopes relative to a control sample and determine a limit of e(b-v)&lt;0.014 foran smc extinction curve. this work provides an empirical motivation fordistinguishing between proximate and intervening dlas, and establishes aconnection between the qso environment and galaxy properties at high redshifts.

1010.5778	galaxy pairs in the sloan digital sky survey - iii: evidence of induced  star formation from optical colours	we have assembled a large, high quality catalogue of galaxy colours from thesloan digital sky survey data release 7, and have identified 21,347 galaxies inpairs spanning a range of projected separations (r_p &lt; 80 h_{70}^{-1} kpc),relative velocities (\delta v &lt; 10,000 km/s, which includes projected pairsthat are essential for quality control), and stellar mass ratios (from 1:10 to10:1). we find that the red fraction of galaxies in pairs is higher than thatof a control sample matched in stellar mass and redshift, and demonstrate thatthis difference is likely due to the fact that galaxy pairs reside in higherdensity environments than non-paired galaxies. we detect clear signs ofinteraction-induced star formation within the blue galaxies in pairs, asevidenced by a higher fraction of extremely blue galaxies, along with bluewardoffsets between the colours of paired versus control galaxies. these signs arestrongest in close pairs (r_p &lt; 30 h_{70}^{-1} kpc and \delta v &lt; 200 km/s),diminish for more widely separated pairs (r_p &gt; 60 h_{70}^{-1} kpc and \delta v&lt; 200 km/s) and disappear for close projected pairs (r_p &lt; 30 h_{70}^{-1} kpcand \delta v &gt; 3000 km/s). these effects are also stronger in central (fibre)colours than in global colours, and are found primarily in low- tomedium-density environments. conversely, no such trends are seen in redgalaxies, apart from a small reddening at small separations which may resultfrom residual errors with photometry in crowded fields. when interpreted inconjunction with a simple model of induced starbursts, these results areconsistent with a scenario in which close peri-centre passages trigger inducedstar formation in the centres of galaxies which are sufficiently gas rich,after which time the galaxies gradually redden as they separate and theirstarbursts age.

1101.3566	gas flows in galaxies: the relative importance of mergers and bars	galaxy-galaxy interactions and large scale galaxy bars are usually consideredas the two main mechanisms for driving gas to the centres of galaxies. by usinglarge samples of galaxy pairs and visually classified bars from the sloandigital sky survey (sdss), we compare the relative efficiency of gas inflowsfrom these two processes. we use two indicators of gas inflow: star formationrate (sfr) and gas phase metallicity, which are both measured relative tocontrol samples. whereas the metallicity of galaxy pairs is suppressed relativeto its control sample of isolated galaxies, galaxies with bars are metal-richfor their stellar mass by 0.06 dex over all stellar masses. the sfrs of boththe close galaxy pairs and the barred galaxies are enhanced by ~60%, but in thebars the enhancement is only seen at stellar masses m* &gt;10^10 m_solar. takinginto account the relative frequency of bars and pairs, we estimate that atleast three times more central star formation is triggered by bars than byinteractions.

1106.1177	the impact of gas inflows on star formation rates and metallicities in  barred galaxies	the star formation rates (sfrs) and metallicities of a sample of 294 galaxieswith visually classified, strong, large-scale bars are compared to a controlsample of unbarred disk galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky surveydata release 4. the fibre (inner few kpc) metallicities of barred galaxies areuniformly higher (at a given mass) than the unbarred sample by ~0.06 dex.however, the fibre sfrs of the visually classified barred galaxies are higherby about 60% only in the galaxies with total stellar mass log m &gt; 10. the metalenhancement at log m&lt;10 without an accompanying increase in the sfr may be dueto a short-lived phase of early bar-triggered star formation in the past,compared to on-going star formation rate enhancements in higher mass barredgalaxies. there is no correlation between bar length or bar axial ratio withthe enhancement of the star formation rate. in order to assess the relativeimportance of star formation triggered by bars and galaxy-galaxy interactions,sfrs are also determined for a sample of close galaxy pairs. both mechanismsappear to be similarly effective at triggering central star formation forgalaxies with log m&gt;10. however, due to the much lower fraction of pairs thanbars, bars account for ~3.5 times more triggered central star formation thaninteractions.

1106.1184	compact groups in theory and practice -- iv. the connection to  large-scale structure	we investigate the properties of photometrically-selected compact groups(cgs) in the sloan digital sky survey. in this paper, the fourth in a series,we focus on understanding the characteristics of our observed cg sample withparticular attention paid to quantifying and removing contamination fromprojected foreground or background galaxies. based on a simple comparison ofpairwise redshift likelihoods, we find that approximately half of compactgroups in the parent sample contain one or more projected (interloping)members; our final clean sample contains 4566 galaxies in 1086 compact groups.we show that half of the remaining cgs are associated with rich groups (orclusters), i.e. they are embedded sub-structure. the other half have spatialdistributions and number-density profiles consistent with the interpretationthat they are either independently distributed structures within the field(i.e. they are isolated) or associated with relatively poor structures.comparisons of late-type and red-sequence fractions in radial annuli show thatgalaxies around apparently isolated compact groups resemble the fieldpopulation by 300 to 500 kpc from the group centre. in contrast, the galaxypopulation surrounding embedded compact groups appears to remain distinct fromthe field out beyond 1 to 2 mpc, consistent with results for rich groups. wetake this as additional evidence that the observed distinction between compactgroups, i.e. isolated vs. embedded, is a separation between different hostenvironments.

0710.0901	diffuse interstellar bands in z &lt; 0.6 caii absorbers	the diffuse interstellar bands (dibs) probably arise from complex organicmolecules whose strength in local galaxies correlates with neutral hydrogencolumn density, n(hi), and dust reddening, e(b-v). since caii absorbers inquasar (qso) spectra are posited to have high n(hi) and significant e(b-v),they represent promising sites for the detection of dibs at cosmologicaldistances. here we present the results from the first search for dibs in 9caii-selected absorbers at 0.07 &lt; z_abs &lt; 0.55. we detect the 5780ang dib inone line of sight at z_abs = 0.1556; this is only the second qso absorber inwhich a dib has been detected. unlike the majority of local dib sight-lines,both qso absorbers with detected dibs show weak 6284ang absorption comparedwith the 5780ang band. this may be indicative of different physical conditionsin intermediate redshift qso absorbers compared with local galaxies. assumingthat local relations between the 5780ang dib strength and n(hi) and e(b-v)apply in qso absorbers, dib detections and limits can be used to derive n(hi)and e(b-v). for the one absorber in this study with a detected dib, we derivee(b-v) = 0.23mag and log[n(hi)] &gt;= 20.9, consistent with previous conclusionsthat caii systems have high hi column densities and significant reddening. forthe remaining 8 caii-selected absorbers with 5780ang dib non-detections, wederive e(b-v) upper limits of 0.1-0.3mag.

1108.2711	galaxy pairs in the sloan digital sky survey - iv: interactions trigger  agn	galaxy-galaxy interactions are predicted to cause gas inflows leading toenhanced nuclear star formation. in this paper we test the further predictionthat the gas inflows lead to enhanced accretion onto the central supermassiveblack hole, triggering activity in the nucleus. based on a sample of 11,060sdss galaxies with a close companion (rp &lt; 80 kpc, delta v &lt; 200 km/s), weclassify agn based either on emission line ratios or on spectral classificationas a quasar. the agn fraction in the close pairs sample is compared to acontrol sample of 110,600 mass- and redshift-matched control galaxies with nonearby companion. we find a clear increase in the agn fraction in close pairsof galaxies with projected separations &lt; 40 kpc by up to a factor of 2.5relative to the control sample (although the enhancement depends on the chosens/n cut of the sample). the increase in agn fraction is strongest in equal massgalaxy pairings, and weakest in the lower mass component of an unequal masspairing. the increased agn fraction at small separations is accompanied by anenhancement in the number of `composite' galaxies whose spectra are the resultof photoionization by both agn and stars. our results indicate that agnactivity occurs (at least in some cases) well before final coalescence andconcurrently with ongoing star formation. finally, we find a marked increase atsmall projected separations of the fraction of pairs in which both galaxiesharbour agn. we demonstrate that the fraction of double agn exceeds theexpected random fraction, indicating that some pairs undergo correlated nuclearactivity. taken together with complimentary studies, we favour aninterpretation where interactions trigger agn, but are not the only cause ofnuclear activity.

1204.2828	the dependence of galaxy group star formation rates and metallicities on  large scale environment	we construct a sample of 75,863 star forming galaxies with robust metallicityand star formation rate measurements from the sloan digital sky survey datarelease 7 (sdss dr7), from which we select a clean sample of compact group (cg)galaxies. the cgs are defined to be close configurations of at least 4 galaxiesthat are otherwise apparently isolated. our selection results in a sample of112 spectroscopically identified compact group galaxies, which can be furtherdivided into groups that are either embedded within a larger structure, such asa cluster or large group, or truly isolated systems. the compact groups thenserve as a probe into the influence of large scale environment on a galaxy'sevolution, while keeping the local density fixed at high values. we find thatthe star formation rates (sfrs) of star forming galaxies in compact groups aresignificantly different between isolated and embedded systems. galaxies inisolated systems show significantly enhanced sfr, relative to a control samplematched in mass and redshift, a trend not seen in the embedded systems.galaxies in isolated systems exhibit a median sfr enhancement at fixed stellarmass of +0.07 \pm 0.03 dex. these dependences on large scale environment aresmall in magnitude relative to the apparent influence of local scale effectsfound in previous studies, but the significance of the difference in sfrsbetween our two samples constrains the effect of large scale environment to benon-zero. we find no significant change in the gas-phase interstellarmetallicity for either the isolated or embedded compact group sample relativeto their controls. however, simulated samples that include artificial offsetsindicate that we are only sensitive to metallicity changes of log o/h &gt;0.13 dex(at 99% confidence), which is considerably larger than the typical metallicitydifferences seen in previous environmental studies.

1204.5148	the chandra multi-wavelength project: optical spectroscopy and the  broadband spectral energy distributions of x-ray selected agn	from optical spectroscopy of x-ray sources observed as part of champ, wepresent redshifts and classifications for a total of 1569 chandra sources fromour targeted spectroscopic follow up using the flwo, saao, wiyn, ctio, kpno,magellan, mmt and gemini telescopes, and from archival sdss spectroscopy. weclassify the optical counterparts as 50% blagn, 16% nelg, 14% alg, and 20%stars. we detect qsos out to z~5.5 and galaxies out to z~3. we have compiledextensive photometry from x-ray to radio bands. together with our spectroscopicinformation, this enables us to derive detailed seds for our extragalacticsources. we fit a variety of templates to determine bolometric luminosities,and to constrain agn and starburst components where both are present. while~58% of x-ray seyferts require a starburst event to fit observed photometryonly 26% of the x-ray qso population appear to have some kind of star formationcontribution. this is significantly lower than for the seyferts, especially ifwe take into account torus contamination at z&gt;1 where the majority of our x-rayqsos lie. in addition, we observe a rapid drop of the percentage of starburstcontribution as x-ray luminosity increases. this is consistent with thequenching of star formation by powerful qsos, as predicted by the merger model,or with a time lag between the peak of star formation and qso activity. we havetested the hypothesis that there should be a strong connection between x-rayobscuration and star-formation but we do not find any association between x-raycolumn density and star formation rate both in the general population or thestar-forming x-ray seyferts. our large compilation also allows us to reporthere the identification of 81 xbong, 78 z&gt;3 x-ray sources and 8 type-2 qsocandidates. also we have identified the highest redshift (z=5.4135) x-rayselected qso with optical spectroscopy.

1211.6115	towards a physical picture of star-formation quenching: the photometric  properties of recently-quenched galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey	we select a sample of young passive galaxies from the sloan digital skysurvey data release 7 in order to study the processes that quench starformation in the local universe. quenched galaxies are identified based on thecontribution of a-type stars to their observed (central) spectra and relativelack of ongoing star formation; we find that such systems account for roughly2.5 per cent of all galaxies with log m_sun &gt;= 9.5, and have a space density of~2.2x10^-4 mpc^-3. we show that quenched galaxies span a range of morphologies,but that visual classifications suggest they are predominantly early-typesystems. their visual early-type classification is supported by quantitativestructural measurements sersic indices that show a notable lack ofdisk-dominated galaxies, suggesting that any morphological transformationassociated with galaxies' transition from star-forming to passive--e.g. theformation of a stellar bulge--occurs contemporaneously with the decline oftheir star-formation activity. we show that there is no clear excess of opticalagn in quenched galaxies, suggesting that: i) agn feedback is not associatedwith the majority of quenched systems or ii) that the observability of quenchedgalaxies is such that the quenching phase in general outlives any associatednuclear activity. comparison with classical post-starburst galaxies shows thatboth populations show similar signatures of bulge growth, and we suggest thatthe defining characteristic of post-starburst galaxies is the efficiency oftheir bulge growth rather than a particular formation mechanism.

1301.3424	a search for hi 21cm absorption towards a radio-selected quasar sample  ii: a new low spin temperature dla at high redshift	we report results from a deep search for redshifted hi 21cm absorption fromeight damped lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers (dlas) detected in our earlier opticalsurvey for dlas towards radio-loud quasars. hi 21cm absorption was detectedfrom the $z = 2.192$ dla towards txs2039+187, only the sixth case of such adetection at $z &gt; 2$, while upper limits on the hi 21cm optical depth wereobtained in six other dlas at $z &gt; 2$. our detection of hi 21cm absorption inthe eighth system, at $z = 2.289$ towards txs0311+430, has been reportedearlier. we also present high spatial resolution images of the backgroundquasars at frequencies close to the redshifted hi 21cm line frequency, allowingus to estimate the covering factor of each dla, and then determine its spintemperature $t_s$. for three non-detections of hi 21cm absorption, we obtainstrong lower limits on the spin temperature, $t_s \gtrsim 790$ k, similar tothe bulk of the high-$z$ dla population; three other dlas yield weak lowerlimits, $t_s &gt; 140-400$ k. however, for the two dlas with detections of hi 21cmabsorption, the derived spin temperatures are both low $t_s = (160 \pm 35)\times (f/0.35)$ k for the $z = 2.192$ dla towards txs2039+187 and $t_s = (72\pm 18) \times (f/0.52)$ k for the $z = 2.289$ dla towards txs0311+430. theseare the first two dlas at $z &gt; 1$ with $t_s$ values comparable to thoseobtained in local spiral galaxies. based on the observed correlations betweenspin temperature and metallicity and velocity spread and metallicity in dlas,we suggest that the hosts of the two absorbers are likely to be massive,high-metallicity galaxies.

1302.6211	the connection between star formation and metallicity evolution in  barred spiral galaxies	we have performed a series of chemodynamical simulations of barred discgalaxies. our goal is to determine the physical processes responsible for theincrease in the central gas-phase metallicity and of the central sfr observedin sdss. we define a 2kpc diameter central aperture to approximate theintegrated spectroscopic fibre measurements from the sdss. the chemicalevolution observed within this central region depends critically upon therelative size of the bar and the aperture, which evolves strongly with time. att~0.5gyr, a strong bar forms, whose length is considerably longer than the 2kpcaperture. the stars and gas lose angular momentum and follow elongated orbitsthat cause an intense mixing of the gas between the central region and itssurroundings. during the next 1.5gyr, the orbits of the gas contractsignificantly until the entire gas bar is contained in the 2kpc aperture,resulting in a net flux of gas into the central region. during this period, themetallicity in the central region increases steadily, and this enrichment isdominated by metal-rich gas that is flowing into the central region. the mainresult of this work is therefore that the observed enrichment in the centres ofbarred galaxies is not dominated by in-situ enrichment by stars formed in thecentre. rather, star formation occurs along the full length of the bar, much ofwhich occurs initially outside the 2kpc aperture. about 50% of the metals thatend up in the central region originate from this extended bar-long starformation, but flow into the central region due to loss of angular momentum. weconclude that there is no direct connection between central sfr and centralmetallicity. the central metallicity does not originate exclusively fromcentral stars. instead, the global sfr (especially along the bar) and thelarge-scale flow of enriched gas play a major role.

0801.0447	limits on reddening and gas-to-dust ratios for seven intermediate  redshift damped ly-alpha absorbers from diffuse interstellar bands	we present equivalent width measurements and limits of six diffuseinterstellar bands (dibs) in seven damped ly-alpha absorbers (dlas) over theredshift range 0.091&lt;z&lt;0.524, sampling 20.3&lt;log[n(hi)]&lt;21.7. dibs were detectedin only one of the seven dlas, that which has the highest reddening andmetallicity. based upon the galactic dib-n(hi) relation, the 6284 dibequivalent width upper limits in four of the seven dlas are a factor of 4-10times below the 6284 dib equivalent widths observed in the milky way, but arenot inconsistent with those present in the magellanic clouds. assuming thegalactic dib-e(b-v) relation, we determine reddening upper limits for the dlasin our sample. based upon the e(b-v) limits, the gas-to-dust ratios,n(hi)/e(b-v), of the four aforementioned dlas are at least 5 times higher thanthat of the milky way ism. the ratios of two other dlas are at least a factorof a few times higher. the best constraints on reddening derive from the upperlimits for the 5780 and 6284 dibs, which yield e(b-v)&lt;0.08 for four of theseven dlas. our results suggest that, in dlas, quantities related to dust, suchas reddening and metallicity, appear to have a greater impact on dib strengthsthan does hi gas abundance; the organic molecules likely responsible for dibsin dla selected sightlines are underabundant relative to sightlines in thegalaxy of similarly high n(hi). with regards to the study of astrobiology, thiscould have implications for the abundance of organic molecules in redshiftedgalaxies. however, since dlas are observed to have low reddening, selectionbias likely plays a role in the apparent underabundance of dibs in dlas.

1305.1595	galaxy pairs in the sloan digital sky survey - vi. the orbital extent of  enhanced star formation in interacting galaxies	we use pair and environmental classifications of ~ 211,000 star-forminggalaxies from the sloan digital sky survey, along with a suite of mergersimulations, to investigate the enhancement of star formation as a function ofseparation in galaxy pairs. using a new technique for distinguishing betweenthe influence of nearby neighbours and larger scale environment, we find aclear enhancement in star formation out to projected separations of ~ 150 kpc,beyond which there is no net enhancement. we find the strongest enhancements atthe smallest separations (especially &lt; 20 kpc), consistent with earlier work.similar trends are seen in the simulations, which indicate that the strongestenhancements are produced in highly disturbed systems approaching finalcoalescence, whereas the more modest enhancements seen at wider separations arethe result of starburst activity triggered at first pericentre passage, whichpersists as the galaxies move to larger separations. the absence of any netenhancement beyond 150 kpc provides reassurance that the detected enhancementsare due to galaxy-galaxy interactions, rather than larger scale environmentaleffects or potential pair selection biases. a rough census indicates that 66per cent of the enhanced star formation in our pair sample occurs atseparations &gt; 30 kpc. we conclude that significant interaction-induced starformation is not restricted to merger remnants or galaxies with closecompanions; instead, a larger population of wider separation pairs exhibitenhanced star formation due to recent close encounters.

0801.1849	metallicity calibrations and the mass-metallicity relation for  star-forming galaxies	(abridged) we investigate the effect of metallicity calibrations, agnclassification, and aperture covering fraction on the local mass-metallicity(mz) relation using 27,730 star-forming galaxies from the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) data release 4. we analyse the sdss mz relation with 10metallicity calibrations, including theoretical and empirical methods. we showthat the choice of metallicity calibration has a significant effect on theshape and y-intercept(12+log(o/h)) of the mz relation. the absolute metallicityscale (y-int) varies up to 0.7 dex, depending on the calibration used, and thechange in shape is substantial. these results indicate that it is critical touse the same metallicity calibration when comparing differentluminosity-metallicity or mass-metallicity relations. we present newmetallicity conversions that allow metallicities that have been derived usingdifferent strong-line calibrations to be converted to the same basecalibration. these conversions facilitate comparisons between differentsamples, particularly comparisons between galaxies at different redshifts forwhich different suites of emission-lines are available.our new conversionssuccessfully remove the large 0.7 dex discrepancies between the metallicitycalibrations, and we reach agreement in the mz relation to within 0.03 dex onaverage. we find that different agn classification methods have negligibleeffect on the sdss mz relation. we compare the sdss mz relation with nuclearand global relations from the nearby field galaxy survey (nfgs). the turn overof the mz relation depends on aperture covering fraction. we find that a lowerredshift limit of z&lt;0.04 is insufficient for avoiding aperture effects in fiberspectra of the highest stellar mass galaxies.

1308.3707	galaxy pairs in the sloan digital sky survey - viii: the observational  properties of post-merger galaxies	in order to investigate the effects of galaxy mergers throughout theinteraction sequence, we present a study of 10,800 galaxies in close pairs anda smaller sample of 97 post-mergers identified in the sloan digital sky survey.we find that the average central star formation rate (sfr) enhancement (x 3.5)and the fraction of starbursts (20 per cent) peak in the post-merger sample.the post-mergers also show a stronger deficit in gas phase metallicity than theclosest pairs, being more metal-poor than their control by -0.09 dex. combinedwith the observed trends in sfr and the timescales predicted in mergersimulations, we estimate that the post-mergers in our sample have undergonecoalescence within the last few hundred myr. in contrast with the incidence ofstar-forming galaxies, the frequency of active galactic nuclei (agn) peaks inthe post-mergers, outnumbering agn in the control sample by a factor of 3.75.moreover, amongst the galaxies that host an agn, the black hole accretion ratesin the closest pairs and post-mergers are higher by a factor of ~3 than agn inthe control sample. these results are consistent with a picture in which starformation is initiated early on in the encounter, with agn activity peakingpost-coalescence.

1308.6222	quasars probing quasars vi. excess hi absorption within one proper mpc  of z~2 quasars	with close pairs of quasars at different redshifts, a background quasarsightline can be used to study a foreground quasar's environment in absorption.we use a sample of 650 projected quasar pairs to study the hi lya absorptiontransverse to luminous, z~2 quasars at proper separations of 30kpc &lt; r &lt; 1mpc.in contrast to measurements along the line-of-sight, regions transverse toquasars exhibit enhanced hi lya absorption and a larger variance than theambient intergalactic medium, with increasing absorption and variance towardsmaller scales. analysis of composite spectra reveals excess absorptioncharacterized by a lya equivalent width profile w = 2.3a (r/100kpc)^-0.46. wealso observe a high (~60%) covering factor of strong, optically thick hiabsorbers (hi column log nhi &gt; 17.3) at separations r&lt;200kpc, which decreasesto ~20% at r~1mpc, but still represents a significant excess over the cosmicaverage. this excess of optically thick absorption can be described by aquasar-absorber cross-correlation function xi_qa(r) = (r/r_0)^gamma with alarge correlation length r_0 = 12.5+2.7-1.4 mpc/h (comoving) and gamma =1.68+0.14-0.30. the hi absorption measured around quasars exceeds that of anypreviously studied population, consistent with quasars being hosted by massivedark matter halos mhalo~10^12.5 msun at z~2.5. the environments of thesemassive halos are highly biased towards producing optically thick gas, and mayeven dominate the cosmic abundance of lyman limit systems and hence theintergalactic opacity to ionizing photons at z~2.5. the anisotropic absorptionaround quasars implies the transverse direction is much less likely to beilluminated by ionizing radiation than the line-of-sight, which we interpret interms of the same obscuration effects frequently invoked in unified models ofactive galactic nuclei.

1309.1191	the dynamics of galaxy pairs in a cosmological setting	we use the millennium simulation, and an abundance-matching framework, toinvestigate the dynamical behaviour of galaxy pairs embedded in a cosmologicalcontext. our main galaxy-pair sample, selected to have separations under 250kpc/h, consists of over 1.3 million pairs at redshift z = 0, with stellarmasses greater than 10^9 msun, probing mass ratios down to 1:1000. we use darkmatter halo membership and energy to classify our galaxy pairs. in terms ofhalo membership, central-satellite pairs tend to be in isolation (in relationto external more massive galaxies), are energetically- bound to each other, andare also weakly-bound to a neighbouring massive galaxy. satellite-satellitepairs, instead, inhabit regions in close proximity to a more massive galaxy,are energetically-unbound, and are often bound to that neighbour. we find that60% of our paired galaxies are bound to both their companion and to a thirdexternal object. moreover, only 9% of our pairs resemble the kind of systemsdescribed by idealised binary merger simulations in complete isolation. in sum,we demonstrate the importance of properly connecting galaxy pairs to the restof the universe.

(2011), which we extend here withbulge+disk and sersic profile photometric decompositions in the sdss u, i, andz bands. we discuss the methodology used to derive stellar masses from thesedata via fitting to broadband spectral energy distributions (seds), and showthat the typical statistical uncertainty on total, bulge, and disk stellar massis ~0.15 dex. despite relatively small formal uncertainties, we argue that sedmodeling assumptions, including the choice of synthesis model, extinction law,initial mass function, and details of stellar evolution likely contribute anadditional 60% systematic uncertainty in any mass estimate based on broadbandsed fitting. we discuss several approaches for identifying genuine bulge+disksystems based on both their statistical likelihood and an analysis of theirone-dimensional surface-brightness profiles, and include these metrics in thecatalogs. estimates of the total, bulge and disk stellar masses for both normaland dust-free models and their uncertainties are made publicly available here.

1401.5483	discovery of a population of bulgeless galaxies with extremely red  mid-ir colors: obscured agn activity in the low mass regime?	in contrast to massive, bulge hosting galaxies, very few supermassive blackholes (smbhs) are known in either low mass, or bulgeless galaxies. such apopulation could provide clues to the origins of smbhs and to secular pathwaysfor their growth. using the all-sky wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise)survey, and bulge-to-disk decompositions from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) data release 7, we report the discovery of a population of local (z&lt;0.3)bulgeless disk galaxies with extremely red mid-infrared colors highlysuggestive of a dominant active galactic nucleus (agn), despite having nooptical agn signatures in their sdss spectra. using various mid-infraredselection criteria from the literature, there are between 30 to over 300bulgeless galaxies with possible agns. other known scenarios that can heat thedust to high temperatures do not appear to explain the observed colors of thissample. if these galaxies are confirmed to host agns, this study will provide abreakthrough in characterizing the properties of smbhs in the low bulge massregime and in understanding their relation with their host galaxies.mid-infrared selection identifies agns that dominate their host galaxy'semission and therefore reveal a different agn population than is uncovered byoptical studies. we find that the fraction of all galaxies identified ascandidate agns by wise is highest at lower stellar masses and dropsdramatically in higher mass galaxies, in striking contrast to the findings fromoptical studies.

1401.7384	artificial neural network based calibrations for the prediction of  galactic [nii] $\lambda$ 6584 and h$\alpha$ line luminosities	the artificial neural network (ann) is a well-established mathematicaltechnique for data prediction, based on the identification of correlations andpattern recognition in input training sets. we present the application of annsto predict the emission line luminosities of h$\alpha$ and [nii] $\lambda$6584in galaxies. these important spectral diagnostics are used for metallicities,active galactic nuclei (agn) classification and star formation rates, yet areshifted into the infra-red for galaxies above $z \sim 0.5$, or may not becovered in spectra with limited wavelength coverage. the ann is trained with alarge sample of emission line galaxies selected from the sloan digital skysurvey using various combinations of emission lines and stellar mass. the annis tested for galaxies dominated by both star formation and agn; in both casesthe h$\alpha$ and [nii] $\lambda$6584 line luminosities can be predicted with ascatter $\sigma &lt;$ 0.1 dex. we also show that the performance of the ann doesnot depend significantly on the covering fraction, mass or metallicity of thedata. polynomial functions are derived that allow easy application of the annpredictions to determine h$\alpha$ and [nii] $\lambda$6584 line luminosities.an ann calibration for the balmer decrement (h$\alpha$/h$\beta$) based on lineequivalent widths and colours is also presented. the effectiveness of the anncalibration is demonstrated with an independent dataset (the galaxy mass andassembly survey). we demonstrate the application of our line luminosities tothe determination of gas-phase metallicities and agn classification. the anntechnique yields a significant improvement in the measurement of metallicitiesthat require [nii] and h$\alpha$ when compared with the function basedconversions of kewley &amp; ellison. the agn classification is successful for 86per cent of sdss galaxies.

1402.5082	the signature of dissipation in the mass-size relation: are bulges  simply spheroids wrapped in a disc?	the relation between the stellar mass and size of a galaxy's structuralsubcomponents, such as discs and spheroids, is a powerful way to understand theprocesses involved in their formation. using very large catalogues ofphotometric bulge+disc structural decompositions and stellar masses from thesloan digital sky survey data release seven, we carefully define two largesubsamples of spheroids in a quantitative manner such that both samples sharesimilar characteristics with one important exception: the 'bulges' are embeddedin a disc and the 'pure spheroids' are galaxies with a single structuralcomponent. our bulge and pure spheroid subsample sizes are 76,012 and 171,243respectively. above a stellar mass of ~$10^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$, the mass-sizerelations of both subsamples are parallel to one another and are close to linesof constant surface mass density. however, the relations are offset by a factorof 1.4, which may be explained by the dominance of dissipation in theirformation processes. whereas the size-mass relation of bulges in discs isconsistent with gas-rich mergers, pure spheroids appear to have been formed viaa combination of 'dry' and 'wet' mergers.

1403.5269	bulge mass is king: the dominant role of the bulge in determining the  fraction of passive galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey	we investigate the origin of galaxy bimodality by quantifying the relativerole of intrinsic and environmental drivers to the cessation (or `quenching')of star formation in over half a million local sloan digital sky survey (sdss)galaxies. our sample contains a wide variety of galaxies at z=0.02-0.2, withstellar masses of 8 &lt; log(m*/m_sun) &lt; 12, spanning the entire morphologicalrange from pure disks to spheroids, and over four orders of magnitude in localgalaxy density and halo mass. we utilise published star formation rates and addto this recent gim2d photometric and stellar mass bulge + disk decompositionsfrom our group. we find that the passive fraction of galaxies increases steeplywith stellar mass, halo mass, and bulge mass, with a less steep dependence onlocal galaxy density and bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio (b/t). at fixedinternal properties, we find that central and satellite galaxies have differentpassive fraction relationships. for centrals, we conclude that there is lessvariation in the passive fraction at a fixed bulge mass, than for any othervariable, including total stellar mass, halo mass, and b/t. this implies thatthe quenching mechanism must be most tightly coupled to the bulge. we arguethat radio-mode agn feedback offers the most plausible explanation of theobserved trends.

1403.7531	galaxy pairs in the sloan digital sky survey - ix: merger-induced agn  activity as traced by the wide-field infrared survey explorer	interactions between galaxies are predicted to cause gas inflows that canpotentially trigger nuclear activity. since the inflowing material can obscurethe central regions of interacting galaxies, a potential limitation of previousoptical studies is that obscured active galactic nuclei (agns) can be missed atvarious stages along the merger sequence. we present the first largemid-infrared study of agns in mergers and galaxy pairs, in order to quantifythe incidence of obscured agns triggered by interactions. the sample consistsof galaxy pairs and post-mergers drawn from the sloan digital sky survey thatare matched to detections by the wide field infrared sky explorer (wise). wefind that the fraction of agn in the pairs, relative to a mass-, redshift- andenvironment-matched control sample, increases as a function of decreasingprojected separation. this enhancement is most dramatic in the post-mergersample, where we find a factor of 10-20 excess in the agn fraction comparedwith the control. although this trend is in qualitative agreement with resultsbased on optical agn selection, the mid-infrared selected agn excess increasesmuch more dramatically in the post-mergers than is seen for optical agn. ourresults suggest that energetically dominant optically obscured agns become moreprevalent in the most advanced mergers, consistent with theoreticalpredictions.

0803.0161	galaxy pairs in the sloan digital sky survey i: star formation, agn  fraction, and the luminosity/mass-metallicity relation	(abridged). we present a sample of 1716 galaxies with companions within deltav &lt; 500 km/s, r_p &lt; 80 kpc and stellar mass ratio 0.1 &lt; m_1/m_2 &lt; 10 from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 4 (dr4). in agreement withprevious studies, we find an enhancement in the star formation rate (sfr) ofgalaxy pairs at projected separations &lt; 30--40 kpc. in addition, we find thatthis enhancement is highest (and extends to the greatest separations) forgalaxies of approximately equal mass, the so-called `major' pairs. however, sfrenhancement can still be detected for a sample of galaxy pairs whose masses arewithin a factor of 10 of each other. in agreement with the one previous studyof the luminosity-metallicity (lz) relation in paired galaxies, we find anoffset to lower metallicities (by ~ 0.1 dex) for a given luminosity forgalaxies in pairs compared to the control sample. we also present the firstmass-metallicity (mz) relation comparison between paired galaxies and thefield, and again find an offset to lower metallicities (by ~ 0.05 dex) for agiven mass. the smaller offset in the mz relation indicates that both higherluminosities and lower metallicities may contribute to the shift of pairsrelative to the control in the lz relation. we show that the offset in the lzrelation depends on galaxy half light radius, r_h. galaxies with r_h &lt; 3 kpcand with a close companion show a 0.05-0.1 dex downwards offset in metallicitycompared to control galaxies of the same size. finally, we study the agnfraction in both the pair and control sample and find that whilst selectinggalaxies in different cuts of color and asymmetry yields different agnfractions, the fraction for pairs and the control sample are consistent for agiven set of selection criteria.

1412.3862	why do galaxies stop forming stars? i. the passive fraction - black hole  mass relation for central galaxies	we derive the dependence of the fraction of passive central galaxies on themass of their supermassive black holes for a sample of over 400,000 sdssgalaxies at z &lt; 0.2. our large sample contains galaxies in a wide range ofenvironments, with stellar masses 8 &lt; log(m*/msun) &lt; 12, spanning the entiremorphological spectrum from pure disks to spheroids. we derive estimates forthe black hole masses from measured central velocity dispersions and bulgemasses, using a variety of published empirical relationships. we find a verystrong dependence of the passive fraction on black hole mass, which is largelyunaffected by the details of the black hole mass estimate. moreover, thepassive fraction relationship with black hole mass remains strong and tighteven at fixed values of galaxy stellar mass (m*), dark matter halo mass(mhalo), and bulge-to-total stellar mass ratio (b/t). whereas, the passivefraction dependence on m*, mhalo and b/t is weak at fixed mbh. theseobservations show that, for central galaxies, mbh is the strongest correlatorwith the passive fraction, consistent with quenching from agn feedback.

1501.03114	the neutral gas content of post-merger galaxies	measurements of the neutral hydrogen gas content of a sample of 93post-merger galaxies are presented, from a combination of matches to thealfalfa.40 data release and new arecibo observations. by imposing completenessthresholds identical to that of the alfalfa survey, and by compiling a mass-,redshift- and environment-matched control sample from the public alfalfa.40data release, we calculate gas fraction offsets (delta f_gas) for thepost-mergers, relative to the control sample. we find that the post-mergershave hi gas fractions that are consistent with undisturbed galaxies. however,due to the relative gas richness of the alfalfa.40 sample, from which we drawour control sample, our measurements of gas fraction enhancements are likely tobe conservative lower limits. combined with comparable gas fractionmeasurements by fertig et al. in a sample of galaxy pairs, who also determinegas fraction offsets consistent with zero, we conclude that there is noevidence for significant neutral gas consumption throughout the mergersequence. from a suite of 75 binary merger simulations we confirm that starformation is expected to decrease the post-merger gas fraction by only 0.06dex, even several gyr after the merger. moreover, in addition to the lack ofevidence for gas consumption from gas fraction offsets, the observed hidetection fraction in the complete sample of post-mergers is twice as high asthe controls, which suggests that the post-merger gas fractions may actually beenhanced. we demonstrate that a gas fraction enhancement in post-mergers,relative to a stellar mass-matched control sample, would indeed be the naturalresult of merging randomly drawn pairs from a parent population which exhibitsa declining gas fraction with increasing stellar mass.

0804.2928	compact groups in theory and practice - i. the spatial properties of  compact groups	we use a mock galaxy catalogue based upon the millennium run simulation toinvestigate the intrinsic spatial properties of compact groups of galaxies. wefind that approximately 30% of galaxy associations identified in our mockcatalogue are physically dense systems of four or more galaxies with nointerlopers, approximately half are close associations of 2, 3 or 4 galaxieswith one or more interlopers, and the remainder are not physically dense.genuine compact groups are preferentially brighter and more isolated than thosewith interlopers; by increasing the required minimum surface brightness of agroup from the canonical value of 26mags/arcsec^2 to 22mags/arcsec^2, we canincrease the proportion of genuinely compact systems identified with nointerlopers from 29% to 75%. of the genuine compact groups identified, morethan half consist of a single dark matter halo with all the member galaxiesdeeply embedded within it. in some cases, there are other galaxies which sharethe same halo (typically with mass ~ 10^13 h^{-1} m_\odot) but which are notidentified as being members of the compact group. this implies that compactgroups are associated with group environments, some or all members of which arein the compact group. for those compact groups where all galaxies are in thesame halo, the three-dimensional velocity dispersion of the compact groupcorrelates broadly with the virial velocity of the dark matter halo. however,the scale-size of the group - and hence the fraction of the halo mass which thegroup samples - is completely uncorrelated with the properties of the darkmatter halo. this means that masses derived under the simple assumption ofvirial equilibrium using the observed velocity dispersions and sizes of compactgroups give incorrect estimates of the true mass of the underlying dark matter.

1503.05194	galaxy pairs in the sloan digital sky survey - x: does gas content alter  star formation rate enhancement in galaxy interactions?	new spectral line observations, obtained with the jansky very large array(vla), of a sample of 34 galaxies in 17 close pairs are presented in thispaper. the sample of galaxy pairs is selected to contain galaxies in close,major interactions (i.e., projected separations $&lt;$30 kpc/h, and mass ratiosless extreme than 4:1), while still having a sufficiently large angularseparation that the vla can spatially resolve both galaxies in the pair. of the34 galaxies, 17 are detected at $&gt; 3\sigma$. we compare the hi gas fraction ofthe galaxies with the triggered star formation present in that galaxy. whencompared to the star formation rates (sfrs) of non-pair galaxies matched inmass, redshift, and local environment, we find that the star formationenhancement is weakly positively correlated ($\sim 2.5\sigma$) with hi gasfraction. in order to help understand the physical mechanisms driving this weakcorrelation, we also present results from a small suite of binary galaxy mergersimulations with varying gas fractions. the simulated galaxies indicate thatlarger initial gas fractions are associated with lower levels ofinteraction-triggered star formation (relative to an identical galaxy inisolation), but also show that high gas fraction galaxies have higher absolutesfrs prior to an interaction. we show that when interaction-driven sfrenhancements are calculated relative to a galaxy with an average gas fractionfor its stellar mass, the relationship between sfr and initial gas fractiondominates over the sfr enhancements driven by the interaction. simulated galaxyinteractions that are matched in stellar mass but not in gas fraction, like ourvla sample, yield the same general positive correlation between sfr enhancementand gas fraction that we observe.

1504.06255	galaxy pairs in the sloan digital sky survey - xii: the fuelling  mechanism of low excitation radio-loud agn	we investigate whether the fuelling of low excitation radio galaxies (lergs)is linked to major galaxy interactions. our study utilizes a sample of 10,800spectroscopic galaxy pairs and 97 post-mergers selected from the sloan digitalsky survey with matches to multi-wavelength datasets. the lerg fraction amongstinteracting galaxies is a factor of 3.5 higher than that of a control samplematched in local galaxy density, redshift and stellar mass. however, the lergexcess in pairs does not depend on projected separation and remains elevatedout to at least 500 kpc, suggesting that major mergers are not their mainfuelling channel. in order to identify the primary fuelling mechanism of lergs,we compile samples of control galaxies that are matched in various host galaxyand environmental properties. the lerg excess is reduced, but not completelyremoved, when halo mass or d4000 are included in the matching parameters.however, when both m_halo and d4000 are matched, there is no lerg excess andthe 1.4 ghz luminosities (which trace jet mechanical power) are consistentbetween the pairs and control. in contrast, the excess of optical and mid-irselected agn in galaxy pairs is unchanged when the additional matchingparameters are implemented. our results suggest that whilst major interactionsmay trigger optically and mid-ir selected agn, the gas which fuels the lergshas two secular origins: one associated with the large scale environment, suchas accretion from the surrounding medium or minor mergers, plus an internalstellar mechanism, such as winds from evolved stars.

1506.02037	the neutral hydrogen cosmological mass density at z=5	we present the largest homogeneous survey of $z&gt;4.4$ damped lyman-$\alpha$systems (dlas) using the spectra of 163 qsos that comprise the giant geminigmos (ggg) survey. with this survey we make the most precise high-redshiftmeasurement of the cosmological mass density of neutral hydrogen, $\omega_{\rmhi}$. at such high redshift important systematic uncertainties in theidentification of dlas are produced by strong intergalactic medium absorptionand qso continuum placement. these can cause spurious dla detections, result inreal dlas being missed, or bias the inferred dla column density distribution.we correct for these effects using a combination of mock and higher-resolutionspectra, and show that for the ggg dla sample the uncertainties introduced aresmaller than the statistical errors on $\omega_{\rm hi}$. we find $\omega_{\rmhi}=0.98^{+0.20}_{-0.18}\times10^{-3}$ at $\langle z\rangle=4.9$, assuming a20% contribution from lower column density systems below the dla threshold. bycomparing to literature measurements at lower redshifts, we show that$\omega_{\rm hi}$ can be described by the functional form $\omega_{\rmhi}(z)\propto(1+z)^{0.4}$. this gradual decrease from $z=5$ to $0$ isconsistent with the bulk of hi gas being a transitory phase fuelling starformation, which is continually replenished by more highly-ionized gas from theintergalactic medium, and from recycled galactic winds.

1509.09004	the infra-red luminosities of ~332,000 sdss galaxies predicted from  artificial neural networks and the herschel stripe 82 survey	the total infra-red (ir) luminosity (l_ir) can be used as a robust measure ofa galaxy's star formation rate (sfr), even in the presence of an activegalactic nucleus (agn), or when optical emission lines are weak. unfortunately,existing all sky far-ir surveys, such as the infra-red astronomical satellite(iras) and akari, are relatively shallow and are biased towards the highest sfrgalaxies and lowest redshifts. more sensitive surveys with the herschel spaceobservatory are limited to much smaller areas. in order to construct a largesample of l_ir measurements for galaxies in the nearby universe, we employartificial neural networks (anns), using 1136 galaxies in the herschel stripe82 sample as the training set. the networks are validated using two independentdatasets (iras and akari) and demonstrated to predict the l_ir with a scattersigma ~ 0.23 dex, and with no systematic offset. importantly, the ann performswell for both star-forming galaxies and those with an agn. a public catalog ispresented with our l_ir predictions which can be used to determine sfrs for331,926 galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss), including ~ 129,000sfrs for agn-dominated galaxies for which sdss sfrs have large uncertainties.

astro-ph;0005448	the enrichment history of the intergalactic medium: measuring the civ/hi  ratio in the lyman alpha forest	we have obtained an exceptionally high s/n, high resolution spectrum of thegravitationally lensed quasar q1422+231 in order to investigate the metalenrichment of the igm. a column density distribution function (cddf) isdetermined for civ, which is well fit by a power law with index 1.44 +/- 0.05.once a correction for incompleteness is applied, we find that the cddf isconsistent with a power law down to log n(civ) = 11.75, a factor of 10 moresensitive than previously determined. in order to determine whether the civenrichment extends to even lower column density hi clouds, we find that ananalysis of individual pixel optical depths is more robust than the stackingtechnique. the results obtained from this optical depth method are comparedwith analyses of simulated spectra enriched with varying civ enrichmentrecipes. from these simulations, we conclude that more civ than is currentlydirectly detected in q1422+231 is required to reproduce the optical depthsdetermined from the data, consistent with the conclusions drawn fromconsideration of the power law distribution.

astro-ph;0104466	the first detection of co in a damped lyman alpha system	the study of elemental abundances in damped lyman alpha systems (dlas) athigh redshift represents one of our best opportunities to probe galaxyformation and chemical evolution at early times. by coupling measurements madein high z dlas with our knowledge of abundances determined locally and withnucleosynthetic models, we can start to piece together the star formationhistories of these galaxies. here, we discuss the clues to galactic chemicalevolution that may be gleaned from studying the abundance of co in dlas. wepresent high resolution echelle spectra of two qsos, q2206-199 and q1223+17,both already known to exhibit intervening damped systems. these observationshave resulted in the first ever detection of co at high redshift, associatedwith the z= 1.92 dla in the sightline towards q2206-199. we find that theabundance of co is approximately 1/4 solar and that there is a clearoverabundance relative to iron, [co/fe] = +0.31 +/- 0.05. from the abundance ofzn, we determine that this is a relatively metal-rich dla, with a metallicityapproximately 1/3 solar. therefore, this first detection of co is similar tothe marked overabundance relative to fe seen in galactic bulge and thick diskstars.

astro-ph;0109205	the corals survey i: new estimates of the number density and gas content  of damped lyman alpha systems free from dust bias	(abridged) we present the first results from the complete optical and radioabsorption line system (corals) survey. we have compiled a homogeneous sampleof radio-selected qsos from the parkes catalogue and searched for damped lymanalpha systems (dlas) towards every target, irrespective of its opticalmagnitude. this approach circumvents selection effects -- particularly fromintervening dust -- which have long been suspected to affect dla surveys inoptically-selected, magnitude-limited qso samples. the corals data set consistsof 66 z_em &gt; 2.2 qsos in which 22 dlas with absorption redshifts 1.8 &lt; z_abs &lt;z_em have been identified over a total redshift interval delta z = 55.46. inthis first paper of the corals series we describe the sample, presentintermediate resolution spectroscopy and determine the population statistics ofdlas. we deduce a value of the neutral gas mass density traced by dlas(expressed as a fraction of the closure density) log omega_dla h =-2.59^{+0.17}_{-0.24}, and a number density of dlas per unit redshift n(z) =0.31^{+0.09}_{-0.08}, both at a mean redshift &lt;z&gt; = 2.37. taking into accountthe errors, we conclude that dust-induced bias in previous surveys may have ledto an underestimate of these quantities by at most a factor of two and we havenot uncovered a previously unrecognised population of high column density dlasin front of faint qsos.

astro-ph;0112135	the corals survey ii: clues to galaxy clustering around qsos from z_abs  ~ z_em damped lyman alpha systems	we present a list of z_abs ~ z_em (delta v &lt; 3000 km/s) dlas discoveredduring the corals survey for absorbers in a radio-selected qso sample. on theassumption that z_abs ~ z_em dlas are neither ejecta from the qso, nor part ofthe host galaxy itself, we use the number density statistics of these dlas toinvestigate galaxy clustering near the qso redshift. we find that n(z) of z_abs\~z_em dlas in our radio-selected qso sample is ~4 times larger than the numberdensity of intervening dlas, implying an excess of galaxies near the qso. thisresult is further supported with the inclusion of the radio-loud qsos in thefirst survey, although the total number of dlas is still small (4) and theresult is currently only significant at approximately the 2 sigma level. sinceall of the z_abs ~ z_em dlas we identify in corals are found towards opticallybright (b &lt; 20) qsos, there is no strong evidence (based on these limitedstatistics) that this population suffers from a severe dust bias. we compareour results with those from an optically-selected, radio-quiet qso sample inorder to determine whether there is evidence for an excess of galaxies aroundradio-loud versus radio-quiet qsos. we find that the n(z) of z_abs ~ z_em dlastowards radio-quiet qsos is in agreement with the number density of interveningabsorbers. this result, although currently limited by the small numberstatistics of our survey, supports the conclusion that radio-loud quasars arefound preferentially in rich galaxy environments at high redshift. finally, wereport that one of the new z_abs ~ z_em dlas discovered by corals has someresidual flux in the base of the lya trough which may be due to lya emission,either from star formation in the dla galaxy or from gas photoionised by theqso.

astro-ph;0205472	the abundances of nitrogen and oxygen in damped lyman alpha systems	we take a fresh look at the abundance of nitrogen in dlas with oxygenabundances between 1/10 and 1/100 of solar. this is a metallicity regime poorlysampled in the local universe and where qso absorbers may hold clues to boththe nucleosynthetic origin of n and the chemical evolution of high redshiftgalaxies. we combine new vlt uves observations with others from the literatureto form a sample of 10 dlas in which the abundances of n and of one of the twoalpha-capture elements o or s have been measured. we confirm earlier reportsthat the (n/o) ratio exhibits a larger range of values than other ratios ofheavy elements in dlas; however, all 10 dlas fall in the region of the (n/o)vs. (o/h) plot delimited by the primary and secondary levels of nitrogenproduction. our results provide empirical evidence in support of the proposalthat intermediate mass stars (with masses less than 7 solar masses) are themain source of primary nitrogen, so that its release into the ism lags behindthat of oxygen, which is produced by type ii snae. a high proportion (40%) ofthe dlas in our sample have apparently not yet attained the full primary levelof n enrichment; this finding may be an indication that the metallicity regimewe are studying preferentially picks out galaxies which have only recentlycondensed out of the igm and begun forming stars. alternatively, the delay inthe release of n following an episode of star formation may increase withdecreasing metallicity, if stars of progressively lower masses than 4 solarmasses can synthesize n in their hotter interiors.

(abridged) following our previous work on metal abundances of a double dampedly-alpha system with a line-of-sight separation ~2000 km/s (ellison &amp; lopez2001), we present vlt uves abundances of 3 new systems spanning a total of\~6000 km/s at z~2.5 toward the southern qso ctq247. these abundances aresupplemented with echelle observations of another `double' damped ly-alphasystem in the literature. we propose a definition in terms of velocity shift ofthe sub-class 'multiple damped ly-alpha system', which is motivated by itspossible connection with large-scale structure. we find that the abundanceratio alpha/fe is systematically low in multiple systems compared with singlesystems, and with a small scatter. the same behavior is found in 2 more singledla systems taken from the literature that show evidence of belonging to agalaxy group. after a careful investigation of possible sources of systematicerrors, we conclude that the low alpha/fe ratios in multiple dlas have anucleosynthetic origin. we suggest that they could be explained by reduced starformation in multiple damped ly-alpha systems, possibly due to environmentaleffects.

astro-ph;0411767	emission line abundances of absorption selected galaxies at z&lt;0.5	we have obtained optical spectra of four galaxies associated with mgii qsoabsorbers at redshifts 0.10 &lt; z &lt; 0.45. we calculate the gas-phase oxygenabundance of these galaxies using the empirical r23 strong line method. theabsolute b-band magnitudes of the galaxies span -20.6 &lt; m_b &lt; -18.3. if themetallicities lie on the r23 upper branch (8.4 &lt; log (o/h) + 12 &lt; 8.9), thenthe metallicities of these absorption selected galaxies span the range between0.5--1.4 solar and would be consistent with the well-knownluminosity-metallicity relation for 0.10 &lt; z &lt; 0.45 emission-line galaxies.however, such metallicities would be 0.5--1.0 dex higher than those observed indamped lyman alpha systems (dlas) via absorption line measurements at similarredshifts. conversely, the lower r23 branch calibration yields metallicitiesapproximately 1/7 solar, consistent with the dla absorption metallicities atlow redshifts. in this case, the absorption selected galaxies would liesignificantly lower than the luminosity-metallicity relation for emission-linegalaxies at z&lt;0.5. we discuss the implications and possible solutions for eachscenario.

astro-ph;0506180	zn and cr abundances in damped lyman alpha systems from the corals  survey	we present metal abundances in 15 damped lyman alpha systems (dlas) from thecomplete optical and radio absorption line system (corals) survey, designed tobe free from any biasing effects due to extinction of qsos by dust inintervening absorbers. it has long been suggested that such biasing may explaindifferences in metallicity between dlas and coeval luminous galaxies, andbetween model predictions and observations. we use our measured zinc andchromium abundances (combined with those for five more corals dlas from theliterature, giving us a very nearly complete sample) to test whether themetallicity and degree of dust depletion in corals dlas are significantlydifferent from those of existing, larger, samples of dlas drawn from magnitudelimited, optical surveys. we find that the column density weighted metallicityof corals dlas, [&lt;(zn/h)_dla&gt;] = -0.88 +/- 0.21 in the redshift interval 1.86 &lt;z(abs) &lt; 3.45, is only marginally higher than that of a control sample from therecent compilation by kulkarni et al., [&lt;(zn/h)_dla&gt;] = -1.09 +/- 0.10. withthe present limited statistics this difference is not highly significant.furthermore, we find no evidence for increased dust depletions in coralsdlas--their [cr/zn] ratios conform to the known trend of increasing depletion(decreasing [cr/zn]) with increasing metallicity, and we have encountered nocases where cr is as depleted as in local cold interstellar clouds. theseresults, when combined with the earlier findings of the corals survey reportedby ellison et al. in 2001, make it difficult to invoke a dust-induced bias toexplain the generally low level of chemical evolution exhibited by most dlas.rather, they indicate that large scale optical qso surveys give a fair censusof the population of high redshift absorbers.

astro-ph;0507418	the optical - infrared colors of corals qsos: searching for dust  reddening associated with high redshift damped lyman alpha systems	the presence of dust in quasar absorbers, such as damped lyman alpha (dla)systems, may cause the background qso to appear reddened. we investigate theextent of this potential reddening by comparing the optical-to-infrared (ir)colors of qsos with and without intervening absorbers. our qso sample is basedon the complete optical and radio absorption line system (corals) survey ofellison et al (2001). we have obtained near-simultaneous b and k bandmagnitudes for subset of the corals sample and supplemented our observationswith further measurements published in the literature. to account forredshift-related color changes, the b-k colors are normalized using the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) qso composite. the mean normalized b-k color of thedla sub-sample is +0.12, whereas the mean for the no-dla sample is -0.10; bothdistributions have rms scatters ~0.5. neither a student's t-test nor a ks testindicate that there is any significant difference between the two colordistributions. based on simulations which redden the colors of qsos withintervening dlas, we determine a reddening limit which corresponds to e(b-v) &lt;0.04 (smc-like extinction) at 99% confidence (3 sigma), assuming that e(b-v) isthe same for all dlas. finally, we do not find any general correlation betweenabsorber properties (such as [fe/zn] or neutral hydrogen column density) andb-k color. one of these two qsos shows evidence for strong associatedabsorption from x-ray observations, an alternative explanation for its very redcolor. we conclude that the presence of intervening galaxies causes a minimalreddening of the background qso.

astro-ph;0512210	an excess of damped lyman alpha galaxies near qsos	we present a sample of 33 damped lyman alpha systems (dlas) discovered in thesloan digital sky survey (sdss) whose absorption redshifts (z_abs) are within6000 km/s of the qso's systemic redshift (z_sys). our sample is based on 7312.5 &lt; z_sys &lt; 4.5 non-broad-absorption-line (non-bal) qsos from data release 3(dr3) of the sdss. we estimate that our search is ~100 % complete for absorberswith n(hi) &gt;= 2e20 cm^-2. the derived number density of dlas per unit redshift,n(z), within v &lt; 6000 km/s is higher (3.5 sigma significance) by almost afactor of 2 than that of intervening absorbers observed in the sdss dr3, i.e.there is evidence for an overdensity of galaxies near the qsos. this provides aphysical motivation for excluding dlas at small velocity separations in surveysof intervening 'field' dlas. in addition, we find that the overdensity ofproximate dlas is independent of the radio-loudness of the qso, consistent withthe environments of radio-loud and radio-quiet qsos being similar.

astro-ph;0601579	an efficient technique for pre-selecting low redshift damped lyman alpha  systems	the number of z ~ 1 damped lyman alpha systems (dlas, log n(hi) &gt;= 20.3) perunit redshift is approximately 0.1, making them relatively rare objects. large,blind qso surveys for low redshift dlas are therefore an expensive prospect forspace-borne uv telescopes. increasing the efficiency of these surveys bypre-selecting dla candidates based on the equivalent widths of metal absorptionlines has previously been a successful strategy. however, the success rate ofdla identification is still only ~ 35% when simple equivalent width cut-offsare applied, the majority of systems having 19.0 &lt; log n(hi)&lt;20.3. here wepropose a new way to pre-select dla candidates. our technique requireshigh-to-moderate resolution spectroscopy of the mgii 2796 transition, which iseasily accessible from the ground for 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 2.4. we define the d-index, theratio of the line's equivalent width to velocity spread and measure thisquantity for 19 dlas and 8 sub-dlas in archival spectra obtained with echellespectrographs. for the majority of absorbers, there is a clear distinctionbetween the d-index of dlas compared with sub-dlas (kolmogorov-smirnovprobability = 0.8%). based on this pilot data sample, we find that the d-indexcan select dlas with a success rate of up to 90%, an increase in selectionefficiency by a factor of 2.5 compared with a simple equivalent width cut. wetest the applicability of the d-index at lower resolution and find that itremains a good discriminant of dlas for fwhm &lt; 1.5 a. however, the recommendedd-index cut-off between dlas and sub-dlas decreases with poorer resolution andwe tabulate the appropriate d-index values that should be used with spectra ofdifferent resolutions.

astro-ph;0605471	detection of diffuse interstellar bands in the z=0.5 damped lyman alpha  system towards ao 0235+164	we report the first detection of the 5705 and 5780 a diffuse interstellarbands (dibs) in a moderate redshift damped lyman alpha (dla) system. we measurea rest frame equivalent width of 63.2 +- 8.7 ma for the 5705 and 216+-9 ma forthe 5780 a feature in the z_abs 0.524 dla towards ao 0235+164 and derive limitsfor the equivalent widths of the bands at 5797, 6284, and 6613 a. theequivalent width of the 5780 band is lower than would be expected based on thegalactic correlation of dib strength with n(hi), but is in good agreement withthe correlation with e(b-v). the relative strengths of the 5780 and 6284 a dibsare inconsistent with all galactic and extragalactic sightlines, except onesmall magellanic cloud wing sightline towards sk 143. however, the relativestrengths of the 5705 and 5780 a dibs are consistent with the galacticrelation, indicating that the relative strengths of these bands may be lesssensitive to environment or that they may be associated with a similar carrier.the detection of dibs at z~0.5 demonstrates that the organic compounds usuallyassumed to be the band carriers were already present in the universe some fivegigayears ago.

astro-ph;0607430	the metal-strong damped lyman-alpha systems	we have identified a metal-strong (logn(zn+) &gt; 13.15 or logn(si+) &gt; 15.95)dla (msdla) population from an automated quasar (qso) absorber search in thesloan digital sky survey data release 3 (sdss-dr3) quasar sample, and find thatmsdlas comprise ~5% of the entire dla population with z_abs &gt; 2.2 found in qsosightlines with r &lt; 19.5. we have also acquired 27 keck esi follow-up spectraof metal-strong candidates to evaluate our automated technique and examine themsdla candidates at higher resolution. we demonstrate that the rest equivalentwidths of strong znii 2026 and siii 1808 lines in low-resolution sdss spectraare accurate metal-strong indicators for higher-resolution spectra, and predictthe observed equivalent widths and signal-to-noise ratios needed to detectcertain extremely weak lines with high-resolution instruments. we investigatehow the msdlas may affect previous studies concerning a dust-obscuration biasand the n(hi)-weighted cosmic mean metallicity &lt;z(z)&gt;. finally, we include abrief discussion of abundance ratios in our esi sample and find that underlyingmostly type ii supernovae enrichment are differential depletion effects due todust (and in a few cases quite strong); we present here a handful of new ti andmn measurements, both of which are useful probes of depletion in dlas. futurepapers will present detailed examinations of particularly metal-strong dlasfrom high-resolution kecki/hires and vlt/uves spectra.

astro-ph;0607483	three intervening galaxy absorbers towards grb060418: faint and dusty?	we present an analysis of three strong, intervening mg ii absorption systems(z_abs = 0.603, 0.656, 1.107) towards the optical afterglow of gamma-ray burst(grb) 060418. from high resolution uves spectra we measure metal columndensities and find that the highest redshift absorber exhibits a large amountof dust depletion compared with dlas seen in qso spectra. the intervening z_abs= 1.107 absorber is also unusual in exhibiting a clear 2175 a bump, the firsttime this feature has been definitively detected in a grb spectrum. the grbafterglow spectrum is best fit with a two component extinction curve: an smcextinction law at z=1.49 (the redshift of the host) with e(b-v) = 0.07+-0.01and a galactic extinction curve at z ~ 1.1 with e(b-v) = 0.08+-0.01. we alsopresent a moderately deep ntt r-band image of the grb060418 field andspectroscopy of four galaxies within 1 arcminute. none of these objects has aredshift that matches any of the intervening absorbers, and we conclude thatthe galaxies responsible for the two intervening mg ii absorbers at z ~ 0.6have luminosities ~&lt;0.3 l^star.

astro-ph;9808017	metal abundances at z &lt; 1.5: fresh clues to the chemical enrichment  history of damped lyman alpha systems	we explore the redshift evolution of the metal content of damped lyman alphasystems (dlas) with new observations of four absorbers at z &lt; 1.5 . the mainconclusion is that the column density--weighted mean metallicity, [&lt;zn/h&gt;] =-1.03 +/- 0.23 (on a logarithmic scale), is not significantly higher at z &lt; 1.5than at earlier epochs, despite the fact that the comoving star formation ratedensity of the universe was near its maximum value at this redshift. for threeof the four dlas our observations include absorption lines of si, mn, cr, fe,and ni, as well as zn. we argue that the relative abundances of these elementsare consistent with a moderate degree of dust depletion which, once accountedfor, leaves no room for the enhancement of the alpha-elements over iron seen inmetal poor stars in the milky way. this is contrary to previous assertions thatdlas have been enriched solely by type ii supernovae, but can be understood ifthe rate of star formation in the systems studied proceeded more slowly than inthe early history of our galaxy. these results add to a growing body of dataall pointing to the conclusion that known dlas do not trace the galaxypopulation responsible for the bulk of star formation. possible reasons arethat sight-lines through metal rich gas are systematically underrepresentedbecause the background qsos are reddened, and that the most actively starforming galaxies are also the most compact, presenting too small across-section to have been probed yet with the limited statistics of currentsamples.

astro-ph;9903063	metal abundances in the lyman alpha forest	we present high s/n echelle spectra of the recently discovered ultraluminousqso apm 08279+5255 and use these data to re-examine the abundance of carbon inly alpha forest clouds. in agreement with previous work, we find thatapproximately half of the ly alpha clouds whose hydrogen column densities logn(hi) &gt; 14.5 have associated weak civ absorption with log n(civ) &gt; 12, and wederive a median n(civ)/n(h i) = 1.4 x 10^-3. we then investigate whether thereis any civ absorption in weaker ly alpha clouds with 13.5 &lt; log n(hi) &lt; 14.0.two contrasting techniques are compared - firstly by stacking individual civlines to produce a high s/n (=580) composite spectrum and secondly byconstructing pixel-by-pixel optical depth distributions, a technique recentlydeveloped by cowie &amp; songaila (1998). by simulating stacks of syntheticabsorption lines, the composite spectrum technique is found to be severelyhampered by random redshift offsets between civ lines and their correspondinghi. whilst the optical depth method showed evidence for civ asborption even athi optical depths as small as 0.5 - 2, simulations showed that even higher s/nratios are required in order to determine whether the civ/hi ratio remainsconstant at these low column densities.

0810.3008	compact groups in theory and practice - ii. comparing the observed and  predicted nature of galaxies in compact groups	we examine the properties of galaxies in compact groups identified in a mockgalaxy catalogue based upon the millennium run simulation. the overallproperties of groups identified in projection are in general agreement with thebest available observational constraints. however, only ~30% of these simulatedgroups are found to be truly compact in 3 dimensions, suggesting thatinterlopers strongly affect our observed understanding of the properties ofgalaxies in compact groups. these simulations predict that genuine compactgroup galaxies are an extremely homogeneous population, confined nearlyexclusively to the red sequence: they are best described as `red and dead'ellipticals. when interlopers are included, the population becomes much moreheterogeneous, due to bluer, star-forming, gas-rich, late-type galaxiesincorrectly identified as compact group members. these models suggest thatselection of members by redshift, such that the line-of-sight velocitydispersion of the group is less than 1000 km/s, significantly reducescontamination to the 30% level. selection of members by galaxy colour, atechnique used frequently for galaxy clusters, is also predicted todramatically reduce contamination rates for compact group studies.

0810.3700	the kinematic signature of damped lyman alpha systems: using the d-index  to screen for high column density hi absorbers	using a sample of 21 damped lyman alpha systems (dlas) and 35 sub-dlas, weevaluate the d-index = ew / delta v x 1000 from high resolution spectra of themgii lambda 2796 profile. this sample represents an increase in sub-dla d-indexstatistics by a factor of four over the sample used by ellison (2006). weinvestigate various techniques to define the velocity spread (delta v) of themgii line to determine an optimal d-index for the identification of dlas. thesuccess rate of dla identification is 50 -- 55%, depending on the velocitylimits used, improving by a few percent when the column density of feii isincluded in the d-index calculation. we recommend the set of parameters that isjudged to be most robust, have a combination of high dla identification rate(57%) and low dla miss rate (6%) and most cleanly separate the dlas andsub-dlas (kolmogorov-smirnov probability 0.5%). these statistics demonstratethat the d-index is the most efficient technique for selecting low redshift dlacandidates: 65% more efficient than selecting dlas based on the equivalentwidths of mgii and feii alone. we also investigate the effect of resolution ondetermining the n(hi) of sub-dlas. we convolve echelle spectra of sub-dla lyaprofiles with gaussians typical of the spectral resolution of instruments onthe hubble space telescope and compare the best fit n(hi) values at bothresolutions. we find that the fitted hi column density is systematicallyover-estimated by ~ 0.1 dex in the moderate resolution spectra compared to thebest fits to the original echelle spectra. this offset is due to blending ofnearby lya clouds that are included in the damping wing fit at low resolution.
