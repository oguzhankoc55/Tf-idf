0902.1175	the clustering of barred galaxies in the local universe	we study the clustering properties of barred galaxies using data from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). we compute projected redshift-space two-pointcross-correlation functions w_p(r_p) for a sample of nearly 1000 galaxies forwhich we have performed detailed structural decompositions using the methodsdescribed in gadotti (2009). the sample includes 286 barred galaxies. theclustering of barred and unbarred galaxies of similar stellar mass isindistinguishable over all the scales probed (~20kpc - 30mpc). this result alsoholds even if the sample is restricted to bars with bluer g-i colours (andhence younger ages). our result also does not change if we split our sample ofbarred galaxies according to bar-to-total luminosity ratio, bar boxyness,effective surface brightness, length, or the shape of the surface densityprofile within the bar. there is a hint that red, elliptical bars are morestrongly clustered than red and less elliptical bars, on scales &gt;~ 1 mpc,although the statistical significance is not high. we conclude that there is nosignificant evidence that bars are a product of mergers or interactions. wetentatively interpret the stronger clustering of the more elliptical bars asevidence that they are located in older galaxies, which reside in more massivehaloes.

0902.2392	estimating the h i gas fractions of galaxies in the local universe	we use a sample of 800 galaxies with h i mass measurements from the hyperledacatalogue and optical photometry from the fourth data release of the sloandigital sky survey to calibrate a new photometric estimator of the h ito-stellar mass ratio for nearby galaxies. our estimator, which is motivated bythe kennicutt-schmidt star formation law, is log(g_{hi}/s) = -1.73238(g-r) +0.215182mu_i - 4.08451, where mu_i is the i-band surface brighteness and g-r isthe optical colour estimated from the g- and r-band petrosian apparentagnitudes. this estimator has a scatter of sigma = 0.31 dex in log(g_{hi}/s),compared to sigma ~ 0.4 dex for previous estimators that were based on colouralone. we investigate whether the residuals in our estimate of log(g_{hi}/s)depend in a systematic way on a variety of different galaxy properties. we findno effect as a function of stellar mass or 4000a break strength, but there is asystematic effect as a function of the concentration index of the light. wethen apply our estimator to a sample of 10^5 emission-line galaxies in the sdssdr4 and derive an estimate of the h i mass function, which is in excellentagreement with recent results from h i blind surveys. finally, we re-examinethe well-known relation between gas-phase metallicity and stellar mass and askwhether there is a dependence on h i-to-stellar mass ratio, as predicted bychemical evolution models. we do find that gas-poor galaxies are more metalrich at fixed stellar mass. we compare our results with the semi-analyticmodels of de lucia &amp; blaizot, which include supernova feedback, as well as thecosmological infall of gas.

0903.3404	understanding the astrophysics of galaxy evolution: the role of  spectroscopic surveys in the next decade	over the last decade optical spectroscopic surveys have characterized the lowredshift galaxy population and uncovered populations of star-forming galaxiesback to z ~ 7. this work has shown that the primary epoch of galaxy buildingand black hole growth occurs at redshifts of 2 to 3. the establishment of theconcordance lcdm cosmology shifted the focus of galaxy population studies fromconstraining cosmological parameters to characterizing the processes whichregulate the formation and evolution of galaxies.in the next decade, highredshift observers will attempt to formulate a coherent evolutionary pictureconnecting galaxies in the high redshift universe to galaxies today. in orderto link galaxy populations at different redshifts, we must not onlycharacterize their evolution in a systematic way, we must establish whichphysical processes are responsible for it. considerable progress has alreadybeen made in understanding how galaxies evolved from z ~ 1 to the present day.large spectroscopic surveys in the near infrared are required to push thesestudies back towards the main epoch of galaxy building. only then will weunderstand the full story of the formation of l* galaxies like our own milkyway. a large near-ir spectroscopic survey will also provide the calibrationneeded to avoid systematics in the large photometric programs proposed to studythe nature of dark matter and dark energy. we provide an outline design for amulti-object 0.4 to 1.8 micron spectrograph, which could be placed on anexisting telescope, and which would allow a full characterization of the galaxypopulation out to z ~ 2. we strongly recommend a serious further study todesign a real instrument, which will be required for galaxy formation studiesto advance to the next frontier.

0706.3113	bursty stellar populations and obscured agn in galaxy bulges	[abridged] we investigate trends between the recent star formation historyand black hole growth in galaxy bulges in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss).the galaxies lie at 0.01&lt;z&lt;0.07 where the fibre aperture covers only thecentral 0.6-4.0kpc diameter of the galaxy. we find strong trends between blackhole growth, as measured by dust-attenuation-corrected oiii luminosity, and therecent star formation history of the bulges. we conclude that our resultssupport the popular hypothesis for black hole growth occurring through gasinflow into the central regions of galaxies, followed by a starburst andtriggering of the agn. however, while this is a significant pathway for thegrowth of black holes, it is not the dominant one in the present-day universe.more unspectacular processes are apparently responsible for the majority ofthis growth.  in order to arrive at these conclusions we have developed a set of new highsignal-to-noise ratio (snr) optical spectral indicators, designed to allow adetailed study of stellar populations which have undergone recent enhanced starformation. working in the rest-frame wavelength range 3750-4150aa, ideallysuited to many recent and ongoing spectroscopic surveys at low and highredshift, the first two indices are equivalent to the previously well studied4000aa break strength and hdelta equivalent width. the primary advantage ofthis new method is a greatly improved snr for the latter index, allowing thepresent study to use spectra with snr-per-pixel as low as 8.

0909.1196	the uv-optical colours of brightest cluster galaxies in optically and  x-ray selected clusters	many brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) at the centers of x-ray selectedclusters exhibit clear evidence for recent star formation. however, studies ofbcgs in optically-selected clusters show that star formation is not enhancedwhen compared to control samples of non-bcgs of similar stellar mass. here weanalyze a sample of 113 bcgs in low redshift (z&lt;0.1), optically-selectedclusters, a matched control sample of non-bcgs, and a smaller sample of bcgs inx-ray selected clusters. we convolve the sdss images of the bcgs to match theresolution of the galex data and we measure uv-optical colours in their innerand outer regions. we find that optically-selected bcgs exhibit smaller scatterin optical colours and redder inner nuv-r colours than the control galaxies,indicating that they are a homogenous population with very little ongoing starformation. the bcgs in the x-ray selected cluster sample span a similar rangein optical colours, but have bluer nuv-r colours. among x-ray selected bcgs,those located in clusters with central cooling times of less than 1 gyr aresignificantly bluer than those located in clusters where the central gascooling times are long. our main conclusion is that the location of a galaxy atthe centre of its halo is not sufficient to determine whether or not it iscurrently forming stars. one must also have information about the thermodynamicstate of the gas in the core of the halo.

0909.3522	star formation and agn activity in sdss cluster galaxies	we investigate the recent and current star formation activity of galaxies asfunction of distance from the cluster center in a sample of 521 sdss clustersat z&lt;0.1. we show that when the bcgs are excluded from the galaxy sample, thereis no evidence for mass segregation in the clusters, so that differences incluster and field populations cannot simply be attributed to different massfunctions. we find a marked star formation-radius relation in that almost allgalaxies in the cluster core are quiescent, i.e. have terminated star formationa few gyr ago. this star formation-radius relation is most pronounced forlow-mass galaxies and is very weak or absent beyond the virial radius. thetypical star formation rate of non-quiescent galaxies declines by approximatelya factor of two towards the cluster center. however, the fraction of galaxieswith young stellar populations indicating a recently completed starburst or atruncation of star formation does not vary significantly with radius. thefraction of star-forming galaxies which host a powerful optical agn is alsoindependent of clustercentric radius, indicating that the link between starformation and agn in these galaxies operates independent of environment. thefraction of red galaxies which host a weak optical agn decreases, however,towards the cluster center, with a similar timescale as the decline of starforming galaxies. our results favor a scenario in which star formation isquenched slowly, on timescales similar to the cluster crossing time, and ruleout significant contributions from more violent processes at least beyondcluster radii &gt;0.1 r_200.

0910.3667	clustering of radio galaxies and quasars	we compute the cross-correlation between a sample of 14,000 radio-loud agn(rlagn) with redshifts between 0.4 and 0.8 selected from the sloan digital skysurvey and a reference sample of 1.2 million luminous red galaxies in the sameredshift range. we quantify how the clustering of radio-loud agn depends onhost galaxy mass and on radio luminosity. radio-loud agn are clustered morestrongly on all scales than control samples of radio-quiet galaxies with thesame stellar masses and redshifts, but the differences are largest on scalesless than 1 mpc. in addition, the clustering amplitude of the rlagn variessignificantly with radio luminosity on scales less than 1 mpc. this proves thatthe gaseous environment of a galaxy on the scale of its dark matter halo, playsa key role in determining not only the probability that a galaxy is radio-loudagn, but also the total luminosity of the radio jet. next, we compare theclustering of radio galaxies with that of radio-loud quasars in the sameredshift range. unified models predict that both types of active nuclei shouldcluster in the same way. our data show that most rlagn are clustered morestrongly than radio-loud qsos, even when the agn and qso samples are matched inboth black hole mass and radio luminosity. only the most extreme rlagn andrlqsos in our sample, with radio luminosities in excess of 10^26 w/hz, havesimilar clustering properties. the majority of the strongly evolving rlagnpopulation at z~0.5 are found in different environments to the quasars, andhence must be triggered by a different physical mechanism.

0912.1610	the galex arecibo sdss survey. i. gas fraction scaling relations of  massive galaxies and first data release	we introduce the galex arecibo sdss survey (gass), an on-going large programthat is gathering high quality hi-line spectra using the arecibo radiotelescope for an unbiased sample of ~1000 galaxies with stellar masses greaterthan 10^10 msun and redshifts 0.025&lt;z&lt;0.05, selected from the sdssspectroscopic and galex imaging surveys. the galaxies are observed untildetected or until a low gas mass fraction limit (1.5-5%) is reached. this paperpresents the first data release, consisting of ~20% of the final gass sample.we use this data set to explore the main scaling relations of hi gas fractionwith galaxy structure and nuv-r colour. a large fraction (~60%) of the galaxiesin our sample are detected in hi. we find that the atomic gas fractiondecreases strongly with stellar mass, stellar surface mass density and nuv-rcolour, but is only weakly correlated with galaxy bulge-to-disk ratio (asmeasured by the concentration index of the r-band light). we also find that thefraction of galaxies with significant (more than a few percent) hi decreasessharply above a characteristic stellar surface mass density of 10^8.5 msunkpc^-2. the fraction of gas-rich galaxies decreases much more smoothly withstellar mass. one of the key goals of gass is to identify and quantify theincidence of galaxies that are transitioning between the blue, star-formingcloud and the red sequence of passively-evolving galaxies. likely transitioncandidates can be identified as outliers from the mean scaling relationsbetween gas fraction and other galaxy properties.

0912.2741	cluster galaxies die hard	we investigate how the specific star formation rates of galaxies of differentmasses depend on cluster-centric radius and on the central/satellite dichotomyin both field and cluster environments. recent data from a variety of sources,including the cluster catalogue of von der linden et al. are compared to thesemi-analytic models of de lucia &amp; blaizot. we find that these models predicttoo many passive satellite galaxies in clusters, too few passive centralgalaxies with low stellar masses, and too many passive central galaxies withhigh masses. we then outline a series of modifications to the model necessaryto solve these problems: a) instead of instantaneous stripping of the externalgas reservoir after a galaxy becomes a satellite, the gas supply is assumed todecrease at the same rate that the surrounding halo loses mass due to tidalstripping, b) the agn feedback efficiency is lowered to bring the fraction ofmassive passive centrals in better agreement with the data. we also allow forradio mode agn feedback in satellite galaxies. c) we assume that satellitegalaxies residing in host haloes with masses below 10^12 m_sun do not undergoany stripping. we highlight the fact that in low mass galaxies, the externalreservoir is composed primarily of gas that has been expelled from the galacticdisk by supernovae driven winds. this gas must remain available as a futurereservoir for star formation, even in satellite galaxies. finally, we present asimple recipe for the stripping of gas and dark matter in satellites that canbe used in models where subhalo evolution is not followed in detail.

1003.5425	absorption-line probes of the prevalence and properties of outflows in  present-day star-forming galaxies	we analyze star forming galaxies drawn from sdss dr7 to show how theinterstellar medium (ism) na i 5890, 5896 (na d) absorption lines depend ongalaxy physical properties, and to look for evidence of galactic winds. wecombine the spectra of galaxies with similar geometry/physical parameters tocreate composite spectra with signal-to-noise ~300. the stellar continuum ismodeled using stellar population synthesis models, and the continuum-normalizedspectrum is fit with two na i absorption components. we find that: (1) ism na dabsorption lines with equivalent widths ew &gt; 0.8a are only prevalent in diskgalaxies with specific properties -- large extinction (av), high star formationrates (sfr), high star formation rate per unit area ($\sigma_{\rm sfr}$), orhigh stellar mass (m*). (2) the ism na d absorption lines can be separated intotwo components: a quiescent disk-like component at the galaxy systemic velocityand an outflow component; (3) the disk-like component is much stronger in theedge-on systems, and the outflow component covers a wide angle but is strongerwithin 60deg of the disk rotation axis; (4) the ew and covering factor of thedisk component correlate strongly with dust attenuation, highlighting theimportance that dust shielding may play the survival of na i. (5) the ew of theoutflow component depends primarily on $\sigma_{\rm sfr}$ and secondarily onav; (6) the outflow velocity varies from ~120 to 160km/s but shows little hintof a correlation with galaxy physical properties over the modest dynamic rangethat our sample probes (1.2 dex in log$\sigma_{\rm sfr}$ and 1 dex in log m*).

1004.2325	the atomic to molecular transition and its relation to the scaling  properties of galaxy disks in the local universe	we extend existing semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to track atomicand molecular gas in disk galaxies. simple recipes for processes such ascooling, star formation, supernova feedback, and chemical enrichment of thestars and gas are grafted on to dark matter halo merger trees derived from themillennium simulation. each galactic disk is represented by a series ofconcentric rings. we assume that surface density profile of infalling gas in adark matter halo is exponential, with scale radius r_d that is proportional tothe virial radius of the halo times its spin parameter $\lambda$. as the darkmatter haloes grow through mergers and accretion, disk galaxies assemble fromthe inside out. we include two simple prescriptions for molecular gas formationprocesses in our models: one is based on the analytic calculations by krumholz,mckee &amp; tumlinson (2008), and the other is a prescription where the h_2fraction is determined by the kinematic pressure of the ism. motivated by theobservational results of leroy et al. (2008), we adopt a star formation law inwhich $\sigma_{sfr}\propto\sigma_{h_2}$ in the regime where the molecular gasdominates the total gas surface density, and $\sigma_{sfr}\propto\sigma_{gas}^2$ where atomic hydrogen dominates. we then fit these models tothe radial surface density profiles of stars, hi and h_2 drawn from recent highresolution surveys of stars and gas in nearby galaxies. we explore how theratios of atomic gas, molecular gas and stellar mass vary as a function ofglobal galaxy scale parameters, including stellar mass, stellar surfacedensity, and gas surface density. we elucidate how the trends can be understoodin terms of three variables that determine the partition of baryons in disks:the mass of the dark matter halo, the spin parameter of the halo, and theamount of gas recently accreted from the external environment.

1005.1825	the accretion of gas onto galaxies as traced by their satellites	we have compiled a large sample of isolated central galaxies from the sloandigital sky survey, which do not have a neighbour of comparable brightnesswithin a projected distance of 1 mpc. we use the colours, luminosities andsurface brightnesses of satellite galaxies in the vicinity of these objects toestimate their atomic gas content and to derive the average total mass of higas contained in satellites as a function of projected radius from the primary.recent calibrations of merging timescales from n-body simulations are used toestimate the rate at which this gas will accrete onto the primaries. ourestimated accretion rates fall short of those needed to maintain the observedlevel of star formation in these systems by nearly two orders of magnitude.nevertheless, there are strong correlations between the total mass of gas insatellites and the colours and specific star formation rates of centralgalaxies of all stellar masses. the correlations are much weaker if we considerthe total stellar mass in the satellites, rather than their total gas mass. weask why star formation in the central galaxies should be correlated with gascontained in satellites at projected separations of a mpc or more, well outsidethe virial radius of the dark matter halos of these systems. we suggest thatgas-rich satellites trace an underlying reservoir of ionized gas that isaccreted continuously, and that provides the fuel for ongoing star formation ingalaxies in the local universe.

1006.0106	from dwarf spheroidals to cds: simulating the galaxy population in a  lcdm cosmology	we apply updated semi-analytic galaxy formation models simultaneously to thestored halo/subhalo merger trees of the millennium and millennium-iisimulations. these differ by a factor of 125 in mass resolution, allowingexplicit testing of resolution effects on predicted galaxy properties. we haverevised the treatments of the transition between the rapid infall and coolingflow regimes of gas accretion, of the sizes of bulges and of gaseous andstellar disks, of supernova feedback, of the transition between central andsatellite status as galaxies fall into larger systems, and of gas and starstripping once they become satellites. plausible values of efficiency andscaling parameters yield an excellent fit not only to the observed abundance oflow-redshift galaxies over 5 orders of magnitude in stellar mass and 9magnitudes in luminosity, but also to the observed abundance of milky waysatellites. this suggests that reionisation effects may not be needed to solvethe "missing satellite" problem except, perhaps, for the faintest objects. thesame model matches the observed large-scale clustering of galaxies as afunction of stellar mass and colour. the fit remains excellent down to ~30kpcfor massive galaxies. for m* &lt; 6 x 10^10msun, however, the model overpredictsclustering at scales below 1 mpc, suggesting that the sigma_8 adopted in thesimulations (0.9) is too high. galaxy distributions within rich clusters agreebetween the simulations and match those observed, but only if galaxies withoutdark matter subhalos (so-called orphans) are included. our model predicts alarger passive fraction among low-mass galaxies than is observed, as well as anoverabundance of ~10^10msun galaxies beyond z~0.6, reflecting deficiencies inthe way star-formation rates are modelled.

1006.5447	the galex arecibo sdss survey ii: the star formation efficiency of  massive galaxies	we use measurements of the hi content, stellar mass and star formation ratesin ~190 massive galaxies with stellar masses greater than 10^10 msun, obtainedfrom the galex arecibo sdss survey (gass) described in paper i (catinella etal. 2010) to explore the global scaling relations associated with thebin-averaged ratio of the star formation rate over the hi mass, which we callthe hi-based star formation efficiency (sfe). unlike the mean specific starformation rate, which decreases with stellar mass and stellar mass surfacedensity, the star formation efficiency remains relatively constant across thesample with a value close to sfe = 10^-9.5 yr^-1 (or an equivalent gasconsumption timescale of ~3 gyr). specifically, we find little variation in sfewith stellar mass, stellar mass surface density, nuv-r color and concentration.we interpret these results as an indication that external processes or feedbackmechanisms that control the gas supply are important for regulating starformation in massive galaxies. an investigation into the detailed distributionof sfes reveals that approximately 5% of the sample shows high efficiencieswith sfe &gt; 10^-9 yr^-1, and we suggest that this is very likely due to adeficiency of cold gas rather than an excess star formation rate. conversely,we also find a similar fraction of galaxies that appear to be gas-rich fortheir given specific star-formation rate, although these galaxies show both ahigher than average gas fraction and lower than average specific star formationrate. both of these populations are plausible candidates for "transition"galaxies, showing potential for a change (either decrease or increase) in theirspecific star formation rate in the near future. we also find that 36+/-5% ofthe total hi mass density and 47+/-5% of the total sfr density is found ingalaxies with stellar mass greater than 10^10 msun.

1007.3272	ugc8802: a massive disk galaxy in formation	we report new observations of the galaxy ugc8802 obtained through gass, thegalex arecibo sdss survey, which show this galaxy to be in a remarkableevolutionary state. ugc8802 (gass35981) is a disk galaxy with stellar massm*=2x10^10 msolar which appears to contain an additional 2.1x10^10 msolar of higas. new millimeter observations with the iram 30m telescope indicate amolecular gas mass only a tenth this large. using deep long-slit spectroscopy,we examine the spatially resolved star formation rate and metallicity profilesof gass35981 for clues to its history. we find that the star formation surfacedensity in this galaxy is low (sigma_sfr=0.003 msolar/yr/kpc^2) and that thestar formation is spread remarkably evenly across the galaxy. the low moleculargas masses measured in our three iram pointings are largely consistent with thetotal star formation measured within the same apertures. our mmt long-slitspectrum reveals a sharp drop in metallicity in the outer disk of gass35981.the ratio of current star formation rate to existing stellar mass surfacedensity in the outer disk is extremely high, implying that all the stars musthave formed within the past ~1gyr. at current star formation rates, however,gass35981 will not consume its hi reservoir for another 5-7 gyr. despite itsexceptionally large gas fraction for a galaxy this massive, gass35981 has aregular rotation curve and exhibits no sign of a recent interaction or merger.we speculate that gass35981 may have acquired its gas directly from theinter-galactic medium, and that it and other similar galaxies identified in thegass survey may provide rare local glimpses of gas accretion processes thatwere more common during the prime epoch of disk galaxy formation at z~1.

1009.4309	alfalfa hi data stacking i. does the bulge quench ongoing star formation  in early-type galaxies?	we have carried out an hi stacking analysis of a volume-limited sample of~5000 galaxies with imaging and spectroscopic data from galex and the sloandigital sky survey, which lie within the current footprint of the arecibolegacy fast alfa (alfalfa) survey. our galaxies are selected to have stellarmasses greater than 10^10 msun and redshifts in the range 0.025&lt;z&lt;0.05. weextract a sub-sample of 1833 "early-type" galaxies with inclinations less than70deg, with concentration indices c&gt;2.6 and with light profiles that are wellfit by a de vaucouleurs model. we then stack hi line spectra extracted from thealfalfa data cubes at the 3-d positions of the galaxies from these two samplesin bins of stellar mass, stellar mass surface density, central velocitydispersion, and nuv-r colour. we use the stacked spectra to estimate theaverage hi gas fractions m_hi/m_* of the galaxies in each bin.  our main result is that the hi content of a galaxy is not influenced by itsbulge. the average hi gas fractions of galaxies in both our samples correlatemost strongly with nuv-r colour and with stellar surface density. the relationbetween average hi fraction and these two parameters is independent ofconcentration index c. we have tested whether the average hi gas content ofbulge-dominated galaxies on the red sequence, differs from that of late-typegalaxies on the red sequence. we find no evidence that galaxies with asignificant bulge component are less efficient at turning their available gasreservoirs into stars. this result is in contradiction with the "morphologicalquenching" scenario proposed by martig et al.

1011.0829	the galex arecibo sdss survey: iii. evidence for the inside-out  formation of galactic disks	we analyze a sample of galaxies with stellar masses greater than $10^{10}m_{\odot}$ and with redshifts in the range $0.025&lt;z&lt;0.05$ for which hi massmeasurements are available from the galex arecibo sdss survey (gass) or fromthe arecibo legacy fast alfa survey (alfalfa). at a given value of $m_*$, oursample consists primarily of galaxies that are more hi-rich than average. weconstructed a series of three control samples for comparison with these hi-richgalaxies. as expected, hi-rich galaxies differ strongly from galaxies of samestellar mass that are selected without regard to hi content. the majority ofthese differences are attributable to the fact that galaxies with more gas arebluer and more actively star-forming. in order to identify those galaxyproperties that are causally connected with hi content, we compare resultsderived for the hi sample with those derived for galaxies matched in stellarmass, size and nuv-$r$ colour. the only photometric property that is clearlyattributable to increasing hi content, is the colour gradient of the galaxy.galaxies with larger hi fractions have bluer, more actively star-forming outerdisks compared to the inner part of the galaxy. hi-rich galaxies also havelarger $g$-band radii compared to $i$-band radii. our results are consistentwith the "inside-out" picture of disk galaxy formation, which has commonlyserved as a basis for semi-analytic models of the formation of disks in thecontext of cold dark matter cosmologies. the lack of any intrinsic connectionbetween hi fraction and galaxy asymmetry suggests that gas is accreted smoothlyonto the outer disk.

1101.4219	extreme feedback and the epoch of reionization: clues in the local  universe	the source responsible for reionizing the universe at z &gt; 6 remainsuncertain. while an energetically adequate population of star-forming galaxiesmay be in place, it is unknown whether a large enough fraction of theirionizing radiation can escape into the intergalactic medium. attempts tomeasure this escape-fraction in intensely star-forming galaxies at lowerredshifts have largely yielded upper limits. in this paper we present new hstcos and archival fuse far-uv spectroscopy of a sample of eleven lyman breakanalogs (lbas), a rare population of local galaxies that strongly resemble thehigh-z lyman break galaxies. we combine these data with sdss optical spectraand spitzer photometry. we also analyze archival fuse observations of fifteentypical uv-bright local starbursts. we find evidence of small covering factorsfor optically-thick neutral gas in 3 cases. this is based on two independentpieces of evidence: a significant residual intensity in the cores of thestrongest interstellar absorption-lines tracing neutral gas and a small ratioof extinction-corrected h-alpha to uv plus far-ir luminosities. these objectsrepresent three of the four lbas that contain a young, very compact (~100pc),and highly massive (~10^9 mo) dominant central object (dco). these threeobjects also differ from the other galaxies in showing a significant amount ofblueshifted ly-alpha emission, which may be related to the low covering factorof neutral gas. all four lbas with dcos in our sample show extremely highvelocity outflows of interstellar gas, with line centroids blueshifted by about700km/s and maximum outflow velocities reaching at least 1500km/s. we show thatthese properties are consistent with an outflow driven by a powerful starburstthat is exceptionally compact. we speculate that such extreme feedback may berequired to enable the escape of ionizing radiation from star forming galaxies.

1103.1642	cold gass, an iram legacy survey of molecular gas in massive galaxies:  i. relations between h2, hi, stellar content and structural properties	we are conducting cold gass, a legacy survey for molecular gas in nearbygalaxies. using the iram 30m telescope, we measure the co(1-0) line in a sampleof ~350 nearby (d=100-200 mpc), massive galaxies (log(m*/msun)&gt;10.0). thesample is selected purely according to stellar mass, and therefore provides anunbiased view of molecular gas in these systems. by combining the iram datawith sdss photometry and spectroscopy, galex imaging and high-quality arecibohi data, we investigate the partition of condensed baryons between stars,atomic gas and molecular gas in 0.1-10l* galaxies. in this paper, we present columinosities and molecular hydrogen masses for the first 222 galaxies. theoverall co detection rate is 54%, but our survey also uncovers the existence ofsharp thresholds in galaxy structural parameters such as stellar mass surfacedensity and concentration index, below which all galaxies have a measurablecold gas component but above which the detection rate of the co line dropssuddenly. the mean molecular gas fraction mh2/m* of the co detections is0.066+/-0.039, and this fraction does not depend on stellar mass, but is astrong function of nuv-r colour. through stacking, we set a firm upper limit ofmh2/m*=0.0016+/-0.0005 for red galaxies with nuv-r&gt;5.0. the averagemolecular-to-atomic hydrogen ratio in present-day galaxies is 0.3, withsignificant scatter from one galaxy to the next. the existence of strongdetection thresholds in both the hi and co lines suggests that "quenching"processes have occurred in these systems. intriguingly, atomic gas stronglydominates in the minority of galaxies with significant cold gas that lie abovethese thresholds. this suggests that some re-accretion of gas may still bepossible following the quenching event.

0709.2911	radio jets in galaxies with actively accreting black holes: new insights  from the sdss	the majority of nearby radio-loud agn are found in massive, old ellipticalgalaxies with weak emission lines. at high redshifts,however, most known radioagn have strong emission lines. in this paper, we examine a subset of radio agnwith emission lines selected from the sloan digital sky survey. the probabilityfor a nearby radio agn to have emission lines is a strongly decreasing functionof galaxy mass and an increasing function of radio luminosity above 10^25 w/hz.emission line and radio luminosities are correlated, but with large dispersion.at a given radio power, agn with small black holes have higher [oiii]luminosities (which we interpret as higher accretion rates) than agn with bigblack holes. however, if we scale both radio and emission line luminosities bythe black hole mass, we find a correlation between normalized radio power andaccretion rate in eddington units that is independent of black hole mass. thereis also a clear correlation between normalized radio power and the age of thestellar population in the galaxy. present-day agn with the highest normalizedradio powers are confined to galaxies with small black holes. high-redshift,high radio-luminosity agn could be explained if big black holes were similarlyactive at earlier cosmic epochs. to investigate why only a small fraction ofemission line agn become radio loud, we create matched samples of radio-loudand radio-quiet agn and compare their host galaxy properties and environments.the main difference lies in their environments; our local density estimates area factor 2 larger around the radio-loud agn. we propose a scenario in whichradio-loud agn with emission lines are located in galaxies where accretion ofboth cold and hot gas can occur simultaneously.

1104.0019	cold gass, an iram legacy survey of molecular gas in massive galaxies:  ii. the non-universality of the molecular gas depletion timescale	we study the relation between molecular gas and star formation in avolume-limited sample of 222 galaxies from the cold gass survey, withmeasurements of the co(1-0) line from the iram 30m telescope. the galaxies areat redshifts 0.025&lt;z&lt;0.05 and have stellar masses in the range10.0&lt;log(m*/msun)&lt;11.5. the iram measurements are complemented by deep arecibohi observations and homogeneous sdss and galex photometry. a reference samplethat includes both uv and far-ir data is used to calibrate our estimates ofstar formation rates from the seven optical/uv bands. the mean molecular gasdepletion timescale, tdep(h2), for all the galaxies in our sample is 1 gyr,however tdep(h2) increases by a factor of 6 from a value of ~0.5 gyr forgalaxies with stellar masses of 10^10 msun to ~3 gyr for galaxies with massesof a few times 10^11 msun. in contrast, the atomic gas depletion timescaleremains contant at a value of around 3 gyr. this implies that in high massgalaxies, molecular and atomic gas depletion timescales are comparable, but inlow mass galaxies, molecular gas is being consumed much more quickly thanatomic gas. the strongest dependences of tdep(h2) are on the stellar mass ofthe galaxy (parameterized as log tdep(h2)= (0.36+/-0.07)(log m* -10.70)+(9.03+/-0.99)), and on the specific star formation rate. a singletdep(h2) versus ssfr relation is able to fit both "normal" star-forminggalaxies in our cold gass sample, as well as more extreme starburst galaxies(lirgs and ulirgs), which have tdep(h2) &lt; 10^8 yr. normal galaxies at z=1-2 aredisplaced with respect to the local galaxy population in the tdep(h2) versusssfr plane and have molecular gas depletion times that are a factor of 3-5times longer at a given value of ssfr due to their significantly larger gasfractions.

0709.3304	hst morphologies of local lyman break galaxy analogs i: evidence for  starbursts triggered by merging	heckman et al. (2005) used the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) uv imagingsurvey to show that there exists a rare population of nearby compactuv-luminous galaxies (uvlgs) that closely resembles high redshift lyman breakgalaxies (lbgs). we present hst images in the uv, optical, and ha, andresimulate them at the depth and resolution of the goods/udf fields to showthat the morphologies of uvlgs are also similar to those of lbgs. our sample of8 lbg analogs thus provides detailed insight into the connection between starformation and lbg morphology. faint tidal features or companions can be seen inall of the rest-frame optical images, suggesting that the starbursts are theresult of a merger or interaction. the uv/optical light is dominated byunresolved (~100-300 pc) super starburst regions (ssbs). a detailed comparisonwith the galaxies haro 11 and vv 114 at z=0.02 indicates that the ssbsthemselves consist of diffuse stars and (super) star clusters. the structuralfeatures revealed by the new hst images occur on very small physical scales andare thus not detectable in images of high redshift lbgs, except in a few caseswhere they are magnified by gravitational lensing. we propose, therefore, thatlbgs are mergers of gas-rich, relatively low-mass (~10^10 msun) systems, andthat the mergers trigger the formation of ssbs. if galaxies at high redshiftsare dominated by ssbs, then the faint end slope of the luminosity function ispredicted to have slope alpha~2. our results are the most direct confirmationto date of models that predict that the main mode of star formation in theearly universe was highly collisional.

1105.3880	autocorrelations of stellar light and mass at z~0 and ~1: from sdss to  deep2	we present measurements of projected autocorrelation functions w_p(r_p) forthe stellar mass of galaxies and for their light in the u, b and v bands, usingdata from the third data release of the deep2 galaxy redshift survey and thefinal data release of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we investigate theclustering bias of stellar mass and light by comparing these to projectedautocorrelations of dark matter estimated from the millennium simulations (ms)at z=1 and 0.07, the median redshifts of our galaxy samples. all of theautocorrelation and bias functions show systematic trends with spatial scaleand waveband which are impressively similar at the two redshifts. this showsthat the well-established environmental dependence of stellar populations inthe local universe is already in place at z=1. the recent ms-based galaxyformation simulation of guo et al. (2011) reproduces the scale-dependentclustering of luminosity to an accuracy better than 30% in all bands and atboth redshifts, but substantially overpredicts mass autocorrelations atseparations below about 2 mpc. further comparison of the shapes of our stellarmass bias functions with those predicted by the model suggests that both thesdss and deep2 data prefer a fluctuation amplitude of sigma_8 0.8 rather thanthe sigma_8=0.9 assumed by the ms.

0710.0589	the lopsidedness of present-day galaxies: results from the sloan digital  sky survey	large-scale asymmetries in the stellar mass distribution in galaxies arebelieved to trace non-equilibrium situations in the luminous and/or dark mattercomponent. these may arise in the aftermath of events like mergers, accretion,and tidal interactions. these events are key in the evolution of galaxies. inthis paper we quantify the large-scale lopsidedness of light distributions in25155 galaxies at z &lt; 0.06 from the sloan digital sky survey data release 4using the m = 1 azimuthal fourier mode. we show that the lopsided distributionof light is primarily due to a corresponding lopsidedness in the stellar massdistribution. observational effects, such as seeing, poisson noise, andinclination, introduce only small errors in lopsidedness for the majority ofthis sample. we find that lopsidedness correlates strongly with other basicgalaxy structural parameters: galaxies with low concentration, stellar mass,and stellar surface mass density tend to be lopsided, while galaxies with highconcentration, mass, and density are not. we find that the strongest and mostfundamental relationship between lopsidedness and the other structuralparameters is with the surface mass density. we also find, in agreement withprevious studies, that lopsidedness tends to increase with radius. both theseresults may be understood as a consequence of several factors. the outerregions of galaxies and low-density galaxies are more susceptible to tidalperturbations, and they also have longer dynamical times (so lopsidedness willlast longer). they are also more likely to be affected by any underlyingasymmetries in the dark matter halo.

1107.3145	the relation between metallicity, stellar mass and star formation in  galaxies: an analysis of observational and model data	we study relations between stellar mass, star formation and gas-phasemetallicity in a sample of 177,071 unique emission line galaxies from thesdss-dr7, as well as in a sample of 43,767 star forming galaxies at z=0 fromthe cosmological semi-analytic model l-galaxies. we demonstrate thatmetallicity is dependent on star formation rate at fixed mass, but that thetrend is opposite for low and for high mass galaxies. low-mass galaxies thatare actively forming stars are more metal-poor than quiescent low-massgalaxies. high-mass galaxies, on the other hand, have lower gas-phasemetallicities if their star formation rates are small. remarkably, the sametrends are found for our sample of model galaxies. we find that massive modelgalaxies with low gas-phase metallicities have undergone a gas-rich merger inthe past, inducing a starburst which exhausted their cold gas reservoirs andshut down star formation. this led to a gradual dilution in the gas-phasemetallicities of these systems via accretion of gas. these model galaxies havelower-than-average gas-to-stellar mass ratios and higher-than-average centralblack hole masses. we confirm that massive galaxies with low gas-phasemetallicities in our observational sample also have very massive black holes.we propose that accretion may therefore play a significant role in regulatingthe gas-phase metallicities of present-day massive galaxies.

1108.4719	evolution of the most massive galaxies to z=0.6: i. a new method for  physical parameter estimation	we use principal component analysis (pca) to estimate stellar masses, meanstellar ages, star formation histories (sfhs), dust extinctions and stellarvelocity dispersions for ~290,000 galaxies with stellar masses greater than$10^{11}msun and redshifts in the range 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.7 from the baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (boss). we find the fraction of galaxies with active starformation first declines with increasing stellar mass, but then flattens abovea stellar mass of 10^{11.5}msun at z~0.6. this is in striking contrast toz~0.1, where the fraction of galaxies with active star formation declinesmonotonically with stellar mass. at stellar masses of 10^{12}msun, therefore,the evolution in the fraction of star-forming galaxies from z~0.6 to thepresent-day reaches a factor of ~10. when we stack the spectra of the mostmassive, star-forming galaxies at z~0.6, we find that half of their [oiii]emission is produced by agns. the black holes in these galaxies are accretingon average at ~0.01 the eddington rate. to obtain these results, we use thestellar population synthesis models of bruzual &amp; charlot (2003) to generate alibrary of model spectra with a broad range of sfhs, metallicities, dustextinctions and stellar velocity dispersions. the pca is run on this library toidentify its principal components over the rest-frame wavelength range3700-5500a. we demonstrate that linear combinations of these components canrecover information equivalent to traditional spectral indices such as the4000a break strength and hda, with greatly improved s/n. this method is able torecover physical parameters such as stellar mass-to-light ratio, mean stellarage, velocity dispersion and dust extinction from the relatively low s/n bossspectra. we examine the sensitivity of our stellar mass estimates to the inputparameters in our model library and the different stellar population synthesismodels.

1110.4226	the galex arecibo sdss survey. iv. baryonic mass-velocity-size relations  of massive galaxies	we present dynamical scaling relations for a homogeneous and representativesample of ~500 massive galaxies, selected only by stellar mass (&gt;10^10 msun)and redshift (0.025&lt;z&lt;0.05) as part of the ongoing galex arecibo sdss survey.we compare baryonic tully-fisher (btf) and faber-jackson (bfj) relations forthis sample, and investigate how galaxies scatter around the best fits obtainedfor pruned subsets of disk-dominated and bulge-dominated systems. the bfjrelation is significantly less scattered than the btf when the relations areapplied to their maximum samples, and is not affected by the inclinationproblems that plague the btf. disk-dominated, gas-rich galaxies systematicallydeviate from the bfj relation defined by the spheroids. we demonstrate that byapplying a simple correction to the stellar velocity dispersions that dependsonly on the concentration index of the galaxy, we are able to bring disks andspheroids onto the same dynamical relation -- in other words, we obtain ageneralized bfj relation that holds for all the galaxies in our sample,regardless of morphology, inclination or gas content, and has a scatter smallerthan 0.1 dex. we find that disks and spheroids are offset in the stellardispersion-size relation, and that the offset is removed when correcteddispersions are used instead. the generalized bfj relation represents afundamental correlation between the global dark matter and baryonic content ofgalaxies, which is obeyed by all (massive) systems regardless of morphology.[abridged]

1112.1084	the galex arecibo sdss survey v: the relation between the hi content of  galaxies and metal enrichment at their outskirts	we have obtained long-slit spectra of 174 star-forming galaxies with stellarmasses greater than 10^10 m_\odot from the galex arecibo sdss (gass) survey.these galaxies have both hi and h_2 mass measurements. the average metallicityprofile is strikingly flat out to r_90, the radius enclosing 90% of the r-bandlight. metallicity profiles which decline steadily with radius are foundprimarily for galaxies in our sample with low stellar mass (log(m_*)&lt;10.2),concentration, and/or mean stellar mass density. beyond ~r_90, however, around10 percent of the galaxies in our sample exhibit a sharp downturn inmetallicity. remarkably, we find that the magnitude of the outer metallicitydrop is well correlated with the total hi content of the galaxy (measured asf_hi=m_hi/m_*). we examine the radial profiles of stellar population ages andstar formation rate densities, and conclude that the galaxies with largestouter metallicity drops are actively growing their stellar disks, with massdoubling times across the whole disk only one third as long as a typical gassgalaxy. we also describe a correlation between local stellar mass density andmetallicity, which is valid across all galaxies in our sample. we argue thatmuch of the recent stellar mass growth at the edges of these galaxies can belinked to the accretion or radial transport of relatively pristine gas frombeyond the galaxies' stellar disks.

1202.2857	the clustering of galaxies as a function of their  photometrically-estimated atomic gas content	we introduce a new photometric estimator of the hi mass fraction (m_hi/m_*)in local galaxies, which is a linear combination of four parameters: stellarmass, stellar surface mass density, nuv-r colour, and g-i colour gradient. itis calibrated using samples of nearby galaxies (0.025&lt;z&lt;0.05) with hi linedetections from the gass and alfalfa surveys, and it is demonstrated to provideunbiased m_hi/m_* estimates even for hi-rich galaxies. we apply this estimatorto a sample of ~24,000 galaxies from the sdss/dr7 in the same redshift range.we then bin these galaxies by stellar mass and hi mass fraction and computeprojected two point cross-correlation functions with respect to a referencegalaxy sample. results are compared with predictions from current semi-analyticmodels of galaxy formation. the agreement is good for galaxies with stellarmasses larger than 10^10 m_sun, but not for lower mass systems. we then extendthe analysis by studying the bias in the clustering of hi-poor or hi-richgalaxies with respect to galaxies with normal hi content on scales between 100kpc and ~5 mpc. for the hi-deficient population, the strongest bias effectsarise when the hi-deficiency is defined in comparison to galaxies of the samestellar mass and size. this is not reproduced by the semi-analytic models,where the quenching of star formation in satellites occurs by "starvation" anddoes not depend on their internal structure. hi-rich galaxies with massesgreater than 10^10 m_sun are found to be anti-biased compared to galaxies with"normal" hi content. interestingly, no such effect is found for lower massgalaxies.

1202.2972	cold gass, an iram legacy survey of molecular gas in massive galaxies:  iii. comparison with semi-analytic models of galaxy formation	we compare the semi-analytic models of galaxy formation of fu et al. (2010),which track the evolution of the radial profiles of atomic and molecular gas ingalaxies, with gas fraction scaling relations derived from the cold gass survey(saintonge et al 2011). the models provide a good description of how condensedbaryons in galaxies with gas are partitioned into stars, atomic and moleculargas as a function of galaxy stellar mass and surface density. the models do notreproduce the tight observed relation between stellar surface density andbulge-to-disk ratio for this population. we then turn to an analysis ofthe"quenched" population of galaxies without detectable cold gas. the currentimplementation of radio-mode feedback in the models disagrees strongly with thedata. in the models, gas cooling shuts down in nearly all galaxies in darkmatter halos above a mass of 10**12 m_sun. as a result, stellar mass is theobservable that best predicts whether a galaxy has little or no neutral gas. incontrast, our data show that quenching is largely independent of stellar mass.instead, there are clear thresholds in bulge-to-disk ratio and in stellarsurface density that demarcate the location of quenched galaxies. we proposethat processes associated with bulge formation play a key role in depleting theneutral gas in galaxies and that further gas accretion is suppressed followingthe formation of the bulge, even in dark matter halos of low mass.

1203.5280	the effect of star formation on the redshift evolution of interstellar  metals, atomic and molecular gas in galaxies	we examine how the atomic and molecular gas components of galaxies evolve tohigher redshifts using the semi-analytic galaxy formation models of fu et al.(2010) in which we track the surface density profiles of gas in disks. we adopttwo different prescriptions based either on gas surface density andmetallicity, or on interstellar pressure, to compute the molecular fraction asa function of radius in each disk. we demonstrate that the adopted starformation law determines how the {\em balance} between gas, stars and metalschanges with time in the star-forming galaxy population, but does not influencethe total mass in stars formed into galaxies at redshifts below $z\sim 2.5$.the redshift evolution of the mass-metallicity relation places strongconstraints on the timescale over which cold gas is converted into stars inhigh redshift galaxies, and favours models where this remains constant atvalues around 1-2 gyr. future observations of the evolution of the averagemolecular-to-atomic gas ratio in galaxies as a function of stellar mass andredshift will constrain models of the atomic-to-molecular transition.

1205.0932	quantifying the role of bars in the build-up of central mass  concentrations in disk galaxies	we analyze the role of bars in the build-up of central mass concentrations inmassive, disk galaxies. our parent sample consists of 3757 face-on diskgalaxies with redshifts between 0.01 and 0.05, selected from the seventh datarelease of the sloan digital sky survey. 1555 galaxies with bars are identifiedusing position angle and ellipticity profiles of the $i$-band light. we comparethe ratio of the specific star formation rate measured in the 1-3 kpc centralregion of the galaxy to that measured for the whole galaxy. galaxies withstrong bars have centrally enhanced star formation; the degree of enhancementdepends primarily on the ellipticity of the bar, and not on the size of the baror on the mass or structure of the host galaxy. the fraction of galaxies withstrong bars is highest at stellar masses greater than $3 \times 10^{10}m_{\odot}$, stellar surface densities less than $3 \times 10^8 m_{\odot}$ andconcentration indices less than 2.5. in this region of parameter space,galaxies with strong bars either have enhanced central star formation rates, orstar formation that is {\em suppressed} compared to the mean. this suggeststhat bars may play a role in the eventual quenching of star formation ingalaxies. only 50% of galaxies with strongly concentrated star formation havestrong bars, indicating that other processes such as galaxy interactions alsoinduce central star-bursts. we also find that the ratio of the size of the barto that of the disk depends mainly on the colour of the galaxy, suggesting thatthe growth and destruction of bars are regulated by gas accretion, as suggestedby simulations.

0711.2839	radio loud agn and the l_x - \sigma relation of galaxy groups and  clusters	we use the rosat all-sky survey to study the x-ray properties of a sample of625 groups and clusters of galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky survey.we stack clusters with similar velocity dispersions and investigate whethertheir average x-ray luminosities and surface brightness profiles vary with theradio activity level of their central galaxies. we find that at a given valueof $\sigma$, clusters with a central radio agn have more concentrated x-raysurface brightness profiles, larger central galaxy masses, and higher x-rayluminosities than clusters with radio-quiet central galaxies. the enhancementin x-ray luminosity is more than a factor of two, is detected with better than6$\sigma$ significance, and cannot be explained by x-ray emission from theradio agn itself. this difference is largely due to a subpopulation ofradio-quiet, high velocity dispersion clusters with low mass central galaxies.these clusters are underluminous at x-ray wavelengths when compared tootherwise similar clusters where the central galaxy is radio-loud, moremassive, or both.

1207.3924	gas depletion in cluster galaxies depends strongly on their internal  structure	we analyze galaxies in 300 nearby groups and clusters identified in the sloandigital sky survey using a photometric gas mass indicator that is useful forestimating the degree to which the interstellar medium of a cluster galaxy hasbeen depleted. we study the radial dependence of inferred gas mass fractionsfor galaxies of different stellar masses and stellar surface densities. atfixed clustercentric distance and at fixed stellar mass, lower density galaxiesare more strongly depleted of their gas than higher density galaxies. ananalysis of depletion trends in the two-dimensional plane of stellar mass $m_*$and stellar mass surface density $\mu_*$ reveals that gas depletion at fixedclustercentric radius is much more sensitive to the density of a galaxy than toits mass. we suggest that low density galaxies are more easily depleted oftheir gas, because they are more easily affected by ram-pressure and/or tidalforces. we also look at the dependence of our gas fraction/radius relations onthe velocity dispersion of the cluster, finding no clear systematic trend.

1208.1584	evolution of the most massive galaxies to z ~ 0.6: ii. the link between  radio agn activity and star formation	we analyze the optical spectra of massive (log m*/msun &gt; 11.4) radio-loudgalaxies at z~0.2 and z~0.6. by comparing stellar population parameters ofthese radio-loud samples with radio-quiet control samples, we investigate howthe presence of a radio-emitting jet relates to the recent star formationhistory of the host galaxy. we also investigate how the emission-lineproperties of the radio galaxies evolve with redshift by stacking theirspectra. our main results are the following. (1) both at low and at highredshift, half as many radio-loud as radio-quiet galaxies have experiencedsignificant star formation in the past gyr. (2) the balmer absorption lineproperties of massive galaxies that have experienced recent star formation showthat star formation occurred as a burst in many of these systems. (3) both theradio and the emission-line luminosity of radio agn evolve significantly withredshift. however, radio galaxies with similar stellar population parameters,have similar emission-line properties both at high- and at low-redshift. theseresults suggest that massive galaxies experience cyclical episodes of gasaccretion, star formation and black hole growth, followed by the production ofa radio jet that shuts down further activity. the behaviour of galaxies withlog m*/msun &gt; 11.4 is the same at z = 0.6 as it is at z = 0.2, except thathigher redshift galaxies experience more star formation and black hole growthand produce more luminous radio jets during each accretion cycle.

0711.3792	interaction-induced star formation in a complete sample of 10^5 nearby  star-forming galaxies	we investigate the clustering properties of a complete sample of 10^5star-forming galaxies drawn from the sdss dr4. on scales less than 100 kpc, theamplitude of the correlation function exhibits a strong dependence on thespecific star formation rate of the galaxy. we interpret this as the signatureof enhanced star formation induced by tidal interactions. we then explore howthe average star formation rate in a galaxy is enhanced as the projectedseparation r_p between the galaxy and its companions decreases. we find thatthe enhancement depends strongly on r_p, but very weakly on the relativeluminosity of the companions. the enhancement is also stronger in low massgalaxies than in high mass galaxies. in order to explore whether a tidalinteraction is not only sufficient, but also necessary to trigger enhanced starformation in a galaxy, we compute background subtracted neighbour counts forthe galaxies in our sample. the average number of close neighbours aroundgalaxies with low to average values of sfr/m* is close to zero. at the highestspecific star formation rates, however, more than 40% of the galaxies in oursample have a companion within a projected radius of 100 kpc. visual inspectionof the highest sfr/m* galaxies without companions reveals that more than 50% ofthese are clear interacting or merging systems. we conclude that tidalinteractions are the dominant trigger of enhanced star formation in the moststrongly star-forming systems. finally, we find clear evidence that tidalinteractions not only lead to enhanced star formation in galaxies, but alsocause structural changes such as an increase in concentration.

1209.2003	alfalfa hi data stacking iii. comparison of environmental trends in hi  gas mass fraction and specific star formation rate	it is well known that both the star formation rate and the cold gas contentof a galaxy depend on the local density out to distances of a few megaparsecs.in this paper, we compare the environmental density dependence of the atomicgas mass fractions of nearby galaxies with the density dependence of theircentral and global specific star formation rates. we stack hi line spectraextracted from the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey centered on galaxies with uvimaging from galex and optical imaging/spectroscopy from sdss. we use thesestacked spectra to evaluate the mean atomic gas mass fraction of galaxies inbins of stellar mass and local density. for galaxies with stellar masses lessthan 10^10.5 m_sun, the decline in mean atomic gas mass fraction with densityis stronger than the decline in mean global and central specific star formationrate. the same conclusion does not hold for more massive galaxies. we interpretour results as evidence for ram-pressure stripping of atomic gas from the outerdisks of low mass satellite galaxies. we compare our results with thesemi-analytic recipes of guo et al. (2011) implemented on the millennium iisimulation. these models assume that only the diffuse gas surrounding satellitegalaxies is stripped, a process that is often termed "strangulation". we showthat these models predict relative trends in atomic gas and star formation thatare in disagreement with observations. we use mock catalogues generated fromthe simulation to predict the halo masses of the hi-deficient galaxies in oursample. we conclude that ram-pressure stripping is likely to become effectivein dark matter halos with masses greater than 10^13 m_sun.

1209.3306	a re-examination of galactic conformity and a comparison with  semi-analytic models of galaxy formation	the observed correlation between star-formation in central galaxies and intheir neighbours (a phenomenon dubbed galactic conformity) is in need of aconvincing physical explanation. we use a volume-limited sample of galaxieswith redshifts less than 0.03 drawn from the sdss dr7 to investigate the scaledependence of the effect and how it changes as a function of the mass of thecentral galaxy. conformity extends over a central galaxy stellar mass rangespanning two orders of magnitude. in central galaxies with masses less than10^10 m_sun, conformity extends out to scales in excess of 4 mpc, well beyondthe virial radii of their dark matter halos. for low mass central galaxies,large-scale conformity with neighbours is only seen when the centrals have lowstar formation rate or gas content. in contrast, at high stellar masses,conformity with neighbours applies in the gas-rich regime and is clearlyconfined to scales comparable to the virial radius of the dark matter halo ofthe central galaxy. our analysis of a mock catalogue from the guo et al (2011)models shows that conformity-like effects are much weaker than observed, andapply only to the low sfr/m* tail of neighbouring galaxies. in the models, themedian and the upper percentiles of the sfr/m* distribution remain almostunchanged, which is in contradiction with the data. conformity betweenlow-mass, gas-poor central galaxies and their distant neighbours cannot beexplained within the framework of halo occupation distribution (hod) models. itis likely a signature of pre-heating of the intergalactic gas at an earlierepoch. the smaller-scale conformity between high-mass, gas-rich centralgalaxies and their close neighbours may be a signature of ongoing gas accretiononto central galaxies in a minority of massive dark matter halos.

0712.0383	interactions, star formation and agn activity	it has long been known that galaxy interactions are associated with enhancedstar formation. in a companion paper, we explored this connection by applying avariety of statistics to sdss data. in particular, we showed that specific starformation rates of galaxies are higher if they have close neighbours. here weapply exactly the same techniques to agn in the survey, showing that closeneighbours are not associated with any similar enhancement of nuclear activity.star formation is enhanced in agn with close neighbours in exactly the same wayas in inactive galaxies, but the accretion rate onto the black hole, asestimated from the extinction-corrected [o iii] luminosity, is not influencedby the presence or absence of companions. previous work has shown that galaxieswith more strongly accreting black holes contain more young stars in theirinner regions. this leads us to conclude that star formation induced by a closecompanion and star formation associated with black hole accretion are distinctevents. these events may be part of the same physical process, for example amerger, provided they are separated in time. in this case, accretion onto theblack hole and its associated star formation would occur only after the twointeracting galaxies have merged. the major caveat in this work is ourassumption that the extinction-corrected [o iii] luminosity is a robustindicator of the bolometric luminosity of the central black hole. it is thusimportant to check our results using indicators of agn activity at otherwavelengths.

1301.5025	on the evolution of the bi-modal distribution of galaxies in the plane  of specific star formation rate versus stellar mass	we have compared the observed distribution of galaxies in the plane ofspecific star formation rate versus stellar mass with the predictions of thegarching semi-analytic model at redshifts 0, 1 and 2. the goal is to testwhether the implementation of radio mode agn feedback, which is responsible forterminating the formation of stars in high mass galaxies, provides an adequatematch to current high-redshift observations. the fraction of quenched galaxiesas a function of stellar mass in the models is in good agreement with data atz=0 and z=1. by z=2, there are too few quenched galaxies with low stellarmasses in the models. at z=2, the population of galaxies with no ongoing starformation is clearly separated from the `main sequence' of star-forminggalaxies in the data. this is not found in the models, because z=2 galaxieswith stellar masses less than 10^11 solar masses are predicted to host blackholes with relatively low masses (less than 10^8 solar masses). the currentimplementation of radio mode feedback from such black holes reduces the coolingrates from the surrounding halo, but does not generate sufficient energy tostop star formation entirely. we suggest that the models may be brought intobetter agreement with the data if black hole growth is triggered by discinstabilities in addition to major mergers, and if feedback mechanismsassociated with the formation of galactic bulges act to quench star formationin galaxies.

1301.5640	spatially resolved star formation histories of nearby galaxies: evidence  for episodic star formation in discs	we use long-slit spectroscopy from moran et al. to study the radialdependence of the recent star formation histories of nearby galaxies withstellar masses greater than 10^10m_sun. we fit stellar population models to thecombination of ssfr, d4000 and hdelta_a and show that many galaxies have balmerabsorption line equivalent widths that require recent short-lived episodes orbursts of star formation. the fraction of galaxies that have experiencedepisodic rather than continuous star formation is highest for late-typegalaxies with low stellar masses. in these systems, bursts occur both in theinner and outer regions of the galaxy. the fraction of stars formed in a singleburst episode is typically around 15% of the total stellar mass in the innerregions of the galaxy and around 5% of the mass in the outer regions. when weaverage over the population, we find that such bursts contribute around a halfof the total mass in stars formed in the last 2 gyr. in massive galaxies,bursts occur predominantly in the outer disk. around a third of all massive,bulge-dominated galaxies have experienced recent star formation episodes thatare fully confined to their outer (r &gt; 0.7r_90) regions. the fraction of starsformed in a single episode is only 2 - 3 % of the underlying stellar mass, butsuch bursts contribute nearly all the stellar mass formed in the last 2 gyr.recent star formation in outer disks is strongly correlated with the globalatomic gas fraction of the galaxy, but not its global molecular gas fraction.we suggest that outer episodic star formation is triggered by gas accretionevents.

1303.3538	the bluedisks project, a study of unusually hi-rich galaxies: i. hi  sizes and morphology	we introduce the "bluedisk" project, a large program at the westerborksynthesis radio telescope (wsrt) that has mapped the hi in a sample of 23nearby galaxies with unusually high hi mass fractions, along with asimilar-sized sample of control galaxies matched in stellar mass, size,inclination and redshift. this paper presents the sample selection,observational set-up, data reduction strategy, and a first analysis of thesizes and structural properties of the hi disks. we find that the hi-richgalaxies lie on the same hi mass versus hi size relation as normal spiralgalaxies, extending it to total hi masses of $2 \times 10^{10} m_{\odot}$ andradii r1 of $\sim 100$ kpc (where r1 is defined as the radius where the hicolumn density reaches 1 $m_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$). hi-rich galaxies havesignificantly larger values of hi-to-optical size ratio at fixed stellar mass,concentration index, stellar and star formation rate surface density comparedto the control sample. the disks of hi-rich galaxies are also significantlymore clumpy (i.e. have higher hi gini and $\delta$area coefficient) than thoseof normal spirals. there is no evidence that the disks of hi-rich galaxies aremore disturbed: hi-rich galaxies exhibit no difference with respect to controlsamples in their distributions of hi asymmetry indices or optical/hi diskposition angle differences. in fact, the center of the hi distributioncorresponds more closely with the center of the optical light in the hi-richgalaxies than in the controls. all these results argue against a scenario inwhich new gas has been brought in by mergers. it is possible that they may bemore consistent with cooling from a surrounding quasi-static halo of warm/hotgas.

1303.6283	galactic accretion and the outer structure of galaxies in the cdm model	we have combined the semi-analytic galaxy formation model of guo et al.(2011) with the particle-tagging technique of cooper et al. (2010) to predictgalaxy surface brightness profiles in a representative sample of ~1900 massivedark matter haloes (10^12--10^14 m_sol) from the millennium ii lambda-cdmn-body simulation. here we present our method and basic results focusing on theouter regions of galaxies, consisting of stars accreted in mergers. thesesimulations cover scales from the stellar haloes of milky way-like galaxies tothe 'cd envelopes' of groups and clusters, and resolve low surface brightnesssubstructure such as tidal streams. we find that the surface density ofaccreted stellar mass around the central galaxies of dark matter haloes is welldescribed by a sersic profile, the radial scale and amplitude of which varysystematically with halo mass (m_200). the total stellar mass surface densityprofile breaks at the radius where accreted stars start to dominate over starsformed in the galaxy itself. this break disappears with increasing m_200because accreted stars contribute more of the total mass of galaxies, and isless distinct when the same galaxies are averaged in bins of stellar mass,because of scatter in the relation between m_star and m_200. to test our modelwe have derived average stellar mass surface density profiles for massivegalaxies at z~0.08 by stacking sdss images. our model agrees well with thesestacked profiles and with other data from the literature, and makes predictionsthat can be more rigorously tested by future surveys that extend the analysisof the outer structure of galaxies to fainter isophotes. we conclude that it islikely that the outer structure of the spheroidal components of galaxies islargely determined by collisionless merging during their hierarchical assembly

1304.7175	the nature of obscuration in agn: i. insights from host galaxies	we analyze a sample of 30,000 nearby obscured agns with optical spectra fromsdss and mid-ir photometry from wise. our aim is to investigate the agn hostgalaxy properties with mid-ir luminosities as agn activity indicator, and tocompare with previous studies based on [oiii] emission lines. first we findthat the [3.4] - [4.6] colour has weak dependence on host stellar age, butstrong dependence on agn activity. we then use a "pair-matching" technique tosubtract the host 4.6 micron contribution. by combining seyferts with a sampleof sdss quasars at z &lt; 0.7, we show that the [oiii] and the intrinsic agn 4.6micron luminosities correlate roughly linearly over 4 orders of magnitude, butwith substantial scatter. we also compare the partition functions of the totalintegrated 4.6 micron and [oiii] line luminosities from seyferts and asub-population of liners with significant nuclear 4.6 micron emission, asfunction of a variety of host galaxy properties, finding that they areidentical. we conclude, therefore, that [oiii] as an agn indicator shows noparticular biases as compared to the 4.6 micron luminosity. our results alsodemonstrate that some liners do fit in with the expectations of the simpleunified model.

1305.7231	modelling element abundances in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation	we update the treatment of chemical evolution in the munich semi-analyticmodel, l-galaxies. our new implementation includes delayed enrichment fromstellar winds, supernovae type ii (sne-ii) and supernovae type ia (sne-ia), aswell as metallicity-dependent yields and a reformulation of the associatedsupernova feedback. two different sets of sn-ii yields and three differentsn-ia delay-time distributions (dtds) are considered, and eleven heavy elements(including o, mg and fe) are self-consistently tracked. we compare the resultsof this new implementation with data on a) local, star-forming galaxies, b)milky way disc g dwarfs, and c) local, elliptical galaxies. we find that thez=0 gas-phase mass-metallicity relation is very well reproduced for all formsof dtd considered, as is the [fe/h] distribution in the milky way disc. the[o/fe] distribution in the milky way disc is best reproduced when using a dtdwith less than or equal to 50 per cent of sne-ia exploding within ~400 myrs.positive slopes in the mass-[alpha/fe] relations of local ellipticals are alsoobtained when using a dtd with such a minor `prompt' component. alternatively,metal-rich winds that drive light alpha elements directly out into thecircumgalactic medium also produce positive slopes for all forms of dtd andsn-ii yields considered. overall, we find that the best model for matching thewide range of observational data considered here should include a power-lawsn-ia dtd, sn-ii yields that take account of prior mass loss through stellarwinds, and some direct ejection of light alpha elements out of galaxies.

0801.3530	why are agn found in high mass galaxies?	we use semi-analytic models implemented in the millennium simulation toanalyze the merging histories of dark matter haloes and of the galaxies thatreside in them. we assume that supermassive black holes only exist in galaxiesthat have experienced at least one major merger. only a few percent of galaxieswith stellar masses less than $m_* &lt; 10^{10} m_{\odot}$ are predicted to haveexperienced a major merger and to contain a black hole. the fraction ofgalaxies with black holes increases very steeply at larger stellar masses. thisagrees well with the observed strong mass dependence of the fraction of nearbygalaxies that contain either low-luminosity (liner-type) or higher-luminosity(seyfert or composite-type) agn. we then investigate when the major mergersthat first create the black holes are predicted to occur. high mass galaxiesare predicted to have formed their black holes at very early epochs. themajority of low mass galaxies never experience a major merger and hence do notcontain a black hole, but a significant fraction of the supermassive blackholes that do exist in low mass galaxies are predicted to have formed recently.

1310.5151	dilution in elliptical galaxies: implications for the relation between  metallicity, stellar mass and star formation rate	we investigate whether gradual dilution of the gas in some ellipticalgalaxies is the cause of a positive correlation between star formation rate(sfr) and gas-phase metallicity (zg) at high stellar mass (m*) in the localuniverse. to do this, two classes of massive (m* &gt;= 10^10.5 msun) galaxy areselected from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and the munich semi-analyticmodel of galaxy formation, l-galaxies. the first class is selected by highspecific star formation rates (ssfr) and high zg, and the second class by lowssfr and low zg. these criteria roughly distinguish disc-dominant galaxies frommetal-poor, elliptical galaxies. in the semi-analytic model, the second classof galaxies obtain low ssfr and low zg due to gradual dilution of theinterstellar medium by accretion of metal-poor gas via infalling clumps andlow-mass satellites. this occurs after a merger-induced starburst and theassociated supernova feedback have quenched most of the original gas reservoir.a number of signatures of this evolution are present in these model galaxies atz=0, including low gas fractions, large central black holes, ellipticalmorphologies, old ages, and importantly, low (zg-z*) indicating dilution afterstar formation. remarkably, all of these properties are also found in low-ssfr,low-zg, massive galaxies in the sdss-dr7. this provides strong, indirectevidence that some elliptical galaxies are undergoing gradual dilution after agas-rich merger in the local universe. this dilution scenario also explains thepositive correlation between sfr and zg measured in high-m* galaxies, andtherefore has consequences for the local fundamental metallicity relation(fmr), which assumes a weak anti-correlation between sfr and zg above 10^10.5msun.

1401.8091	quantitative constraints on starburst cycles in galaxies with stellar  masses in the range 10**8-10**10 msol	we have used 4000 \aa\ break and h$\delta_a$ indices in combination withsfr/m* derived from emission line flux measurements, to constrain the recentstar formation histories of galaxies with stellar masses in the range10**8-10**10 msol. the fraction of the total sfr density in galaxies withongoing bursts is a strong function of stellar mass, declining from 0.85 at astellar mass of 10**8 msol to 0.25 for galaxies with m* = 10**10 msol. low massgalaxies are not all young. the distribution of half mass formation times forgalaxies with stellar masses less than 10**9 msol is broad, spanning the range1-10 gyr. the peak-to-trough variation in star formation rate among thebursting population ranges lies in the range 10-25. in low mass galaxies, theaverage duration of the burst is comparable to the dynamical time of thegalaxy. galaxy structure is correlated with estimated burst mass fraction, butin different ways in low and in high mass galaxies. high mass galaxies withlarge burst mass fractions are more centrally concentrated, indicating thatbulge formation is at work. in low mass galaxies, stellar surface massdensities decrease as a function of f_{burst}. these results are in goodagreement with the observational predictions of teyssier et al (2013) and lendfurther credence to the idea that the cuspy halo problem can be solved byenergy input from multiple starbursts over the lifetime of the galaxy. we notethat there is no compelling evidence for imf variations in the population ofstar-forming galaxies in the local universe.

1401.8164	an observational and theoretical view of the radial distribution of hi  gas in galaxies	we analyze the radial distribution of hi gas for 23 disk galaxies withunusually high hi content from the bluedisk sample, along with a similar-sizedsample of "normal" galaxies. we propose an empirical model to fit the radialprofile of the hi surface density, an exponential function with a depressionnear the center. the radial hi surface density profiles are very homogeneous inthe outer regions of the galaxy; the exponentially declining part of theprofile has a scale-length of $\sim 0.18$ r1, where r1 is the radius where thecolumn density of the hi is 1 m$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$. this holds for allgalaxies, independent of their stellar or hi mass. the homogenous outerprofiles, combined with the limited range in hi surface density in thenon-exponential inner disk, results in the well-known tight relation between hisize and hi mass. by comparing the radial profiles of the hi-rich galaxies withthose of the control systems, we deduce that in about half the galaxies, mostof the excess gas lies outside the stellar disk, in the exponentially decliningouter regions of the hi disk. in the other half, the excess is more centrallypeaked. we compare our results with existing smoothed-particle hydrodynamicalsimulations and semi-analytic models of disk galaxy formation in a $\lambda$cold dark matter universe. both the hydro simulations and the semi-analyticmodels reproduce the hi surface density profiles and the hi size-mass relationwithout further tuning of the simulation and model inputs. in the semi-analyticmodels, the universal shape of the outer hi radial profiles is a consequence ofthe {\em assumption} that infalling gas is always distributed exponentially.the conversion of atomic gas to molecular form explains the limited range of hisurface densities in the inner disk. these two factors produce the tight himass-size relation.

0802.4100	narrow associated qso absorbers: clustering, outflows and the  line-of-sight proximity effect	using data from the sloan digital sky survey data release 3 (sdss dr3) weinvestigate how narrow (&lt;700km/s) civ and mgii quasar absorption line systemsare distributed around quasars. the civ absorbers lie in the redshift range 1.6&lt; z &lt; 4 and the mgii absorbers in the range 0.4&lt;z&lt;2.2. by correlating absorberswith quasars on different but neighbouring lines-of-sight, we measure theclustering of absorbers around quasars on comoving scales between 4 and 30mpc.the observed comoving correlation lengths are r_o~5h^-1mpc, similar to thoseobserved for bright galaxies at these redshifts. comparing with correlationsbetween absorbers and the quasars in whose spectra they are identified thenimplies: (i) that quasars destroy absorbers to comoving distances of ~300kpc(civ) and ~800kpc (mgii) along their lines-of-sight; (ii) that &gt;40% of civabsorbers within 3,000km/s of the qso are not a result of large-scaleclustering but rather are directly associated with the quasar itself; (iii)that this intrinsic absorber population extends to outflow velocities of order12,000km/s; (iv) that this outflow component is present in both radio-loud andradio-quiet quasars; and (v) that a small high-velocity outflow component isobserved in the mgii population, but any further intrinsic absorber componentis undetectable in our clustering analysis. we also find an indication thatabsorption systems within 3,000km/s are more abundant for radio-loud than forradio-quiet quasars. this suggests either that radio-loud objects live in moremassive halos, or that their radio activity generates an additionallow-velocity outflow, or both.

1404.7138	the variation in molecular gas depletion time among nearby galaxies:  what are the main parameter dependencies?	we re-analyze correlations between global molecular gas depletion time (tdep)and galaxy parameters including stellar mass, specific star formation rate(ssfr), stellar mass surface density and concentration index. the analysis isbased on the cold gass survey, which includes galaxies with stellar mass in therange 10^10 - 10^11.5 msun with molecular gas mass estimates derived fromco(1-0) line measurements. we improve on previous work by saintonge et al.(2011b) by estimating sfrs using the combination of galex fuv and wise 22micron data and by deriving tdep within a fixed aperture set by the iram beamsize. in our new study we find correlations with much smaller scatter.dependences of the tdep on galaxy structural parameters such as stellar masssurface density and concentration index are now weak or absent. differenceswith previous work arise because dust extinction correlates strongly withgalaxy structural parameters. we further demonstrate that the 'primary' globalparameter correlation is between tdep and ssfr; all other remainingcorrelations can be shown to be induced by this primary dependence. thisimplies that galaxies with high current-to-past-averaged star formationactivity, will drain their molecular gas reservoir sooner. we then analyzemolecular gas depletion times on 1-kpc scales in galactic disks using data fromthe heracles survey. there is remarkably good agreement between the global tdepversus ssfr relation for the cold gass galaxies and that derived for 1 kpcscale grid regions in disks. the strong correlation between tdep and ssfrextends continuously over a factor of 10 in tdep from log(sfr/m*) = -11.5 to-9, i.e. from nearly quiescent patches of the disk to disk regions with verystrong star formation. this leads to the conclusion that the local moleculargas depletion time in galactic disks is dependent on the local fraction ofyoung-to-old stars.

1412.1482	overview of the sdss-iv manga survey: mapping nearby galaxies at apache  point observatory	we present an overview of a new integral field spectroscopic survey calledmanga (mapping nearby galaxies at apache point observatory), one of three coreprograms in the fourth-generation sloan digital sky survey (sdss-iv) that beganon 2014 july 1. manga will investigate the internal kinematic structure andcomposition of gas and stars in an unprecedented sample of 10,000 nearbygalaxies. we summarize essential characteristics of the instrument and surveydesign in the context of manga's key science goals and present prototypeobservations to demonstrate manga's scientific potential. manga employsdithered observations with 17 fiber-bundle integral field units that vary indiameter from 12" (19 fibers) to 32" (127 fibers). two dual-channelspectrographs provide simultaneous wavelength coverage over 3600-10300 a atr~2000. with a typical integration time of 3 hr, manga reaches a target r-bandsignal-to-noise ratio of 4-8 (per a, per 2" fiber) at 23 ab mag per sq. arcsec,which is typical for the outskirts of manga galaxies. targets are selected withstellar mass greater than 1e9 msun using sdss-i redshifts and i-band luminosityto achieve uniform radial coverage in terms of the effective radius, anapproximately flat distribution in stellar mass, and a sample spanning a widerange of environments. analysis of our prototype observations demonstratesmanga's ability to probe gas ionization, shed light on recent star formationand quenching, enable dynamical modeling, decompose constituent components, andmap the composition of stellar populations. manga's spatially resolved spectrawill enable an unprecedented study of the astrophysics of nearby galaxies inthe coming 6 yr.

1412.3111	the variation in molecular gas depletion time among nearby galaxies: ii  the impact of galaxy internal structures	we use a data set of nearby galaxies drawn from the heracles, atlas3d, andcold gass surveys to study variations in molecular gas depletion time (tdep) ingalaxy structures such as bulges, grand-design spiral arms, bars and rings.molecular gas is traced by co line emission and star formation rate (sfr) isderived using the combination of far-ultraviolet and mid-infrared (mir) data.the contribution of old stars to mir emission for the atlas3d sample iscorrected using 2mass k-band images. we apply a two-dimensional imagedecomposition algorithm to decompose galaxies into bulges and discs. spiralarms, bars and rings are identified in the residual maps, and molecular gasdepletion times are derived on a square grid of 1 kpc^2 size. in previous work,we showed that tdep correlates strongly with specific star formation rate(ssfr). we now find that at a given ssfr, the bulge has shorter tdep than thedisc. the shift to shorter depletion times is most pronounced in the innerbulge (r &lt; 0.1re). grids from galaxies with bars and rings are similar to thosefrom galactic bulges in that they have reduced tdep at a given ssfr. incontrast, the tdep versus ssfr relation in the discs of galaxies with spiralarms is displaced to longer tdep at fixed ssfr. we then show that thedifferences in the tdep-ssfr relation for bulges, discs, arms, bars and ringscan be linked to variations in "stellar", rather than gas surface densitybetween different structures. our best current predictor for tdep, bothglobally and for 1 kpc grids, is given by tdep=-0.36log(sigma_sfr)-0.5log(sigma_*)+5.87.

1501.01017	the outer stellar populations and environments of unusually hi-rich  galaxies	we investigate the nature of hi-rich galaxies from the alfalfa and gasssurveys, which are defined as galaxies in the top 10th percentile in atomic gasfraction at a given stellar mass. we analyze outer (r&gt;1.5 re) stellarpopulations for a subset of face-on systems using optical g-r versus r-zcolour/colour diagrams. the results are compared with those from controlsamples that are defined without regard to atomic gas content, but are matchedin redshift, stellar mass and structural parameters. hi-rich early-type (c&gt;2.6)and late-type (c&lt;2.6) galaxies are studied separately. when compared to thecontrol sample, the outer stellar populations of the majority of hi-richearly-type galaxies are shifted in the colour/colour plane along a locusconsistent with younger stellar ages, but similar metallicities. the outercolours of hi-rich late-type galaxies are much bluer in r-z than the hi-richearly types, and we infer that they have outer disks which are both younger andmore metal-poor. we then proceed to analyze the galaxy environments of hi-richgalaxies on scales of 500 kpc. hi-rich early-type galaxies with low (log m* &lt;10.5) stellar masses differ significantly from the control sample in that theyare more likely to be central rather than satellite systems. their satellitesare also less massive and have younger stellar populations. similar, but weakereffects are found for low mass hi-rich late-type galaxies. in addition, we findthat the satellites of hi-rich late-types exhibit a greater tendency to alignalong the major axis of the primary. no environmental differences are found formassive (log m* &gt; 10.5) hi-rich galaxies, regardless of type.

1503.02667	the spatially resolved kennicutt-schmidt relation in the hi dominated  regions of spiral and dwarf irregular galaxies	we study the kennicutt-schmidt relation between average star formation rateand average cold gas surface density in the hi dominated ism of nearby spiraland dwarf irregular galaxies. we divide the galaxies into grid cells varyingfrom sub-kpc to tens of kpc in size. grid-cell measurements of low sfrs usingh-alpha emission can be biased and scatter may be introduced because ofnon-uniform sampling of the imf or because of stochastically varying starformation. in order to alleviate these issues, we use far-ultraviolet emissionto trace sfr, and we sum up the fluxes from different bins with the same gassurface density to calculate the average $\sigma_{sfr}$ at a given value of$\sigma_{gas}$. we study the resulting kennicutt-schmidt relation in 400 pc, 1kpc and 10 kpc scale grids in nearby massive spirals and in 400 pc scale gridsin nearby faint dwarf irregulars. we find a relation with a power law slope of1.5 in the hi-dominated regions for both kinds of galaxies. the relation isoffset towards longer gas consumption timescales compared to the molecularhydrogen dominated centres of spirals, but the offset is an order-of-magnitudeless than that quoted by earlier studies. our results lead to the surprisingconclusion that conversion of gas to stars is independent of metallicity in thehi dominated regions of star-forming galaxies. our observed relations arebetter fit by a model of star formation based on thermal and hydrostaticequilibrium in the ism, in which feedback driven turbulence sets the thermalpressure.

1503.03141	hi scaling relations of galaxies in the environment of hi-rich and  control galaxies observed by the bluedisk project	our work is based on the "bluedisk" project, a program to map the neutral gasin a sample of 25 hi-rich spirals and a similar number of control galaxies withthe westerbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt). in this paper we focus on thehi properties of the galaxies in the environment of our targeted galaxies. intotal, we extract 65 galaxies from the wsrt cubes with stellar masses between$10^8m_{\odot}$ and $10^{11}m_{\odot}$. most of these galaxies are located onthe same hi mass-size relation and "hi-plane" as normal spiral galaxies. wefind that companions around hi-rich galaxies tend to be hi-rich as well and tohave larger r90,hi/r50,hi. this suggests a scenario of "hi conformity", similarto the colour conformity found by weinmann et al. (2006): galaxies tend toadopt the hi properties of their neighbours. we visually inspect the outliersfrom the hi mass-size relation and galaxies which are offset from the hi planeand find that they show morphological and kinematical signatures of recentinteractions with their environment. we speculate that these outliers have beendisturbed by tidal or ram-pressure stripping processes, or in a few cases, byaccretion events.

1503.05924	a systematic study of the inner rotation curves of galaxies observed as  part of the gass and cold gass surveys	we present a systematic analysis of the rotation curves of 187 galaxies withmasses greater than 10^10 m_sol, with atomic gas masses from the galex arecibosloan survey (gass), and with follow-up long-slit spectroscopy from the mmt.our analysis focuses on stellar rotation curves derived by fitting stellartemplate spectra to the galaxy spectra binned along the slit. in this way, weare able to obtain accurate rotation velocity measurements for a factor of 2more galaxies than possible with the halpha line. galaxies with high atomic gasmass fractions are the most dark-matter dominated galaxies in our sample andhave dark matter halo density profiles that are well fit by navarro, frenk &amp;white profiles with an average concentration parameter of 10. the inner slopesand of the rotation curves correlate more strongly with stellar population agethan with galaxy mass or structural parameters. at fixed stellar mass, therotation curves of more actively star-forming galaxies have steeper innerslopes than less actively star-forming galaxies. the ratio between the galaxyspecific angular momentum and the total specific angular momentum of its darkmatter halo, r_j, correlates strongly with galaxy mass, structure and gascontent. low mass, disk-dominated galaxies with atomic gas mass fractionsgreater than 20% have median values of r_j of around 1, but massive,bulge-dominated galaxies have r_j=0.2-0.3. we argue that these trends can beunderstood in a picture where gas inflows triggered by disk instabilities leadto the formation of passive, bulge-dominated galaxies with low specific angularmomentum.

1504.01392	connection between the circumgalactic medium and the interstellar medium  of galaxies: results from the cos-gass survey	we present a study exploring the nature and properties of the circum-galacticmedium (cgm) and its connection to the atomic gas content in the interstellarmedium (ism) of galaxies as traced by the hi 21cm line. our sample includes 45low-z (0.026-0.049) galaxies from the galex arecibo sdss survey. their cgm wasprobed via absorption in the spectra of background quasi-stellar objects atimpact parameters of 63 to 231kpc. the spectra were obtained with the cosmicorigins spectrograph aboard the hubble space telescope. we detected neutralhydrogen (ly$\alpha$ absorption-lines) in the cgm of 92% of the galaxies. wefind the radial profile of the cgm as traced by the ly$\alpha$ equivalent widthcan be fit as an exponential with a scale length of roughly the virial radiusof the dark matter halo. we found no correlation between the orientation ofsightline relative to the galaxy major axis and the ly$\alpha$ equivalentwidth. the velocity spread of the circumgalactic gas is consistent with thatseen in the atomic gas in the interstellar medium. we find a strong correlation(99.8% confidence) between the gas fraction (m(hi)/m*) and theimpact-parameter-corrected ly$\alpha$ equivalent width. this is stronger thanthe analogous correlation between corrected ly$\alpha$ equivalent width andsfr/m* (97.5% confidence). these results imply a physical connection betweenthe hi disk and the cgm, which is on scales an order-of-magnitude larger. thisis consistent with the picture in which the hi disk is nourished by accretionof gas from the cgm.

1508.02400	physical origin of the large-scale conformity in the specific star  formation rates of galaxies	two explanations have been put forward to explain the observed conformitybetween the colours and specific star formation rates (sfr/$m_*$) of galaxieson large scales: 1) the formation times of their surrounding dark matter halosare correlated (commonly referred to as "assembly bias"), 2) gas is heated overlarge scales at early times, leading to coherent modulation of cooling and starformation between well-separated galaxies (commonly referred to as"pre-heating") . to distinguish between the pre-heating and assembly biasscenarios, we search for relics of energetic feedback events in theneighbourhood of central galaxies with different specific star formation rates.we find a significant excess of very high mass ($\log m_* &gt; 11.3$) galaxies outto a distance of 2.5 mpc around low sfr/$m_*$ central galaxies compared tocontrol samples of higher sfr/$m_*$ central galaxies with the same stellar massand redshift. we also find that very massive galaxies in the neighbourhood oflow sfr/$m_*$ galaxies have much higher probability of hosting radio loudactive galactic nuclei. the radio-loud agn fraction in neighbours with $\logm_* &gt; 11.3$ is four times higher around passive, non star-forming centrals atprojected distances of 1 mpc and two times higher at projected distances of 4mpc. finally, we carry out an investigation of conformity effects in therecently publicly-released illustris cosmological hydrodynamical simulation,which includes energetic input both from quasars and from radio mode accretiononto black holes. we do not find conformity effects of comparable amplitude onlarge scales in the simulations and we propose that gas needs to be pushed outof dark matter halos more efficiently at high redshifts.

1511.04909	the distribution of atomic hydrogen in eagle galaxies: morphologies,  profiles, and hi holes	we compare the mass and internal distribution of atomic hydrogen (hi) in 2200present-day central galaxies with m_star &gt; 10^10 m_sun from the 100 mpc eaglereference simulation to observational data. atomic hydrogen fractions arecorrected for self-shielding using a fitting formula from radiative transfersimulations and for the presence of molecular hydrogen using an empirical or atheoretical prescription from the literature. the resulting neutral hydrogenfractions, m_(hi+h2)/m_star, agree with observations to better than 0.1 dex forgalaxies with m_star between 10^10 and 10^11 m_sun. our fiducial, empirical h2model based on gas pressure results in galactic hi mass fractions, m_hi/m_star,that agree with observations from the gass survey to better than 0.3 dex, butthe alternative theoretical h2 formula leads to a negative offset inm_hi/m_star of up to 0.5 dex. visual inspection reveals that most hi disks insimulated hi-rich galaxies are vertically disturbed, plausibly due to recentaccretion events. many galaxies (up to 80 per cent) contain spuriously large hiholes, which are likely formed as a consequence of the feedback implementationin eagle. the hi mass-size relation of all simulated galaxies is close to (but16 per cent steeper than) observed, and when only galaxies without large holesin the hi disc are considered, the agreement becomes excellent (better than 0.1dex). the presence of large hi holes also makes the radial hi surface densityprofiles somewhat too low in the centre, at \sigma_hi &gt; 1 m_sun pc^-2 (by afactor of &lt;~ 2 compared to data from the bluedisk survey). in the outer region(\sigma_hi &lt; 1 m_sun pc^-2), the simulated profiles agree quantitatively withobservations. scaled by hi size, the simulated profiles of hi-rich (m_hi &gt;10^9.8 m_sun) and control galaxies (10^9.1 m_sun &gt; m_hi &gt; 10^9.8 m_sun) followeach other closely, as observed.

0806.2872	milky way type galaxies in a lcdm cosmology	we analyse a sample of 52,000 milky way (mw) type galaxies drawn from thepublicly available galaxy catalogue of the millennium simulation with the aimof studying statistically the differences and similarities of their propertiesin comparison to our galaxy. model galaxies are chosen to lie in haloes withmaximum circular velocities in the range 200-250 km/seg and to havebulge-to-disk ratios similar to that of the milky way. we find that model mwgalaxies formed quietly through the accretion of cold gas and small satellitesystems. only 12 per cent of our model galaxies experienced a major mergerduring their lifetime. most of the stars formed in situ, with only about 15 percent of the final mass gathered through accretion. supernovae and agn feedbackplay an important role in the evolution of these systems. at high redshifts,when the potential wells of the mw progenitors are shallower, winds driven bysupernovae explosions blow out a large fraction of the gas and metals. as thesystems grow in mass, sn feedback effects decrease and agn feedback takes over,playing a more important role in the regulation of the star formation activityat lower redshifts. although model milky way galaxies have been selected to liein a narrow range of maximum circular velocities, they nevertheless exhibit asignificant dispersion in the final stellar masses and metallicities. ouranalysis suggests that this dispersion results from the different accretionhistories of the parent dark matter haloes. statically, we also find evidencesto support the milky way as a typical sb/sc galaxy in the same mass range,providing a suitable benchmark to constrain numerical models of galaxyformation

0806.4089	halo masses for optically-selected and for radio-loud agn from  clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing	we compute two-point correlation functions and measure the shear signal dueto galaxy-galaxy lensing for 80,000 optically identified and 5,700 radio-loudagn from data release 4 (dr4) of the sloan digital sky survey. halo occupationmodels are used to estimate halo masses and satellite fractions for these twotypes of agn. the large sample size allows us to separate agn according to thestellar mass of their host galaxies. we study how the halo masses of opticaland radio agn differ from those of the parent population at fixed m*. halomasses deduced from clustering and from lensing agree satisfactorily. radio agnare found in more massive halos than optical agn: in our samples their meanhalo masses are 1.6 x 10^{13} and 8 x 10^{11} m_{sun}/h, respectively. opticalagn follow the same relation between stellar mass and halo mass as galaxiesselected without regard to nuclear properties, but radio-loud agn deviatesignificantly from this relation. the dark matter halos of radio-loud agn areabout twice as massive as those of control galaxies of the same stellar mass.this boost is independent of radio luminosity, and persists even when ouranalysis is restricted to field galaxies. the large-scale gaseous environmentof the galaxy clearly plays a crucial role in producing observable radioemission. the dark matter halo masses that we derive for the agn in our twosamples are in good agreement with recent models in which feedback from radioagn becomes dominant in halos where gas cools quasi-statically.

astro-ph;0005485	the spatial and kinematic distributions of cluster galaxies in a lcdm  universe -- comparison with observations	we combine dissipationless n-body simulations and semi-analytic models ofgalaxy formation to study the spatial and kinematic distributions of clustergalaxies in a lcdm cosmology. we investigate how the star formation rates,colours and morphologies of galaxies vary as a function of distance from thecluster centre and compare our results with the cnoc1 survey of galaxies from15 x-ray luminous clusters in the redshift range 0.18 to 0.55. in our model,gas no longer cools onto galaxies after they fall into the cluster and theirstar formation rates decline on timescales of 1-2 gyr. galaxies in clustercores have lower star formation rates and redder colours than galaxies in theouter regions because they were accreted earlier. our colour and star formationgradients agree with those those derived from the data. the difference invelocity dispersions between red and blue galaxies observed in the cnoc1clusters is also well reproduced by the model. we assume that the morphologiesof cluster galaxies are determined solely by their merging histories.morphology gradients in clusters arise naturally, with the fraction of bulge-dominated galaxies highest in cluster cores. we compare these gradients withthe cnoc1 data and find excellent agreement for bulge-dominated galaxies. thesimulated clusters contain too few galaxies of intermediate bulge-to-diskratio, suggesting that additional processes may influence the morphologicalevolution of disk-dominated galaxies in clusters. although the properties ofthe cluster galaxies in our model agree extremely well with the data, the sameis not true of field galaxies. both the star formation rates and the colours ofbright field galaxies appear to evolve much more strongly from redshift 0.2 to0.4 in the cnoc1 field sample than in our simulations.

astro-ph;0007369	the correlation between black hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion in  hierarchical galaxy formation models	recent work has demonstrated that there is a tight correlation between themass of a black hole and the velocity dispersion of the bulge of its hostgalaxy. we show that the model of kauffmann &amp; haehnelt, in which bulges andsupermassive black holes both form during major mergers, produces a correlationbetween m_bh and sigma with slope and scatter comparable to the observedrelation. in the model, the m_bh - sigma relation is significantly tighter thanthe correlation between black hole mass and bulge luminosity or the correlationbetween bulge luminosity and velocity dispersion. there are two reasons forthis: i) the gas masses of bulge progenitors depend on the velocity dispersionbut not on the formation epoch of the bulge, whereas the stellar masses of theprogenitors depend on both; ii) mergers between galaxies move black holes alongthe observed m_bh - sigma relation, even at late times when the galaxies aregas-poor and black holes grow mainly by merging of pre-existing black holes. weconclude that the small scatter in the observed m_bh - sigma relation isconsistent with a picture in which bulges and black holes form over a widerange in redshift.

astro-ph;0012055	populating a cluster of galaxies - i. results at z=0	we simulate the assembly of a massive rich cluster and the formation of itsconstituent galaxies in a flat, low-density universe. our most accurate modelfollows the collapse, the star-formation history and the orbital motion of allgalaxies more luminous than the fornax dwarf spheroidal, while dark halostructure is tracked consistently throughout the cluster for all galaxies moreluminous than the smc. within its virial radius this model contains about 2.0e7dark matter particles and almost 5000 distinct dynamically resolved galaxies.simulations of this same cluster at a variety of resolutions allow us to checkexplicitly for numerical convergence both of the dark matter structuresproduced by our new parallel n-body and substructure identification codes, andof the galaxy populations produced by the phenomenological models we use tofollow cooling, star formation, feedback and stellar aging. this baryonicmodelling is tuned so that our simulations reproduce the observed properties ofisolated spirals outside clusters. without further parameter adjustment oursimulations then produce a luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio,luminosity, number and velocity dispersion profiles, and a morphology-radiusrelation which are similar to those observed in real clusters. in particular,since our simulations follow galaxy merging explicitly, we can demonstrate thatit accounts quantitatively for the observed cluster population of bulges andelliptical galaxies.

astro-ph;0103130	the star formation histories of local galaxies: continuous or  intermittent?	we explore a model in which efficient star formation in galaxies is triggeredby merging satellites. we show that the merger/interaction rates predicted byhierarchical galaxy formation models depend strongly on galaxy mass. if amerger of a satellite larger than 1% the mass of the primary triggers efficientstar formation, low-mass dwarf galaxies experience strong bursts separated byquiescent periods lasting several gyr. massive galaxies, such as our own milkyway, are perturbed by a 1% satellite every few hundred million years, and thushave fluctuating, but relatively continuous star formation histories. we studythe spectral signatures of a population of galaxies undergoing intermittentstar formation by combining the models with the latest version of the bruzual &amp;charlot spectral synthesis code. we concentrate on spectral indicators that aresensitive primarily to stellar age, rather than to metallicity and extinction.we show that if a population undergoes intermittent rather than continuous starformation, the signatures of the bursts should be evident from the observeddispersion in the star formation rates, h-delta equivalent widths and gas massfractions of galaxies with 4000 angstrom break strengths indicative of recentor ongoing star formation.

astro-ph;0108275	the clustering of galaxies around quasars	we study the cross-correlation between quasars and galaxies by embeddingmodels for the formation and evolution of the two populations in cosmologicaln-body simulations. we adopt the quasar evolution model of kauffmann &amp; haehnelt(2000), in which supermassive black holes are formed and fuelled during majormergers. we define the `bias' parameter b_qg as the ratio of thecross-correlation function xi_qg to the galaxy auto-correlation function xi_gg.on scales larger than 1 h^{-1} mpc, the values of b_qg predicted by our modelsat low redshift depend very little on galaxy selection. they measure thecharacteristic mass of the dark matter halos that host quasars and can be usedto estimate the typical quasar lifetime. in current redshift surveys, suchmeasurements will constrain the lifetimes of low z quasars more accurately thanmeasurements of the quasar auto-correlation function, because galaxies havemuch higher space densities than quasars. on scales smaller than 1 h^{-1} mpc,the main contribution to xi_qg comes from quasar/galaxy pairs in the same darkmatter halo. the amplitude of xi_qg depends both on the location of the hostgalaxy and on the density profile of other galaxies within the halo. as aresult, measurements on these scales yield information about the processesresponsible for fuelling super- massive black holes. at high redshifts, ourmodels predict that quasars of fixed luminosity are located in less massivehalos than at low redshift. they are therefore less biased relative to galaxiesof given luminosity or stellar mass. we have used the simulations to calculatethe evolution of the quasar auto- correlation function. we find that modelswith quasar lifetimes in the range 10^6-10^7 years provide a good match to theresults of the 2df qso survey.

astro-ph;0204055	stellar masses and star formation histories for 10^5 galaxies from the  sloan digital sky survey	we develop a new method to constrain the star formation histories, dustattenuation and stellar masses of galaxies. it is based on two stellarabsorption line indices, the 4000 angstrom break strength and the balmerabsorption line index hdelta_a. together, these indices allow us to constrainthe mean stellar ages of galaxies and the fractional stellar mass formed inbursts over the past few gyr. a comparison with broad band photometry thenyields estimates of dust attenuation and of stellar mass. we generate a largelibrary of monte carlo realizations of different star formation histories,including starbursts of varying strength and a range of metallicities. we usethis library to generate median likelihood estimates of burst mass fractions,dust attenuation strengths, stellar masses and stellar mass-to-light ratios fora sample of 122,208 galaxies drawn from the sloan digital sky survey. thetypical 95% confidence range in our estimated stellar masses is +-40%. we studyhow the stellar mass-to-light ratios of galaxies vary as a function of absolutemagnitude, concentration index and photometric pass-band and how dustattenuation varies as a function of absolute magnitude and 4000 angstrom breakstrength. we also calculate how the total stellar mass of the present universeis distributed over galaxies as a function of their mass, size, concentration,colour, burst mass fraction and surface mass density. we find that most of thestellar mass in the local universe resides in galaxies that have stellar masses\~5\times 10^10 m_sol, half light radii ~3 kpc, and half- light surface massdensities ~10^9 m_sol/kpc^2. the distribution of d(4000) is strongly bimodal,showing a clear division between galaxies dominated by old stellar populationsand galaxies with more recent star formation.

astro-ph;0205070	the dependence of star formation history and internal structure on  stellar mass for 10^5 low-redshift galaxies	we study the relations between stellar mass, star formation history, size andinternal structure for a complete sample of 122,808 galaxies drawn from thesloan digital sky survey. we show that low-redshift galaxies divide into twodistinct families at a stellar mass of 3 \times 10^10 m_sol. lower massgalaxies have young stellar populations, low surface mass densities and the lowconcentrations typical of disks. a significant fraction of the lowest massgalaxies in our sample have experienced recent starbursts. at given stellarmass, the sizes of low mass galaxies are log- normally distributed withdispersion sigma(ln r_50) \sim 0.5, in excellent agreement with the idea thatthey form with little angular momentum loss through cooling and condensation ina gravitationally dominant dark matter halo. their median stellar surface massdensity scales with stellar mass as mu* propto m_*^0.54, suggesting that thestellar mass of a disk galaxy is proprtional to the three halves power of itshalo mass. this suggests that the efficiency of the conversion of baryons intostars in low mass galaxies increases in propor- tion to halo mass, perhaps as aresult of supernova feedback processes. at stellar masses above 3 \times 10^10m_sol, there is a rapidly increasing frac- tion of galaxies with old stellarpopulations, high surface mass densities and high concentrations typical ofbulges. in this regime, the size distribution is log-normal, but its dispersiondecreases rapidly with increasing stellar mass and the median mass surfacedensity is approximately constant. this suggests that the star formationefficiency decreases in the highest mass halos, and that little star formationoccurs in massive galaxies once they have assembled.

astro-ph;0205546	understanding the results of galaxy-galaxy lensing using galaxy-mass  correlation in numerical simulations	mckay et al. (2002) have recently used measurements of weak galaxy-galaxylensing in the sloan digital sky survey to estimate the cross correlationbetween galaxies and the projected dark matter density field. they derive arelation between aperture mass within a radius of $260\kpch$, $m_{260}$, andlens galaxy luminosity, that does not depend on galaxy luminosity, type orenvironment. in this paper, we study the cross-correlation between galaxies anddark matter using galaxy catalogs constructed from a high-resolution n-bodysimulation of a $\lambda$cdm universe. we show that our simulations reproducethe mckay et al. results reasonably well. in the simulation, $m_{260}$ isapproximately equal to the halo virial mass for $l_*$ galaxies. $m_{260}$overestimates the virial mass for fainter galaxies and underestimates it forbrighter galaxies. we use the simulations to show that under certaincircumstances the halo virial mass may be recovered by fitting an nfw profileto the projected galaxy-mass correlation function. if we apply our method tothe observations, we find that $l_*$ galaxies typically reside in halos of$\sim 2\times 10^{12} h^{-1} \msun$, consistent with halo masses estimated fromthe observed tully-fisher relation. in the simulations, the halo virial massscales with galaxy luminosity as $l^{1.5}$ for central galaxies in halos andfor galaxies in low-density regions. for satellite galaxies, and for galaxiesin high-density regions, there is no simple relation between galaxy luminosityand halo mass and care must be exercised when interpreting the lensing results.

astro-ph;0208215	multiple black holes in galactic bulges	we study the number and interaction rates of supermassive black holes ingalactic bulges as predicted by hierarchical models of galaxy formation inwhich the spheroidal components of galaxies are formed by mergers. in brightellipticals, the number of events that can eject a central supermassive binaryblack hole is large. central binaries must therefore merge in less than ahubble time -- otherwise there will be too much scatter in the m-sigma relationand too many off-center galactic nuclei. we propose that binary black holes areable to merge during the major gas accretion events that trigger qso activityin galaxies. if this is the case, less than 10 percent of faint ellipticals and40 percent of bright ellipticals are predicted to harbour binary black holeswith near equal masses at their centres. this binary may be ejected away fromthe centre of the galaxy or even into intergalactic space in up to 20 percentof the most luminous ellipticals. the number of low mass black holes that caninteract with the central object is predicted to be a strong function of galaxyluminosity. in most faint ellipticals, no black holes fall into the centre ofthe galaxy after the last major gas accretion event, but in the most luminousellipticals, an average of 10 low mass black holes interact with the centralsupermassive object after this time. it is expected that stars will be ejectedfrom galaxy cores as these low mass-ratio binaries harden. multiple black holesin galactic bulges thus provide a natural explanation for the strong systematictrends in the observed central density profiles of ellipticals as a function ofluminosity.

astro-ph;0310268	chemical enrichment of the intra-cluster and intergalactic medium in a  hierarchical galaxy formation model	(abridged) we use a combination of high resolution n-body simulations andsemi-analytic techniques to follow the formation, the evolution and thechemical enrichment of cluster galaxies in a lambda-cdm universe. we model thetransport of metals between the stars, the cold gas in galaxies, the hot gas indark matter haloes, and the intergalactic gas outside virialized haloes. wehave compared three different feedback schemes. the `retention' model assumesthat material reheated by supernova explosions is able to leave the galaxy, butnot the dark matter halo. the `ejection' model assumes that this materialleaves the halo and is then re-incorporated when structure collapses on largerscales. the `wind' model uses prescriptions that are motivated by observationsof local starburst galaxies. we require that our models reproduce the clusterlf from the 2df survey, the relations between stellar mass, gas mass andmetallicity inferred from new sdss data, and the observed amount of metals inthe icm. with suitable adjustment of the free parameters in the model, areasonable fit to the observational results at redshift zero can be obtainedfor all three feedback schemes. all three predict that the chemical enrichmentof the icm occurs at high redshift with 60-80 per cent of the metals currentlyin the icm ejected at redshifts larger than 1. massive galaxies are importantcontributors to the chemical pollution. the observed decline in baryon fractionfrom rich clusters to galaxy groups is reproduced only in an `extreme' ejectionscheme, where material ejected from dark matter haloes is re-incorporated on atimescale comparable to the age of the universe. we explore how the metalabundance in the intergalactic medium as a function of redshift can constrainthow and when galaxies ejected their metals.

astro-ph;0402030	the environmental dependence of the relations between stellar mass,  structure, star formation and nuclear activity in galaxies	we use a complete sample of galaxies drawn from the sdss to study howstructure, star formation and nuclear activity depend on local density and onstellar mass. local density is estimated by counting galaxies above a fixedabsolute magnitude limit within cylinders 2 mpc in projected radius and +-500km/s in depth. the stellar mass distribution of galaxies shifts by nearly afactor of two towards higher masses between low and high density regions. atfixed stellar mass, both star formation and nuclear activity depend strongly onlocal density, while structural parameters such as size and concentration arealmost independent of it. the galaxy property most sensitive to environment isspecific star formation rate. for galaxies with stellar masses less than 3 x10^10 m_sun, the median sfr/m* decreases by more than a factor of 10 from lowto high densities. this decrease is less marked for massive galaxies. at fixedstellar mass, twice as many galaxies host agn with strong [oiii] emission inlow density regions as in high. massive galaxies in low-density environmentsalso contain more dust. we have analyzed correlations between spectroscopicindicators that probe sfh on different timescales (d4000, hdelta_a and sfr/m*).the correlations do not depend on environment, suggesting that the decrease instar formation has ocurred over long (&gt;1 gyr) timescales. since structure doesnot depend on environment for more massive galaxies, trends in recent sfh, dustand agn for these systems cannot be driven by processes that alter structure,e.g. mergers. the sfh-density correlation is strongest for small scale (&lt; 1mpc) estimates of local density. finally, we highlight a striking similaritybetween changes in the galaxy population as a function of density and as afunction of redshift and we interpret this using n-body simulations.

0808.3683	constraints on the star formation histories of galaxies from z~1 to z~0	we present a new method to estimate the average star formation rate per unitstellar mass (ssfr) of a stacked population of galaxies. we combine the spectraof 600-1000 galaxies with similar stellar masses and parameterise the starformation history of this stacked population using a set of exponentiallydeclining functions. the strength of the hydrogen balmer absorption line seriesin the rest-frame wavelength range 3750-4150\aa is used to constrain the ssfrby comparing with a library of models generated using the bc03 stellarpopulation code. our method, based on a principal component analysis (pca), canbe applied in a consistent way to spectra drawn from local galaxy surveys andfrom surveys at $z \sim 1$, and is only weakly influenced by attenuation due todust. we apply our method to galaxy samples drawn from sdss and deep2 to studymass-dependent growth of galaxies from $z \sim 1$ to $z \sim 0$. we find that,(1) high mass galaxies have lower ssfrs than low mass galaxies; (2) the averagessfr has decreased from $z=1$ to $z=0$ by a factor of $\sim 3-4$, independentof galaxy mass. additionally, at $z \sim 1$ our average ssfrs are a factor of$2-2.5$ lower than those derived from multi-wavelength photometry using similardatasets. we then compute the average time (in units of the hubble time,$t_{\rm h}(z)$) needed by galaxies of a given mass to form their stars at theircurrent rate. at both $z=0$ and at $z=1$, this timescale decreases stronglywith stellar mass from values close to unity for galaxies with masses $\sim10^{10} m_{\odot}$, to more than ten for galaxies more massive than $ 10^{11}m_{\odot}$. our results are in good agreement with models in which agn feedbackis more efficient at preventing gas from cooling and forming stars in high massgalaxies.

astro-ph;0411354	new constraints on the star formation histories and dust attenuation of  galaxies in the local universe from galex	we derive a variety of physical parameters including star formation rates(sfrs), dust attenuation and burst mass fractions for 6472 galaxies observed bythe galaxy evolution explorer (galex) and present in the sdss dr1 mainspectroscopic sample. parameters are estimated in a statistical way bycomparing each observed broad-band sed (two galex and five sdss bands) with anextensive library of model galaxy seds, which cover a wide range of starformation histories and include stochastic starbursts. we compare theconstraints derived using sdss bands only with those derived using thecombination of sdss and galex photometry. we find that the addition of thegalex bands leads to significant improvement in the estimation of both the dustoptical depth and the star formation rate over timescales of 100 myr to 1 gyrin a galaxy. we are sensitive to sfrs as low as 10^{-3} m_sun/yr, and we findthat low levels of star formation (sf) are mostly associated with early-type,red galaxies. the least massive galaxies have ratios of current topast-averaged sf rates (b-parameter) consistent with constant sf over a hubbletime. for late-type galaxies, this ratio on average decreases with mass. wefind that b correlates tightly with nuv-r color, implying that the sf historyof a galaxy can be constrained on the basis of the nuv-r color alone. thefraction of galaxies that have undergone a significant starburst episode withinthe last 1 gyr steeply declines with mass-from ~20% for galaxies with ~10^8m_sun to ~5% for ~10^11 m_sun galaxies.

astro-ph;0412577	the properties of ultraviolet-luminous galaxies at the current epoch	we have used the first matched set of galex and sdss data to investigate theproperties of a sample of 74 nearby galaxies with far-ultraviolet luminositieschosen to overlap the luminosity range of typical high-z lyman break galaxies(lbgs). galex deep surveys have shown that ultraviolet-luminous galaxies(uvlgs) similar to these are the fastest evolving component of the uv galaxypopulation. model fits to the combined galex and sdss photometry yield typicalfuv extinctions similar to lbgs. the implied star formation rates are sfr ~ 3to 30 solar mass per year. this overlaps the range of sfrs for lbgs. we find astrong inverse correlation between galaxy mass and far-ultraviolet surfacebrightness, and on this basis divide the sample into ``large'' and ``compact''uvlgs. the compact uvlgs have half-light radii of a few kpc or less (similar tolbgs). they are relatively low mass galaxies (~10 billion solar masses) withtypical velocity dispersions of 60 to 150 km/s. they span a range inmetallicity from 0.3 to 1 times solar, have blue optical-uv colors, and areforming stars at a rate sufficient to build the present galaxy in ~a gigayear.in all these respects they appear similar to the lbg population. these ``livingfossils'' may therefore provide an opportunity for detailed investigation ofthe physical processes occurring in typical star forming galaxies in the earlyuniverse.

astro-ph;0501042	active galactic nuclei in the sloan digital sky survey: ii.  emission-line luminosity function	the emission line luminosity function of active galactic nuclei (agn) ismeasured from about 3000 agn included in the main galaxy sample of the sloandigital sky survey within a redshift range of $0&lt;z&lt;0.15$. the $\ha$ and[oiii]$\lambda 5007$ luminosity functions for seyferts cover luminosity rangeof $10^{5-9}$$l_\odot$ in h$\alpha$ and the shapes are well fit by broken powerlaws, without a turnover at fainter nuclear luminosities. assuming a universalconversion from emission line strength to continuum luminosity, the inferred bband magnitude luminosity function is comparable both to the agn luminosityfunction of previous studies and to the low redshift quasar luminosity functionderived from the 2df redshift survey. the inferred agn number density isapproximately 1/5 of all galaxies and about $6\times 10^{-3}$ of the totallight of galaxies in the $r$-band comes from the nuclear activity. the numbersof seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s are comparable at low luminosity, while at highluminosity, seyfert 1s outnumber seyfert 2s by a factor of 2-4. in making theluminosity function measurements, we assumed that the nuclear luminosity isindependent of the host galaxy luminosity, an assumption we test {\it aposteriori}, and show to be consistent with the data. given the relationshipbetween black hole mass and host galaxy bulge luminosity, the lack ofcorrelation between nuclear and host luminosity suggests that the main variablethat determines the agn luminosity is the eddington ratio, not the black holemass. this appears to be different from luminous quasars, which are most likelyto be shining near the eddington limit.

astro-ph;0502117	the colours of elliptical galaxies	we have compiled a sample of 2728 nearby ($z&lt;0.08$) elliptical galaxies withphotometry in the $g,r,i,z$ bands from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and$j,h,k$ photometry from the two micron all sky survey (2mass). stellar masses,stellar velocity dispersions and structural parameters such as sizes andsurface mass densities are also available for these objects. in order tocorrect the aperture mismatch between sdss and 2mass, we correct the sdssmagnitudes to the isophotal circular radius where the 2mass magnitudes aremeasured. we compare the correlations between optical, optical-infrared andinfrared colours and galaxy luminosity, stellar mass, velocity dispersion andsurface mass density. we find that all galaxy colours correlate more stronglywith stellar mass and velocity dispersion than with any other structuralparameter. the dispersion about these two relations is also smaller.  we also study the correlations between a variety of stellar absorption lineindices and the same set of galaxy parameters and we reach very similarconclusions. finally, we analyze correlations between absorption line indicesand colour. our results suggest that the optical colours of elliptical galaxiesare sensitive to a combination of age, metallicity and $\alpha$-enhancement,while the optical-infrared colours are sensitive to metallicity and to$\alpha$-enhancement, but are somewhat less sensitive to age.

astro-ph;0509725	the formation history of elliptical galaxies	we take advantage of the largest high-resolution simulation of cosmicstructure growth ever carried out -- the millennium simulation of theconcordance lambdacdm cosmogony -- to study how the star formation histories,ages and metallicities of elliptical galaxies depend on environment and onstellar mass. we concentrate on a galaxy formation model which is tuned to fitthe joint luminosity/colour/morphology distribution of low redshift galaxies.massive ellipticals in this model have higher metal abundances, olderluminosity-weighted ages, shorter star formation timescales, but lower assemblyredshifts than less massive systems. within clusters the typical masses, agesand metal abundances of ellipticals are predicted to decrease, on average, withincreasing distance from the cluster centre. we also quantify the effectivenumber of progenitors of ellipticals as a function of present stellar mass,finding typical numbers below 2 for m* &lt; 10^{11} msun, rising to about 5 forthe most massive systems. these findings are consistent with recentobservational results that suggest ``down-sizing'' or ``anti-hierarchical''behaviour for the star formation history of the elliptical galaxy population,despite the fact that our model includes all the standard elements ofhierarchical galaxy formation and is implemented on the standard, lambdacdmcosmogony.

astro-ph;0509873	the dependence of clustering on galaxy properties	(abridged)we use a sample of ~200,000 galaxies drawn from the sloan digitalsky survey to study how clustering depends on properties such as stellar mass(m*), colour (g-r), 4000a break strength (d4000), concentration index (c), andstellar surface mass density (\mu_*). we find that more massive galaxiescluster more strongly than less massive galaxies, with the differenceincreasing above the characteristic stellar mass of the schechter massfunction. when divided by physical quantities, galaxies with redder colours,larger d4000, higher c and larger \mu_* cluster more strongly. the clusteringdifferences are largest on small scales and for low mass galaxies. at fixedstellar mass,the dependences of clustering on colour and 4000a break strengthare similar. different results are obtained when galaxies are split byconcentration or surface density. the dependence of w(r_p) on g-r and d4000extends out to physical scales that are significantly larger than those ofindividual dark matter haloes (&gt; 5 mpc/h). this large-scale clusteringdependence is not seen for the parameters c or \mu_*. on small scales (&lt; 1mpc/h), the amplitude of the correlation function is constant for ``young''galaxies with 1.1 &lt; d4000&lt; 1.5 and a steeply rising function of age for``older'' galaxies with d4000&gt;1.5. in contrast, the dependence of the amplitudeof w(r_p) on concentration on scales less than 1 mpc/h is strongest fordisk-dominated galaxies with c&lt;2.6. this demonstrates that different processesare required to explain environmental trends in the structure and in starformation history of galaxies.

astro-ph;0509874	the dependence of the pairwise velocity dispersion on galaxy properties	(abridged) we present measurements of the pairwise velocity dispersion (pvd)for different classes of galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey. for a sampleof about 200,000 galaxies, we study the dependence of the pvd on galaxyproperties such as luminosity, stellar mass (m_*), colour (g-r), 4000a breakstrength (d4000), concentration index (c), and stellar surface mass density(\mu_*). the luminosity dependence of the pvd is in good agreement with theresults of jing &amp; b\"orner (2004) for the 2dfgrs catalog. the value of\sigma_{12} measured at k=1 h/mpc decreases as a function of increasing galaxyluminosity for galaxies fainter than l*, before increasing again for the mostluminous galaxies in our sample. each of the galaxy subsamples selectedaccording to luminosity or stellar mass is divided into two further subsamplesaccording to colour, d4000, c and \mu_*. we find that galaxies with reddercolours and higher d4000, c, and \mu_* values have larger pvds on all scalesand at all luminosities/stellar masses. the dependence of the pvd on parametersrelated to recent star formation(colour, d4000) is stronger than on parametersrelated to galaxy structure (c, \mu_*), especially on small scales and forfaint galaxies. the reddest galaxies and galaxies with high surface massdensities and intermediate concentrations have the highest pairwise peculiarvelocities, i.e. these move in the strongest gravitational fields. we concludethat the faint red population located in rich clusters is responsible for thehigh pvd values that are measured for low-luminosity galaxies on small scales.

astro-ph;0510405	gas infall and stochastic star formation in galaxies in the local  universe	we study the recent star formation histories of local galaxies by analyzingthe scatter in their colours and spectral properties. we present evidence thatthe distribution of star formation histories changes qualitatively above acharacteristic stellar surface mass density of 3x10^8 m_sol kpc^-2,corresponding to the transition between disk-dominated and bulge-dominatedgalaxies. when we average over subpopulations of galaxies with densities belowthis value, we find that subpopulations of all masses form their stars at thesame average rate per unit stellar mass. however, the scatter in galaxy coloursand emission line strengths is larger for more compact galaxies of a givenmass. this suggests that star formation occurs in shorter, higher amplitudeevents in galaxies with smaller sizes. above the characteristic density, galaxygrowth through star formation shuts down. we propose that star formation eventsare triggered when cold gas is accreted onto a galaxy. we have used the newhigh resolution millennium simulation of structure formation in a concordancelcdm universe to quantify the incidence of these accretion events and we showthat the observational data are well fit by a model in which the consumptiontime of accreted gas decreases with the surface density of the galaxy as t_cons\propto mu*^-1. the dark matter halos hosting massive galaxies with highdensities are also expected to grow through accretion, but the observationsindicate that star formation in bulge- dominated galaxies is no longer coupledto the hierarchical build-up of their surrounding dark matter halos.

astro-ph;0511164	galaxy halo masses and satellite fractions from galaxy-galaxy lensing in  the sdss: stellar mass, luminosity, morphology, and environment dependencies	the relationship between galaxies and dark matter can be characterized by thehalo mass of the central galaxy and the fraction of galaxies that aresatellites. here we present observational constraints from the sdss on thesequantities as a function of r-band luminosity and stellar mass usinggalaxy-galaxy weak lensing, with a total of 351,507 lenses. we use stellarmasses derived from spectroscopy and virial halo masses derived from weakgravitational lensing to determine the efficiency with which baryons in thehalo of the central galaxy have been converted into stars. we find that an l*galaxy with a stellar mass of 6x10^{10} m_{sun} is hosted by a halo with massof 1.4x10^{12} m_{sun}/h, independent of morphology, yielding baryon conversionefficiencies of 17_{-5}^{+10} (early types) and 16_{-6}^{+15} (late types) percent at the 95 per cent cl (statistical, not including systematic uncertaintydue to assumption of a universal initial mass function, or imf). we find thatfor a given stellar mass, the halo mass is independent of morphology belowm_{stellar}=10^{11} m_{sun}, in contrast to typically a factor of twodifference in halo mass between ellipticals and spirals at a fixed luminosity.this suggests that stellar mass is a good proxy for halo mass in this range andshould be used preferentially whenever a halo mass selected sample is needed.for higher stellar masses, the conversion efficiency is a declining function ofstellar mass, and the differences in halo mass between early and late typesbecome larger, reflecting the fact that most group and cluster halos withmasses above 10^{13} m_{sun} host ellipticals at the center, while even thebrightest central spirals are hosted by halos of mass below 10^{13} m_{sun}.(abridged)

astro-ph;0603546	modelling galaxy clustering in a high resolution simulation of structure  formation	we use the millennium simulation, a 10 billion particle simulation of thegrowth of cosmic structure, to construct a new model of galaxy clustering. weadopt a methodology that falls midway between the traditional semi-analyticapproach and the halo occupation distribution(hod) approach. in our model, weadopt the positions and velocities of the galaxies that are predicted byfollowing the orbits and merging histories of the substructures in thesimulation. rather than using star formation and feedback `recipes' to specifythe physical properties of the galaxies, we adopt parametrized functions torelate these properties to the quantity m_{infall}, defined as the mass of thehalo at the epoch when the galaxy was last the central dominant object in itsown halo. we test whether these parametrized relations allow us to recover thebasic statistical properties of galaxies in the semi-analytic catalogues,including the luminosity function, the stellar mass function and the shape andamplitude of the two-point correlation function evaluated in different stellarmass and luminosity ranges. we then use our model to interpret recentmeasurements of these quantities from sloan digital sky survey data. we deriverelations between the luminosities and the stellar masses of galaxies in thelocal universe and their host halo masses. our results are in excellentagreement with recent determinations of these relations by mandelbaum et alusing galaxy-galaxy weak lensing measurements from the sdss.

astro-ph;0607311	emission-line diagnostics of low metallicity agn	current emission-line based estimates of the metallicity of active galacticnuclei (agn) at both high and low redshifts indicate that agn havepredominantly solar to supersolar metallicities. this leads to the question: dolow metallicity agn exist? in this paper we use photoionization models toexamine the effects of metallicity variations on the narrow emission lines froman agn. we explore a variety of emission-line diagnostics that are useful foridentifying agn with low metallicity gas. we find that line ratios involving[nii] are the most robust metallicity indicators in galaxies where the primarysource of ionization is from the active nucleus. ratios involving [sii] and[oi] are strongly affected by uncertainties in modelling the density structureof the narrow line clouds. to test our diagnostics, we turn to an analysis ofagn in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we find a clear trend in therelative strength of [nii] with the mass of the agn host galaxy. themetallicity of the ism is known to be correlated with stellar mass instar-forming galaxies; our results indicate that a similar trend exists foragn. we also find that the best-fit models for typical seyfert narrow lineregions have supersolar abundances. although there is a mass-dependent range ofa factor of 2-3 in the nlr metallicities of the agn in our sample, agn withsub-solar metallicities are very rare in the sdss. out of a sample of ~23000seyfert 2 galaxies we find only ~40 clear candidates for agn with nlrabundances that are below solar.

astro-ph;0607492	the clustering of narrow-line agn in the local universe	we have analyzed the clustering of ~ 90,000 narrow-line agn drawn from thedata release 4 (dr4) of the sdss. we compute the cross-correlation between agnand a reference sample of galaxies, and compare this to results for controlsamples of inactive galaxies matched simultaneously in redshift,stellarmass,concentration, velocity dispersion and the 4000a break strength. we alsocompare near-neighbour counts around agn and around the control galaxies. onscales larger than a few mpc, agn have almost the same clustering amplitude asthe control sample. this demonstrates that agn host galaxies and inactivegalaxies populate dark matter halos of similar mass.on scales between 100kpcand 1mpc,agn are clustered more weakly than the control galaxies. we use mockcatalogues constructed from high-resolution n-body simulations to interpretthis anti-bias, showing that the observed effect is easily understood if agnare preferentially located at the centres of their dark matter halos. on scalesless than 70 kpc, agn cluster marginally more strongly than the control sample,but the effect is weak. when compared to the control sample, we find that onlyone in a hundred agn has an extra neighbour within a radius of 70 kpc. thisexcess increases as a function of the accretion rate onto the black hole, butit does not rise above the few percent level. although interactions betweengalaxies may be responsible for triggering nuclear activity in a minority ofnearby agn, some other mechanism is required to explain the activity seen inthe majority of the objects in our sample.

astro-ph;0609415	the diverse properties of the most ultraviolet luminous galaxies  discovered by the galaxy evolution explorer	we report on the properties of a sample of ultraviolet luminous galaxies(uvlgs) selected by matching the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) surveys withthe sloan digital sky survey third data release. out of 25362 galaxies between0.0&lt;z&lt;0.3 detected by galex, there are 215 galaxies with l&gt;2x10^10 l_solar at1530 angstroms (observed wavelength). the properties of this population arewell correlated with ultraviolet surface brightness. we find that the galaxieswith low uv surface brightness are primarily large spiral systems with amixture of old and young stellar populations, while the high surface brightnessgalaxies consist primarily of compact starburst systems. in terms of thebehavior of surface brightness with luminosity, size with luminosity, themass-metallicity relation, and other parameters, the compact uvlgs clearlydepart from the trends established by the full sample of galaxies. the subsetof compact uvlgs with the highest surface brightness (``supercompact uvlgs'')have characteristics that are remarkably similar to lyman break galaxies athigher redshift. they are much more luminous than typical localultraviolet-bright starburst galaxies and blue compact dwarf galaxies. theyhave metallicities that are systematically lower than normal galaxies of thesame stellar mass, indicating that they are less chemically evolved. in allthese respects, they are the best local analogs for lyman break galaxies.

astro-ph;0609436	ongoing formation of bulges and black holes in the local universe: new  insights from galex	we analyze a volume-limited sample of massive bulge-dominated galaxies withdata from both the sloan digital sky survey and the galaxy evolution explorer(galex) satellite. the galaxies have central velocity dispersions greater than100 km/s and stellar surface mass densities that lie above the value wheregalaxies transition from actively star forming to passive systems. the sampleis limited to redshifts 0.03&lt;z&lt;0.07. at these distances, the sdss spectrasample the light from the bulge-dominated central regions of the galaxies. thegalex nuv data provide high sensitivity to low rates of global star formationin these systems. our sample of bulge-dominated galaxies exhibits a much largerdispersion in nuv-r colour than in optical g-r colour. nearly all of thegalaxies with bluer nuv-r colours are agn. both galex images and sdss colourprofiles demonstrate that the excess uv light is associated with an extendeddisk. we find that galaxies with red outer regions almost never have a youngbulge or a strong agn. galaxies with blue outer regions have bulges and blackholes that span a wide range in age and accretion rate. galaxies with youngbulges and strongly accreting black holes almost always have blue outer disks.our suggested scenario is one in which the source of gas that builds the bulgeand black hole is a low mass reservoir of cold gas in the disk.the presence ofthis gas is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for bulge and black holegrowth. some mechanism must transport this gas inwards in a time variable way.as the gas in the disk is converted into stars, the galaxies will turn red, butfurther gas infall can bring them back into the blue nuv-r sequence.(abridged)

astro-ph;0611196	how special are brightest group and cluster galaxies?	we use the sloan digital sky survey to construct a sample of 625 brightestgroup and cluster galaxies (bcgs) together with control samples of non-bcgsmatched in stellar mass, redshift, and color. we investigate how the systematicproperties of bcgs depend on stellar mass and on their privileged location nearthe cluster center. the groups and clusters that we study are drawn from the c4catalogue of miller et al. (2005) but we have developed improved algorithms foridentifying the bcg and for measuring the cluster velocity dispersion. sincethe sdss photometric pipeline tends to underestimate the luminosities of largegalaxies in dense environments, we have developed a correction for this effectwhich can be readily applied to the published catalog data. we find that bcgsare larger and have higher velocity dispersions than non-bcgs of the samestellar mass, which implies that bcgs contain a larger fraction of dark matter.in contrast to non-bcgs, the dynamical mass-to-light ratio of bcgs does notvary as a function of galaxy luminosity. hence bcgs lie on a differentfundamental plane than ordinary elliptical galaxies. bcgs also follow a steeperfaber-jackson relation than non-bcgs, as suggested by models in which bcgsassemble via dissipationless mergers along preferentially radial orbits. wefind tentative evidence that this steepening is stronger in more massiveclusters. bcgs have similar mean stellar ages and metallicities to non-bcgs ofthe same mass, but they have somewhat higher alpha/fe ratios, indicating thatstar formation may have occurred over a shorter timescale in the bcgs. finally,we find that bcgs are more likely to host radio-loud active galactic nucleithan other galaxies of the same mass, but are less likely to host an opticalagn. the differences we find are more pronounced for the less massive bcgs.

astro-ph;0701218	luminosity dependence of the spatial and velocity distributions of  galaxies: semi-analytic models versus the sloan digital sky survey	by comparing semi-analytic galaxy catalogues with data from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss), we show that current galaxy formation models reproducequalitatively the dependence of galaxy clustering and pairwise peculiarvelocities on luminosity, but some subtle discrepancies with the data stillremain. the comparisons are carried out by constructing a large set of mockgalaxy redshift surveys that have the same selection function as the sdss datarelease four (dr4). the mock surveys are based on two sets of semi-analyticcatalogues presented by croton et al. and kang et al. from the mock catalogues,we measure the redshift-space projected two-point correlation function, thepower spectrum, and the pairwise velocity dispersion (pvd) in fourier space andin configuration space, for galaxies in different luminosity intervals. we thencompare these theoretical predictions with the measurements derived from thesdss dr4. on large scales and for galaxies brighter than l*, both sets of mockcatalogues agree well with the data. for fainter galaxies, however, both modelspredict stronger clustering and higher pairwise velocities than observed. wedemonstrate that this problem can be resolved if the fraction of faintsatellite galaxies in massive haloes is reduced by ~30% compared to the modelpredictions. a direct look into the model galaxy catalogues reveals that asignifcant fraction (15%) of faint galaxies ($-18&lt;m_{^{0.1}r}&lt;-17$) reside inhaloes with $m_{vir}&gt;10^{13}\msun$, and this population is predominantly red incolour. these faint red galaxies are responsible for the high pvd values oflow-luminosity galaxies on small scales.

astro-ph;0701682	modelling and interpreting the dependence of clustering on the spectral  energy distributions of galaxies	we extend our previous physically-based halo occupation distribution modelsto include the dependence of clustering on the spectral energy distributions ofgalaxies. the high resolution millennium simulation is used to specify thepositions and the velocities of the model galaxies. the stellar mass of agalaxy is assumed to depend only on m_{infall}, the halo mass when the galaxywas last the central dominant object of its halo. star formation histories areparametrized using two additional quantities that are measured from thesimulation for each galaxy: its formation time (t_{form}), and the time when itfirst becomes a satellite (t_{infall}). central galaxies begin forming stars attime t_{form} with an exponential time scale tau_c. if the galaxy becomes asatellite, its star formation declines thereafter with a new time scale tau_s.we compute 4000 \aa break strengths for our model galaxies using stellarpopulation synthesis models. by fitting these models to the observed abundancesand projected correlations of galaxies as a function of break strength in thesloan digital sky survey, we constrain tau_c and tau_s as functions of galaxystellar mass. we find that central galaxies with large stellar masses haveceased forming stars. at low stellar masses, central galaxies display a widerange of different star formation histories, with a significant fractionexperiencing recent starbursts. satellite galaxies of all masses have decliningstar formation rates, with similar e-folding times, tau_s ~ 2.5gyr. oneconsequence of this long e-folding time is that the colour-density relation ispredicted to flatten at redshifts &gt; 1.5, because star formation in the majorityof satellites has not yet declined by a significant factor. this is consistentwith recent observational results from the deep and vvds surveys.

0809.2283	environmental effects on satellite galaxies: the link between  concentration, size and colour profile	using the sdss dr4 group catalogue of yang et al. (2007), we investigatesizes, concentrations, colour gradients and surface brightness profiles ofcentral and satellite galaxies. we compare central and satellite galaxies atfixed stellar mass, in order to disentangle environmental from stellar massdependencies. early and late type galaxies are defined according toconcentration. we find that at fixed stellar mass, late type satellite galaxieshave smaller radii and larger concentrations than late type central galaxies.no such differences are found for early-type galaxies. we have also constructedsurface brightness and colour profiles for the central and satellite galaxiesin our sample. we find that late-type satellite galaxies have a lower surfacebrightness and redder colours than late-type central galaxies. we show that allobserved differences between satellite and central galaxies can be explained bya simple fading model, in which the star formation in the disk decreases overtimescales of 2-3 gyr after a galaxy becomes a satellite. processes that inducestrong morphological changes (e.g. harassment) and processes that strip thegalaxy of its entire ism need not to be invoked in order to explain theenvironmental dependencies we find.

astro-ph;9402015	constraints on models of galaxy formation from the evolution of damped  ly$\alpha$ absorption systems	there is accumulating observational evidence suggesting that dampedly$\alpha$ absorption systems systems are the progenitors of present-day spiralgalaxies. we use the observed properties of these systems to place constraintson the history of star formation in galactic disks, and on cosmologicaltheories of structure formation in the universe. we show that the observedincrease in $\omega_{hi}$ contributed by damped ly$\alpha$ systems at highredshift implies that star formation must have been considerably less efficientin the past. we also show that the data can constrain cosmological models inwhich structure forms at late epochs. a mixed dark matter (mdm) model with$\omega_{\nu}=0.3$ is unable to reproduce the mass densities of cold gas seenat high redshift, even in the absence of any star formation. we show that atredshifts greater than 3, this model predicts that the total baryonic masscontained in dark matter halos with circular velocities $v_c &gt; 35$ km s$^{-1}$is less than the observed mass of hi in damped systems. at these redshifts, thephoto-ionizing background would prevent gas from dissipating and collapsing toform high column density systems in halos smaller than 35 km s$^{-1}$. mdmmodels are thus ruled out by the observations.

astro-ph;9404051	hierarchical clustering and the butcher-oemler effect	we show that the rapid evolution in the fraction of blue, star-forminggalaxies seen in clusters as a function of redshift (the butcher-oemler effect)can be explained very simply if structure formation in the universe proceeedshierarchically. we show that a rich cluster observed at high redshift has had asignificantly different evolutionary history to a cluster of the same richnessobserved today. high redshift clusters take longer to assemble and thus under-go more merging at small lookback times. we have investigated two models ofstar formation in cluster galaxies: 1) a model in which star formation isinduced by galaxy-galaxy mergers and interactions and 2) a model in which starformation is regulated by the infall of galaxies onto larger systems such asgroups and clusters. both models produce trends consistent with the butcher-oemler effect. our models of cluster formation and evolution allow us to makepredictions about trends in the observed properties of clusters with redshift.we find that there should be a correlation between the mass of the cluster orgroup and the strength of the observed butcher-oemler effect, with more massivesystems exhibiting more evolution than less massive systems. we also predictthat both the blue galaxy fraction and the incidence of interacting galaxies inrich clusters should rise continuously with redshift. finally, we have exploredthe influence of cosmological parameters on our predictions for clusterevolution. we find that models in which structure formation occurs at veryearly epochs, such as low $\omega$ models, predict rather little recent starformation and merging activity in clusters at redshifts of around 0.4.

astro-ph;9409075	the observed properties of high-redshift cluster galaxies	we use the semi-analytic models of galaxy formation developed by kauffmann,white \&amp; guiderdoni to generate predictions for the observed properties ofcluster and group galaxies at redshifts between 0 and 0.6. we examine four setsof cosmological initial conditions: low-density cdm models with and withoutcosmological constant, a flat cdm model and a mixed dark matter model. thesemodels were selected because they span a wide range in cluster formation epoch.the semi-analytic models that we employ are able to follow both the evolutionof the dark matter component of clusters and the formation and evolution of thestellar populations of the cluster galaxies. we are thus able to generate modelpredictions that can be compared directly with the observational data. in thelow-density cdm models, clusters form at high red- shift and accrete verylittle mass at recent times. our models predict that essentially no evolutionin the observed properties of clusters will have occurred by a redshift of 0.6,in direct contradiction with the data. in contrast, in the mdm model, bothgalaxies and clusters form extremely late. this model predicts evolution whichappears to be too extreme to be in agreement with the observations. the flatcdm model, which is intermediate in structure formation epoch, is mostsuccessful. this model is able to account for the evolution of the bluefraction of rich clusters with redshift, the relationship between blue fractionand cluster richness at different epochs, and the changes in the distributionof the morphologies of cluster galaxies by a redshift of 0.4.

astro-ph;9512009	galaxy formation and large-scale bias	we outline a simple approach to understanding the physical origin of bias inthe distribution of galaxies relative to that of dark matter. the first step isto specify how collapsed, virialized halos of dark matter trace the overallmatter distribution. the next step is to make a connection between halos andthe luminous galaxies we observe. we appeal to the results of semi-analyticmodels of galaxy formation that are tuned to fit the observed luminosityfunctions of local groups and clusters. we have also used a high-resolutionn-body simulation of a cold dark matter (cdm) universe to study the biasrelation in more detail. the differences between the galaxy and dark matterdistributions are quantified using a number of different clustering statistics.we arrive at the following general conclusions: 1) a comparison of the galaxyand dark matter density fields shows that linear biasing is a good descriptionon large scales. 2) the bias factor b depends on the shape and normalization ofthe power spectrum. the lower the normalization, the larger the bias. more biasis obtained for spectra with more power on large scales. for "realistic"models, b ranges from 1 to 2.5. 3) galaxies of different luminosity ormorphology have different bias factors. 4) the scale dependence of the biasfactor is weak.

astro-ph;9512123	disk galaxies at z=0 and at high redshift: an explanation of the  observed evolution of damped ly-alpha systems	the analysis of disk formation is based on the white &amp; rees (1978) picture,in which disk galaxies form by continuous cooling and accretion of gas within amerging hierarchy of dark matter halos. a simple kennicutt law of starformation for disks, based on a single- fluid gravitational instability modelis introduced. since the gas supply in the disk is regulated by infall from thesurrounding halo, the gas is always maintained at a critical threshold surfacedensity. chemical enrichment of the disks occurs when the surrounding hot halogas is enriched with heavy elements ejected during surpernova explosions. thisgas then cools onto the disk producing a new generation of metal-rich stars.  i first show that models of this type can reproduce many of the observedproperties of a typical spiral galaxy like the milky way, including its gas andstellar surface density profiles and the observed relationship between the agesand metallicities of solar neighbourhood stars. i then use the models to makeinferences about the properties of disk galaxies at high redshift. the totalneutral hydrogen density omega(hi) increases at higher z. the predictedincrease is mild, but is roughly consistent with the latest derivation ofomega(hi) as a function of z by storrie-lombardi &amp; macmahon (1995). the modelsare also able to account for some of the other trends other trends seen in thehigh-redshift data, including the increase in the number of high column-densitysystems at high redshift, as well as the metallicity distribution of dampedlyman-alpha systems at redshifts 2-3.

astro-ph;9605136	detection of strong evolution in the population of early-type galaxies	the standard picture holds that giant elliptical galaxies formed in a singleburst at high redshift. aging of their stellar populations subsequently causedthem to fade and become redder. the canada-france redshift survey provides asample of about 125 galaxies with the luminosities and colours of passivelyevolving giant ellipticals and with 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1. this sample is inconsistentwith the standard evolutionary picture with better than 99.9% confidence. thestandard schmidt test gives &lt;v/v_{max}&gt; = 0.398 when restricted to objects withno detected star formation, and &lt;v/v_{max}&gt; = 0.410 when objects with emissionlines are also included. a smaller sample of early-type galaxies selected fromtha hawaii deep survey gives equally significant results. with increasingredshift a larger and larger fraction of the nearby elliptical and s0population must drop out of of the sample, either because the galaxies are nolonger single units or because star formation alters their colours. if theremaining fraction is modelled as f=(1+z)^{-\gamma}, the data imply gamma = 1.5+- 0.3. at z=1 only about one third of bright e and s0 galaxies were alreadyassembled and had the colours of old passively evolving systems. we discuss thesensitivity of these results to the incompleteness corrections and stellarpopulation models we have adopted. we conclude that neither is uncertain enoughto reconcile the observations with the standard picture. hierarchical galaxyformation models suggest that both merging and recent star formation play arole in the strong evolution we have detected.

astro-ph;9704148	chemical enrichment and the origin of the colour-magnitude relation of  elliptical galaxies in a hierarchical merger model	in this paper, we present a model of the formation and chemical enrichment ofelliptical galaxies that differs from the conventional picture in two ways:1)ellipticals do not form in a single monolithic collapse and burst of starformation at high redshift. instead, most of their stars form at modest ratesin disk galaxies, which then merge to form the ellipticals. 2)galaxies do notundergo closed-box chemical evolution. instead, metals can be transferredbetween the stars, cold gas and the hot gas halos of the galaxies. it isassumed that metals are ejected out of disk galaxies during supernovaexplosions and these metals enter the hot gas component. the fact that metalsare more easily ejected from small galaxies leads to the establishment of amass-metallicity relation for the disk systems. big ellipticals are more metalrich because they are formed from the mergers of bigger disks. we usesemi-analytic techniques to follow the formation, evolution, and chemicalenrichment of cluster ellipticals in a merging hierarchy of dark matter halos.the inclusion of the new metallicity-dependent spectral synthesis models ofbruzual &amp; charlot allow us to compute the colours, line indices and mass-to-light ratios of these galaxies. if feedback is assumed to be efficient, we areable to reproduce the slope and scatter of the colour-magnitude and themg2-sigma relations. we also study the evolution of these relations to highredshift. we show that the luminosity-metallicity relation remains fixed, butthe mean stellar ages of the galaxies scale with the age of the universe.finally, we study the enrichment history of the intracluster gas. we find that80% of the metals were ejected by low-mass galaxies at redshifts greater than1. the metallicity of the icm thus evolves very little out to z &gt; 1.

astro-ph;9710125	environmental influences on dark matter halos and consequences for the  galaxies within them	we use large n-body simulations of dissipationless gravitational clusteringin cold dark matter (cdm) cosmologies to study whether the properties of darkmatter halos are affected by their environment. we look for correlationsbetween the masses, formation redshifts, concentrations, shapes and spins ofhalos and the overdensity of their local environment. we also look forcorrelations of these quantities with the local tidal field. our conclusion isextremely simple. only the mass distribution varies as a function ofenvironment. this variation is well described by a simple analytic formulabased on the conditional press-schechter theory. we find no significantdependence of any other halo property on environment. our results do not dependon our choice of cosmology. according to current hierarchical models, thestructure and evolutionary history of a galaxy is fully determined by thestructure and evolutionary history of the dark halo in which it is embedded. ifthese models are correct, clustering variations between galaxies of differingmorphological types, luminosities, colours and surface brightnesses, must allarise because the halo mass function is skewed towards high mass objects inoverdense regions of the universe and towards low mass objects in underdenseregions.

astro-ph;9802233	the k-band luminosity function at z=1: a powerful constraint on galaxy  formation theory	there are two major approaches to modelling galaxy evolution. the traditionalview is that the most massive galaxies were assembled early and have evolvedwith steeply declining star formation rates since a redshift of 2 or higher.according to hierarchical theories, massive galaxies were assembled much morerecently from mergers of smaller subunits. here we present a simpleobservational test designed to differentiate between the two. the observedk-band flux from a galaxy is a good measure of its stellar mass even at highredshift. it is probably only weakly affected by dust extinction. we computethe evolution of the observed k-band luminosity function for traditional, pureluminosity evolution (ple) models and for hierarchical models. at z=0, bothmodels can fit the observed local k-band luminosity function. by redshift 1,they differ greatly in the predicted abundance of bright galaxies. we calculatethe redshift distributions of k-band selected galaxies and compare these withavailable data. we show that the number of k&lt;19 galaxies with redshifts greaterthan 1 is well below the numbers predicted by the ple models. in the songailaet al (1994) redshift sample of 118 galaxies with 16&lt;k&lt;18, 33 galaxies arepredicted to lie at z&gt;1. only 2 are observed. in the cowie et al. (1996)redshift sample of 52 galaxies with 18&lt;k&lt;19, 28 galaxies are predicted to lieat at z&gt;1. only 5 are observed. both these samples are more than 90% complete.we conclude that there is already strong evidence that the abundance of massivegalaxies at z=1 is well below the local value. this is inconsistent with thetraditional model, but similar to the expectations of hierarchical models.

astro-ph;9805283	clustering of galaxies in a hierarchical universe: i. methods and  results at z=0	we introduce a new technique for following the formation and evolution ofgalaxies in cosmological n-body simulations. dissipationless simulations areused to track the formation and merging of dark matter halos as a function ofredshift. simple prescriptions, taken directly from semi-analytic models ofgalaxy formation, are adopted for cooling, star formation, supernova feedbackand the merging of galaxies within the halos. this scheme enables us to studythe clustering properties of galaxies and to investigate how selection by type,colour or luminosity influences the results. in this paper, we study propertiesof the galaxy distribution at z=0. these include luminosity functions, colours,correlation functions, pairwise peculiar velocities, cluster m/l ratios andstar formation rates. we focus on two variants of a cdm cosmology: a high-density model with gamma=0.21 (tcdm) and a low-density model with omega=0.3 andlambda=0.7 (lcdm). both are normalized to reproduce the i-band tully-fisherrelation near a circular velocity of 220 km/s. our results depend strongly bothon this normalization and on the prescriptions for star formation and feedback.very different assumptions are required to obtain an acceptable model in thetwo cases. for tcdm, efficient feedback is required to suppress the growth ofgalaxies low-mass field halos. without it, there are too many galaxies and thecorrelation function turns over below 1 mpc. for lcdm, feedback must be weak,otherwise too few l* galaxies are produced and the correlation function is toosteep. given the uncertainties in modelling some of the key physical processes,we conclude that it is not yet possible to draw conclusions about the values ofcosmological parameters from studies of this kind. further work on global starformation and feedback effects is required to narrow the range of possibilities

0809.3310	the lopsidedness of present-day galaxies: connections to the formation  of stars, the chemical evolution of galaxies, and the growth of black holes	we have used the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) to undertake aninvestigation of lopsidedness in a sample of ~25,000 nearby galaxies (z &lt;0.06). we use the m=1 azimuthal fourier mode between the 50% and 90% lightradii as our measure of lopsidedness. the sdss spectra are used to measure theproperties of the stars, gas, and black hole in the central-most few-kpc-scaleregion. we show that there is a strong link between lopsidedness in the outerparts of the galactic disk and the youth of the stellar population in thecentral region. this link is independent of the other structural properties ofthe galaxy. these results provide a robust statistical characterization of theconnections between accretion/interactions/mergers and the resulting starformation. we also show that residuals in the galaxy mass-metallicity relationcorrelate with lopsidedness (at fixed mass, the more metal-poor galaxies aremore lopsided). this suggests that the events causing lopsidedness and enhancedstar formation deliver lower metallicity gas into the galaxy's central region.finally, we find that there is a trend for the more powerful active galacticnuclei to be hosted by more lopsided galaxies (at fixed galaxy mass, density,or concentration). however if we compare samples matched to have both the samestructures and central stellar populations, we then find no difference inlopsidedness between active and non-active galaxies. this leads to thefollowing picture. the presence of cold gas in the central region of a galaxy(irrespective of its origin) is essential for both star-formation and blackhole growth. the delivery of cold gas is aided by the processes that producelopsidedness. other processes on scales smaller than we can probe with our dataare required to transport the gas to the black hole.

astro-ph;9809168	clustering of galaxies in a hierarchical universe: ii. evolution to high  redshift	in hierarchical cosmologies the evolution of galaxy clustering depends bothon cosmological quantities such as omega and lambda, which determine how darkmatter halos form and evolve, and on the physical processes - cooling, starformation and feedback - which drive the formation of galaxies within thesemerging halos. in this paper, we combine dissipationless cosmological n-bodysimulations and semi-analytic models of galaxy formation in order to study howthese two aspects interact. we focus on the differences in clustering predictedfor galaxies of differing luminosity, colour, morphology and star formationrate and on what these differences can teach us about the galaxy formationprocess. we show that a "dip" in the amplitude of galaxy correlations betweenz=0 and z=1 can be an important diagnostic. such a dip occurs in low-densitycdm models because structure forms early and dark matter halos of 10**12 solarmasses, containing galaxies with luminosities around l*, are unbiased tracersof the dark matter over this redshift range; their clustering amplitude thenevolves similarly to that of the dark matter. at higher redshifts brightgalaxies become strongly biased and the clustering amplitude increases again.in high density models, structure forms late and bias evolves more rapidly. asa result, the clustering amplitude of l* galaxies remains constant from z=0 to1. the strength of these effects is sensitive to sample selection. the dip isweaker for galaxies with lower star formation rates, redder colours, higherluminosities and earlier morphological types. we explain why this is the caseand how it is related to the variation with redshift of the abundance and andenvironment of the observed galaxies. studies of clustering evolution as afunction of galaxy properties should place strong constraints on models.

astro-ph;9810031	evolution of elliptical galaxies in a hierarchical universe	in hierarchical models of galaxy formation, ellipticals form from the mergingof disk galaxies drawn together by gravity as their surrounding dark haloscoalesce. using semi-analytic techniques, we are able to follow the merging,star formation and chemical enrichment histories of galaxies for a given choiceof cosmological parameters. we calculate the ages and metallicities ofelliptical galaxies in a standard cdm cosmology and show that we can reproducethe observed correlation between magnitude and colour, and the scatter aboutthis relation. we also study the evolution of ellipticals to high redshift. inrich clusters, the models predict a substantial population of "evolved"ellipticals at z&gt;1. however, the average number density of bright ellipticalsmust decrease at high redshift. the rate of decrease is sensitive tocosmological parameters. in a high-density model, the abundance of brightellipticals declines by factor of 3 by z=1. in a low-density model (omega=0.3,lambda=0.7), the abundance drops by 30% at z=1, but is down by a factor 3 atz=2

astro-ph;9812009	clustering of galaxies in a hierarchical universe: iii. mock redshift  surveys	this is the third paper in a series which combines n-body simulations andsemi-analytic modelling to provide a fully spatially resolved simulation of thegalaxy formation and clustering processes. here we extract mock redshiftsurveys from our simulations: a cold dark matter model with either omega_0=1(taucdm) or omega_0=0.3 and lambda=0.7 (lambdacdm). we compare the mockcatalogues with the northern region (cfa2n) of the center for astrophysics(cfa) redshift surveys. we study the properties of galaxy groups and clustersidentified using standard observational techniques and we study the relation ofthese groups to real virialised systems. most features of cfa2n groups arereproduced quite well by both models with no obvious dependence on omega_0.redshift space correlations and pairwise velocities are also similar in the twocosmologies. the luminosity functions predicted by our galaxy formation modelsdepend sensitively on the treatment of star formation and feedback. for theparticular choices of paper i they agree poorly with the cfa survey. to isolatethe effect of this discrepancy on our mock redshift surveys, we modify galaxyluminosities in our simulations to reproduce the cfa luminosity functionexactly. this adjustment improves agreement with the observed abundance ofgroups, which depends primarily on the galaxy luminosity density, but otherstatistics, connected more closely with the underlying mass distribution,remain unaffected. regardless of the luminosity function adopted, modestdifferences with observation remain. these can be attributed to the presence ofthe ``great wall'' in the cfa2n. it is unclear whether the greater coherence ofthe real structure is a result of cosmic variance, given the relatively smallregion studied, or reflects a physical deficiency of the models.

astro-ph;9906493	a unified model for the evolution of galaxies and quasars	we incorporate a simple scheme for the growth of supermassive black holesinto semi-analytic models that follow the formation and evolution of galaxiesin a cold dark matter dominated universe. we assume that supermassive blackholes are formed and fuelled during major mergers. if two galaxies ofcomparable mass merge, their central black holes coalesce and a few percent ofthe gas in the merger remnant is accreted by the new black hole over atimescale of a few times 10^7 years. with these simple assumptions, our modelnot only fits many aspects of the observed evolution of galaxies, but alsoreproduces quantitatively the observed relation between bulge luminosity andblack hole mass in nearby galaxies, the strong evolution of the quasarpopulation with redshift and the relation between the luminosities of nearbyquasars and those of their host galaxies. the strong decline in the numberdensity of quasars from z=2 to z=0 is due to the combination of three effects:i) a decrease in the merging rate, ii) a decrease in the amount of cold gasavailable to fuel black holes, and iii) an increase in the timescale for gasaccretion. in a lcdm cosmology the predicted decline in the total content ofcold gas in galaxies is consistent with that inferred from observations ofdamped lyman-alpha systems. our results strongly suggest that the evolution ofsupermassive black holes, quasars and starbursts is inextricably linked to thehierarchical build-up of galaxies.

0810.2566	lcdm predictions for galaxy protoclusters i: the relation between  galaxies, protoclusters and quasars at z~6	motivated by recent observational studies of the environment of z~6 qsos, wehave used the millennium run (mr) simulations to construct a very large (~20deg^2) mock redshift survey of star-forming galaxies at z~6. we use thissimulated survey to study the relation between density enhancements in thedistribution of i-dropouts and lya-emitters, and their relation to the mostmassive halos and protocluster regions at z~6. our simulation predictssignificant variations in surface density across the sky with some voids andfilaments extending over scales of 1 degree, much larger than probed by currentsurveys. approximately one third of all z~6 halos hosting i-dropouts brighterthan z=26.5 mag (~m* at z=6) become part of z=0 galaxy clusters. i-dropoutsassociated with protocluster regions are found in regions where the surfacedensity is enhanced on scales ranging from a few to several tens of arcminuteson the sky. we analyze two structures of i-dropouts and lya-emitters observedwith the subaru telescope and show that these structures must be the seeds ofmassive clusters-in-formation. in striking contrast, six z~6 qso fieldsobserved with hst show no significant enhancements in their i-dropout numbercounts. with the present data, we cannot rule out the qsos being hosted by themost massive halos. however, neither can we confirm this widely usedassumption. we conclude by giving detailed recommendations for theinterpretation and planning of observations by current and future ground- andspace based instruments that will shed new light on questions related to thelarge-scale structure at z~6.

0811.1219	the growth of supermassive black holes in pseudo-bulges, classical  bulges and elliptical galaxies	using results from structural analysis of a sample of nearly 1000 localgalaxies from the sloan digital sky survey, we estimate how the mass in centralblack holes is distributed amongst elliptical galaxies, classical bulges andpseudo-bulges, and investigate the relation between their stellar masses andcentral stellar velocity dispersion sigma. assuming a single relation betweenelliptical galaxy/bulge mass, m_bulge, and central black hole mass, m_bh, wefind that 55^{+8}_{-4} per cent of the mass in black holes in the localuniverse is in the centres of elliptical galaxies, 41^{+4}_{-2} per cent inclassical bulges and 4^{+0.9}_{-0.4} per cent in pseudo-bulges. we find thatellipticals, classical bulges and pseudo-bulges follow different relationsbetween their stellar masses and sigma, and the most significant offset occursfor pseudo-bulges in barred galaxies. this structural dissimilarity leads todiscrepant black hole masses if single m_bh-m_bulge and m_bh-sigma relationsare used. adopting relations from the literature, we find that the m_bh-sigmarelation yields an estimate of the total mass density in black holes that isroughly 55 per cent larger than if the m_bh-m_bulge relation is used.

0812.1224	feast and famine: regulation of black hole growth in low redshift  galaxies	we analyze the observed distribution of eddington ratios as a function ofsupermassive black hole mass for a large sample of nearby galaxies drawn fromthe sloan digital sky survey. we demonstrate that there are two distinctregimes of black hole growth in nearby galaxies. the first is associated withgalaxies with significant star formation in their central kiloparsec regions,and is characterized by a broad log-normal distribution of accretion ratespeaked at about one percent of the eddington limit. in this regime, theeddington ratio distribution is independent of the mass of the black hole andshows no further dependence on the central stellar population of the galaxy.the second regime is associated with galaxies with old central stellarpopulations, and is characterized by a power-law distribution function ofeddington ratios. in this regime, the time-averaged mass accretion rate ontoblack holes is proportional to the mass of stars in the galaxy bulge, with aconstant of proportionality that depends on the mean stellar age of the stars.this result is once again independent of black hole mass. we show that both theslope of the power-law and the decrease in the accretion rate onto black holesin old galaxies are consistent with population synthesis model predictions ofthe decline in stellar mass loss rates as a function of mean stellar age. ourresults lead to a very simple picture of black hole growth in the localuniverse. if the supply of cold gas in a galaxy bulge is plentiful, the blackhole regulates its own growth at a rate that does not further depend on theproperties of the interstellar medium. once the gas runs out, black hole growthis regulated by the rate at which evolved stars lose their mass.
