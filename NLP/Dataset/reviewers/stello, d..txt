0906.0766	radius determination of solar-type stars using asteroseismology: what to  expect from the kepler mission	for distant stars, as observed by the nasa kepler satellite, parallaxinformation is currently of fairly low quality and is not complete. this limitsthe precision with which the absolute sizes of the stars and their potentialtransiting planets can be determined by traditional methods. asteroseismologywill be used to aid the radius determination of stars observed during nasa'skepler mission. we report on the recent asteroflag hare-and-hounds exercise#2,where a group of `hares' simulated data of f-k main-sequence stars that a groupof `hounds' sought to analyze, aimed at determining the stellar radii. based onthe asteroseismic large frequency spacing, obtained from simulations of 4-yeartime series data from the kepler mission, we demonstrate that the stellar radiican be correctly and precisely determined, when combined with traditionalstellar parameters from the kepler input catalogue. the radii found by thevarious methods used by each independent hound generally agree with the truevalues of the artificial stars to within 3%, when the large frequency spacingis used. this is 5--10 times better than the results where seismology is notapplied. these results give strong confidence that radius estimation can beperformed to better than 3% for solar-like stars using automatic pipelinereduction. even when the stellar distance and luminosity are unknown we canobtain the same level of agreement.

1001.0229	solar-like oscillations in low-luminosity red giants: first results from  kepler	we have measured solar-like oscillations in red giants using time-seriesphotometry from the first 34 days of science operations of the kepler mission.the light curves, obtained with 30-minute sampling, reveal clear oscillationsin a large sample of g and k giants, extending in luminosity from the red clumpdown to the bottom of the giant branch. we confirm a strong correlation betweenthe large separation of the oscillations (delta nu) and the frequency ofmaximum power (nu_max). we focus on a sample of 50 low-luminosity stars (nu_max&gt; 100 muhz, l &lt;~ 30 l_sun) having high signal-to-noise ratios and showing theunambiguous signature of solar-like oscillations. these are h-shell-burningstars, whose oscillations should be valuable for testing models of stellarevolution and for constraining the star-formation rate in the local disk. weuse a new technique to compare stars on a single echelle diagram by scalingtheir frequencies and find well-defined ridges corresponding to radial andnon-radial oscillations, including clear evidence for modes with angular degreel=3. measuring the small separation between l=0 and l=2 allows us to plot theso-called c-d diagram of delta nu_02 versus delta nu. the small separationdelta nu_01 of l=1 from the midpoint of adjacent l=0 modes is negative,contrary to the sun and solar-type stars. the ridge for l=1 is notablybroadened, which we attribute to mixed modes, confirming theoreticalpredictions for low-luminosity giants. overall, the results demonstrate thetremendous potential of kepler data for asteroseismology of red giants.

1010.4566	asteroseismology of red giants from the first four months of kepler  data: global oscillation parameters for 800 stars	we have studied solar-like oscillations in ~800 red-giant stars using keplerlong-cadence photometry. the sample includes stars ranging in evolution fromthe lower part of the red-giant branch to the helium main sequence. weinvestigate the relation between the large frequency separation (delta nu) andthe frequency of maximum power (nu_max) and show that it is different for redgiants than for main-sequence stars, which is consistent with evolutionarymodels and scaling relations. the distributions of nu_max and delta nu are inqualitative agreement with a simple stellar population model of the keplerfield, including the first evidence for a secondary clump populationcharacterized by m ~&gt; 2 m_sun and nu_max ~ 40-110 muhz. we measured the smallfrequency separations delta nu_02 and delta nu_01 in over 400 stars and deltanu_03 in over 40. we present c-d diagrams for l=1, 2 and 3 and show that thefrequency separation ratios delta nu_02/delta nu and delta nu_01/delta nu haveopposite trends as a function of delta nu. the data show a narrowing of the l=1ridge towards lower nu_max, in agreement with models predicting more efficientmode trapping in stars with higher luminosity. we investigate the offsetepsilon in the asymptotic relation and find a clear correlation with delta nu,demonstrating that it is related to fundamental stellar parameters. finally, wepresent the first amplitude-nu_max relation for kepler red giants. we observe alack of low-amplitude stars for nu_max ~&gt; 110 muhz and find that, for a givennu_max between 40-110 muhz, stars with lower delta nu (and consequently highermass) tend to show lower amplitudes than stars with higher delta nu.

1107.0490	amplitudes of solar-like oscillations: constraints from red giants in  open clusters observed by kepler	scaling relations that link asteroseismic quantities to global stellarproperties are important for gaining understanding of the intricate physicsthat underpins stellar pulsation. the common notion that all stars in an opencluster have essentially the same distance, age, and initial composition,implies that the stellar parameters can be measured to much higher precisionthan what is usually achievable for single stars. this makes clusters ideal forexploring the relation between the mode amplitude of solar-like oscillationsand the global stellar properties. we have analyzed data obtained with nasa'skepler space telescope to study solar-like oscillations in 100 red giant starslocated in either of the three open clusters, ngc 6791, ngc 6819, and ngc 6811.by fitting the measured amplitudes to predictions from simple scaling relationsthat depend on luminosity, mass, and effective temperature, we find that thedata cannot be described by any power of the luminosity-to-mass ratio aspreviously assumed. as a result we provide a new improved empirical relationwhich treats luminosity and mass separately. this relation turns out to alsowork remarkably well for main-sequence and subgiant stars. in addition, themeasured amplitudes reveal the potential presence of a number of previouslyunknown unresolved binaries in the red clump in ngc 6791 and ngc 6819, pointingto an interesting new application for asteroseismology as a probe into theformation history of open clusters.

1109.1194	granulation in red giants: observations by the kepler mission and 3d  convection simulations	the granulation pattern that we observe on the surface of the sun is due tohot plasma from the interior rising to the photosphere where it cools down, anddescends back into the interior at the edges of granules. this is the visiblemanifestation of convection taking place in the outer part of the solarconvection zone. because red giants have deeper convection zones and moreextended atmospheres than the sun, we cannot a priori assume that granulationin red giants is a scaled version of solar granulation. until now, neitherobservations nor 1d analytical convection models could put constraints ongranulation in red giants. however, thanks to asteroseismology, this study cannow be performed. the resulting parameters yield physical information about thegranulation. we analyze \sim1000 red giants that have been observed by keplerduring 13 months. we fit the power spectra with harvey-like profiles toretrieve the characteristics of the granulation (time scale tau_gran and powerp_gran). we also introduce a new time scale, tau_eff, which takes into accountthat different slopes are used in the harvey functions. we search for acorrelation between these parameters and the global acoustic-mode parameter(the position of maximum power, nu_max) as well as with stellar parameters(mass, radius, surface gravity (log g) and effective temperature (t_eff)). weshow that tau_eff nu_max^{-0.89} and p_gran nu_max^{-1.90}, which is consistentwith the theoretical predictions. we find that the granulation time scales ofstars that belong to the red clump have similar values while the time scales ofstars in the red-giant branch are spread in a wider range. finally, we showthat realistic 3d simulations of the surface convection in stars, spanning the(t_eff, log g)-range of our sample of red giants, match the kepler observationswell in terms of trends.

1202.2844	a uniform asteroseismic analysis of 22 solar-type stars observed by  kepler	asteroseismology with the kepler space telescope is providing not only animproved characterization of exoplanets and their host stars, but also a newwindow on stellar structure and evolution for the large sample of solar-typestars in the field. we perform a uniform analysis of 22 of the brightestasteroseismic targets with the highest signal-to-noise ratio observed for 1month each during the first year of the mission, and we quantify the precisionand relative accuracy of asteroseismic determinations of the stellar radius,mass, and age that are possible using various methods. we present theproperties of each star in the sample derived from an automated analysis of theindividual oscillation frequencies and other observational constraints usingthe asteroseismic modeling portal (amp), and we compare them to the results ofmodel-grid-based methods that fit the global oscillation properties. we findthat fitting the individual frequencies typically yields asteroseismic radiiand masses to \sim1% precision, and ages to \sim2.5% precision (respectively 2,5, and 8 times better than fitting the global oscillation properties). theabsolute level of agreement between the results from different approaches isalso encouraging, with model-grid-based methods yielding slightly smallerestimates of the radius and mass and slightly older values for the stellar agerelative to amp, which computes a large number of dedicated models for eachstar. the sample of targets for which this type of analysis is possible willgrow as longer data sets are obtained during the remainder of the mission.

1203.0611	accurate parameters of 93 solar-type kepler targets	we present a detailed spectroscopic study of 93 solar-type stars that aretargets of the nasa/kepler mission and provide detailed chemical composition ofeach target. we find that the overall metallicity is well-represented by felines. relative abundances of light elements (cno) and alpha-elements aregenerally higher for low-metallicity stars. our spectroscopic analysis benefitsfrom the accurately measured surface gravity from the asteroseismic analysis ofthe kepler light curves. the log g parameter is known to better than 0.03 dexand is held fixed in the analysis. we compare our teff determination with arecent colour calibration of v-k (tycho v magnitude minus 2mass ks magnitude)and find very good agreement and a scatter of only 80 k, showing that for othernearby kepler targets this index can be used. the asteroseismic log g valuesagree very well with the classical determination using fe1-fe2 balance,although we find a small systematic offset of 0.08 dex (asteroseismic log gvalues are lower). the abundance patterns of metals, alpha elements, and thelight elements (cno) show that a simple scaling by [fe/h] is adequate torepresent the metallicity of the stars, except for the stars with metallicitybelow -0.3, where alpha-enhancement becomes important. however, this is onlyimportant for a very small fraction of the kepler sample. we thereforerecommend that a simple scaling with [fe/h] be employed in the asteroseismicanalyses of large ensembles of solar-type stars.

1203.0689	probing the core structure and evolution of red giants using  gravity-dominated mixed modes observed with kepler	we report for the first time a parametric fit to the pattern of the \ell = 1mixed modes in red giants, which is a powerful tool to identifygravity-dominated mixed modes. with these modes, which share thecharacteristics of pressure and gravity modes, we are able to probe directlythe helium core and the surrounding shell where hydrogen is burning. we proposetwo ways for describing the so-called mode bumping that affects the frequenciesof the mixed modes. firstly, a phenomenological approach is used to describethe main features of the mode bumping. alternatively, a quasi-asymptoticmixed-mode relation provides a powerful link between seismic observations andthe stellar interior structure. we used period \'echelle diagrams to emphasizethe detection of the gravity-dominated mixed modes. the asymptotic relation formixed modes is confirmed. it allows us to measure the gravity-mode periodspacings in more than two hundred red giant stars. the identification of thegravity-dominated mixed modes allows us to complete the identification of allmajor peaks in a red giant oscillation spectrum, with significant consequencesfor the true identification of \ell = 3 modes, of \ell = 2 mixed modes, for themode widths and amplitudes, and for the \ell = 1 rotational splittings. theaccurate measurement of the gravity-mode period spacing provides an effectiveprobe of the inner, g-mode cavity. the derived value of the couplingcoefficient between the cavities is different for red giant branch and clumpstars. this provides a probe of the hydrogen-shell burning region thatsurrounds the helium core. core contraction as red giants ascend the red giantbranch can be explored using the variation of the gravity-mode spacing as afunction of the mean large separation.

1205.4071	age and helium content of the open cluster ngc 6791 from multiple  eclipsing binary members. ii. age dependencies and new insights	models of stellar structure and evolution can be constrained by measuringaccurate parameters of detached eclipsing binaries in open clusters. multiplebinary stars provide the means to determine helium abundances in these oldstellar systems, and in turn, to improve estimates of their age. in the firstpaper of this series, we demonstrated how measurements of multiple eclipsingbinaries in the old open cluster ngc6791 sets tighter constraints on theproperties of stellar models than has previously been possible, therebypotentially improving both the accuracy and precision of the cluster age. herewe add additional constraints and perform an extensive model comparison todetermine the best estimates of the cluster age and helium content, employingas many observational constraints as possible. we improve our photometry andcorrect empirically for differential reddening effects. we then perform anextensive comparison of the cmds and eclipsing binary measurements to victoriaand dsep isochrones to estimate cluster parameters. we also reanalyse aspectrum of the star 2-17 to improve [fe/h] constraints. we find a bestestimate of the age of ~8.3 gyr while demonstrating that remaining ageuncertainty is dominated by uncertainties in the cno abundances. the heliummass fraction is well constrained at y = 0.30 \pm 0.01 resulting in dy/dz ~ 1.4assuming that such a relation exists. during the analysis we firmly identifyblue straggler stars, including the star 2-17, and find indications for thepresence of their evolved counterparts. our analysis supports the rgb mass-lossfound from asteroseismology and we determine precisely the absolute mass ofstars on the lower rgb, 1.15\pm0.02msun. this will be an important consistencycheck for the detailed asteroseismology of cluster stars.

1206.3841	a pulsation zoo in the hot subdwarf b star kic 10139564 observed by  kepler	we present our analyses of 15 months of kepler data on kic 10139564. wedetected 57 periodicities with a variety of properties not previously observedall together in one pulsating subdwarf b star. ten of the periodicities werefound in the low-frequency region, and we associate them with nonradialg-modes. the other periodicities were found in the high-frequency region, whichare likely p-modes. we discovered that most of the periodicities are componentsof multiplets with a common spacing. assuming that multiplets are caused byrotation, we derive a rotation period of 25.6(1.8) days. the multiplets alsoallow us to identify the pulsations to an unprecedented extent for this classof pulsator. we also detect l&lt;=2 multiplets, which are sensitive to thepulsation inclination and can constrain limb darkening via geometriccancellation factors. while most periodicities are stable, we detected severalregions that show complex patterns. detailed analyses showed these regions arecomplicated by several factors. two are combination frequencies that originatein the supernyquist region and were found to be reflected below the nyquistfrequency. the fourier peaks are clear in the supernyquist region, but theorbital motion of kepler smears the nyquist frequency in the barycentricreference frame and this effect is passed on to the subnyquist reflections.others are likely multiplets but unstable in amplitudes and/or frequencies. thedensity of periodicities also make kic 10139564 challenging to explain usingpublished models. this menagerie of properties should provide tight constraintson structural models, making this subdwarf b star the most promising forapplying asteroseismology.

1207.0615	solar-like oscillations in red giants observed with \textit{kepler}:  influence of increased timespan on global oscillation parameters	the length of the asteroseismic timeseries obtained from the kepler satelliteanalysed here span 19 months. kepler provides the longest continuous timeseriescurrently available, which calls for a study of the influence of the increasedtimespan on the accuracy and precision of the obtained results. we find that ingeneral a minimum of the order of 400 day long timeseries are necessary toobtain reliable results for the global oscillation parameters in more than 95%of the stars, but this does depend on &lt;dnu&gt;. in a statistical sense the quoteduncertainties seem to provide a reasonable indication of the precision of theobtained results in short (50-day) runs, they do however seem to beoverestimated for results of longer runs. furthermore, the differentdefinitions of the global parameters used in the different methods havenon-negligible effects on the obtained values. additionally, we show that thereis a correlation between nu_max and the flux variance. we conclude that longertimeseries improve the likelihood to detect oscillations with automated codes(from ~60% in 50 day runs to &gt; 95% in 400 day runs with a slight methoddependence) and the precision of the obtained global oscillation parameters.the trends suggest that the improvement will continue for even longertimeseries than the 600 days considered here, with a reduction in the medianabsolute deviation of more than a factor of 10 for an increase in timespan from50 to 2000 days (the currently foreseen length of the mission). this work showsthat global parameters determined with high precision - thus from long datasets- using different definitions can be used to identify the evolutionary state ofthe stars.

1208.6294	verifying asteroseismically determined parameters of kepler stars using  hipparcos parallaxes: self-consistent stellar properties and distances	accurately determining the properties of stars is of prime importance forcharacterizing stellar populations in our galaxy. the field of asteroseismologyhas been thought to be particularly successful in such an endeavor for stars indifferent evolutionary stages. however, to fully exploit its potential, robustmethods for estimating stellar parameters are required and independentverification of the results is mandatory. with this purpose, we present a newtechnique to obtain stellar properties by coupling asteroseismic analysis withthe infrared flux method. by using two global seismic observables andmulti-band photometry, the technique allows us to obtain masses, radii,effective temperatures, bolometric fluxes, and hence distances for field starsin a self-consistent manner. we apply our method to 22 solar-like oscillatorsin the kepler short-cadence sample, that have accurate hipparcos parallaxes.our distance determinations agree to better than 5%, while measurements ofspectroscopic effective temperatures and interferometric radii also validateour results. we briefly discuss the potential of our technique for stellarpopulation analysis and models of galactic chemical evolution.

1209.3336	spin down of the core rotation in red giants	the space mission kepler provides us with long and uninterrupted photometrictime series of red giants. we are now able to probe the rotational behaviour intheir deep interiors using the observations of mixed modes. we aim to measurethe rotational splittings in red giants and to derive scaling relations forrotation related to seismic and fundamental stellar parameters. we havedeveloped a dedicated method for automated measurements of the rotationalsplittings in a large number of red giants. ensemble asteroseismology, namelythe examination of a large number of red giants at different stages of theirevolution, allows us to derive global information on stellar evolution. we havemeasured rotational splittings in a sample of about 300 red giants. we havealso shown that these splittings are dominated by the core rotation. under theassumption that a linear analysis can provide the rotational splitting, weobserve a small increase of the core rotation of stars ascending the red giantbranch. alternatively, an important slow down is observed for red-clump starscompared to the red giant branch. we also show that, at fixed stellar radius,the specific angular momentum increases with increasing stellar mass. ensembleasteroseismology indicates what has been indirectly suspected for a while: ourinterpretation of the observed rotational splittings leads to the conclusionthat the mean core rotation significantly slows down during the red giantphase. the slow-down occurs in the last stages of the red giant branch. thisspinning down explains, for instance, the long rotation periods measured inwhite dwarfs

1305.6586	asteroseismic surface gravity for evolved stars	context: asteroseismic surface gravity values can be of importance indetermining spectroscopic stellar parameters. the independent log(g) value fromasteroseismology can be used as a fixed value in the spectroscopic analysis toreduce uncertainties due to the fact that log(g) and effective temperature cannot be determined independently from spectra. since 2012, a combined analysisof seismically and spectroscopically derived stellar properties is ongoing fora large survey with sdss/apogee and kepler. therefore, knowledge of anypotential biases and uncertainties in asteroseismic log(g) values is nowbecoming important. aims: the seismic parameter needed to derive log(g) is thefrequency of maximum oscillation power (nu_max). here, we investigate theinfluence of nu_max derived with different methods on the derived log(g)values. the large frequency separation between modes of the same degree andconsecutive radial orders (dnu) is often used as an additional constraint forthe determination of log(g). additionally, we checked the influence of smallcorrections applied to dnu on the derived values of log(g). methods we usemethods extensively described in the literature to determine nu_max and dnutogether with seismic scaling relations and grid-based modeling to derivelog(g). results: we find that different approaches to derive oscillationparameters give results for log(g) with small, but different, biases forred-clump and red-giant-branch stars. these biases are well within the quoteduncertainties of ~0.01 dex (cgs). corrections suggested in the literature tothe dnu scaling relation have no significant effect on log(g). however somewhatunexpectedly, method specific solar reference values induce biases of the orderof the uncertainties, which is not the case when canonical solar referencevalues are used.

1309.0702	kepler white paper: asteroseismology of solar-like oscillators in a  2-wheel mission	we comment on the potential for continuing asteroseismology of solar-type andred-giant stars in a 2-wheel kepler mission. our main conclusion is that bytargeting stars in the ecliptic it should be possible to perform high-qualityasteroseismology, as long as favorable scenarios for 2-wheel pointingperformance are met. targeting the ecliptic would potentially facilitate uniquescience that was not possible in the nominal mission, notably from the study ofclusters that are significantly brighter than those in the kepler field. ourconclusions are based on predictions of 2-wheel observations made by a spacephotometry simulator, with information provided by the kepler project used asinput to describe the degraded pointing scenarios. we find that elevated levelsof frequency-dependent noise, consistent with the above scenarios, would have asignificant negative impact on our ability to continue asteroseismic studies ofsolar-like oscillators in the kepler field. however, the situation may be muchmore optimistic for observations in the ecliptic, provided that pointing resetsof the spacecraft during regular desaturations of the two functioning reactionwheels are accurate at the &lt; 1 arcsec level. this would make it possible toapply a post-hoc analysis that would recover most of the lost photometricprecision. without this post-hoc correction---and the accurate re-pointing itrequires---the performance would probably be as poor as in the kepler-fieldcase. critical to our conclusions for both fields is the assumed level ofpointing noise (in the short-term jitter and the longer-term drift). we suggestthat further tests will be needed to clarify our results once more detail anddata on the expected pointing performance becomes available, and we offer ourassistance in this work.

1311.6990	study of kic 8561221 observed by kepler: an early red giant showing  depressed dipolar modes	the continuous high-precision photometric observations provided by the corotand kepler space missions have allowed us to better understand the structureand dynamics of red giants using asteroseismic techniques. a small fraction ofthese stars shows dipole modes with unexpectedly low amplitudes. the reductionin amplitude is more pronounced for stars with higher frequency of maximumpower. in this work we want to characterize kic 8561221 in order to confirmthat it is currently the least evolved star among this peculiar subset and todiscuss several hypotheses that could help explain the reduction of the dipolemode amplitudes. we used kepler short- and long-cadence data combined withspectroscopic observations to infer the stellar structure and dynamics of kic8561221. we then discussed different scenarios that could contribute to thereduction of the dipole amplitudes such as a fast rotating interior or theeffect of a magnetic field on the properties of the modes. we also performed adetailed study of the inertia and damping of the modes. we have been able tocharacterize 37 oscillations modes, in particular, a few dipole modes abovenu_max that exhibit nearly normal amplitudes. we have inferred a surfacerotation period of around 91 days and uncovered the existence of a variation inthe surface magnetic activity during the last 4 years. as expected, theinternal regions of the star probed by the l = 2 and 3 modes spin 4 to 8 timesfaster than the surface. with our grid of standard models we are able toproperly fit the observed frequencies. our model calculation of mode inertiaand damping give no explanation for the depressed dipole modes. a fast rotatingcore is also ruled out as a possible explanation. finally, we do not have anyobservational evidence of the presence of a strong deep magnetic field insidethe star.

1401.4195	masses, radii, and orbits of small kepler planets: the transition from  gaseous to rocky planets	we report on the masses, sizes, and orbits of the planets orbiting 22 keplerstars. there are 49 planet candidates around these stars, including 42 detectedthrough transits and 7 revealed by precise doppler measurements of the hoststars. based on an analysis of the kepler brightness measurements, along withhigh-resolution imaging and spectroscopy, doppler spectroscopy, and (for 11stars) asteroseismology, we establish low false-positive probabilities for allof the transiting planets (41 of 42 have a false-positive probability under1%), and we constrain their sizes and masses. most of the transiting planetsare smaller than 3x the size of earth. for 16 planets, the doppler signal wassecurely detected, providing a direct measurement of the planet's mass. for theother 26 planets we provide either marginal mass measurements or upper limitsto their masses and densities; in many cases we can rule out a rockycomposition. we identify 6 planets with densities above 5 g/cc, suggesting amostly rocky interior for them. indeed, the only planets that are compatiblewith a purely rocky composition are smaller than ~2 r_earth. larger planetsevidently contain a larger fraction of low-density material (h, he, and h2o).

1403.2754	stroemgren survey for asteroseismology and galactic archaeology: let the  saga begin	asteroseismology has the capability of precisely determining stellarproperties which would otherwise be inaccessible, such as radii, masses andthus ages of stars. when coupling this information with classicaldeterminations of stellar parameters, such as metallicities, effectivetemperatures and angular diameters, powerful new diagnostics for galacticstudies can be obtained. the ongoing stroemgren survey for asteroseismology andgalactic archaeology (saga) has the goal of transforming the kepler field intoa new benchmark for galactic studies, similarly to the solar neighborhood. herewe present first results from a stripe centred at galactic longitude 74deg andcovering latitude from about 8 to 20deg, which includes almost 1000 k-giantswith seismic information and the benchmark open cluster ngc 6819. we describethe coupling of classical and seismic parameters, the accuracy as well as thecaveats of the derived effective temperatures, metallicities, distances,surface gravities, masses, and radii. confidence in the achieved precision iscorroborated by the detection of the first and secondary clump in a populationof field stars with a ratio of 2 to 1, and by the negligible scatter in theseismic distances among ngc 6819 member stars. an assessment of the reliabilityof stellar parameters in the kepler input catalogue is also performed, and theimpact of our results for population studies in the milky way is discussed,along with the importance of an all-sky stroemgren survey.

1405.5374	impact on asteroseismic analyses of regular gaps in kepler data	the nasa kepler mission has observed more than 190,000 stars in theconstellations of cygnus and lyra. around 4 years of almost continuous ultrahigh-precision photometry have been obtained reaching a duty cycle higher than90% for many of these stars. however, almost regular gaps due to nominaloperations are present in the light curves at different time scales. in thispaper we want to highlight the impact of those regular gaps in asteroseismicanalyses and we try to find a method that minimizes their effect in thefrequency domain. to do so, we isolate the two main time scales of quasiregular gaps in the data. we then interpolate the gaps and we compare the powerdensity spectra of four different stars: two red giants at different stages oftheir evolution, a young f-type star, and a classical pulsator in theinstability strip. the spectra obtained after filling the gaps in the selectedsolar-like stars show a net reduction in the overall background level, as wellas a change in the background parameters. the inferred convective propertiescould change as much as 200% in the selected example, introducing a bias in thep-mode frequency of maximum power. when global asteroseismic scaling relationsare used, this bias can lead up to a variation in the surface gravity of 0.05dex. finally, the oscillation spectrum in the classical pulsator is cleanercompared to the original one.

1406.0003	non-radial oscillations in m-giant semi-regular variables: stellar  models and kepler observations	the success of asteroseismology relies heavily on our ability to identify thefrequency patterns of stellar oscillation modes. for stars like the sun this isrelatively easy because the mode frequencies follow a regular pattern describedby a well-founded asymptotic relation. when a solar like star evolves off themain sequence and onto the red giant branch its structure changes dramaticallyresulting in changes in the frequency pattern of the modes. we follow theevolution of the adiabatic frequency pattern from the main sequence to near thetip of the red giant branch for a series of models. we find a significantdeparture from the asymptotic relation for the non-radial modes near the redgiant branch tip, resulting in a triplet frequency pattern. to support ourinvestigation we analyze almost four years of kepler data of the most luminousstars in the field (late k and early m type) and find that their frequencyspectra indeed show a triplet pattern dominated by dipole modes even for themost luminous stars in our sample. our identification explains previous resultsfrom ground-based observations reporting fine structure in the petersen diagramand sub ridges in the period-luminosity diagram. finally, we find `new ridges'of non-radial modes with frequencies below the fundamental mode in our modelcalculations, and we speculate they are related to f modes.

1411.1082	mixed modes in red giants: a window on stellar evolution	the detection of oscillations with a mixed character in subgiants and redgiants allows us to probe the physical conditions in their cores. with thesemixed modes, we aim at determining seismic markers of stellar evolution. keplerasteroseismic data were selected to map various evolutionary stages and stellarmasses. seismic evolutionary tracks were then drawn with the combination of thefrequency and period spacings. we measured the asymptotic period spacing formore than 1170 stars at various evolutionary stages. this allows us to monitorstellar evolution from the main sequence to the asymptotic giant branch anddraw seismic evolutionary tracks. we present clear quantified asteroseismicdefinitions that characterize the change in the evolutionary stages, inparticular the transition from the subgiant stage to the early red giantbranch, and the end of the horizontal branch.the seismic information is soprecise that clear conclusions can be drawn independently of evolution models.the quantitative seismic information can now be used for stellar modeling,especially for studying the energy transport in the helium-burning core or forspecifying the inner properties of stars entering the red or asymptotic giantbranches. modeling will also allow us to study stars that are identified to bein the helium-subflash stage, high-mass stars either arriving or quitting thesecondary clump, or stars that could be in the blue-loop stage.

1501.06227	an ancient extrasolar system with five sub-earth-size planets	the chemical composition of stars hosting small exoplanets (with radii lessthan four earth radii) appears to be more diverse than that of gas-giant hosts,which tend to be metal-rich. this implies that small, including earth-size,planets may have readily formed at earlier epochs in the universe's historywhen metals were more scarce. we report kepler spacecraft observations ofkepler-444, a metal-poor sun-like star from the old population of the galacticthick disk and the host to a compact system of five transiting planets withsizes between those of mercury and venus. we validate this system as a truefive-planet system orbiting the target star and provide a detailedcharacterization of its planetary and orbital parameters based on an analysisof the transit photometry. kepler-444 is the densest star with detectedsolar-like oscillations. we use asteroseismology to directly measure a preciseage of 11.2+/-1.0 gyr for the host star, indicating that kepler-444 formed whenthe universe was less than 20% of its current age and making it the oldestknown system of terrestrial-size planets. we thus show that earth-size planetshave formed throughout most of the universe's 13.8-billion-year history,leaving open the possibility for the existence of ancient life in the galaxy.the age of kepler-444 not only suggests that thick-disk stars were among thehosts to the first galactic planets, but may also help to pinpoint thebeginning of the era of planet formation.

1501.07869	koi-3158: the oldest known system of terrestrial-size planets	the first discoveries of exoplanets around sun-like stars have fueled effortsto find ever smaller worlds evocative of earth and other terrestrial planets inthe solar system. while gas-giant planets appear to form preferentially aroundmetal-rich stars, small planets (with radii less than four earth radii) canform under a wide range of metallicities. this implies that small, includingearth-size, planets may have readily formed at earlier epochs in the universe'shistory when metals were far less abundant. we report kepler spacecraftobservations of koi-3158, a metal-poor sun-like star from the old population ofthe galactic thick disk, which hosts five planets with sizes between mercuryand venus. we used asteroseismology to directly measure a precise age of11.2+/-1.0 gyr for the host star, indicating that koi-3158 formed when theuniverse was less than 20% of its current age and making it the oldest knownsystem of terrestrial-size planets. we thus show that earth-size planets haveformed throughout most of the universe's 13.8-billion-year history, providingscope for the existence of ancient life in the galaxy.

0804.3593	polaris the cepheid returns: 4.5 years of monitoring from ground and  space	we present the analysis of 4.5 years of nearly continuous observations of theclassical cepheid polaris, which comprise the most precise data available forthis star. we have made spectroscopic measurements from ground and photometricmeasurements from the wire star tracker and the smei instrument on the coriolissatellite. measurements of the amplitude of the dominant oscillation (p = 4days), that go back more than a century, show a decrease from 120 mmag to 30mmag (v magnitude) around the turn of the millennium. it has been speculatedthat the reason for the decrease in amplitude is the evolution of polaristowards the edge of the instability strip. however, our new data reveal anincrease in the amplitude by about 30% from 2003-2006. it now appears that theamplitude change is cyclic rather than monotonic, and most likely the result ofa pulsation phenomenon. in addition, previous radial velocity campaigns haveclaimed the detection of long-period variation in polaris (p &gt; 40 days). ourradial velocity data are more precise than previous datasets, and we find noevidence for additional variation for periods in the range 3-50 days with anupper limit of 100 m/s. however, in the wire data we find evidence of variationon time-scales of 2-6 days, which we interpret as being due to granulation.

1502.04767	the galah survey: scientific motivation	the galah survey is a large high-resolution spectroscopic survey using thenewly commissioned hermes spectrograph on the anglo-australian telescope. thehermes spectrograph provides high-resolution (r ~28,000) spectra in fourpassbands for 392 stars simultaneously over a 2 degree field of view. the goalof the survey is to unravel the formation and evolutionary history of the milkyway, using fossil remnants of ancient star formation events which have beendisrupted and are now dispersed throughout the galaxy. chemical tagging seeksto identify such dispersed remnants solely from their common and uniquechemical signatures; these groups are unidentifiable from their spatial,photometric or kinematic properties. to carry out chemical tagging, the galahsurvey will acquire spectra for a million stars down to v~14. the hermesspectra of fgk stars contain absorption lines from 29 elements including lightproton-capture elements, alpha-elements, odd-z elements, iron-peak elements andn-capture elements from the light and heavy s-process and the r-process. thispaper describes the motivation and planned execution of the galah survey, andpresents some results on the first-light performance of hermes.

1503.09085	structural glitches near the cores of red giants revealed by  oscillations in g-mode period spacings from stellar models	with recent advances in asteroseismology it is now possible to peer into thecores of red giants, potentially providing a way to study processes such asnuclear burning and mixing through their imprint as sharp structural variations-- glitches -- in the stellar cores. here we show how such core glitches canaffect the oscillations we observe in red giants. we derive an analyticalexpression describing the expected frequency pattern in the presence of aglitch. this formulation also accounts for the coupling between acoustic andgravity waves. from an extensive set of canonical stellar models we findglitch-induced variation in the period spacing and inertia of non-radial modesduring several phases of red-giant evolution. significant changes are seen inthe appearance of mode amplitude and frequency patterns in asteroseismicdiagrams such as the power spectrum and the \'echelle diagram. interestingly,along the red-giant branch glitch-induced variation occurs only at theluminosity bump, potentially providing a direct seismic indicator of stars inthat particular evolution stage. similarly, we find the variation at onlycertain post-helium-ignition evolution stages, namely, in the early phases ofhelium-core burning and at the beginning of helium-shell burning signifying theasymptotic-giant-branch bump. based on our results, we note that assuming starsto be glitch-free, while they are not, can result in an incorrect estimate ofthe period spacing. we further note that including diffusion and mixing beyondclassical schwarzschild, could affect the characteristics of the glitches,potentially providing a way to study these physical processes.

1504.07992	ages and fundamental properties of kepler exoplanet host stars from  asteroseismology	we present a study of 33 {\it kepler} planet-candidate host stars for whichasteroseismic observations have sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio toallow extraction of individual pulsation frequencies. we implement a newbayesian scheme that is flexible in its input to process individual oscillationfrequencies, combinations of them, and average asteroseismic parameters, andderive robust fundamental properties for these targets. applying this scheme togrids of evolutionary models yields stellar properties with median statisticaluncertainties of 1.2\% (radius), 1.7\% (density), 3.3\% (mass), 4.4\%(distance), and 14\% (age), making this the exoplanet host-star sample with themost precise and uniformly determined fundamental parameters to date. we assessthe systematics from changes in the solar abundances and mixing-lengthparameter, showing that they are smaller than the statistical errors. we alsodetermine the stellar properties with three other fitting algorithms andexplore the systematics arising from using different evolution and pulsationcodes, resulting in 1\% in density and radius, and 2\% and 7\% in mass and age,respectively. we confirm previous findings of the initial helium abundancebeing a source of systematics comparable to our statistical uncertainties, anddiscuss future prospects for constraining this parameter by combiningasteroseismology and data from space missions. finally we compare our derivedproperties with those obtained using the global average asteroseismicobservables along with effective temperature and metallicity, finding anexcellent level of agreement. owing to selection effects, our results show thatthe majority of the high signal-to-noise ratio asteroseismic {\it kepler} hoststars are older than the sun.

1506.08931	oscillating red giants observed during campaign 1 of the kepler k2  mission: new prospects for galactic archaeology	nasa's re-purposed kepler mission -- dubbed k2 -- has brought new scientificopportunities that were not anticipated for the original kepler mission. onescience goal that makes optimal use of k2's capabilities, in particular its360-degree ecliptic field of view, is galactic archaeology -- the study of theevolution of the galaxy from the fossil stellar record. the thrust of thisresearch is to exploit high-precision, time-resolved photometry from k2 inorder to detect oscillations in red giant stars. this asteroseismic informationcan provide estimates of stellar radius (hence distance), mass and age of vastnumbers of stars across the galaxy. here we present the initial analysis of asubset of red giants, observed towards the north galactic gap, during themission's first full science campaign. we investigate the feasibility of usingk2 data for detecting oscillations in red giants that span a range in apparentmagnitude and evolutionary state (hence intrinsic luminosity). we demonstratethat oscillations are detectable for essentially all cool giants within the$\log g$ range $\sim 1.9-3.2$. our detection is complete down to$\mathit{kp}\sim 14.5$, which results in a seismic sample with little or nodetection bias. this sample is ideally suited to stellar population studiesthat seek to investigate potential shortcomings of contemporary galaxy models.

1510.01376	measuring the vertical age structure of the galactic disc using  asteroseismology and saga	the existence of a vertical age gradient in the milky way disc has beenindirectly known for long. here, we measure it directly for the first time withseismic ages, using red giants observed by kepler. we use stroemgren photometryto gauge the selection function of asteroseismic targets, and derive colour andmagnitude limits where giants with measured oscillations are representative ofthe underlying population in the field. limits in the 2mass system are alsoderived. we lay out a method to assess and correct for target selection effectsindependent of galaxy models. we find that low mass, i.e. old red giantsdominate at increasing galactic heights, whereas closer to the galactic planethey exhibit a wide range of ages and metallicities. parametrizing this as avertical gradient returns approximately 4 gyr/kpc for the disc we probe,although with a large dispersion of ages at all heights. the ages of stars showa smooth distribution over the last 10 gyr, consistent with a mostly quiescentevolution for the milky way disc since a redshift of about 2. we also find aflat age-metallicity relation for disc stars. finally, we show how to usesecondary clump stars to estimate the present-day intrinsic metallicity spread,and suggest using their number count as a new proxy for tracing the ageing ofthe disc. this work highlights the power of asteroseismology for galacticstudies; however, we also emphasize the need for better constraints on stellarmass-loss, which is a major source of systematic age uncertainties in red giantstars.

1511.06160	internal rotation of the red-giant star kic 4448777 by means of  asteroseismic inversion	in this paper we study the dynamics of the stellar interior of the earlyred-giant star kic 4448777 by asteroseismic inversion of 14 splittings of thedipole mixed modes obtained from {\it kepler} observations. in order toovercome the complexity of the oscillation pattern typical of red-giant stars,we present a procedure which involves a combination of different methods toextract the rotational splittings from the power spectrum. we find not onlythat the core rotates faster than the surface, confirming previous inversionresults generated for other red giants (deheuvels et al. 2012,2014), but wealso estimate the variation of the angular velocity within the helium core witha spatial resolution of $\delta r=0.001r$ and verify the hypothesis of a sharpdiscontinuity in the inner stellar rotation (deheuvels et al. 2014). theresults show that the entire core rotates rigidly with an angular velocity ofabout $\langle\omega_c/2\pi\rangle=748\pm18$~nhz and provide evidence for anangular velocity decrease through a region between the helium core and part ofthe hydrogen burning shell; however we do not succeed to characterize therotational slope, due to the intrinsic limits of the applied techniques. theangular velocity, from the edge of the core and through the hydrogen burningshell, appears to decrease with increasing distance from the center, reachingan average value in the convective envelope of$\langle\omega_s/2\pi\rangle=68\pm22$~nhz. hence, the core in kic~4448777 isrotating from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 17 times faster than the envelope.we conclude that a set of data which includes only dipolar modes is sufficientto infer quite accurately the rotation of a red giant not only in the densecore but also, with a lower level of confidence, in part of the radiativeregion and in the convective envelope.

astro-ph;0204030	time-series spectroscopy of pulsating sdb stars ii: velocity analysis of  pg1605+072	we present the analysis of time-resolved spectroscopy of the pulsating sdbstar pg1605+072. from our main observing run of 16 nights we have detectedvelocity variations at 5 frequencies that correspond to those found inphotometry. based on these data, there appears to be change in amplitude of thedominant modes over about a year. however, when we include extra observationsto improve the frequency resolution, we find that some of the frequencies aresplit into two or three. simulations suggest that the apparent amplitudevariation can be at least partially explained by a series of very closelyspaced frequencies around the two strongest modes. by combining observationstaken over ~300 days we conclude that some of the closely spaced modes arecaused by one mode whose amplitude is varying, however this frequency is stillwithin ~1 microhz of an apparently stable frequency. because of this kind ofcomplexity and uncertainty we advise caution when trying to identifyoscillation modes in this star.

(1993) who targeted 11 turn-off starsin the open cluster m67 (ngc 2682), but the oscillation amplitudes were toosmall (&lt;20micromag) to obtain unambiguous detections. like gilliland et al.(1993) we also aim at detecting solar-like oscillations in m67, but we targetred giant stars with expected amplitudes in the range 50-500micromag andperiods of 1 to 8 hours. we analyse our recently published photometrymeasurements, obtained during a six-week multisite campaign using ninetelescopes around the world. the observations are compared with simulations andwith estimated properties of the stellar oscillations. noise levels in thefourier spectra as low as 27micromag are obtained for single sites, while thecombined data reach 19micromag, making this the best photometric time series ofan ensemble of red giant stars. these data enable us to make the first test ofthe scaling relations (used to estimate frequency and amplitude) with anhomogeneous ensemble of stars. the detected excess power is consistent with theexpected signal from stellar oscillations, both in terms of its frequency rangeand amplitude. however, our results are limited by apparent high levels ofnon-white noise, which cannot be clearly separated from the stellar signal.
