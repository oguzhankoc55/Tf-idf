0902.4457	photometric and spectroscopic detection of the primary transit of the  111-day-period planet hd 80606 b	we report the detection of the primary transit of the extra-solar planet hd80606 b, thanks to photometric and spectroscopic observations performed atobservatoire de haute-provence, simultaneously with the ccd camera at the120-cm telescope and the sophie spectrograph at the 193-cm telescope. weobserved the whole egress of the transit and partially its central part, inboth data sets with the same timings. the ingress occurred before sunset andwas not observed. the full duration of the transit was between 9.5 and 17.2hours. the data allows the planetary radius to be measured (rp = 0.9 +- 0.1rjup) and other parameters of the system to be refined. radial velocitymeasurements show the detection of a prograde rossiter-mclaughlin effect, andprovide a hint for a spin-orbit misalignment. if confirmed, this misalignmentwould corroborate the hypothesis that hd 80606 b owes its unusual orbitalconfiguration to kozai migration. hd 80606 b is by far the transiting planet onthe longest period detected today. its unusually small radius reinforces theobserved relationship between the planet radius and the incident flux receivedfrom the star and opens new questions for theory. orbiting a quite bright star(v=9), it opens opportunities to numerous follow-up studies.

0707.0679	refined parameters and spectroscopic transit of the super-massive planet  hd147506b	in this paper, we report a refined determination of the orbital parametersand the detection of the rossiter-mclaughlin effect of the recently discoveredtransiting exoplanet hd147506b (hat-p-2b). the large orbital eccentricity atthe short orbital period of this exoplanet is unexpected and is distinguishingfrom other known transiting exoplanets. we performed high-precision radialvelocity spectroscopic observations of hd147506 (hat-p-2) with the newspectrograph sophie, mounted on the 1.93 m telescope at the haute-provenceobservatory (ohp). we obtained 63 new measurements, including 35 on may 14 and20 on june 11, when the planet was transiting its parent star. the radialvelocity (rv) anomaly observed illustrates that hat-p-2b orbital motion is setin the same direction as its parent star spin. the sky-projected angle betweenthe normal of the orbital plane and the stellar spin axis, \lambda = 0.2 +12.2-12.5 deg, is consistent with zero. the planetary and stellar radii werere-determined, yielding r_p = 0.951 +0.039 -0.053 r_jup, r_s = 1.416 +0.040-0.062 r_sun. the mass m_p = 8.62 +0.39 -0.55 m_jup and radius of hat-p-2bindicate a density of 12.5 +2.6 -3.6 g cm^{-3}, suggesting an object in betweenthe known close-in planets with typical density of the order of 1 g cm^{-3},and the very low-mass stars, with density greater than 50 g cm^{-3}.

0908.4521	extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs around a-f type stars - vii. theta  cygni radial velocity variations: planets or stellar phenomenon?	(abridged) in the frame of the search for extrasolar planets and brown dwarfsaround early-type main-sequence stars, we present the results obtained on theearly f-type star theta cygni. elodie and sophie at ohp were used to obtain thespectra. our dedicated radial-velocity measurement method was used to monitorthe star's radial velocities over five years. we also use complementary, highangular resolution and high-contrast images taken with pueo at cfht. we showthat theta cygni radial velocities are quasi-periodically variable, with a~150-day period. these variations are not due to the ~0.35-msun stellarcompanion that we detected in imaging at more than 46 au from the star. theabsence of correlation between the bisector velocity span variations and theradial velocity variations for this 7 km/s vsini star, as well as othercriteria indicate that the observed radial velocity variations are not due tostellar spots. the observed amplitude of the bisector velocity span variationsalso seems to rule out stellar pulsations. however, we observe a peak in thebisector velocity span periodogram at the same period as the one found in theradial velocity periodogram, which indicates a probable link between theseradial velocity variations and the low amplitude lineshape variations which areof stellar origin. long-period variations are not expected from this type ofstar to our knowledge. if a stellar origin (hence of new type) was to beconfirmed for these long-period radial velocity variations, this would haveseveral consequences on the search for planets around main-sequence stars, bothin terms of observational strategy and data analysis. an alternativeexplanation for these variable radial velocities is the presence of at leastone planet of a few jupiter masses orbiting at less than 1 au.

1001.4774	the harps search for southern extra-solar planets xix. characterization  and dynamics of the gj876 planetary system	precise radial-velocity measurements for data acquired with the harpsspectrograph infer that three planets orbit the m4 dwarf star gj876. inparticular, we confirm the existence of planet "d", which orbits every 1.93785days. we find that its orbit may have significant eccentricity (e=0.14), anddeduce a more accurate estimate of its minimum mass of 6.3 earth masses.dynamical modeling of the harps measurements combined with literaturevelocities from the keck observatory strongly constrain the orbitalinclinations of the "b" and "c" planets. we find that i_b = 48.9 degrees andi_c = 48.1 degrees, which infers the true planet masses of m_b = 2.64 jupitermasses and m_c = 0.83 jupiter masses, respectively. radial velocities alone, inthis favorable case, can therefore fully determine the orbital architecture ofa multi-planet system, without the input from astrometry or transits.  the orbits of the two giant planets are nearly coplanar, and their 2:1 meanmotion resonance ensures stability over at least 5 gyr. the libration amplitudeis smaller than 2 degrees, suggesting that it was damped by some dissipativeprocess during planet formation. the system has space for a stable fourthplanet in a 4:1 mean motion resonance with planet "b", with a period around 15days. the radial velocity measurements constrain the mass of this possibleadditional planet to be at most that of the earth.

1004.0790	observation of the full 12-hour-long transit of the exoplanet hd80606b.  warm-spitzer photometry and sophie spectroscopy	we present new observations of a transit of the 111-day-period exoplanethd80606b. using the spitzer space telescope and its irac camera on thepost-cryogenic mission, we performed a 19-hour-long photometric observation ofhd80606 that covers the full transit of 13-14 january 2010. we complement thisphotometric data by new spectroscopic observations that we simultaneouslyperformed with sophie at haute-provence observatory. this provides radialvelocity measurements of the first half of the transit that was previouslyuncovered with spectroscopy. this new data set allows the parameters of thissingular planetary system to be significantly refined. we obtained aplanet-to-star radius ratio r_p/r_* = 0.1001 +/- 0.0006 that is slightly lowerthan the one measured from previous ground observations. we detected a featurein the spitzer light curve that could be due to a stellar spot. we also found atransit timing about 20 minutes earlier than the ephemeris prediction; thiscould be caused by actual ttvs due to an additional body in the system or byunderestimated systematic uncertainties. the sky-projected angle between thespin-axis of hd80606 and the normal to the planetary orbital plane is found tobe lambda = 42 +/- 8 degrees thanks to the fit of the rossiter-mclaughlinanomaly. this allows scenarios with aligned spin-orbit to be definitivelyrejected. over the twenty planetary systems with measured spin-orbit angles, afew of them are misaligned; this is probably the signature of two differentevolution scenarios for misaligned and aligned systems, depending if theyexperienced or not gravitational interaction with a third body. as in the caseof hd80606b, most of the planetary systems including a massive planet aretilted; this could be the signature of a separate evolution scenario formassive planets in comparison with jupiter-mass planets.

1110.2256	higher-precision radial velocity measurements with the sophie  spectrograph using octagonal-section fibers	high-precision spectrographs play a key role in exoplanet searches using theradial velocity technique. but at the accuracy level of 1 m.s-1, required forsuper-earth characterization, stability of fiber-fed spectrograph performanceis crucial considering variable observing conditions such as seeing, guidingand centering errors and, telescope vignetting. in fiber-fed spectrographs suchas harps or sophie, the fiber link scrambling properties are one of the mainissues. both the stability of the fiber near-field uniformity at thespectrograph entrance and of the far-field illumination on the echelle grating(pupil) are critical for high-precision radial velocity measurements due to thespectrograph geometrical field and aperture aberrations. we conducted tests onthe sophie spectrograph at the 1.93-m ohp telescope to measure the instrumentsensitivity to the fiber link light feeding conditions: star decentering,telescope vignetting by the dome,and defocussing.  to significantly improve on current precision, we designed a fiber linkmodification considering the spectrograph operational constraints. we havedeveloped a new link which includes a piece of octagonal-section fiber, havinggood scrambling properties, lying inside the former circular-section fiber, andwe tested the concept on a bench to characterize near-field and far-fieldscrambling properties.  this modification has been implemented in spring 2011 on the sophiespectrograph fibers and tested for the first time directly on the sky todemonstrate the gain compared to the previous fiber link. scientific validationfor exoplanet search and characterization has been conducted by observingstandard stars.

1202.2467	the harps search for southern extra-solar planets xxxv. super-earths  around the m-dwarf neighbors gl433 and gl667c	m dwarfs have been found to often have super-earth planets with short orbitalperiods. such stars are thus preferential targets in searches for rocky orocean planets in the solar neighbourhood. in a recent paper (bonfils et al.2011), we announced the discovery of respectively 1 and 2 low mass planetsaround the m1.5v stars gl433 and gl667c. we found those planets with the harpsspectrograph on the eso~3.6-m telescope at la silla observatory, fromobservations obtained during the guaranteed time observing program of thatinstrument. we have obtained additional harps observations of those two stars,for a total of respectively 67 and 179 radial velocity measurements for gl433and gl667c, and present here an orbital analysis of those extended data setsand our main conclusion about both planetary systems. one of the three planets,gl667cc, has a mass of only m2.sin(i)~4.25 m_earth and orbits in the centralhabitable zone of its host star. it receives just 10% less stellar energy fromgl667c than the earth receives from the sun. however planet evolution inhabitable zone can be very different if the host star is a m dwarf or asolar-like star, without necessarily questioning the presence of water. the twoother planets, gl433b and gl667cb, both have m2.sin(i) of ~5.5 m_earth andperiods of ~7 days. the radial velocity measurements of both stars containlonger time scale signals, which we fit as longer period keplerians. for gl433that signal probably originates in a magnetic cycle, while a longer time spanwill be needed to conclude for gl667c. the metallicity of gl433 is close tosolar, while gl667c is metal poor with [fe/h] ~ -0.6. this reinforces therecent conclusion that the occurence of super-earth planets does not stronglycorrelate with stellar metallicity.

1503.00180	a maximum entropy approach to detect close-in giant planets around  active stars	(shortened for arxiv) we aim to progress towards more efficient exoplanetdetection around active stars by optimizing the use of doppler imaging inradial velocity measurements. we propose a simple method to simultaneouslyextract a brightness map and a set of orbital parameters through a tomographicinversion technique derived from classical doppler mapping. based on themaximum entropy principle, the underlying idea is to determine the set oforbital parameters that minimizes the information content of the resultingdoppler map. we carry out a set of numerical simulations to perform apreliminary assessment of the robustness of our method, using an actual dopplermap of the very active star hr 1099 to produce a realistic synthetic data setfor various sets of orbital parameters of a single planet in a circular orbit.using a simulated time-series of 50 line profiles affected by a peak-to-peakactivity jitter of 2.5 km/s, we are able in most cases to recover the radialvelocity amplitude, orbital phase and orbital period of an artificial planetdown to a radial velocity semi-amplitude of the order of the radial velocityscatter due to the photon noise alone (about 50 m/s in our case). onenoticeable exception occurs when the planetary orbit is close to co-rotation,in which case significant biases are observed in the reconstructed radialvelocity amplitude, while the orbital period and phase remain robustlyrecovered. the present method constitutes a very simple way to extract orbitalparameters from heavily distorted line profiles of active stars, when moreclassical radial velocity detection methods generally fail. it is easilyadaptable to most existing doppler imaging codes, paving the way towards asystematic search for close-in planets orbiting young, rapidly-rotating stars.

astro-ph;0106277	new neighbours. iii. 21 new companions to nearby dwarfs, discovered with  adaptive optics	we present some results of a cfht adaptive optics search for companions tonearby dwarfs. we identify 21 new components in solar neighbourhood systems, ofwhich 13 were found while surveying a volume-limited sample of m dwarfs within12pc. we are obtaining complete observations for this subsample, to deriveunbiased multiplicity statistics for the very-low-mass disk population.additionally, we resolve for the first time 6 known spectroscopic orastrometric binaries, for a total of 27 newly resolved companions. a fairfraction of the new binaries has favourable parameters for accurate massdeterminations. the newly resolved companion of gl120.1c had an apparentspectroscopic minimum mass in the brown-dwarf range (duquennoy &amp; mayor 1991)and it contributed to the statistical evidence that a few percent of solar typestars might have close-in brown-dwarf companions. we find that gl~120.1cactually is an unrecognised double-lined spectroscopic pair. itsradial-velocity amplitude had therefore been strongly underestimated byduquennoy &amp; mayor, and it does not truly belong to their sample of single-linedsystems with minimum spectroscopic mass below the substellar limit. we alsopresent the first direct detection of gl~494b, an astrometric brown-dwarfcandidate. its luminosity does straddle the substellar limit, and it is a browndwarf if its age is less than 300myr. a few more years of observations willascertain its mass and status from first principles.

astro-ph;0110100	four brown dwarfs in the taurus star-forming region	we have identified four brown dwarfs in the taurus star-forming region. theywere first selected from $r$ and $i$ ccd photometry of 2.29 square degreesobtained at the canada-france-hawaii telescope. subsequently, they wererecovered in the 2mass second incremental data release point source catalog.low-resolution optical spectra obtained at the william herschel telescope allowus to derive spectral types in the range m7--m9. one of the brown dwarfs hasvery strong h$\alpha$ emission (ew=-340 \aa). it also displays br$\gamma$emission in an infrared spectrum obtained with ircs on the subaru telescope,suggesting that it is accreting matter from a disk. the \ion{k}{1} resonancedoublet and the \ion{na}{1} subordinate doublet at 818.3 and 819.5 nm in thesetaurus objects are weaker than in field dwarfs of similar spectral type,consistent with low surface gravities as expected for young brown dwarfs. twoof the objects are cooler and fainter than gg tau bb, the lowest mass knownmember of the taurus association. we estimate masses of only 0.03 m$_\odot$ forthem. the spatial distribution of brown dwarfs in taurus hints to a possibleanticorrelation between the density of stars and the density of brown dwarfs.

astro-ph;0206201	detection of an optical transient following the 13 march 2000 short/hard  gamma-ray burst	we imaged the error box of a gamma-ray burst of the short (0.5 s), hard type(grb 000313), with the bootes-1 experiment in southern spain, starting 4 minafter the gamma-ray event, in the i-band. a bright optical transient (ot000313) with i = 9.4 +/- 0.1 was found in the bootes-1 image, close to theerror box (3-sigma) provided by batse. late time vrik'-band deep observationsfailed to reveal an underlying host galaxy. if the ot 000313 is related to theshort, hard grb 000313, this would be the first optical counterpart ever foundfor this kind of events (all counterparts to date have been found for bursts ofthe long, soft type). the fact that only prompt optical emission has beendetected (but no afterglow emission at all, as supported by theoretical models)might explain why no optical counterparts have ever been found for short, hardgrbs.this fact suggests that most short bursts might occur in a low-densitymedium and favours the models that relate them to binary mergers in verylow-density enviroments.

astro-ph;0405111	first determination of the dynamical mass of a binary l dwarf	we present here the results of astrometric, photometric and spectroscopicobservations leading to the determination of the orbit and dynamical masses ofthe binary l dwarf 2massw j0746425+2000321. high angular resolutionobservations spread over almost 4 years and obtained with the hubble spacetelescope (hst), the eso very large telescope (vlt), and a the w. m. keckobservatory (keck) allow us to cover 36% of the period, corresponding to 60% ofthe orbit, and, for the first time, to derive a precise estimate of the totaland individual masses of such a late-type object. we find an orbital period of3850.9$^{+904}_{-767}$ days. the corresponding total mass is0.146$^{+0.016}_{-0.006}$ m$_{\sun}$, with uncertainties depending on thedistance. spatially resolved low resolution optical (550--1025 nm) spectra havebeen obtained with hst/stis, allowing us to measure the spectral types of thetwo components (l0$\pm$0.5 for the primary and l1.5$\pm$0.5 for the secondary).we also present precise photometry of the individual components measured on thehigh angular resolution images obtained with hst/acs and wfpc2 (visible),vlt/naco (j, h and ks bands) and keck i (ks) band). these spectral andphotometric measurements enable us to estimate their effective temperatures andmass ratio, and to place the object accurately in a h--r diagram. the binarysystem is most likely formed by a primary with a mass of 0.085$\pm$0.010m$_{\sun}$ and a secondary with a mass of 0.066$\pm$0.006 m$_{\sun}$, thusclearly substellar, for an age of approximately 300$\pm$150 myr. h$\alpha$variability indicates chromospheric and/or magnetic activity.

astro-ph;0503260	metallicity of m dwarfs i. a photometric calibration and impact on the  mass-luminosity relation at the bottom of the main sequence	we obtained high resolution elodie and coralie spectra for both components of20 wide visual binaries composed of an f-, g- or k-dwarf primary and an m-dwarfsecondary. we analyse the well understood spectra of the primaries to determinemetallicities ([fe/h]) for these 20 systems, and hence for their m dwarfcomponents. we pool these metallicities with determinations from the literatureto obtain a precise (+- 0.2 dex) photometric calibration of m dwarfmetallicities. this calibration represents a breakthrough in a field wherediscussions have had to remain largely qualitative, and it helps us demonstratethat metallicity explains most of the large dispersion in the empirical v-bandmass-luminosity relation. we examine the metallicity of the two known m-dwarfplanet-host stars, gl 876 (+0.02 dex) and gl 436 (-0.03 dex), in the context ofpreferential planet formation around metal-rich stars. we finally determine themetallicity of the 47 brightest single m dwarfs in a volume limited sample, andcompare the metallicity distributions of solar-type and m-dwarf stars in thesolar neighbourhood.

0809.0750	the harps search for southern extra-solar planets: xiv. gl 176b, a  super-earth rather than a neptune, and at a different period	a 10.24 days neptune-mass planet was recently announced to orbit the nearbym2 dwarf gl 176, based on 28 radial velocities measured with the hrsspectrograph on the hobby-heberly telescope (het). we obtained 57 radialvelocities of gl 176 with the eso 3.6m telescope and the harps spectrograph,which is known for its sub-m/s stability. the median photon-noise standarderror of our measurements is 1.1 m/s, significantly lower than the 4.7 m/s ofthe het velocities, and the 4 years period over which they were obtained hasmuch overlap with the epochs of the het measurements. the harps measurementsshow no evidence for a signal at the period of the putative het planet,suggesting that its detection was spurious. we do find, on the other hand,strong evidence for a lower mass 8.4 mearth planet, in a quasi-circular orbitand at the different period of 8.78 days. the host star has moderate magneticactivity and rotates on a 39-days period, which we confirm through modulationof both contemporaneous photometry and chromospheric indices. we detect thatperiod as well in the radial velocities, but it is well removed from theorbital period and no cause for confusion. this new detection of a super-earth(2 mearth &lt; m sin(i) &lt; 10 mearth) around an m dwarf adds to the growingevidence that such planets are common around very low mass stars: a third ofthe 20 known planets with m sin(i) &lt; 0.1 mjup and 3 of the 7 known planets withm sin(i) &lt; 10 mearth orbit an m dwarf, in contrast to just 4 of the ~300 knownjupiter-mass planets.

astro-ph;9805311	optical spectroscopy of denis mini-survey brown dwarf candidates	we present optical (6500-9200a) spectroscopy of eight cool dwarfs detected ina 231 square degree ``mini-survey'' of the deep near infrared survey (denis)data. we are able to confirm that the spectral types derived from themini-survey infrared spectroscopy are meaningful. we provide a spectralsequence which extends beyond the m-dwarf range and into the proposed ``l''class of dwarfs. the dominant spectral features in the optical for these l-typedwarfs are resonance lines of cs i and molecular band heads of crh and feh. theother dominant feature in these l-type spectra is a broad 600a absorption dipcentered on 7700a, which we identify with extremely strong (equivalent width$\sim$ several hundred a) absorption associated with the 7664,7698a resonancedoublet of k i. we find that model atmospheres which include the effects ofmolecular condensation without dust opacity (to simulate rapid gravitationalsettling of dust grains) produce significantly better agreement with observedoptical spectra for l-type dwarfs, than models including dust opacity. thissuggests gravitational settling of dust grains plays an important role inl-dwarf photospheres. the extreme strength of the k i resonance doublet, anddisappearance of tio and vo, and the consequent dominance of crh and feh inl-dwarf spectra offer considerable prospects as sensitive effective temperaturediagnostics, even at low spectral resolution.
