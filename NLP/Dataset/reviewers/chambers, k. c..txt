0909.1566	58 radio sources near bright natural guide stars	we present a preliminary survey of 58 radio sources within the isoplanaticpatches (r &lt; 25") of bright (11&lt;r&lt;12) stars suitable for use as natural guidestars with high-order adaptive optics (ao). an optical and near-infraredimaging survey was conducted utilizing tip-tilt corrections in the optical andao in the near-infrared. spectral energy distributions (seds) were fit to themulti-band data for the purpose of obtaining photometric redshifts using thehyperz code. several of these photometric redshifts were confirmed withspectroscopy, a result that gives more confidence to the redshift distributionfor the whole sample. additional long-wavelength data from spitzer, scuba,sharc2, and vla supplement the optical and near-infrared data. we find thesample generally follows and extends the magnitude-redshift relation found formore powerful local radio galaxies. the survey has identified severalreasonably bright (h=19-20) objects at significant redshifts (z&gt;1) that are nowwithin the capabilities of the current generation of ao-fed integral-fieldspectrographs. these objects constitute a unique sample that can be used fordetailed ground-based ao studies of galactic structure, evolution, and agnformation at high redshift.

1001.5427	sn 2009kf : a uv bright type iip supernova discovered with pan-starrs 1  and galex	we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of a luminous type iipsupernova 2009kf discovered by the pan-starrs 1 (ps1) survey and detected alsoby galex. the sn shows a plateau in its optical and bolometric light curves,lasting approximately 70 days in the rest frame, with absolute magnitude of m_v= -18.4 mag. the p-cygni profiles of hydrogen indicate expansion velocities of9000km/s at 61 days after discovery which is extremely high for a type iip sn.sn 2009kf is also remarkably bright in the near-ultraviolet (nuv) and shows aslow evolution 10-20 days after optical discovery. the nuv and opticalluminosity at these epochs can be modelled with a black-body with a hoteffective temperature (t ~16,000 k) and a large radius (r ~1x10^{15} cm). thebright bolometric and nuv luminosity, the lightcurve peak and plateau duration,the high velocities and temperatures suggest that 2009kf is a type iip snpowered by a larger than normal explosion energy. recently discovered high-zsne (0.7 &lt; z &lt; 2.3) have been assumed to be iin sne, with the bright uvluminosities due to the interaction of sn ejecta with a dense circumstellarmedium (csm). uv bright sne similar to sn 2009kf could also account for thesehigh-z events, and its absolute magnitude m_nuv = -21.5 +/- 0.5 mag suggestssuch sne could be discovered out to z ~2.5 in the ps1 survey.

1007.4551	galex and pan-starrs1 discovery of sn iip 2010aq: the first few days  after shock breakout in a red supergiant star	we present the early uv and optical light curve of type iip supernova (sn)2010aq at z=0.0862, and compare it to analytical models for thermal emissionfollowing sn shock breakout in a red supergiant star. sn 2010aq was discoveredin joint monitoring between the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) time domainsurvey (tds) in the nuv and the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey (ps1 mds) in theg, r, i, and z bands. the galex and pan-starrs1 observations detect the sn lessthan 1 day after shock breakout, measure a diluted blackbody temperature of31,000 +/- 6,000 k 1 day later, and follow the rise in the uv/optical lightcurve over the next 2 days caused by the expansion and cooling of the snejecta. the high signal-to-noise ratio of the simultaneous uv and opticalphotometry allows us to fit for a progenitor star radius of 700 +/- 200 r_sun,the size of a red supergiant star. an excess in uv emission two weeks aftershock breakout compared to sne well fitted by model atmosphere-code syntheticspectra with solar metallicity, is best explained by suppressed line blanketingdue to a lower metallicity progenitor star in sn 2010aq. continued monitoringof ps1 mds fields by the galex tds will increase the sample of early uvdetections of type ii sne by an order of magnitude, and probe the diversity ofsn progenitor star properties.

1008.2674	ultra-bright optical transients are linked with type ic supernovae	recent searches by unbiased, wide-field surveys have uncovered a group ofextremely luminous optical transients. the initial discoveries of sn 2005ap bythe texas supernova search and scp-06f6 in a deep hubble pencil beam surveywere followed by the palomar transient factory confirmation of host redshiftsfor other similar transients. the transients share the common properties ofhigh optical luminosities (peak magnitudes ~ -21 to -23), blue colors, and alack of h or he spectral features. the physical mechanism that produces theluminosity is uncertain, with suggestions ranging from jet-driven explosion topulsational pair-instability. here we report the most detailed photometric andspectral coverage of an ultra-bright transient (sn 2010gx) detected in thepan-starrs 1 sky survey. in common with other transients in this family,early-time spectra show a blue continuum, and prominent broad absorption linesof o ii. however, about 25d after discovery, the spectra developed type icsupernova features, showing the characteristic broad fe ii and si ii absorptionlines. detailed, post-maximum follow-up may show that all sn 2005ap andscp-06f6 type transients are linked to supernovae ic. this poses problems inunderstanding the physics of the explosions: there is no indication fromlate-time photometry that the luminosity is powered by 56ni, the broadlightcurves suggest very large ejected masses, and the slow spectral evolutionis quite different from typical ic timescales. the nature of the progenitorstars and the origin of the luminosity are intriguing and open questions.

1008.4353	displaying the heterogeneity of the sn 2002cx-like subclass of type ia  supernovae with observations of the pan-starrs-1 discovered sn2009ku	sn2009ku, discovered by pan-starrs-1, is a type ia supernova (snia), and amember of the distinct sn2002cx-like class of sneia. its light curves aresimilar to the prototypical sn2002cx, but are slightly broader and have a laterrise to maximum in g. sn2009ku is brighter (~0.6 mag) than other sn2002cx-likeobjects, peaking at m_v = -18.4 mag - which is still significantly fainter thantypical sneia. sn2009ku, which had an ejecta velocity of ~2000 kms^-1 at 18days after maximum brightness is spectroscopically most similar to sn2008ha,which also had extremely low-velocity ejecta. however, sn2008ha had anexceedingly low luminosity, peaking at m_v = -14.2 mag, ~4 mag fainter thansn2009ku. the contrast of high luminosity and low ejecta velocity for sn2009kuis contrary to an emerging trend seen for the sn2002cx class. sn2009ku is acounter-example of a previously held belief that the class was more homogeneousthan typical sneia, indicating that the class has a diverse progenitorpopulation and/or complicated explosion physics. as the first example of amember of this class of objects from the new generation of transient surveys,sn2009ku is an indication of the potential for these surveys to find rare andinteresting objects.

1106.3105	four new t dwarfs identified in panstarrs 1 commissioning data	a complete well-defined sample of ultracool dwarfs is one of the key scienceprograms of the pan-starrs 1 optical survey telescope (ps1). here we combineps1 commissioning data with 2mass to conduct a proper motion search(0.1--2.0\arcsec/yr) for nearby t dwarfs, using optical+near-ir colors toselect objects for spectroscopic followup. the addition of sensitive far-redoptical imaging from ps1 enables discovery of nearby ultracool dwarfs thatcannot be identified from 2mass data alone. we have searched 3700 sq. deg. ofps1 y-band (0.95--1.03 um) data to y$\approx$19.5 mag (ab) and j$\approx$16.5mag (vega) and discovered four previously unknown bright t dwarfs. three of theobjects (with spectral types t1.5, t2 and t3.5) have photometric distanceswithin 25 pc and were missed by previous 2mass searches due to more restrictivecolor selection criteria. the fourth object (spectral type t4.5) is moredistant than 25 pc and is only a single-band detection in 2mass. we alsoexamine the potential for completing the census of nearby ultracool objectswith the ps1 3$\pi$ survey.

1107.3552	pan-starrs1 discovery of two ultra-luminous supernovae at z ~ 0.9	we present the discovery of two ultra-luminous supernovae (sne) at z ~ 0.9with the pan-starrs1 medium-deep survey. these sne, ps1-10ky and ps1-10awh, areamongst the most luminous sne ever discovered, comparable to the unusualtransients sn 2005ap and scp 06f6. like sn 2005ap and scp 06f6, they showcharacteristic high luminosities (m_bol ~ -22.5 mag), blue spectra with a fewbroad absorption lines, and no evidence for h or he. we have constructed a fullmulti-color light curve sensitive to the peak of the spectral energydistribution in the rest-frame ultraviolet, and we have obtained time-seriesspectroscopy for these sne. given the similarities between the sne, we combinetheir light curves to estimate a total radiated energy over the course ofexplosion of (0.9-1.4) x 10^51 erg. we find photospheric velocities of12,000-19,000 km/s with no evidence for deceleration measured across ~3rest-frame weeks around light-curve peak, consistent with the expansion of anoptically-thick massive shell of material. we show that, consistent withfindings for other ultra-luminous sne in this class, radioactive decay is notsufficient to power ps1-10ky, and we discuss two plausible origins for theseevents: the initial spin-down of a newborn magnetar in a core-collapse sn, orsn shock breakout from the dense circumstellar wind surrounding a wolf-rayetstar.

1109.5080	the photometric classification server for pan-starrs1	the pan-starrs1 survey is obtaining multi-epoch imaging in 5 bands (gps rpsips zps yps) over the entire sky north of declination -30deg. we describe herethe implementation of the photometric classification server (pcs) forpan-starrs1. pcs will allow the automatic classification of objects intostar/galaxy/quasar classes based on colors, the measurement of photometricredshifts for extragalactic objects, and constrain stellar parameters forstellar objects, working at the catalog level. we present tests of the systembased on high signal-to-noise photometry derived from the medium deep fields ofpan-starrs1, using available spectroscopic surveys as training and/orverification sets. we show that the pan-starrs1 photometry deliversclassifications and photometric redshifts as good as the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) photometry to the same magnitude limits. in particular, ourpreliminary results, based on this relatively limited dataset down to the sdssspectroscopic limits and therefore potentially improvable, show that stars arecorrectly classified as such in 85% of cases, galaxies in 97% and qsos in 84%.false positives are less than 1% for galaxies, ~19% for stars and ~28% qsos.moreover, photometric redshifts for 1000 luminous red galaxies up to redshift0.5 are determined to 2.4% precision with just 0.4% catastrophic outliers andsmall (-0.5%) residual bias. pcs will create a value added catalog withclassifications and photometric redshifts for eventually many millions sources.

1109.6350	observational and dynamical characterization of main-belt comet p/2010  r2 (la sagra)	we present observations of comet-like main-belt object p/2010 r2 (la sagra)obtained by pan-starrs 1 and the faulkes telescope-north on haleakala inhawaii, the university of hawaii 2.2 m, gemini-north, and keck i telescopes onmauna kea, the danish 1.54 m telescope at la silla, and the isaac newtontelescope on la palma. an antisolar dust tail is observed from august 2010through february 2011, while a dust trail aligned with the object's orbit planeis also observed from december 2010 through august 2011. assuming typical phasedarkening behavior, p/la sagra is seen to increase in brightness by &gt;1 magbetween august 2010 and december 2010, suggesting that dust production isongoing over this period. these results strongly suggest that the observedactivity is cometary in nature (i.e., driven by the sublimation of volatilematerial), and that p/la sagra is therefore the most recent main-belt comet tobe discovered. we find an approximate absolute magnitude for the nucleus ofh_r=17.9+/-0.2 mag, corresponding to a nucleus radius of ~0.7 km, assuming analbedo of p=0.05. using optical spectroscopy, we find no evidence ofsublimation products (i.e., gas emission), finding an upper limit cn productionrate of q_cn&lt;6x10^23 mol/s, from which we infer an h2o production rate ofq_h2o&lt;10^26 mol/s. numerical simulations indicate that p/la sagra isdynamically stable for &gt;100 myr, suggesting that it is likely native to itscurrent location and that its composition is likely representative of otherobjects in the same region of the main belt, though the relatively closeproximity of the 13:6 mean-motion resonance with jupiter and the (3,-2,-1)three-body mean-motion resonance with jupiter and saturn mean that dynamicalinstability on larger timescales cannot be ruled out.

1110.0060	first results from pan-starrs1: faint, high proper motion white dwarfs  in the medium-deep fields	the pan-starrs1 survey has obtained multi-epoch imaging in five bands(pan-starrs1 gps, rps, ips, zps, and yps) on twelve "medium deep fields", eachof which spans a 3.3 degree circle. for the period between apr 2009 and apr2011 these fields were observed 50-200 times. using a reduced proper motiondiagram, we have extracted a list of 47 white dwarf (wd) candidates whosepan-starrs1 astrometry indicates a non-zero proper motion at the 6-sigma level,with a typical 1-sigma proper motion uncertainty of 10 mas/yr. we also usedastrometry from sdss (when available) and usno-b to assess our proper motionfits. none of the wd candidates exhibits evidence of statistically significantparallaxes, with a typical 1-sigma uncertainty of 8 mas. twelve of thesecandidates are known wds, including the high proper motion (1.7"/yr) wd lhs291. we confirm three more objects as wds through optical spectroscopy. basedon the pan-starrs1 colors, ten of the stars are likely to be cool wds with 4170k teff 5000 k and cooling ages &lt;9 gyr. we classify these objects as likelythick disk wds based on their kinematics. our current sample represents only asmall fraction of the pan-starrs1 data. with continued coverage from the mediumdeep field survey and the 3pi survey, pan-starrs1 should find many more highproper motion wds that are part of the old thick disk and halo.

(2008) in the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss), we use repeat ps1 observations of stars to perform the relativecalibration of ps1 in each of its five bands, solving simultaneously for thesystem throughput, the atmospheric transparency, and the large-scale detectorflat field. both internal consistency tests and comparison against the sdssindicate that we achieve relative precision of &lt;10 mmag in g, r, and i_p1, and~10 mmag in z and y_p1. the spatial structure of the differences with the sdssindicates that errors in both the ps1 and sdss photometric calibrationcontribute similarly to the differences. the analysis suggests that both theps1 system and the haleakala site will enable &lt;1% photometry over much of thesky.

1205.0252	an ultraviolet-optical flare from the tidal disruption of a helium-rich  stellar core	the flare of radiation from the tidal disruption and accretion of a star canbe used as a marker for supermassive black holes that otherwise lie dormant andundetected in the centres of distant galaxies. previous candidate flares havehad declining light curves in good agreement with expectations, but with poorconstraints on the time of disruption and the type of star disrupted, becausethe rising emission was not observed. recently, two `relativistic' candidatetidal disruption events were discovered, each of whose extreme x-ray luminosityand synchrotron radio emission were interpreted as the onset of emission from arelativistic jet. here we report the discovery of a luminousultraviolet-optical flare from the nuclear region of an inactive galaxy at aredshift of 0.1696. the observed continuum is cooler than expected for a simpleaccreting debris disk, but the well-sampled rise and decline of its light curvefollows the predicted mass accretion rate, and can be modelled to determine thetime of disruption to an accuracy of two days. the black hole has a mass ofabout 2 million solar masses, modulo a factor dependent on the mass and radiusof the star disrupted. on the basis of the spectroscopic signature of ionizedhelium from the unbound debris, we determine that the disrupted star was ahelium-rich stellar core.

1303.0555	x-ray selected galaxy clusters in the pan-starrs medium-deep survey	[abridged]  we present the results of a pilot study for the extended macs survey (emacs),a comprehensive search for distant, x-ray luminous galaxy clusters at z&gt;0.5.our pilot study applies the emacs concept to the 71 deg^2 area extended by theten fields of the pan-starrs1 (ps1) medium deep survey (mds). candidateclusters are identified by visual inspection of ps1 images in the g,r, i, and zbands in a 5x5 arcmin^2 region around x-ray sources detected in the rosatall-sky survey (rass). to test and optimize the emacs x-ray selection criteria,our pilot study uses the largest possible rass database, i.e., all rass sourceslisted in the bright and faint source catalogs (bsc and fsc) that fall withinthe mds footprint. scrutiny of ps1/mds images for 41 bsc and 200 fsc sourcescombined with dedicated spectroscopic follow-up observations results in asample of 11 clusters with estimated or spectroscopic redshifts of z&gt;0.3. x-rayfollow-up observations will be crucial in order to establish robust clusterluminosities for emacs clusters.  although the small number of distant x-ray luminous clusters in the mds doesnot allow us to make firm predictions for the over 20,000 deg^2 ofextragalactic sky covered by emacs, the identification of two extremelypromising emacs cluster candidates at z&gt;0.6 (both yet to be observed withchandra) in such a small solid angle is encouraging. representing a tremendousgain over the presently known two dozen such systems from x-ray, optical, andsz cluster surveys combined, the sample of over 100 extremely massive clustersat z&gt;0.5 expected from emacs would be invaluable for the identification of themost powerful gravitational lenses in the universe, as well as for in-depth andstatistical studies of the physical properties of the most massive galaxyclusters out to z~1.

1303.1531	ps1-10bzj: a fast, hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova in a metal poor  host galaxy	we present observations and analysis of ps1-10bzj, a superluminous supernova(slsn) discovered in the pan-starrs medium deep survey at a redshift z = 0.650.spectroscopically, ps1-10bzj is similar to the hydrogen-poor slsne 2005ap andscp 06f6, though with a steeper rise and lower peak luminosity (m_bol = -21.4mag) than previous events. we construct a bolometric light curve, and show thatwhile ps1-10bzj's energetics were less extreme than previous events, itsluminosity still cannot be explained by radioactive nickel decay alone. weexplore both a magnetar spin-down and circumstellar interaction scenario andfind that either can fit the data. ps1-10bzj is located in the extended chandradeep field south and the host galaxy is imaged in a number of surveys,including with the hubble space telescope. the host is a compact dwarf galaxy(m_b ~ -18 mag, diameter &lt; 800 pc), with a low stellar mass (m_* ~ 2.4 * 10^7m_sun), young stellar population (\tau_* ~ 5 myr), and a star formation rate of~ 2-3 m_sun/yr. the specific star formation rate is the highest seen in a slsnhost so far (~ 100 gyr^{-1}). we detect the [o iii]\lambda 4363 line, and finda low metallicity: 12+(o/h) = 7.8 +/- 0.2 (~ 0.1 z_sun). together, thisindicates that at least some of the progenitors of slsne come from young,low-metallicity populations.

1303.1818	ps1-12sk is a peculiar supernova from a he-rich progenitor system in a  brightest cluster galaxy environment	we report on our discovery and observations of the pan-starrs1 supernova (sn)ps1-12sk, a transient with properties that indicate atypical star formation inits host galaxy cluster or pose a challenge to popular progenitor system modelsfor this class of explosion. the optical spectra of ps1-12sk classify it as atype ibn sn (c.f. sn 2006jc), dominated by intermediate-width (3x10^3 km/s) andtime variable he i emission. our multi-wavelength monitoring establishes therise time dt = 9-23 days and shows an nuv-nir sed with temperature &gt; 17x10^3 kand a peak rise magnitude of mz = -18.9 mag. sn ibn spectroscopic propertiesare commonly interpreted as the signature of a massive star (17 - 100 m_sun)explosion within a he-enriched circumstellar medium. however, unlike previoustype ibn supernovae, ps1-12sk is associated with an elliptical brightestcluster galaxy, cgcg 208-042 (z = 0.054) in cluster rxc j0844.9+4258. theexpected probability of an event like ps1-12sk in such environments is lowgiven the measured infrequency of core-collapse sne in red sequence galaxiescompounded by the low volumetric rate of sn ibn. furthermore, we find noevidence of star formation at the explosion site to sensitive limits (sigmahalpha &lt; 2x10^-3 m_sun/yr/kpc^2). we therefore discuss white dwarf binarysystems as a possible progenitor channel for sne ibn. we conclude that ps1-12skrepresents either a fortuitous and statistically unlikely discovery, evidencefor a top-heavy imf in galaxy cluster cooling flow filaments, or the first cluesuggesting an alternate progenitor channel for type ibn sne.

1304.3320	super luminous ic supernovae: catching a magnetar by the tail	we report extensive observational data for five of the lowest redshiftsuper-luminous type ic supernovae (sl-sne ic) discovered to date, namelyptf10hgi, sn2011ke, ptf11rks, sn2011kf and sn2012il. photometric imaging of thetransients at +50 to +230 days after peak combined with host galaxy subtractionreveals a luminous tail phase for four of these sl-sne. a high resolution,optical and near infrared spectrum from xshooter provides detection of a broadhe i $\lambda$10830 emission line in the spectrum (+50d) of sn2012il, revealingthat at least some sl-sne ic are not completely helium free. at first sight,the tail luminosity decline rates that we measure are consistent with theradioactive decay of \co, and would require 1-4m of \ni to produce theluminosity. these \ni masses cannot be made consistent with the short diffusiontimes at peak, and indeed are insufficient to power the peak luminosity. weinstead favour energy deposition by newborn magnetars as the power source forthese objects. a semi-analytical diffusion model with energy input from thespin-down of a magnetar reproduces the extensive lightcurve data well. themodel predictions of ejecta velocities and temperatures which are required arein reasonable agreement with those determined from our observations. we derivemagnetar energies of $0.4\lesssim e$($10^{51}$erg) $\lesssim6.9$ and ejectamasses of $2.3\lesssim m_{ej}$(\m) $\lesssim 8.6$. the sample of five sl-sne icpresented here, combined with sn 2010gx - the best sampled sl-sne ic so far -point toward an explosion driven by a magnetar as a viable explanation for allsl-sne ic.

1305.1803	stacked reverberation lags at high redshift	over the past 20years reverberation mapping has proved one of the mostsuccessful techniques for studying the local (&lt;1pc) environment ofsuper-massive black holes that drive active galactic nuclei. key successes ofreverberation mapping have been direct black hole mass estimates, theradius-luminosity relation for the hbeta line and the calibration ofsingle-epoch mass estimators commonly employed up to z~7. however, observingconstraints mean that few studies have been successful at z&gt;0.1, or for themore-luminous quasars that make up the majority of current spectroscopicsamples, or for the rest-frame ultra-violet emission lines available in opticalspectra of z&gt;0.5 objects.  previously we described a technique for stacking cross correlations to obtainreverberation mapping results at high z. here we present the first results froma campaign designed for this purpose. we construct stacked cross-correlationfunctions for the civ and mgii lines and find a clear peak in both. we find thepeak in the mgii correlation is at longer lags than civ consistent withprevious results at low redshift. for the civ sample we are able to bin byluminosity and find evidence for increasing lags for more-luminous objects.this civ radius-luminosity relation is consistent with previous studies butwith a fraction of the observational cost.

1305.5558	main-belt comet p/2012 t1 (panstarrs)	we present initial results from observations and numerical analyses aimed atcharacterizing main-belt comet p/2012 t1 (panstarrs). optical monitoringobservations were made between october 2012 and february 2013 using theuniversity of hawaii 2.2 m telescope, the keck i telescope, the baade and claymagellan telescopes, faulkes telescope south, the perkins telescope at lowellobservatory, and the southern astrophysical research (soar) telescope. theobject's intrinsic brightness approximately doubles from the time of itsdiscovery in early october until mid-november and then decreases by ~60%between late december and early february, similar to photometric behaviorexhibited by several other main-belt comets and unlike that exhibited bydisrupted asteroid (596) scheila. we also used keck to conduct spectroscopicsearches for cn emission as well as absorption at 0.7 microns that couldindicate the presence of hydrated minerals, finding an upper limit cnproduction rate of qcn&lt;1.5x10^23 mol/s, from which we infer a water productionrate of qh2o&lt;5x10^25 mol/s, and no evidence of the presence of hydratedminerals. numerical simulations indicate that p/2012 t1 is largely dynamicallystable for &gt;100 myr and is unlikely to be a recently implanted interloper fromthe outer solar system, while a search for potential asteroid familyassociations reveal that it is dynamically linked to the ~155 myr-old lixiaohuaasteroid family.

1307.5324	a search for fast optical transients in the pan-starrs1 medium-deep  survey: m dwarf flares, asteroids, limits on extragalactic rates, and  implications for lsst	[abridged] we present a search for fast optical transients (~0.5 hr-1 day)using repeated observations of the pan-starrs1 medium-deep survey (ps1/mds)fields. our search takes advantage of the consecutive g/r-band observations(16.5 min in each filter), by requiring detections in both bands, withnon-detections on preceding and subsequent nights. we identify 19 transientsbrighter than 22.5 ab mag (s/n&gt;10). of these, 11 events exhibit quiescentcounterparts in the deep ps1/mds templates that we identify as m4-m9 dwarfs.the remaining 8 transients exhibit a range of properties indicative ofmain-belt asteroids near the stationary point of their orbits. withidentifications for all 19 transients, we place an upper limit ofr_fot(0.5hr)&lt;0.12 deg^-2 d^-1 (95% confidence level) on the sky-projected rateof extragalactic fast transients at &lt;22.5 mag, a factor of 30-50 times lowerthan previous limits; the limit for a timescale of ~day is r_fot&lt;2.4e-3 deg^-2d^-1. to convert these sky-projected rates to volumetric rates, we explore theexpected peak luminosities of fast optical transients powered by variousmechanisms, and find that non-relativistic events are limited to m~-10 mag(m~-14 mag) for a timescale of ~0.5 hr (~day), while relativistic sources(e.g., grbs, magnetar-powered transients) can reach much larger luminosities.the resulting volumetric rates are &lt;13 (m~-10 mag), &lt;0.05 (m~-14 mag) and &lt;1e-6mpc^-3 yr^-1 (m~-24 mag), significantly above the nova, supernova, and grbrates, respectively, indicating that much larger surveys are required toprovide meaningful constraints. motivated by the results of our search wediscuss strategies for identifying fast optical transients in the lsst mainsurvey, and reach the optimistic conclusion that the veil of foregroundcontaminants can be lifted with the survey data, without the need for expensivefollow-up observations.

1309.0503	a search for l/t transition dwarfs with pan-starrs1 and wise: discovery  of seven nearby objects including two candidate spectroscopic variables	we present initial results from a wide-field (30,000 deg^2) search for l/ttransition brown dwarfs within 25 pc using the pan-starrs1 and wise surveys.previous large-area searches have been incomplete for l/t transition dwarfs,because these objects are faint in optical bands and have near-infrared colorsthat are difficult to distinguish from background stars. to overcome theseobstacles, we have cross-matched the pan-starrs1 (optical) and wise (mid-ir)catalogs to produce a unique multi-wavelength database for finding ultracooldwarfs. as part of our initial discoveries, we have identified seven browndwarfs in the l/t transition within 9-15 pc of the sun. the l9.5 dwarf psoj140.2308+45.6487 and the t1.5 dwarf pso j307.6784+07.8263 (both independentlydiscovered by mace et al. 2013) show possible spectroscopic variability at they- and j-bands. two more objects in our sample show evidence of photometricj-band variability, and two others are candidate unresolved binaries based ontheir spectra. we expect our full search to yield a well-defined,volume-limited sample of l/t transition dwarfs that will include many newtargets for study of this complex regime. pso j307.6784+07.8263 in particularmay be an excellent candidate for in-depth study of variability, given itsbrightness (j = 14.2 mag) and proximity (11 pc).

1309.3009	the uv-bright, slowly declining transient ps1-11af as a partial tidal  disruption event	we present the pan-starrs1 discovery of the long-lived and blue transientps1-11af, which was also detected by galex with coordinated observations in thenear-ultraviolet (nuv) band. ps1-11af is associated with the nucleus of anearly-type galaxy at redshift z=0.4046 that exhibits no evidence for starformation or agn activity. four epochs of spectroscopy reveal a pair oftransient broad absorption features in the uv on otherwise featureless spectra.despite the superficial similarity of these features to p-cygni absorptions ofsupernovae (sne), we conclude that ps1-11af is not consistent with theproperties of known types of sne. blackbody fits to the spectral energydistribution are inconsistent with the cooling, expanding ejecta of a sn, andthe velocities of the absorption features are too high to represent material inhomologous expansion near a sn photosphere. however, the constant blue colorsand slow evolution of the luminosity are similar to previous optically-selectedtidal disruption events (tdes). the shape of the optical light curve isconsistent with models for tdes, but the minimum accreted mass necessary topower the observed luminosity is only ~0.002m_sun, which points to a partialdisruption model. a full disruption model predicts higher bolometricluminosities, which would require most of the radiation to be emitted in aseparate component at high energies where we lack observations. in addition,the observed temperature is lower than that predicted by pure accretion diskmodels for tdes and requires reprocessing to a constant, lower temperature.three deep non-detections in the radio with the vla over the first two yearsafter the event set strict limits on the production of any relativistic outflowcomparable to swift j1644+57, even if off-axis.

1311.0026	hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae and long-duration gamma-ray  bursts have similar host galaxies	we present optical spectroscopy and optical/near-ir photometry of 31 hostgalaxies of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (slsne), including 15 eventsfrom the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey. our sample spans the redshift range0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1.6 and is the first comprehensive host galaxy study of this specificsubclass of cosmic explosions. combining the multi-band photometry andemission-line measurements, we determine the luminosities, stellar masses, starformation rates and metallicities. we find that as a whole, the hosts of slsneare a low-luminosity (&lt;m_b&gt; ~ -17.3 mag), low stellar mass (&lt;m_*&gt; ~ 2 x 10^8m_sun) population, with a high median specific star formation rate (&lt;ssfr&gt; ~ 2gyr^-1). the median metallicity of our spectroscopic sample is low, 12 +log(o/h}) ~ 8.35 ~ 0.45 z_sun, although at least one host galaxy has solarmetallicity. the host galaxies of h-poor slsne are statistically distinct fromthe hosts of goods core-collapse sne (which cover a similar redshift range),but resemble the host galaxies of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) interms of stellar mass, sfr, ssfr and metallicity. this result indicates thatthe environmental causes leading to massive stars forming either slsne or lgrbsare similar, and in particular that slsne are more effectively formed in lowmetallicity environments. we speculate that the key ingredient is large coreangular momentum, leading to a rapidly-spinning magnetar in slsne and anaccreting black hole in lgrbs.

1312.4736	the pan-starrs1 medium-deep survey: the role of galaxy group environment  in the star formation rate versus stellar mass relation and quiescent  fraction out to $z \sim 0.8$	using a large sample of field and group galaxies drawn from the pan-starrs1medium-deep survey, we present the specific star formation rate (ssfr) -stellar mass (m*) relation, as well as the quiescent fraction versus m*relation in different environments. we confirm that the fraction of quiescentgalaxies is strongly dependent on environment at a fixed stellar mass, but thatthe amplitude and the slope of the star-forming sequence is similar between thefield and groups: in other words, the ssfr-density relation at a fixed stellarmass is primarily driven by the change in the star-forming and quiescentfractions between different environments rather than a global suppression inthe star formation rate for the star-forming population. however, when werestrict our sample to the cluster-scale environments ($m&gt;10^{14}m_{solar}$),we find a global reduction in the ssfr of the star forming sequence of $17\%$at 4$\sigma$ confidence as opposed to its field counterpart. after removing thestellar mass dependence of the quiescent fraction seen in field galaxies, theexcess in the quiescent fraction due to the environment quenching in groups andclusters is found to increase with stellar mass. we argue that these resultsare in favor of galaxy mergers to be the primary environment quenchingmechanism operating in galaxy groups whereas strangulation is able to reproducethe observed trend in the environment quenching efficiency and stellar massrelation seen in clusters. our results also suggest that the relativeimportance between mass quenching and environment quenching depends on stellarmass -- the mass quenching plays a dominant role in producing quiescentgalaxies for more massive galaxies, while less massive galaxies are quenchedmostly through the environmental effect, with the transition mass around$1-2\times10^{10}m_{solar}$ in the group/cluster environment.

1402.1631	selecting superluminous supernovae in faint galaxies from the first year  of the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey	the pan-starrs1 (ps1) survey has obtained imaging in 5 bands (grizy_p1) over10 medium deep survey (mds) fields covering a total of 70 square degrees. thispaper describes the search for apparently hostless supernovae (sne) within thefirst year of ps1 mds data with an aim of discovering new superluminoussupernovae (slsne). a total of 249 hostless transients were discovered down toa limiting magnitude of m_ab ~ 23.5, of which 76 were classified as type iasne. there were 57 sne with complete light curves that are likely core-collapsesne (ccsne) or slsne and 12 of these have had spectra taken. of these 12hostless, non-type ia sne, 7 were slsne of type ic at redshifts between0.5-1.4. this illustrates that the discovery rate of type ic slsne can bemaximised by concentrating on hostless transients and removing normal sne ia.we present data for two new possible slsne; ps1-10pm (z = 1.206) and ps1-10ahf(z = 1.1), and estimate the rate of slsne-ic to be between 3^{+3}_{-2} *10^{-5} and 8^{+2}_{-1} * 10^{-5} of the ccsne rate within 0.3 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.4 byapplying a monte-carlo technique. the rate of slowly evolving, sn2007bi-likeexplosions is estimated as a factor of 10 lower than this range.

1402.6403	pan-starrs 1 observations of the unusual active centaur p/2011 s1(gibbs)	p/2011 s1 (gibbs) is an outer solar system comet or active centaur with asimilar orbit to that of the famous 29p/schwassmann-wachmann 1. p/2011 s1(gibbs) has been observed by the pan-starrs 1 (ps1) sky survey from 2010 to2012. the resulting data allow us to perform multi-color studies of the nucleusand coma of the comet. analysis of ps1 images reveals that p/2011 s1 (gibbs)has a small nucleus $&lt; 4$ km radius, with colors $g_{p1}-r_{p1} = 0.5 \pm0.02$, $r_{p1}-i_{p1} = 0.12 \pm 0.02$ and $i_{p1}-z_{p1} = 0.46 \pm 0.03$. thecomet remained active from 2010 to 2012, with a model-dependent mass-loss rateof $\sim100$ kg s$^{-1}$. the mass-loss rate per unit surface area of p/2011 s1(gibbs) is as high as that of 29p/schwassmann-wachmann 1, making it one of themost active centaurs. the mass-loss rate also varies with time from $\sim 40$kg s$^{-1}$ to 150 kg s$^{-1}$. due to its rather circular orbit, we proposethat p/2011 s1 (gibbs) has 29p/schwassmann-wachmann 1-like outbursts thatcontrol the outgassing rate. the results indicate that it may have a similarsurface composition to that of 29p/schwassmann-wachmann 1.  our numerical simulations show that the future orbital evolution of p/2011 s1(gibbs) is more similar to that of the main population of centaurs than to thatof 29p/schwassmann-wachmann 1. the results also demonstrate that p/2011 s1(gibbs) is dynamically unstable and can only remain near its current orbit forroughly a thousand years.

1403.3393	a large catalog of accurate distances to molecular clouds from ps1  photometry	distance measurements to molecular clouds are important, but are often madeseparately for each cloud of interest, employing very different different dataand techniques. we present a large, homogeneous catalog of distances tomolecular clouds, most of which are of unprecedented accuracy. we determinedistances using optical photometry of stars along lines of sight toward theseclouds, obtained from panstarrs-1. we simultaneously infer the reddenings anddistances to these stars, tracking the full probability distribution functionusing a technique presented in green et al. (2014). we fit these star-by-starmeasurements using a simple dust screen model to find the distance to eachcloud. we thus estimate the distances to almost all of the clouds in themagnani et al. (1985) catalog, as well as many other well-studied clouds,including orion, perseus, taurus, cepheus, polaris, california, and monocerosr2, avoiding only the inner galaxy. typical statistical uncertainties in thedistances are 5%, though the systematic uncertainty stemming from the qualityof our stellar models is about 10%. the resulting catalog is the largestcatalog of accurate, directly-measured distances to molecular clouds. ourdistance estimates are generally consistent with available distance estimatesfrom the literature, though in some cases the literature estimates are off by afactor of more than two.

1405.3668	rapidly-evolving and luminous transients from pan-starrs1	in the past decade, several rapidly-evolving transients have been discoveredwhose timescales and luminosities are not easily explained by traditionalsupernovae (sn) models. the sample size of these objects has remained smalldue, at least in part, to the challenge of detecting short timescale transientswith traditional survey cadences. here we present the results from a searchwithin the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey (ps1-mds) for rapidly-evolving andluminous transients. we identify 10 new transients with a time abovehalf-maximum of less than 12 days and -16.5 &gt; m &gt; -20 mag. this increases thenumber of known events in this region of sn phase space by roughly a factor ofthree. the median redshift of the ps1-mds sample is z=0.275 and they allexploded in star forming galaxies. in general, the transients possess fasterrise than decline timescale and blue colors at maximum light (g - r &lt; -0.2).best fit blackbodies reveal photospheric temperatures/radii that expand/coolwith time and explosion spectra taken near maximum light are dominated by ablue continuum, consistent with a hot, optically thick, ejecta. we find itdifficult to reconcile the short timescale, high peak luminosity (l &gt; 10^43erg/s), and lack of uv line blanketing observed in many of these transientswith an explosion powered mainly by the radioactive decay of ni-56. rather, wefind that many are consistent with either (1) cooling envelope emission fromthe explosion of a star with a low-mass extended envelope which ejected verylittle (&lt;0.03 m_sun) radioactive material, or (2) a shock breakout within adense, optically thick, wind surrounding the progenitor star. after calculatingthe detection efficiency for objects with rapid timescales in the ps1-mds wefind a volumetric rate of 4800 - 8000 events/yr/gpc^3 (4-7% of thecore-collapse sn rate at z=0.2).

1408.6807	observational constraints on the catastrophic disruption rate of small  main belt asteroids	we have calculated 90% confidence limits on the steady-state rate ofcatastrophic disruptions of main belt asteroids in terms of the absolutemagnitude at which one catastrophic disruption occurs per year (hcl) as afunction of the post-disruption increase in brightness (delta m) and subsequentbrightness decay rate (tau). the confidence limits were calculated using thebrightest unknown main belt asteroid (v = 18.5) detected with the pan-starrs1(pan-starrs1) telescope. we measured the pan-starrs1's catastrophic disruptiondetection efficiency over a 453-day interval using the pan-starrs moving objectprocessing system (mops) and a simple model for the catastrophic disruptionevent's photometric behavior in a small aperture centered on the catastrophicdisruption event. our simplistic catastrophic disruption model suggests thatdelta m = 20 mag and 0.01 mag d-1 &lt; tau &lt; 0.1 mag d-1 which would imply that h0= 28 -- strongly inconsistent with h0,b2005 = 23.26 +/- 0.02 predicted bybottke et al. (2005) using purely collisional models. we postulate that thesolution to the discrepancy is that &gt; 99% of main belt catastrophic disruptionsin the size range to which this study was sensitive (100 m) are notimpact-generated, but are instead due to fainter rotational breakups, of whichthe recent discoveries of disrupted asteroids p/2013 p5 and p/2013 r3 areprobable examples. we estimate that current and upcoming asteroid surveys maydiscover up to 10 catastrophic disruptions/year brighter than v = 18.5.

1501.05470	machine learning for transient discovery in pan-starrs1 difference  imaging	efficient identification and follow-up of astronomical transients is hinderedby the need for humans to manually select promising candidates from datastreams that contain many false positives. these artefacts arise in thedifference images that are produced by most major ground-based time domainsurveys with large format ccd cameras. this dependence on humans to rejectbogus detections is unsustainable for next generation all-sky surveys andsignificant effort is now being invested to solve the problem computationally.in this paper we explore a simple machine learning approach to real-bogusclassification by constructing a training set from the image data of ~32000real astrophysical transients and bogus detections from the pan-starrs1 mediumdeep survey. we derive our feature representation from the pixel intensityvalues of a 20x20 pixel stamp around the centre of the candidates. this differsfrom previous work in that it works directly on the pixels rather thancatalogued domain knowledge for feature design or selection. three machinelearning algorithms are trained (artificial neural networks, support vectormachines and random forests) and their performances are tested on a held-outsubset of 25% of the training data. we find the best results from the randomforest classifier and demonstrate that by accepting a false positive rate of1%, the classifier initially suggests a missed detection rate of around 10%.however we also find that a combination of bright star variability, nucleartransients and uncertainty in human labelling means that our best estimate ofthe missed detection rate is approximately 6%.

1507.04663	total eclipse of the heart: the am cvn gaia14aae / assasn-14cn	we report the discovery and characterisation of a deeply eclipsing amcvn-system, gaia14aae (= assasn-14cn). gaia14aae was identified independentlyby the all-sky automated survey for supernovae (asas-sn; shappee et al. 2014)and by the gaia science alerts project, during two separate outbursts. a thirdoutburst is seen in archival pan-starrs-1 (ps1; schlafly et al. 2012; tonry etal. 2012; magnier et al. 2013) and asas-sn data. spectroscopy reveals a hot,hydrogen-deficient spectrum with clear double-peaked emission lines, consistentwith an accreting double degenerate classification. we use follow-up photometryto constrain the orbital parameters of the system. we find an orbital period of49.71 min, which places gaia14aae at the long period extremum of theoutbursting am cvn period distribution. gaia14aae is dominated by the lightfrom its accreting white dwarf. assuming an orbital inclination of 90 degreesfor the binary system, the contact phases of the white dwarf lead to lowerlimits of 0.78 m solar and 0.015 m solar on the masses of the accretor anddonor respectively and a lower limit on the mass ratio of 0.019. gaia14aae isonly the third eclipsing am cvn star known, and the first in which the wd istotally eclipsed. using a helium wd model, we estimate the accretor's effectivetemperature to be 12900+-200 k. the three out-burst events occurred within 4months of each other, while no other outburst activity is seen in the previous8 years of catalina real-time transient survey (crts; drake et al. 2009),pan-starrs-1 and asas-sn data. this suggests that these events might berebrightenings of the first outburst rather than individual events.

1508.05361	supercal: cross-calibration of multiple photometric systems to improve  cosmological measurements with type ia supernovae	current cosmological analyses which use type ia supernova (sn ia)observations combine sn samples to expand the redshift range beyond that of asingle sample and increase the overall sample size. the inhomogeneousphotometric calibration between different sn samples is one of the largestsystematic uncertainties of the cosmological parameter estimation. to placethese different samples on a single system, analyses currently use observationsof a small sample of very bright flux standards on the $hst$ system. we proposea complementary method, called `supercal', in which we use measurements ofsecondary standards in each system, compare these to measurements of the samestars in the pan-starrs1 (ps1) system, and determine offsets for each systemrelative to ps1, placing all sn observations on a single, consistentphotometric system. ps1 has observed $3\pi$ of the sky and has a relativecalibration of better than 5 mmag (for $\sim15&lt;griz&lt;21$ mag), making it anideal reference system. we use this process to recalibrate optical observationstaken by the following sn samples: ps1, snls, sdss, csp, and cfa1-4. we measurediscrepancies on average of 10 mmag, but up to 35 mmag, in various opticalpassbands. we find that correcting for these differences changes recoveredvalues for the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, $w$, by on average$2.6\%$. this change is roughly half the size of current statisticalconstraints on $w$. the size of this effect strongly depends on the error inthe $b-v$ calibration of the low-$z$ surveys. the supercal method will allowfuture analyses to tie past samples to the best calibrated sample.

1509.04712	a pan-starrs1 study of the relationship between wide binarity and planet  occurrence in the kepler field	the nasa kepler mission has revolutionised time-domain astronomy and hasmassively expanded the number of known extrasolar planets. however, the effectof wide multiplicity on exoplanet occurrence has not been tested with thisdataset. we present a sample of 401 wide multiple systems containing at leastone kepler target star. our method uses pan-starrs1 and archival data toproduce an accurate proper motion catalogue of the kepler field. combined withpan-starrs1 sed fits and archival proper motions for bright stars, we use anewly developed probabilistic algorithm to identify likely wide binary pairswhich are not chance associations. as by-products of this we present stellarsed templates in the pan-starrs1 photometric system and conversions from thissystem to kepler magnitudes. we find that kepler target stars in our binarysample with separations above 6 arcseconds are no more or less likely to beidentified as confirmed or candidate planet hosts than a weighted comparisonsample of kepler targets of similar brightness and spectral type. therefore wefind no evidence that binaries with projected separations greater than 3,000auaffect the occurrence rate of planets with p&lt;300days around fgk stars.

1510.01739	pan-starrs1 variability of xmm-cosmos agn. i. impact on photometric  redshifts	[abbreviated] upcoming large area sky surveys like euclid and erositacrucially depend on accurate photometric redshifts (photo-z). theidentification of variable sources, such as agns, and the achievable redshiftaccuracy for varying objects are important in view of the science goals of theeuclid and erosita missions. we probe agn optical variability for a largesample of x-ray-selected agns in the xmm-cosmos field, using the light curvesprovided by the pan-starrs1 (ps1) 3pi and mdf04 surveys. utilizing twodifferent variability parameters, we defined a sample of varying agns for everyps1 band. we investigated the influence of variability on the calculation ofphoto-z by applying three different input photometry sets for our fittingprocedure. for each of the five ps1 bands, we chose either the epochsminimizing the interval in observing time, the median magnitude values, orrandomly drawn light curve points to compute the redshift. in addition, wederived photo-z using ps1 photometry extended by galex/irac bands. we find thatthe photometry produced by the 3pi survey is sufficient to reliably detectvariable sources provided that the fractional variability amplitude is at least3%. considering the photo-z of variable agns, we observe that minimizing thetime spacing of the chosen points yields superior photo-z in terms of thepercentage of outliers (33%) and accuracy (0.07), outperforming the other twoapproaches. drawing random points from the light curve gives rise to typically57% of outliers and an accuracy of 0.4. adding galex/irac bands for theredshift determination weakens the influence of variability. although theredshift quality generally improves when adding these bands, we still obtainnot less than 26% of outliers and an accuracy of 0.05 at best, thereforevariable sources should receive a flag stating that their photo-z may be lowquality.

1512.00469	evidence of fanning in the ophiuchus stream	the ophiuchus stellar stream presents a dynamical puzzle: its old stellarpopulations ($\sim 12$ gyr) cannot be reconciled with (1) its orbit in a simplemodel for the milky way potential and (2) its short angular extent, both ofwhich imply that the observed stream formed within the last $&lt;1$ gyr. recenttheoretical work has shown that streams on chaotic orbits may abruptly fan outnear their apparent ends; stars in these fans are dispersed in both positionand velocity and may be difficult to associate with the stream. here we presentthe first evidence of such stream-fanning in the ophiuchus stream, traced byfour blue horizontal branch (bhb) stars beyond the apparent end of the stream.these stars stand out from the background by their high velocities ($v_{\rmlos} &gt; 230$ km s$^{-1}$) against $\sim 40$ other stars: their velocities arecomparable to those of the stream, but would be exceptional if they wereunrelated halo stars. their positions and velocities are, however, inconsistentwith simple extrapolation of the observed cold, high-density portion of thestream. these observations suggest that stream-fanning may be a real,observable effect and, therefore, that ophiuchus may be on a chaotic orbit.they also show that the ophiuchus stream is more extended and hence dynamicallyolder than previously thought, easing the stellar population vs. dynamical agetension.

1512.07259	pan-planets: searching for hot jupiters around cool dwarfs	the pan-planets survey observed an area of 42 sq deg. in the galactic diskfor about 165 hours. the main scientific goal of the project is the detectionof transiting planets around m dwarfs. we establish an efficient procedure fordetermining the stellar parameters $t_{eff}$ and log$g$ of all sources using amethod based on sed fitting, utilizing a three-dimensional dust map and propermotion information. in this way we identify more than 60000 m dwarfs, which isby far the largest sample of low-mass stars observed in a transit survey todate. we present several planet candidates around m dwarfs and hotter starsthat are currently being followed up. using monte-carlo simulations wecalculate the detection efficiency of the pan-planets survey for differentstellar and planetary populations. we expect to find $3.0^{+3.3}_{-1.6}$ hotjupiters around f, g, and k dwarfs with periods lower than 10 days based on theplanet occurrence rates derived in previous surveys. for m dwarfs, thepercentage of stars with a hot jupiter is under debate. theoretical modelsexpect a lower occurrence rate than for larger main sequence stars. however,radial velocity surveys find upper limits of about 1\% due to their smallsample, while the kepler survey finds a occurrence rate that we estimate to beat least $0.17(^{+0.67}_{-0.04})$%, making it even higher than the determinedfraction from ogle-iii for f, g and k stellar types,$0.14(^{+0.15}_{-0.076})\%$. with the large sample size of pan-planets, we areable to determine an occurrence rate of $0.11(^{+0.37}_{-0.02})$% in case oneof our candidates turns out to be a real detection. if, however, none of ourcandidates turn out to be true planets, we are able to put an upper limit of0.34% with a 95% confidence on the hot jupiter occurrence rate of m dwarfs.therefore we cannot yet confirm the theoretical prediction of a loweroccurrence rate for cool stars.

0807.3070	core-collapse supernovae in low-metallicity environments and future  all-sky transient surveys	aims: massive stars in low-metallicity environments may produce exoticexplosions such as long-duration gamma-ray bursts and pair-instabilitysupernovae when they die as core-collapse supernovae (ccsne). here we determinethe feasibility of searching for these ccsne in metal-poor dwarf galaxies usingvarious survey strategies. methods: we determine oxygen abundances andstar-formation rates for all spectroscopically typed star-forming galaxies inthe sloan digital sky survey, data release 5, within z = 0.04. we then estimatethe ccsn rates for sub-samples of galaxies with differing upper-metallicitylimits. using monte-carlo simulations we then predict the fraction of theseccsne that we can expect to detect using different survey strategies. results:using a single 2m telescope (with a standard ccd camera) search we predict adetection rate of ~1.3 ccsne/yr in galaxies with metallicities below 12 +log(o/h) &lt; 8.2 which are within a volume that will allow detailed follow-upwith 4m and 8m telescopes (z = 0.04). with a network of seven 2m telescopes weestimate ~9.3 ccsne/yr could be found, although this would require more than1,000 hrs of telescope time allocated to the network. within the same radialdistance, a volume-limited search in the future pan-starrs ps1 all-sky surveyshould uncover 12.5 ccsne/yr in low-metallicity galaxies. over a period of afew years this would allow a detailed comparison of their properties. we thenextend our calculations to determine the total numbers of ccsne that canpotentially be found in magnitude-limited surveys with ps1 (24,000/yr, within z&lt; 0.6), ps4 (69,000/yr, within z &lt; 0.8) and lsst (160,000/yr, within z &lt; 0.9)surveys.

astro-ph;0310843	23 high redshift supernovae from the ifa deep survey: doubling the sn  sample at z&gt;0.7	we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of 23 high redshiftsupernovae spanning a range of z=0.34-1.03, 9 of which are unambiguouslyclassified as type ia. these supernovae were discovered during the ifa deepsurvey, which began in september 2001 and observed a total of 2.5 squaredegrees to a depth of approximately m=25-26 in riz over 9-17 visits, typicallyevery 1-3 weeks for nearly 5 months, with additional observations continuinguntil april 2002. we give a brief description of the survey motivations,observational strategy, and reduction process. this sample of 23 high-redshiftsupernovae includes 15 at z&gt;0.7, doubling the published number of objects atthese redshifts, and indicates that the evidence for acceleration of theuniverse is not due to a systematic effect proportional to redshift. incombination with the recent compilation of tonry et al. (2003), we calculatecosmological parameter density contours which are consistent with the flatuniverse indicated by the cmb (spergel et al. 2003). adopting the constraintthat omega_total = 1.0, we obtain best-fit values of (omega_m,omega_lambda)=(0.33, 0.67) using 22 sne from this survey augmented by theliterature compilation. we show that using the empty-beam model forgravitational lensing does not eliminate the need for omega_lambda &gt; 0.experience from this survey indicates great potential for similar large-scalesurveys while also revealing the limitations of performing surveys for z&gt;1 snefrom the ground.

astro-ph;9608063	spectroscopy of ultra--steep spectrum radio sources: a sample of z&gt;2  radio galaxies	we present spectroscopic observations for 64 radio galaxies having ultrasteep radio spectra. twenty-nine objects have redshifts $z&gt;2$, the largestredshifts being almost 4. our ultra steep spectrum (uss) criterion ($\alpha &lt;-1$) has proven to be the most efficient way of finding distant radio galaxies.we find that even among the uss sources, there is a strong statisticalcorrelation between the spectral index and redshift. the most distant radiogalaxies within the uss sample have the steepest radio spectra.  in our sample there are 3 radio galaxies at $z&gt;3$ compared with 26 at $2 &lt; z&lt; 3$. however, the present data do not allow us to decide whether there is adecrease in co-moving source density at the highest redshifts.  we have analyzed the spectra of the 30 objects with the highest redshifts($z&gt;1.9$). for these high redshift radio galaxies, ly$\alpha$ is almost alwaysthe dominant emission line, with a rest frame equivalent width ranging from$\sim100$ \aa\ to more than 1000 \aa. the equivalent widths of the mostimportant emission lines (ly$\alpha$, c\,{\small iv}, he\,{\small ii},c\,{\small iii}]) are found to correlate strongly with each other. the largerest frame equivalent widths and the correlation between the equivalent widthsof the emission lines, confirm that photoionization by a central continuumsource is most likely the dominant ionization mechanism.  there are significant velocity differences between the various emission linesof our high redshift radio galaxies; in particular the ly$\alpha$ line isshifted with respect to the higher ionization lines. velocity shifts range from100 to almost 1000 km s$^{-1}$ in some cases. simulations show that the effectsof associated h\,{\small i} absorption on the ly$\alpha$ emission line may be
