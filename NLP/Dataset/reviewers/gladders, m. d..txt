0707.0066	first detection of galaxy-galaxy-galaxy lensing in rcs. a new tool for  studying the matter environment of galaxy pairs	the weak gravitational lensing effect, small coherent distortions of galaxyimages by means of a gravitational tidal field, can be used to study therelation between the matter and galaxy distribution. in this context, weaklensing has so far only been used for considering a second-order correlationfunction that relates the matter density and galaxy number density as afunction of separation. we implement two new, third-order correlation functionsthat have recently been suggested in the literature, and apply them to thered-sequence cluster survey. we demonstrate that it is possible, even withalready existing data, to make significant measurements of third-order lensingcorrelations. we develop an optimised computer code for the correlationfunctions. to test its reliability a set of tests are performed. thecorrelation functions are transformed to aperture statistics, which allow easytests for remaining systematics in the data. in order to further verify therobustness of our measurement, the signal is shown to vanish when randomisingthe source ellipticities. finally, the lensing signal is compared to crudepredictions based on the halo-model. on angular scales between roughly 1 arcminand 11 arcmin a significant third-order correlation between two lens positionsand one source ellipticity is found. we discuss this correlation function as anovel tool to study the average matter environment of pairs of galaxies.correlating two source ellipticities and one lens position yields a lesssignificant but nevertheless detectable signal on a scale of 4 arcmin. bothsignals lie roughly within the range expected by theory which supports theircosmological origin.[abridged]

0911.0138	hst discovery of a z = 3.9 multiply imaged galaxy behind the complex  cluster lens warps j1415.1+36 at z = 1.026	we report the discovery of a multiply lensed ly alpha (lya) emitter at z =3.90 behind the massive galaxy cluster warps j1415.1+3612 at z = 1.026. imagestaken by the hubble space telescope(hst) using acs reveal a complex lensingsystem that produces a prominent, highly magnified arc and a triplet of smallerarcs grouped tightly around a spectroscopically confirmed cluster member.spectroscopic observations using focas on subaru confirm strong lya emission inthe source galaxy and provide redshifts for more than 21 cluster members, fromwhich we obtain a velocity dispersion of 807+/-185 km/s. assuming a singularisothermal sphere profile, the mass within the einstein ring (7.13+/-0.38")corresponds to a central velocity dispersion of 686+15-19 km/s for the cluster,consistent with the value estimated from cluster member redshifts. our massprofile estimate from combining strong lensing and dynamical analyses is ingood agreement with both x-ray and weak lensing results.

1003.0003	galaxy clusters selected with the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect from 2008  south pole telescope observations	we present a detection-significance-limited catalog of 21 sunyaev-zel'dovichselected galaxy clusters. these clusters, along with 1 unconfirmed candidate,were identified in 178 deg^2 of sky surveyed in 2008 by the south poletelescope to a depth of 18 uk-arcmin at 150 ghz. optical imaging from theblanco cosmology survey (bcs) and magellan telescopes provided photometric (andin some cases spectroscopic) redshift estimates, with catalog redshifts rangingfrom z=0.15 to z&gt;1, with a median z = 0.74. of the 21 confirmed galaxyclusters, three were previously identified as abell clusters, three werepresented as spt discoveries in staniszewski et al, 2009, and three were firstidentified in a recent analysis of bcs data by menanteau et al, 2010; theremaining 12 clusters are presented for the first time in this work. simulatedobservations of the spt fields predict the sample to be nearly 100% completeabove a mass threshold of m_200 ~ 5x10^14 m_sun/h at z = 0.6. this completenessthreshold pushes to lower mass with increasing redshift, dropping to ~4x10^14m_sun/h at z=1. the size and redshift distribution of this catalog are in goodagreement with expectations based on our current understanding of galaxyclusters and cosmology. in combination with other cosmological probes, we usethe cluster catalog to improve estimates of cosmological parameters. assuming astandard spatially flat wcdm cosmological model, the addition of our catalog tothe wmap 7-year analysis yields sigma_8 = 0.81 +- 0.09 and w = -1.07 +- 0.29, a~50% improvement in precision on both parameters over wmap7 alone.

1006.3068	x-ray properties of the first sze-selected galaxy cluster sample from  the south pole telescope	we present results of x-ray observations of a sample of 15 clusters selectedvia their imprint on the cosmic microwave background (cmb) from the thermalsunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect. these clusters are a subset of the firstsz-selected cluster catalog, obtained from observations of 178 deg^2 of skysurveyed by the south pole telescope. using x-ray observations with chandra andxmm-newton, we estimate the temperature, t_x, and mass, m_g, of theintracluster medium (icm) within r_500 for each cluster. from these, wecalculate y_x=m_g t_x and estimate the total cluster mass using a m_500-y_xscaling relation measured from previous x-ray studies. the integratedcomptonization, y_sz, is derived from the sz measurements, using additionalinformation from the x-ray measured gas density profiles and a universaltemperature profile. we calculate scaling relations between the x-ray and szobservables, and find results generally consistent with other measurements andthe expectations from simple self-similar behavior. specifically, we fit ay_sz-y_x relation and find a normalization of 0.82 +- 0.07, marginallyconsistent with the predicted ratio of y_sz/y_x=0.91+-0.01 that would beexpected from the density and temperature models used in this work. using they_x derived mass estimates, we fit a y_sz-m_500 relation and find a slopeconsistent with the self-similar expectation of y_sz ~ m^5/3 with anormalization consistent with predictions from other x-ray studies. we comparethe x-ray mass estimates to previously published sz mass estimates derived fromcosmological simulations of the spt survey. we find that the sz mass estimatesare lower by a factor of 0.89+-0.06, which is within the ~15% systematicuncertainty quoted for the simulation-based sz masses.

1012.3470	the red-sequence cluster survey-2 (rcs-2): survey details and  photometric catalog construction	the second red-sequence cluster survey (rcs-2) is a ~1000 square degree,multi-color imaging survey using the square-degree imager, megacam, on thecanada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht). it is designed to detect clusters ofgalaxies over the redshift range 0.1&lt;~z&lt;~1. the primary aim is to build astatistically complete, large (~10^4) sample of clusters, covering asufficiently long redshift baseline to be able to place constraints oncosmological parameters via the evolution of the cluster mass function. othermain science goals include building a large sample of high surface brightness,strongly gravitationally-lensed arcs associated with these clusters, and anunprecedented sample of several tens of thousands of galaxy clusters andgroups, spanning a large range of halo mass, with which to study the propertiesand evolution of their member galaxies.  this paper describes the design of the survey and the methodology foracquiring, reducing and calibrating the data for the production ofhigh-precision photometric catalogs. we describe the method for calibrating ourgriz imaging data using the colors of the stellar locus and overlappingtwo-micron all-sky survey (2mass) photometry. this yields an absolute accuracyof &lt;0.03 mag on any color and ~0.05 mag in the r-band magnitude, verified withrespect to the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). rcs-2 reaches average 5 sigmapoint source limiting magnitudes of griz = [24.4, 24.3, 23.7, 22.8],approximately 1-2 magnitudes deeper than the sdss. due to the queue-schedulednature of the observations, the data are highly uniform and taken in excellentseeing, mostly fwhm&lt;~0.7" in the r-band. in addition to the main science goalsjust described, these data form the basis for a number of other planned andongoing projects (including the wigglez survey), making rcs-2 an importantnext-generation imaging survey.

1101.1286	discovery and cosmological implications of spt-cl j2106-5844, the most  massive known cluster at z &gt; 1	using the south pole telescope (spt), we have discovered the most massiveknown galaxy cluster at z &gt; 1, spt-cl j2106-5844. in addition to producing astrong sunyaev-zel'dovich effect signal, this system is a luminous x-ray sourceand its numerous constituent galaxies display spatial and color clustering, allindicating the presence of a massive galaxy cluster. vlt and magellanspectroscopy of 18 member galaxies shows that the cluster is at z =1.132^+0.002_-0.003. chandra observations obtained through a combined hrc-acisgto program reveal an x-ray spectrum with an fe k line redshifted by z = 1.18+/- 0.03. these redshifts are consistent with galaxy colors in extensiveoptical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared imaging. spt-cl j2106-5844 displaysextreme x-ray properties for a cluster, having a core-excluded temperature ofkt = 11.0^+2.6_-1.9 kev and a luminosity (within r_500) of l_x (0.5 - 2.0 kev)= (13.9 +/- 1.0) x 10^44 erg/s. the combined mass estimate from measurements ofthe sunyaev-zel'dovich effect and x-ray data is m_200 = (1.27 +/- 0.21) x 10^15m_sun. the discovery of such a massive gravitationally collapsed system at highredshift provides an interesting laboratory for galaxy formation and evolution,and is a powerful probe of extreme perturbations of the primordial matterdensity field. we discuss the latter, determining that, under the assumption oflambdacdm cosmology with only gaussian perturbations, there is only a 7% chanceof finding a galaxy cluster similar to spt-cl j2106-5844 in the 2500 deg^2 sptsurvey region, and that only one such galaxy cluster is expected in the entiresky.

1101.1290	an sz-selected sample of the most massive galaxy clusters in the  2500-square-degree south pole telescope survey	the south pole telescope (spt) is currently surveying 2500 deg^2 of thesouthern sky to detect massive galaxy clusters out to the epoch of theirformation using the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect. this paper presents acatalog of the 26 most significant sz cluster detections in the full surveyregion. the catalog includes 14 clusters which have been previously identifiedand 12 that are new discoveries. these clusters were identified in fieldsobserved to two differing noise depths: 1500 deg^2 at the final spt surveydepth of 18 uk-arcmin at 150 ghz, and 1000 deg^2 at a depth of 54 uk-arcmin.clusters were selected on the basis of their sz signal-to-noise ratio (s/n) inspt maps, a quantity which has been demonstrated to correlate tightly withcluster mass. the s/n thresholds were chosen to achieve a comparable massselection across survey fields of both depths. cluster redshifts were obtainedwith optical and infrared imaging and spectroscopy from a variety of ground-and space-based facilities. the redshifts range from 0.098 \leq z \leq 1.132with a median of z_med = 0.40. the measured sz s/n and redshifts lead tounbiased mass estimates ranging from 9.8 \times 10^14 m_sun/h_70 \leqm_200(rho_mean) \leq 3.1 \times 10^15 m_sun/h_70. based on the sz massestimates, we find that none of the clusters are individually in significanttension with the lambdacdm cosmological model. we also test for evidence ofnon-gaussianity based on the cluster sample and find the data show nopreference for non-gaussian perturbations.

1105.3186	scaling relations and overabundance of massive clusters at z&gt;~1 from  weak-lensing studies with hst	we present weak gravitational lensing analysis of 22 high-redshift (z &gt;~1)clusters based on hubble space telescope images. most clusters in our sampleprovide significant lensing signals and are well detected in theirreconstructed two-dimensional mass maps. combining the current results and ourprevious weak-lensing studies of five other high-z clusters, we comparegravitational lensing masses of these clusters with other observables. werevisit the question whether the presence of the most massive clusters in oursample is in tension with the current lambdacdm structure formation paradigm.we find that the lensing masses are tightly correlated with the gastemperatures and establish, for the first time, the lensing mass-temperaturerelation at z &gt;~ 1. for the power law slope of the m-tx relation (m proptot^{\alpha}), we obtain \alpha=1.54 +/- 0.23. this is consistent with thetheoretical self-similar prediction \alpha=3/2 and with the results previouslyreported in the literature for much lower redshift samples. however, ournormalization is lower than the previous results by 20-30%, indicating that thenormalization in the m-tx relation might evolve. after correcting for eddingtonbias and updating the discovery area with a more conservative choice, we findthat the existence of the most massive clusters in our sample still provides atension with the current lambda cdm model. the combined probability of findingthe four most massive clusters in this sample after marginalization overcurrent cosmological parameters is less than 1%.

1109.5125	submillimetre source counts in the fields of high-redshift galaxy  clusters	we present a submillimetre survey of seven high-z galaxy clusters(0.64&lt;z&lt;1.0) using the submillimetre common-user bolometer array (scuba) at 850and 450 um. the targets, of similar richness and redshift, are selected fromthe red-sequence cluster survey (rcs). we use this sample to investigate theapparent excess of submillimetre source counts in the direction of clusterfields compared to blank fields. the sample consists of three galaxy clustersthat exhibit multiple optical arcs due to strong gravitational lensing, and acontrol group of four clusters with no apparent strong lensing. a tentativeexcess of 2.7-sigma is seen in the number density of submillimetre luminousgalaxies (smgs) within the lensing cluster fields compared to that in thecontrol group. ancillary observations at radio, mid-infrared, optical, andx-ray wavelengths allow for the identification of counterparts to many of thesmgs. utilizing photometric redshifts, we conclude that at least three of thegalaxies within the lensing fields have redshifts consistent with the clustersand implied infrared luminosities of ~10^12 lsol. the existence of smg clustermembers may therefore be boosting source counts in the lensing cluster fields,which might be an effect of the dynamical state of those clusters. however, wefind that the removal of potential cluster members from the counts analysisdoes not entirely eliminate the difference between the cluster samples. we alsoinvestigate possible occurrences of lensing between background smgs and lower-zoptical galaxies, though further observations are required to make anyconclusive claims. although the excess counts between the two cluster sampleshave not been unambiguously accounted for, these results warrant caution forinterpreting submillimetre source counts in cluster fields and point sourcecontamination for sunyaev-zel'dovich surveys.

0710.2351	the red-sequence luminosity function in galaxy clusters since z~1	we use a statistical sample of ~500 rich clusters taken from 72 squaredegrees of the red-sequence cluster survey (rcs-1) to study the evolution of~30,000 red-sequence galaxies in clusters over the redshift range 0.35&lt;z&lt;0.95.we construct red-sequence luminosity functions (rslfs) for a well-defined,homogeneously selected, richness limited sample. the rslf at higher redshiftsshows a deficit of faint red galaxies (to m_v=&gt; -19.7) with their numbersincreasing towards the present epoch. this is consistent with the `down-sizing`picture in which star-formation ended at earlier times for the most massive(luminous) galaxies and more recently for less massive (fainter) galaxies. weobserve a richness dependence to the down-sizing effect in the sense that, at agiven redshift, the drop-off of faint red galaxies is greater for poorer (lessmassive) clusters, suggesting that star-formation ended earlier for galaxies inmore massive clusters. the decrease in faint red-sequence galaxies isaccompanied by an increase in faint blue galaxies, implying that the processresponsible for this evolution of faint galaxies is the termination ofstar-formation, possibly with little or no need for merging. at the bright end,we also see an increase in the number of blue galaxies with increasingredshift, suggesting that termination of star-formation in higher mass galaxiesmay also be an important formation mechanism for higher mass ellipticals. bycomparing with a low-redshift abell cluster sample, we find that thedown-sizing trend seen within rcs-1 has continued to the local universe.

1112.5435	cosmological constraints from sunyaev-zel'dovich-selected clusters with  x-ray observations in the first 178 square degrees of the south pole  telescope survey	we use measurements from the south pole telescope (spt) sunyaev zel'dovich(sz) cluster survey in combination with x-ray measurements to constraincosmological parameters. we present a statistical method that fits for thescaling relations of the sz and x-ray cluster observables with mass whilejointly fitting for cosmology. the method is generalizable to multiple clusterobservables, and self-consistently accounts for the effects of the clusterselection and uncertainties in cluster mass calibration on the derivedcosmological constraints. we apply this method to a data set consisting of ansz-selected catalog of 18 galaxy clusters at z &gt; 0.3 from the first 178 deg2 ofthe 2500 deg2 spt-sz survey, with 14 clusters having x-ray observations fromeither chandra or xmm. assuming a spatially flat lcdm cosmological model, wefind the spt cluster sample constrain sigma_8 (omega_m/0.25)^0.30 = 0.785 +-0.037. in combination with measurements of the cmb power spectrum from the sptand the seven-year wmap data, the spt cluster sample constrain sigma_8 = 0.795+- 0.016 and omega_m = 0.255 +- 0.016, a factor of 1.5 improvement on eachparameter over the cmb data alone. we consider several extensions beyond thelcdm model by including the following as free parameters: the dark energyequation of state (w), the sum of the neutrino masses (sum mnu), the effectivenumber of relativistic species (neff), and a primordial non-gaussianity (fnl).we find that adding the spt cluster data significantly improves the constraintson w and sum mnu beyond those found when using measurements of the cmb,supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the hubble constant. consideringeach extension independently, we best constrain w=-0.973 +- 0.063 and the sumof neutrino masses sum mnu &lt; 0.28 ev at 95% confidence, a factor of 1.25 and1.4 improvement, respectively, over the constraints without clusters.

1207.4369	redshifts, sample purity, and bcg positions for the galaxy cluster  catalog from the first 720 square degrees of the south pole telescope survey	we present the results of the ground- and space-based optical andnear-infrared (nir) follow-up of 224 galaxy cluster candidates detected withthe sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect in the 720 deg^2 of the south pole telescope(spt) survey completed in the 2008 and 2009 observing seasons. we use theoptical/nir data to establish whether each candidate is associated with anoverdensity of galaxies and to estimate the cluster redshift. most photometricredshifts are derived through a combination of three different cluster redshiftestimators using red-sequence galaxies, resulting in an accuracy of \deltaz/(1+z)=0.017, determined through comparison with a subsample of 57 clustersfor which we have spectroscopic redshifts. we successfully measure redshiftsfor 158 systems and present redshift lower limits for the remaining candidates.the redshift distribution of the confirmed clusters extends to z=1.35 with amedian of z_{med}=0.57. approximately 18% of the sample with measured redshiftslies at z&gt;0.8. we estimate a lower limit to the purity of this spt sz-selectedsample by assuming that all unconfirmed clusters are noise fluctuations in thespt data. we show that the cumulative purity at detection significance \xi&gt;5(\xi&gt;4.5) is &gt;= 95 (&gt;= 70%). we present the red brightest cluster galaxy (rbcg)positions for the sample and examine the offsets between the spt candidateposition and the rbcg. the radial distribution of offsets is similar to thatseen in x-ray-selected cluster samples, providing no evidence that sz-selectedcluster samples include a different fraction of recent mergers thanx-ray-selected cluster samples.

1208.2962	a massive, cooling-flow-induced starburst in the core of a highly  luminous galaxy cluster	in the cores of some galaxy clusters the hot intracluster plasma is denseenough that it should cool radiatively in the cluster's lifetime, leading tocontinuous "cooling flows" of gas sinking towards the cluster center, yet nosuch cooling flow has been observed. the low observed star formation rates andcool gas masses for these "cool core" clusters suggest that much of the coolingmust be offset by astrophysical feedback to prevent the formation of a runawaycooling flow. here we report x-ray, optical, and infrared observations of thegalaxy cluster spt-clj2344-4243 at z = 0.596. these observations reveal anexceptionally luminous (l_2-10 kev = 8.2 x 10^45 erg/s) galaxy cluster whichhosts an extremely strong cooling flow (dm/dt = 3820 +/- 530 msun/yr). further,the central galaxy in this cluster appears to be experiencing a massivestarburst (740 +/- 160 msun/yr), which suggests that the feedback sourceresponsible for preventing runaway cooling in nearby cool core clusters may notyet be fully established in spt-clj2344-4243. this large star formation rateimplies that a significant fraction of the stars in the central galaxy of thiscluster may form via accretion of the intracluster medium, rather than thecurrent picture of central galaxies assembling entirely via mergers.

1303.2723	dusty starburst galaxies in the early universe as revealed by  gravitational lensing	in the past decade, our understanding of galaxy evolution has beenrevolutionized by the discovery that luminous, dusty, starburst galaxies were1,000 times more abundant in the early universe than at present. it has,however, been difficult to measure the complete redshift 2 distribution ofthese objects, especially at the highest redshifts (z &gt; 4). here we report aredshift survey at a wavelength of three millimeters, targeting carbon monoxideline emission from the star-forming molecular gas in the direction ofextraordinarily bright millimetrewave-selected sources. high-resolution imagingdemonstrates that these sources are strongly gravitationally lensed byforeground galaxies. we detect spectral lines in 23 out of 26 sources andmultiple lines in 12 of those 23 sources, from which we obtain robust,unambiguous redshifts. at least 10 of the sources are found to lie at z &gt; 4,indicating that the fraction of dusty starburst galaxies at high redshifts isgreater than previously thought. models of lens geometries in the sampleindicate that the background objects are ultra-luminous infrared galaxies,powered by extreme bursts of star formation.

(2008). the targets were selected based on the presenceof a intervening mgii absorption system at a similar redshift to that of agalaxy cluster candidate lying at a projected distance &lt; 2 h^{-1}mpc from theqso sight-line (a 'photometric-hit'). the absorption systems span rest-frameequivalent widths between 0.015 and 2.028 angstroms. our aim was 3-fold: 1)identify the absorbing galaxies and determine their impact parameters, 2)confirm the galaxy cluster candidates in the vicinity of each quasar sightline,and 3) determine whether the absorbing galaxies reside in galaxy clusters. ourmain findings are: 1) the identification of 10 out of 24 absorbing galaxieswith redshifts up to 1.0955. 2) the spectroscopic confirmation of 20 out of 31cluster/group candidates, with most of the confirmed clusters/groups at z &lt;0.7. 3) following from the results above, the spectroscopic confirmation of 10out of 14 photometric hits within ~ 650 km/s from galaxy clusters/groups, inaddition to 2 new ones related to galaxy group environments. these numbersimply efficiencies of 71% in finding such systems with mos spectroscopy. thisis a remarkable result since we defined a photometric hit as thosecluster-absorber pairs having a redshift difference dz = 0.1. absorbingcluster-galaxies hosting weak absorbers are consistent with lower starformation activity than the rest, which produce strong absorption and agreewith typical mgii absorbing galaxies found in the literature. our spectroscopicconfirmations lend support to the selection of photometric hits made in lopezet al.

1404.6250	the redshift evolution of the mean temperature, pressure, and entropy  profiles in 80 spt-selected galaxy clusters	(abridged) we present the results of an x-ray analysis of 80 galaxy clustersselected in the 2500 deg^2 south pole telescope survey and observed with thechandra x-ray observatory. we divide the full sample into subsamples of ~20clusters based on redshift and central density, performing an x-ray fit to allclusters in a subsample simultaneously, assuming self-similarity of thetemperature profile. this approach allows us to constrain the shape of thetemperature profile over 0&lt;r&lt;1.5r500, which would be impossible on aper-cluster basis, since the observations of individual clusters have, onaverage, 2000 x-ray counts. the results presented here represent the firstconstraints on the evolution of the average temperature profile from z=0 toz=1.2. we find that high-z (0.6&lt;z&lt;1.2) clusters are slightly (~40%) cooler bothin the inner (r&lt;0.1r500) and outer (r&gt;r500) regions than their low-z(0.3&lt;z&lt;0.6) counterparts. combining the average temperature profile withmeasured gas density profiles from our earlier work, we infer the averagepressure and entropy profiles for each subsample. overall, our observedpressure profiles agree well with earlier lower-redshift measurements,suggesting minimal redshift evolution in the pressure profile outside of thecore. we find no measurable redshift evolution in the entropy profile atr&lt;0.7r500. we observe a slight flattening of the entropy profile at r&gt;r500 inour high-z subsample. this flattening is consistent with a temperature bias dueto the enhanced (~3x) rate at which group-mass (~2 kev) halos, which would goundetected at our survey depth, are accreting onto the cluster at z~1. thiswork demonstrates a powerful method for inferring spatially-resolved clusterproperties in the case where individual cluster signal-to-noise is low, but thenumber of observed clusters is high.

1406.3356	on the lack of correlation between mg ii 2796, 2803 angstrom and lyman  alpha emission in lensed star-forming galaxies	we examine the mg ii 2796, 2803 angstrom, lyman alpha, and nebular lineemission in five bright star-forming galaxies at 1.66&lt;z&lt;1.91 that have beengravitationally lensed by foreground galaxy clusters. all five galaxies showprominent mg ii emission and absorption in a p cygni profile. we find nocorrelation between the equivalent widths of mg ii and lyman alpha emission.the mg ii emission has a broader range of velocities than do the nebularemission line profiles; the mg ii emission is redshifted with respect tosystemic by 100 to 200 km/s. when present, lyman alpha is even more redshifted.the reddest components of mg ii and lyman alpha emission have tails to 500-600km/s, implying a strong outflow. the lack of correlation in the mg ii and lymanalpha equivalent widths, the differing velocity profiles, and the high ratiosof mg ii to nebular line fluxes together suggest that the bulk of mg iiemission does not ultimately arise as nebular line emission, but may instead bereprocessed stellar continuum emission.

1406.4149	the inside-out growth of the most massive galaxies at 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.9	we study the surface brightness profiles of a sample of brightest clustergalaxies (bcgs) with 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.9. the bcgs are selected from the firstred-sequence cluster survey and an x-ray cluster survey. the surface brightnessprofiles of the bcgs are measured using hst acs images, and most of them can bewell modeled by a sersic profile with index ~ 6 and half-light radius ~ 30 kpc.although the single sersic model fits the profiles well, we argue that thesystematics in the sky background measurement and the coupling between themodel parameters make the comparison of the model parameters ambiguous. directcomparison of the bcg profiles, on the other hand, has revealed an inside-outgrowth for these most massive galaxies: as the mass of a bcg increases, thecentral mass density of the galaxy increases slowly ($\rho_{1kpc} \proptom*^{0.39}$), while the slope of the outer profile grows continuously shallower($\alpha \propto m*^{-2.5}$). such a fashion of growth continues down to theless massive early-type galaxies (etgs), without apparent distinction betweenbcgs and non-bcgs. for the very massive etgs and bcgs, the slope of thekormendy relation starts to trace the slope of the surface brightness profilesand becomes insensitive to subtle profile evolution. these results aregenerally consistent with dry mergers being the major driver of the mass growthfor bcgs and massive etgs. we also find strong correlations between therichness of clusters and the properties of bcgs: the more massive the clustersare, the more massive the bcgs ($m*_{bcg} \propto m_{clusters}^{0.6}$) and theshallower their surface brightness profiles. after taking into account the biasin the cluster samples, we find the masses of the bcgs have grown by at least afactor of 1.5 from z=0.5 to z=0, in contrast to the previous findings of noevolution. such an evolution validates the expectation from the lcdm model.

1407.2942	mass calibration and cosmological analysis of the spt-sz galaxy cluster  sample using velocity dispersion $\sigma_v$ and x-ray $y_\textrm{x}$  measurements	we present a velocity dispersion-based mass calibration of the south poletelescope sunyaev-zel'dovich effect survey (spt-sz) galaxy cluster sample.using a homogeneously selected sample of 100 cluster candidates from 720 deg2of the survey along with 63 velocity dispersion ($\sigma_v$) and 16 x-ray yxmeasurements of sample clusters, we simultaneously calibrate themass-observable relation and constrain cosmological parameters. thecalibrations using $\sigma_v$ and yx are consistent at the $0.6\sigma$ level,with the $\sigma_v$ calibration preferring ~16% higher masses. we use the fullcluster dataset to measure $\sigma_8(\omega_ m/0.27)^{0.3}=0.809\pm0.036$. thespt cluster abundance is lower than preferred by either the wmap9 orplanck+wmap9 polarization (wp) data, but assuming the sum of the neutrinomasses is $\sum m_\nu=0.06$ ev, we find the datasets to be consistent at the1.0$\sigma$ level for wmap9 and 1.5$\sigma$ for planck+wp. allowing for larger$\sum m_\nu$ further reconciles the results. when we combine the cluster andplanck+wp datasets with bao and snia, the preferred cluster masses are$1.9\sigma$ higher than the yx calibration and $0.8\sigma$ higher than the$\sigma_v$ calibration. given the scale of these shifts (~44% and ~23% in mass,respectively), we execute a goodness of fit test; it reveals no tension,indicating that the best-fit model provides an adequate description of thedata. using the multi-probe dataset, we measure $\omega_ m=0.299\pm0.009$ and$\sigma_8=0.829\pm0.011$. within a $\nu$cdm model we find $\sum m_\nu =0.148\pm0.081$ ev. we present a consistency test of the cosmic growth rate.allowing both the growth index $\gamma$ and the dark energy equation of stateparameter $w$ to vary, we find $\gamma=0.73\pm0.28$ and $w=-1.007\pm0.065$,demonstrating that the expansion and the growth histories are consistent with alcdm model ($\gamma=0.55; \,w=-1$).

0804.1604	pair analysis of field galaxies from the red-sequence cluster survey	we study the evolution of the number of close companions of similarluminosities per galaxy (nc) by choosing a volume-limited subset of thephotometric redshift catalog from the red-sequence cluster survey (rcs-1). thesample contains over 157,000 objects with a moderate redshift range of 0.25 &lt; z&lt; 0.8 and absolute magnitude in rc (m_rc) &lt; -20. this is the largest sampleused for pair evolution analysis, providing data over 9 redshift bins withabout 17,500 galaxies in each. after applying incompleteness and projectioncorrections, nc shows a clear evolution with redshift. the nc value for thewhole sample grows with redshift as (1+z)^m, where m = 2.83 +/- 0.33 in goodagreement with n-body simulations in a lcdm cosmology. we also separate thesample into two different absolute magnitude bins: -25 &lt; m_rc &lt; -21 and -21 &lt;m_rc &lt; -20, and find that the brighter the absolute magnitude, the smaller them value. furthermore, we study the evolution of the pair fraction for differentprojected separation bins and different luminosities. we find that the m valuebecomes smaller for larger separation, and the pair fraction for the fainterluminosity bin has stronger evolution. we derive the major merger remnantfraction f_rem = 0.06, which implies that about 6% of galaxies with -25 &lt; m_rc&lt; -20 have undergone major mergers since z = 0.8.

1412.7521	a measurement of gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave  background by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope	clusters of galaxies are expected to gravitationally lens the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) and thereby generate a distinct signal in the cmb onarcminute scales. measurements of this effect can be used to constrain themasses of galaxy clusters with cmb data alone. here we present a measurement oflensing of the cmb by galaxy clusters using data from the south pole telescope(spt). we develop a maximum likelihood approach to extract the cmb clusterlensing signal and validate the method on mock data. we quantify the effects onour analysis of several potential sources of systematic error and find thatthey generally act to reduce the best-fit cluster mass. it is estimated thatthis bias to lower cluster mass is roughly $0.85\sigma$ in units of thestatistical error bar, although this estimate should be viewed as an upperlimit. we apply our maximum likelihood technique to 513 clusters selected viatheir sz signatures in spt data, and rule out the null hypothesis of no lensingat $3.1\sigma$. the lensing-derived mass estimate for the full cluster sampleis consistent with that inferred from the sz flux: $m_{200,\mathrm{lens}} =0.83_{-0.37}^{+0.38}\, m_{200,\mathrm{sz}}$ (68% c.l., statistical error only).

1502.01026	a calibration of nicmos camera 2 for low count-rates	nicmos 2 observations are crucial for constraining distances to most of theexisting sample of z &gt; 1 sne ia. unlike the conventional calibration programs,these observations involve long exposure times and low count rates. reciprocityfailure is known to exist in hgcdte devices and a correction for this effecthas already been implemented for high and medium count-rates. howeverobservations at faint count-rates rely on extrapolations. here instead, weprovide a new zeropoint calibration directly applicable to faint sources. thisis obtained via inter-calibration of nic2 f110w/f160w with wfc3 in the lowcount-rate regime using z ~ 1 elliptical galaxies as tertiary calibrators.these objects have relatively simple near-ir seds, uniform colors, and theirextended nature gives superior signal-to-noise at the same count rate thanwould stars. the use of extended objects also allows greater tolerances on psfprofiles. we find st magnitude zeropoints (after the installation of the nicmoscooling system, ncs) of 25.296 +- 0.022 for f110w and 25.803 +- 0.023 forf160w, both in agreement with the calibration extrapolated from count-rates1,000 times larger (25.262 and 25.799). before the installation of the ncs, wefind 24.843 +- 0.025 for f110w and 25.498 +- 0.021 for f160w, also in agreementwith the high-count-rate calibration (24.815 and 25.470). we also check thestandard bandpasses of wfc3 and nicmos 2 using a range of stars and galaxies atdifferent colors and find mild tension for wfc3, limiting the accuracy of thezeropoints. to avoid human bias, our cross-calibration was "blinded" in thatthe fitted zeropoint differences were hidden until the analysis was finalized.

astro-ph;0203218	the explore project i: a deep search for transiting extrasolar planets	(abridged) we discuss the design considerations of the explore (extra-solarplanet occultation research) project, a series of transiting planet searchesusing 4-m-class telescopes to continuously monitor a single field of stars inthe galactic plane in each ~2 week observing campaign. we discuss the generalfactors which determine the efficiency and the number of planets found by atransit search, including time sampling strategy and field selection. theprimary goal is to select the most promising planet candidates for radialvelocity follow-up observations. we show that with very high photometricprecision light curves that have frequent time sampling and at least twodetected transits, it is possible to uniquely solve for the main parameters ofthe eclipsing system (including planet radius) based on several importantassumptions about the central star. together with a measured spectral type forthe star, this unique solution for orbital parameters provides a powerfulmethod for ruling out most contaminants to transiting planet candidates. forthe explore project, radial velocity follow-up observations for companion massdetermination of the best candidates are done on 8-m-class telescopes withintwo or three months of the photometric campaigns. this same-season follow-up ismade possible by the use of efficient pipelines to produce high quality lightcurves within weeks of the observations. we conclude by presenting earlyresults from our first search, explore i, in which we reached &lt;1% rmsphotometric precision (measured over a full night) on ~37,000 stars to i &lt;=18.2.

astro-ph;0409653	searching for planetary transits in galactic open clusters: explore/oc	open clusters potentially provide an ideal environment for the search fortransiting extrasolar planets since they feature a relatively large number ofstars of the same known age and metallicity at the same distance. with thismotivation, over a dozen open clusters are now being monitored by fourdifferent groups. we review the motivations and challenges for open clustertransit surveys for short-period giant planets. our photometric monitoringsurvey (explore/oc) of galactic southern open clusters was designed with thegoals of maximizing the chance of finding and characterizing planets, and ofproviding for a statistically valuable astrophysical result in the case of nodetections. we use the explore/oc data from two open clusters ngc 2660 and ngc6208 to illustrate some of the largely unrecognized issues facing open clustersurveys including severe contamination by galactic field stars ($&gt;$ 80%) andrelatively low number of cluster members for which high precision photometrycan be obtained. we discuss how a careful selection of open cluster targetsunder a wide range of criteria such as cluster richness, observability,distance, and age can meet the challenges, maximizing chances to detect planettransits. in addition, we present the explore/oc observing strategy to optimizeplanet detection which includes high-cadence observing and continuouslyobserving individual clusters rather than alternating between targets.

astro-ph;0505107	the afterglows, redshifts, and properties of swift gamma-ray bursts	we present optical, near-ir, and radio follow up of sixteen swift bursts,including our discovery of nine afterglows and a redshift determination forthree. these observations, supplemented by data from the literature, provide anafterglow recovery rate of 60% in the optical/near-ir, much higher than inprevious missions (bepposax, hete-2, integral, and ipn). the optical/near-irafterglows of swift events are on average 1.7 mag fainter at t=12 hr than thoseof previous missions. the x-ray afterglows are similarly fainter compared tothose of pre-swift bursts. in the radio the limiting factor is the vlathreshold and the detection rate for swift bursts is similar to that for pastmissions. the redshift distribution of pre-swift bursts peaked at z~1, whereasthe five swift bursts with measured redshifts are distributed evenly between1.3 and 3.2. from these results we conclude that (i) the pre-swiftdistributions were biased in favor of bright events and low redshift events,(ii) the higher sensitivity and accurate positions of swift result in a betterrepresentation of the true burst redshift and brightness distributions (whichare higher and dimmer, respectively), and (iii) as many as 1/3 of the burstscan be optically dark, as a result of a high redshift and/or dust extinction.we remark that the apparent lack of low redshift, low luminosity swift bursts,and the lower event rate compared to pre-launch estimates (90 vs. 150 peryear), are the result of a threshold that is similar to that of batse. in viewof these inferences, afterglow observers may find it advisable to makesignificant changes in follow up strategies of swift events.

astro-ph;0505480	closing in on a short-hard burst progenitor: constraints from early-time  optical imaging and spectroscopy of a possible host galaxy of grb 050509b	the localization of the short-duration, hard-spectrum grb 050509b was awatershed event. thanks to the nearly immediate relay of the grb position byswift, we began imaging the grb field 8 minutes after the burst and continuedfor the following 8 days. no convincing optical/infrared candidate afterglow orsupernova was found for the object. we present a re-analysis of the xrtafterglow and find an absolute position that is ~4" to the west of the xrtposition reported previously. close to this position is a bright ellipticalgalaxy with redshift z=0.2248, about 1' from the center of a rich cluster ofgalaxies. based on positional coincidences, the grb and the bright ellipticalare likely to be physically related. we thus have discovered evidence that atleast some short-duration, hard-spectra grbs arise at cosmological distances.however, while grb 050509b was underluminous compared to long-duration grbs, wedemonstrate that the ratio of the blast-wave energy to the gamma-ray energy isconsistent with that of long-duration grbs. based on this analysis, on thelocation of the grb (40 +- 13 kpc from a bright galaxy), on the galaxy type(elliptical), and the lack of a coincident supernova, we suggest that there isnow observational consistency with the hypothesis that short-hard bursts ariseduring the merger of a compact binary. we limit the properties of ali-paczynski ''mini-supernova.'' other progenitor models are still viable, andadditional rapidly localized bursts from the swift mission will undoubtedlyhelp to further clarify the progenitor picture.

astro-ph;0603689	hst and spitzer observations of the host galaxy of grb 050904: a  metal-enriched, dusty starburst at z=6.295	we present deep hubble space telescope and spitzer space telescopeobservations of the host galaxy of grb 050904 at z=6.295. the host is detectedin the h-band and marginally at 3.6 micron. from these detections, and limitsin the z'-band and 4.5 micron, we infer an extinction-corrected absolutemagnitude, m(uv)=-20.7 mag, or ~l*, a substantial star formation rate of 15solar masses per year, and a stellar mass of a few 10^9 solar masses. acomparison to the published sample of spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies atz&gt;5.5 reveals that the host of grb 050904 would evade detection and/orconfirmation in any of the current surveys due to the lack of detectablely-alpha emission, which is likely the result of dust extinction (a[1200]~1.5mag). this suggests that not all luminous starburst galaxies at z~6 arecurrently being accounted for. most importantly, using the metallicity ofz~0.05 solar inferred from the afterglow absorption spectrum, our observationsindicate for the first time that the observed evolution in the mass- andluminosity-metallicity relations from z=0 to z~2 continues on to z&gt;6. the easeof measuring redshifts and metallicities from the afterglow emission suggeststhat in tandem with the next generation ground- and space-based telescopes, agrb mission with dedicated near-ir follow-up can provide unique information onthe evolution of stars and galaxies through the epoch of re-ionization.
