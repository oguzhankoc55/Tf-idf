0902.4712	lyman break galaxies at z~1.8-2.8: galex/nuv imaging of the subaru deep  field	abridged: a photometric sample of ~7100 v&lt;25.3 lyman break galaxies (lbgs)has been selected by combining subaru/suprime-cam bvrci'z' data with deepgalex/nuv imaging of the subaru deep field. follow-up spectroscopy confirmed 24lbgs at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.7. among the optical spectra, 12 have ly-alpha emission withrest-frame equivalent widths of ~5-60aa. the success rate for identifying lbgsas nuv-dropouts at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.7 is 86%. the rest-frame uv (1700aa) luminosityfunction (lf) is constructed from the photometric sample with corrections forstellar contamination and z&lt;1.5 interlopers. the lf is 1.7+/-0.1 times higherthan those of z~2 bxs and z~3 lbgs. three explanations were considered, and itis argued that significantly underestimating low-z contamination or effectivecomoving volume is unlikely: the former would be inconsistent with thespectroscopic sample at 93% confidence, and the second explanation would notresolve the discrepancy. the third scenario is that different photometricselection of the samples yields non-identical galaxy populations, such thatsome bx galaxies are lbgs and vice versa. this argument is supported by ahigher surface density of lbgs at all magnitudes while the redshiftdistribution of the two populations is nearly identical. this study, whencombined with other star-formation rate (sfr) density uv measurements from lbgsurveys, indicates that there is a rise in the sfr density: a factor of 3-6(3-10) increase from z~5 (z~6) to z~2, followed by a decrease to z~0. thisresult, along with past sub-mm studies that find a peak at z~2 in theirredshift distribution, suggest that z~2 is the epoch of peak star-formation.additional spectroscopy is required to characterize the complete shape of thez~2 lbg uv lf via measurements of contamination and accurate distances.

0908.0003	the lick agn monitoring project: broad-line region radii and black hole  masses from reverberation mapping of hbeta	we have recently completed a 64-night spectroscopic monitoring campaign atthe lick observatory 3-m shane telescope with the aim of measuring the massesof the black holes in 12 nearby (z &lt; 0.05) seyfert 1 galaxies with expectedmasses in the range ~10^6-10^7 m_sun and also the well-studied nearby activegalactic nucleus (agn) ngc 5548. nine of the objects in the sample (includingngc 5548) showed optical variability of sufficient strength during themonitoring campaign to allow for a time lag to be measured between thecontinuum fluctuations and the response to these fluctuations in the broadhbeta emission. we present here the light curves for the objects in this sampleand the subsequent hbeta time lags for the nine objects where thesemeasurements were possible. the hbeta lag time is directly related to the sizeof the broad-line region, and by combining the lag time with the measured widthof the hbeta emission line in the variable part of the spectrum, we determinethe virial mass of the central supermassive black hole in these nine agns. theabsolute calibration of the black hole masses is based on the normalizationderived by onken et al. we also examine the time lag response as a function ofvelocity across the hbeta line profile for six of the agns. the analysis offour leads to ambiguous results with relatively flat time lags as a function ofvelocity. however, sbs 1116+583a exhibits a symmetric time lag response aroundthe line center reminiscent of simple models for circularly orbiting broad-lineregion (blr) clouds, and arp 151 shows an asymmetric profile that is mosteasily explained by a simple gravitational infall model. further investigationwill be necessary to fully understand the constraints placed on physical modelsof the blr by the velocity-resolved response in these objects.

0911.4107	cosmic evolution of black holes and spheroids. iv. the bh mass -  spheroid luminosity relation	from high-resolution images of 23 seyfert-1 galaxies at z=0.36 and z=0.57obtained with the near infrared camera and multi-object spectrometer on boardthe hubble space telescope (hst), we determine host-galaxy morphology, nuclearluminosity, total host-galaxy luminosity and spheroid luminosity. keckspectroscopy is used to estimate black hole mass (m_bh). we study the cosmicevolution of the m_bh-spheroid luminosity (l_sph) relation. in combination withour previous work, totaling 40 seyfert-1 galaxies, the covered range in bh massis substantially increased, allowing us to determine for the first timeintrinsic scatter and correct evolutionary trends for selection effects. were-analyze archival hst images of 19 local reverberation-mapped active galaxiesto match the procedure adopted at intermediate redshift. correcting spheroidluminosity for passive luminosity evolution and taking into account selectioneffects, we determine that at fixed present-day v-band spheroid luminosity,m_bh/l_sph \propto (1+z)^(2.8+/-1.2). when including a sample of 44 quasars outto z=4.5 taken from the literature, with luminosity and bh mass corrected to aself-consistent calibration, we extend the bh mass range to over two orders ofmagnitude, resulting in m_bh/l_sph \propto (1+z)^(1.4+/-0.2). the intrinsicscatter of the relation, assumed constant with redshift, is 0.3+/-0.1 dex (&lt;0.6dex at 95% cl). the evolutionary trend suggests that bh growth precedesspheroid assembly. interestingly, the m_bh-total host-galaxy luminosityrelation is apparently non-evolving. it hints at either a more fundamentalrelation or that the spheroid grows by a redistribution of stars. however, thehigh-z sample does not follow this relation, indicating that major mergers mayplay the dominant role in growing spheroids above z~1.

1004.0252	the lick agn monitoring project: the mbh - sigma relation for  reverberation-mapped active galaxies	(abridged) to investigate the black hole mass (mbh) vs. stellar velocitydispersion relation of active galaxies, we measured the velocity dispersions ofa sample of local seyfert 1 galaxies, for which we have recently determined mbhusing reverberation mapping. for most objects, velocity dispersions weremeasured from high s/n ratio optical spectra centered on the ca ii tripletregion (~8500 a), obtained at the keck, palomar, and lick observatories. fortwo objects, in which the ca ii triplet region was contaminated by nuclearemission, the measurement was based on high-quality h-band spectra obtainedwith the osiris at the keck-ii telescope. combining our new measurements withdata from the literature, we assemble a sample of 24 active galaxies withstellar velocity dispersions and reverberation-based mbh measurements in therange of black hole mass 10^6&lt;mbh/m_sun&lt;10^9. we use this sample to obtainreverberation mapping constraints on the slope and intrinsic scatter of them-sigma relation of active galaxies. assuming a constant virial coefficient ffor the reverberation mapping black hole masses, we find a slope b=3.55+-0.60and the intrinsic scatter sigma_int=0.43+-0.08 dex in the relation log(mbh/m_sun) = a + b log (sigma/200 km/s), which are consistent with those foundfor quiescent galaxies. we derive an updated value of the virial coefficient fby finding the value which places the reverberation masses in best agreementwith the m-sigma relation of quiescent galaxies; using the quiescent m-sigmarelation determined by gultekin et al. we find log f=0.72^{+0.09-0.10} with anintrinsic scatter of 0.44+-0.07 dex. the uncertainty of the virial coefficientremains one of the main sources of the uncertainty in black hole massdeterminations using reverberation mapping, and therefore also in single-epochspectroscopic estimates of mbh in active galaxies.

1007.0781	the lick agn monitoring project: velocity-delay maps from the  maximum-entropy method for arp 151	we present velocity-delay maps for optical h i, he i, and he ii recombinationlines in arp 151, recovered by fitting a reverberation model tospectrophotometric monitoring data using the maximum-entropy method. h iresponse is detected over the range 0-15 days, with the response confinedwithin the virial envelope. the balmer-line maps have similar morphologies butexhibit radial stratification, with progressively longer delays for hgamma tohbeta to halpha. the he i and he ii response is confined within 1-2 days. thereis a deficit of prompt response in the balmer-line cores but strong promptresponse in the red wings. comparison with simple models identifies two classesthat reproduce these features: freefalling gas, and a half-illuminated diskwith a hotspot at small radius on the receding lune. symmetrically illuminatedmodels with gas orbiting in an inclined disk or an isotropic distribution ofrandomly inclined circular orbits can reproduce the virial structure but notthe observed asymmetry. radial outflows are also largely ruled out by theobserved asymmetry. a warped-disk geometry provides a physically plausiblemechanism for the asymmetric illumination and hotspot features. simpleestimates show that a disk in the broad-line region of arp 151 could beunstable to warping induced by radiation pressure. our results demonstrate thepotential power of detailed modeling combined with monitoring campaigns athigher cadence to characterize the gas kinematics and physical processes thatgive rise to the broad emission lines in active galactic nuclei.

1008.4837	spitzer space telescope constraint on the stellar mass of a z = 6.96  lyman alpha emitter	we obtained mid-infrared 3.6 and 4.5 micron imaging of a z=6.96 lyman alphaemitter (lae) iok-1 discovered in the subaru deep field, using spitzer spacetelescope infrared array camera observations. after removal of a nearby brightsource, we find that iok-1 is not significantly detected in any of theseinfrared bands to m_3.6 ~ 24.00 and m_4.5 ~ 23.54 at 3 sigma. fittingpopulation synthesis models to the spectral energy distribution consisting ofthe upper limit fluxes of the optical to infrared non-detection images andfluxes in detection images, we constrain the stellar mass m* of iok-1. this laecould have either a mass as low as m* &lt;~ 2-9 x 10^8 msun for the young age (&lt;~10 myr) and the low dust reddening (a_v ~ 0) or a mass as large as m* &lt;~ 1-4 x10^{10} msun for either the old age (&gt; 100 myr) or the high dust reddening (a_v~ 1.5). this would be within the range of masses of z ~ 3-6.6 laes studied todate, ~ 10^6-10^{10} msun. hence, iok-1 is not a particularly unique galaxywith extremely high mass or low mass but is similar to one of the laes seen atthe later epochs.

1009.0532	the lick agn monitoring project: alternate routes to a broad-line region  radius	it is now possible to estimate black hole masses across cosmic time, usingbroad emission lines in active galaxies. this technique informs our views ofhow galaxies and their central black holes coevolve. unfortunately, there aremany outstanding uncertainties associated with these "virial" mass estimates.one of these comes from using the accretion luminosity to infer a size for thebroad-line region. incorporating the new sample of low-luminosity activegalaxies from our recent monitoring campaign at lick observatory, werecalibrate the radius-luminosity relation with tracers of the accretionluminosity other than the optical continuum. we find that the radius of thebroad-line region scales as the square root of the x-ray and hbetaluminosities, in agreement with recent optical studies. on the other hand, thescaling appears to be marginally steeper with narrow-line luminosities. this isconsistent with a previously observed decrease in the ratio of narrow-line tox-ray luminosity with increasing total luminosity. the radius of the broad-lineregion correlates most tightly with hbeta luminosity, while the x-ray andnarrow-line relations both have comparable scatter of a factor of two. thesecorrelations provide useful alternative virial bh masses in objects with nodetectable optical/uv continuum emission, such as high-redshift galaxies withbroad emission lines, radio-loud objects, or local active galaxies withgalaxy-dominated continua.

1102.1975	the relation between black hole mass and host spheroid stellar mass out  to z~2	we combine hubble space telescope images from the great observatories originsdeep survey with archival very large telescope and keck spectra of a sample of11 x-ray selected broad-line active galactic nuclei in the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;2to study the black hole mass - stellar mass relation out to a lookback time of10 gyrs. stellar masses of the spheroidal component are derived frommulti-filter surface photometry. black hole masses are estimated from the widthof the broad mgii emission line and the 3000a nuclear luminosity. comparingwith a uniformly measured local sample and taking into account selectioneffects, we find evolution in the form m_bh/m_spheroid ~ (1+z)^(1.96+/-0.55),in agreement with our earlier studies based on spheroid luminosity. however,this result is more accurate because it does not require a correction forluminosity evolution and therefore avoids the related and dominant systematicuncertainty. we also measure total stellar masses. combining our sample withdata from the literature, we find m_bh/m_host ~ (1+z)^(1.15+/-0.15), consistentwith the hypothesis that black holes (in the range m_bh ~ 10^8-9 m_sun) predatethe formation of their host galaxies. roughly one third of our objects residein spiral galaxies; none of the host galaxies reveal signs of interaction ormajor merger activity. combined with the slower evolution in host stellarmasses compared to spheroid stellar masses, our results indicate that secularevolution or minor mergers play a non-negligible role in growing both bhs andspheroids.

1104.2330	completing the census of ly-alpha emitters at the reionization epoch	we carried out extended spectroscopic confirmations of ly-alpha emitters(laes) at z=6.5 and 5.7 in the subaru deep field. now, the total number ofspectroscopically confirmed laes is 45 and 54 at z=6.5 and 5.7, respectively,and at least 81% (70%) of our photometric candidates at z=6.5 (5.7) have beenspectroscopically identified as real laes. we made careful measurements of thely-alpha luminosity, both photometrically and spectroscopically, to accuratelydetermine the ly-alpha and rest-uv luminosity functions (lfs). thesubstantially improved evaluation of the ly-alpha lf at z=6.5 shows an apparentdeficit from z=5.7 at least at the bright end, and a possible decline even atthe faint end, though small uncertainties remain. the rest-uv lfs at z=6.5 and5.7 are in good agreement, at least at the bright end, in clear contrast to thedifferences seen in the ly-alpha lf. these results imply an increase in theneutral fraction of the intergalactic medium from z=5.7 to 6.5. the rest-frameequivalent width (ew_0) distribution at z=6.5 seems to be systematicallysmaller than z=5.7, and it shows an extended tail toward larger ew_0. thebright end of the rest-uv lf can be reproduced from the observed ly-alpha lfand a reasonable ew_0-uv luminosity relation. integrating this rest-uv lfprovides the first measurement of the contribution of laes to the photon budgetrequired for reionization. the derived uv lf suggests that the fractionalcontribution of laes to the photon budget among lyman break galaxiessignificantly increases towards faint magnitudes. low-luminosity laes coulddominate the ionizing photon budget, though this inference depends strongly onthe uncertain faint-end slope of the ly-alpha lf.

1104.4794	the mass of the black hole in arp 151 from bayesian modeling of  reverberation mapping data	supermassive black holes are believed to be ubiquitous at the centers ofgalaxies. measuring their masses is extremely challenging yet essential forunderstanding their role in the formation and evolution of cosmic structure. wepresent a direct measurement of the mass of a black hole in an active galacticnucleus (arp 151) based on the motion of the gas responsible for the broademission lines. by analyzing and modeling spectroscopic and photometric timeseries, we find that the gas is well described by a disk or torus with anaverage radius of 3.99 +- 1.25 light days and an opening angle of 68.9 (+21.4,-17.2) degrees, viewed at an inclination angle of 67.8 +- 7.8 degrees (that is,closer to face-on than edge-on). the black hole mass is inferred to be 10^(6.51+- 0.28) solar masses. the method is fully general and can be used to determinethe masses of black holes at arbitrary distances, enabling studies of theirevolution over cosmic time.

0710.1839	comparing and calibrating black hole mass estimators for distant active  galactic nuclei	black hole mass is a fundamental property of active galactic nuclei (agns).in the distant universe, black hole mass is commonly estimated using the mgii,hbeta, or halpha emission line widths and the optical/uv continuum or lineluminosities, as proxies for the characteristic velocity and size of thebroad-line region. although they all have a common calibration in the localuniverse, a number of different recipes are currently used in the literature.it is important to verify the relative accuracy and consistency of the recipes,as systematic changes could mimic evolutionary trends when comparing varioussamples. at z=0.36, all three lines can be observed at optical wavelengths,providing a unique opportunity to compare different empirical recipes. we usespectra from the keck telescope and the sloan digital sky survey to compareblack hole mass estimators for a sample of nineteen agns at this redshift. wecompare popular recipes available from the literature, finding that massestimates can differ up to 0.38+-0.05 dex in the mean (or 0.13+-0.05 dex, ifthe same virial coefficient is adopted). finally, we provide a set of 30internally self consistent recipes for determining black hole mass from avariety of observables. the intrinsic scatter between cross-calibrated recipesis in the range 0.1-0.3 dex. this should be considered as a lower limit to theuncertainty of the black hole mass estimators.

1202.0278	dust attenuation and h-alpha star formation rates of z~0.5 galaxies	using deep narrow-band and broad-band imaging, we identify 401 z~0.40 and 249z~0.49 h-alpha line-emitting galaxies in the subaru deep field. compared toother h-alpha surveys at similar redshifts, our samples are unique since theyprobe lower h-alpha luminosities, are augmented with multi-wavelength(rest-frame 1000aa--1.5 microns) coverage, and a large fraction (20%) of oursamples has already been spectroscopically confirmed. our spectra allow us tomeasure the balmer decrement for nearly 60 galaxies with h-beta detected above5-sigma. the balmer decrements indicate an average extinction ofa(h-alpha)=0.7^{+1.4}_{-0.7} mag. we find that the balmer decrementsystematically increases with higher h-alpha luminosities and with largerstellar masses, in agreement with previous studies with sparser samples. wefind that the sfrs estimated from modeling the spectral energy distribution(sed) is reliable---we derived an "intrinsic" h-alpha luminosity which is thenreddened assuming the color excess from sed modeling. the sed-predicted h-alphaluminosity agrees with h-alpha narrow-band measurements over 3 dex (rms of 0.25dex). we then use the sed sfrs to test different statistically-based dustcorrections for h-alpha and find that adopting one magnitude of extinction isinappropriate: galaxies with lower luminosities are less reddened. we find thatthe luminosity-dependent dust correction of hopkins et al. yields consistentresults over 3 dex (rms of 0.3 dex). our comparisons are only possible byassuming that stellar reddening is roughly half of nebular reddening. thestrong correspondence argue that with sed modeling, we can derive reliableintrinsic sfrs even in the absence of h-alpha measurements at z~0.5.

1203.1326	discovery of a protocluster at z~6	we report the discovery of a protocluster at z~6 containing at least eightcluster member galaxies with spectroscopic confirmations in the wide-fieldimage of the subaru deep field (sdf). the overdensity of the protocluster issignificant at the 6 sigma level, based on the surface number density ofi'-dropout galaxies. the overdense region covers ~36 sq. arcmin, and includes30 i'-dropout galaxies. follow-up spectroscopy revealed that 15 of these arereal z~6 galaxies (5.7 &lt; z &lt; 6.3). eight of the 15 are clustering in a narrowredshift range centered at z=6.01, corresponding to a seven-fold increase innumber density over the average in redshift space. we found no significantdifference in the observed properties, such as ly-alpha luminosities and uvcontinuum magnitudes, between the eight protocluster members and the sevennon-members. the velocity dispersion of the eight protocluster members is 647km/s, which is about three times higher than that predicted by the standardcold dark matter model. this discrepancy could be attributed to thedistinguishing three-dimensional distribution of the eight protoclustermembers. we discuss two possible explanations for this discrepancy: either theprotocluster is already mature, with old galaxies at the center, or it is stillimmature and composed of three subgroups merging to become a larger cluster. ineither case, this concentration of z=6.01 galaxies in the sdf may be one of thefirst sites of formation of a galaxy cluster in the universe.

1203.1942	reliable identifications of agn from the wise, 2mass and rosat all-sky  surveys	we have developed the "s_ix" statistic to identify bright, highly-likelyactive galactic nucleus (agn) candidates solely on the basis of wise, 2mass androsat all-sky survey data. this statistic was optimized with data from thepreliminary wise survey and the sdss, and tested with lick 3-m kastspectroscopy. we find that sources with s_ix &lt; 0 have a &lt;~95% likelihood ofbeing an agn (defined in this paper as a seyfert 1, quasar or blazar). thisstatistic was then applied to the full wise/2mass/rass dataset, including thefinal wise data release, to yield the "w2r" sample of 4,316 sources with s_ix &lt;0. only 2,209 of these sources are currently in the veron-cetty and veron (vcv)catalog of spectroscopically confirmed agn, indicating that the w2r samplecontains nearly 2,000 new, relatively bright (j &lt;~ 16) agn.  we utilize the w2r sample to quantify biases and incompleteness in the vcvcatalog. we find it is highly complete for bright (j &lt; 14), northern agn, butthe completeness drops below 50% for fainter, southern samples and for sourcesnear the galactic plane. this approach also led to the spectroscopicidentification of 10 new agn in the kepler field, more than doubling the numberof agn being monitored by kepler. this has identified ~1 bright agn every 10square degrees, permitting construction of agn samples in any sufficientlylarge region of sky.

1205.3789	the lick agn monitoring project 2011: dynamical modeling of the broad  line region in mrk 50	we present dynamical modeling of the broad line region (blr) in the seyfert 1galaxy mrk 50 using reverberation mapping data taken as part of the lick agnmonitoring project (lamp) 2011. we model the reverberation mapping datadirectly, constraining the geometry and kinematics of the blr, as well asderiving a black hole mass estimate that does not depend on a normalizingfactor or virial coefficient. we find that the geometry of the blr in mrk 50 isa nearly face-on thick disk, with a mean radius of 9.6(+1.2,-0.9) light days, awidth of the blr of 6.9(+1.2,-1.1) light days, and a disk opening angle of25\pm10 degrees above the plane. we also constrain the inclination angle to be9(+7,-5) degrees, close to face-on. finally, the black hole mass of mrk 50 isinferred to be log10(m(bh)/msun) = 7.57(+0.44,-0.27). by comparison to thevirial black hole mass estimate from traditional reverberation mappinganalysis, we find the normalizing constant (virial coefficient) to be log10(f)= 0.78(+0.44,-0.27), consistent with the commonly adopted mean value of 0.74based on aligning the m(bh)-{\sigma}* relation for agn and quiescent galaxies.while our dynamical model includes the possibility of a net inflow or outflowin the blr, we cannot distinguish between these two scenarios.

1206.4303	the stellar population and star formation rates of z~1.5-1.6 [o ii]  emitting galaxies selected from narrow-band emission-line surveys	we present the first detailed study of the stellar populations ofstar-forming galaxies at z~1.5, which are selected by their [o ii] emissionline, detected in narrow-band surveys. we identified ~1,300 [o ii] emitters atz=1.47 and z=1.62 in the subaru deep field with rest-frame ews above 13\aa.optical and near-infrared spectroscopic observations for ~10% of our samplesshow that our separation of [o ii] from [o iii] emission-line galaxies intwo-color space is 99% successful. we analyze the multi-wavelength propertiesof a subset of ~1,200 galaxies with the best photometry. they have averagerest-frame ew of 45\aa, stellar mass of 3 x 10^9 m_sun, and stellar age of 100myr. in addition, our sed fitting and broad-band colors indicate that [o ii]emitters span the full range of galaxy populations at z~1.5. we also find that80% of [o ii] emitters are also photometrically classified as "bx/bm" (uv)galaxies and/or the star-forming "bzk" (near-ir) galaxies. our [o ii] emissionline survey produces a far more complete, and somewhat deeper sample of z~1.5galaxies than either the bx/bm or sbzk selection alone. we constructed averageseds and find that higher [o ii] ew galaxies have somewhat bluer continua. sedmodel-fitting shows that they have on average half the stellar mass of galaxieswith lower [o ii] ew. the observed [o ii] luminosity is well-correlated withthe far-uv continuum with a logarithmic slope slightly 0f 0.89\pm0.22. thescatter of the [o ii] luminosity against the far-uv continuum suggests that [oii] can be used as a sfr indicator with a reliability of 0.23 dex.

1210.4933	a ly-alpha emitter with an extremely large rest-frame equivalent width  of ~900a at z=6.5: a candidate of population iii-dominated galaxy?	we have identified a very interesting ly-alpha emitter, whose ly-alphaemission line has an extremely large observed equivalent width ofew_0=436^{+422}_{-149}a, which corresponds to an extraordinarily largeintrinsic rest-frame equivalent width of ew_0^{int}=872^{+844}_{-298}a afterthe average intergalactic absorption correction. the object wasspectroscopically confirmed to be a real ly-alpha emitter by its apparentasymmetric ly-alpha line profile detected at z=6.538. the continuum emission ofthe object was definitely detected in our deep z'-band image; thus, its ew_0was reliably determined. follow-up deep near-infrared spectroscopy revealedemission lines of neither he ii lambda1640 as an apparent signature ofpopulation iii, nor c iv lambda1549 as a proof of active nucleus. no detectionof short-lived he ii lambda1640 line is not necessarily inconsistent with theinterpretation that the underlying stellar population of the object isdominated by population iii. we found that the observed extremely large ew_0 ofthe ly-alpha emission and the upper limit on the ew_0 of the he ii lambda1640emission can be explained by population synthesis models favoring a very youngage less than 2-4myr and massive metal-poor (z&lt;10^{-5}) or even metal-freestars. the observed large ew_0 of ly-alpha is hardly explained by populationi/ii synthesis models with z&gt;10^{-3}. however, we cannot conclusively rule outthe possibility that this object is composed of a normal stellar populationwith a clumpy dust distribution, which could enhance the ly-alpha ew_0, thoughits significance is still unclear.

1303.1742	the low-luminosity end of the radius-luminosity relationship for active  galactic nuclei	we present an updated and revised analysis of the relationship between thehbeta broad-line region (blr) radius and the luminosity of the active galacticnucleus (agn). specifically, we have carried out two-dimensional surfacebrightness decompositions of the host galaxies of 9 new agns imaged with thehubble space telescope wide field camera 3. the surface brightnessdecompositions allow us to create "agn-free" images of the galaxies, from whichwe measure the starlight contribution to the optical luminosity measuredthrough the ground-based spectroscopic aperture. we also incorporate 20 newreverberation-mapping measurements of the hbeta time lag, which is assumed toyield the average hbeta blr radius. the final sample includes 41 agns coveringfour orders of magnitude in luminosity. the additions and updates incorporatedhere primarily affect the low-luminosity end of the r-l relationship. the bestfit to the relationship using a bayesian analysis finds a slope of alpha =0.533 (+0.035/-0.033), consistent with previous work and with simplephotoionization arguments. only two agns appear to be outliers from therelationship, but both of them have monitoring light curves that raise doubtregarding the accuracy of their reported time lags. the scatter around therelationship is found to be 0.19(+/-0.02) dex, but would be decreased to 0.13dex by the removal of these two suspect measurements. a large fraction of theremaining scatter in the relationship is likely due to the inaccurate distancesto the agn host galaxies. our results help support the possibility that the r-lrelationship could potentially be used to turn the blrs of agns intostandardizable candles. this would allow the cosmological expansion of theuniverse to be probed by a separate population of objects, and over a largerrange of redshifts.

1303.4399	fueling agn-i: how the global characteristics of the central kiloparsec  of seyferts differ from quiescent galaxies	in a matched sample of seyfert and quiescent galaxies we simultaneously probethe stellar and molecular gas kinematics from 1 kpc down to 50 pc with the aimof identifying the dynamical processes dictating black hole accretion rates.this first paper compares the global characteristics of a sample of tengalaxies. we find several differences within a radius of 500 pc that arecorrelated with active galactic nucleus (agn) activity. the seyferts have: (1)a more centrally concentrated nuclear stellar surface brightness with lowerstellar luminosities beyond a radius of 100 pc, (2) a lower stellar velocitydispersion within a radius of 200 pc, (3) elevated h2 luminosity out to aradius of at least 250 pc, and (4) more centrally concentrated h2 surfacebrightness profiles. these observed differences can be interpreted as evidencefor seyfert galaxies having a dynamically cold (in comparison to the bulge)nuclear structure composed of a significant gas reservoir and a relativelyyoung stellar population. this structure is undetected (and possibly does notexist) in quiescent galaxies. the presence of such a nuclear structure inseyfert galaxies provides evidence for inflow of the surrounding interstellarmedium since the nuclear stellar population requires a supply of gas from whichto form. the fueling of a seyfert agn is thus associated with the formation ofa dynamically cold component of gas and stars on scales of hundreds of parsecs.

1304.4643	the lick agn monitoring project 2011: fe ii reverberation from the outer  broad-line region	the prominent broad fe ii emission blends in the spectra of active galacticnuclei have been shown to vary in response to continuum variations, but pastattempts to measure the reverberation lag time of the optical fe ii lines havemet with only limited success. here we report the detection of fe iireverberation in two seyfert 1 galaxies, ngc 4593 and mrk 1511, based on datafrom a program carried out at lick observatory in spring 2011. light curves foremission lines including h-beta and fe ii were measured by applying a fittingroutine to decompose the spectra into several continuum and emission-linecomponents, and we use cross-correlation techniques to determine thereverberation lags of the emission lines relative to v-band light curves. inboth cases the measured lag (t_cen) of fe ii is longer than that of h-beta,although the inferred lags are somewhat sensitive to the choice of fe iitemplate used in the fit. for spectral decompositions done using the fe iitemplate of veron-cetty et al. (2004), we find t_cen(fe ii)/t_cen(h-beta) =1.9+-0.6 in ngc 4593 and 1.5+-0.3 in mrk 1511. the detection of highlycorrelated variations between fe ii and continuum emission demonstrates thatthe fe ii emission in these galaxies originates in photoionized gas, locatedpredominantly in the outer portion of the broad-line region.

1307.7712	"direct" gas-phase metallicities, stellar properties, and local  environments of emission-line galaxies at redshift below 0.90	using deep narrow-band (nb) imaging and optical spectroscopy from the kecktelescope and mmt, we identify a sample of 20 emission-line galaxies (elgs) atz=0.065-0.90 where the weak auroral emission line, [oiii]4363, is detected at&gt;3\sigma. these detections allow us to determine the gas-phase metallicityusing the "direct'' method. with electron temperature measurements and dustattenuation corrections from balmer decrements, we find that 4 of theselow-mass galaxies are extremely metal-poor with 12+log(o/h) &lt;= 7.65 orone-tenth solar. our most metal-deficient galaxy has 12+log(o/h) =7.24^{+0.45}_{-0.30} (95% confidence), similar to some of the lowestmetallicity galaxies identified in the local universe. we find that ourgalaxies are all undergoing significant star formation with average specificstar formation rate (sfr) of (100 myr)^{-1}, and that they have high centralsfr surface densities (average of 0.5 msun/yr/kpc^2. in addition, more thantwo-thirds of our galaxies have between one and four nearby companions within aprojected radius of 100 kpc, which we find is an excess among star-forminggalaxies at z=0.4-0.85. we also find that the gas-phase metallicities for agiven stellar mass and sfr lie systematically below the local m-z-(sfr)relation by \approx0.2 dex (2\sigma\ significance). these results are partlydue to selection effects, since galaxies with strong star formation and lowmetallicity are more likely to yield [oiii]4363 detections. finally, theobserved higher ionization parameter and electron density suggest that they arelower redshift analogs to typical z&gt;1 galaxies.

0802.1743	late-time observations of sn2006gy: still going strong	owing to its extremely high luminosity and long duration, sn2006gy radiatedmore energy in visual light than any other known sn. two hypotheses to explainits high luminosity -- that it was powered by shock interaction with csm asimplied by its type iin spectrum, or that it was fueled by radioactive decayfrom a large mass of 56ni synthesized in a pair-instability sn -- predicteddifferent late-time properties. here we present observations of sn2006gyobtained more than a year after discovery. we were unable to detect it atvisual wavelengths, but clear near-ir k and h-band detections show that it isstill at least as luminous as the peak of a normal sn ii. we also presentspectra giving an upper limit to the late-time ha luminosity of about 1e39erg/s. based on the weak late-time ha, x-ray, and radio emission, combined withthe difficulty of explaining the shift to ir wavelengths, we can rule outongoing csm interaction as the primary late-time power source. instead, wepropose that the evolution of sn2006gy is consistent with one of two possiblescenarios: (1) a pair-instability sn plus modest csm interaction, where theradioactive decay luminosity shifts to the ir because of dust formation. (2) anir echo, where radiation emitted during peak luminosity heats a pre-existingdust shell at radii near 1 light year, requiring the progenitor star to haveejected another 10 msun shell about 1500 yr before the sn.

astro-ph;0202331	the far-infrared energy distributions of seyfert and starburst galaxies  in the local universe: iso photometry of the 12 micron active galaxy sample	new far-infrared photometry with isophot, onboard the infrared spaceobservatory, is presented for 58 galaxies with homogeneous published data foranother 32 galaxies all belonging to the 12 micron galaxy sample. in total 29seyfert 1's, 35 seyfert 2's and 12 starburst galaxies, about half of the 12micron active galaxy sample, plus 14 normal galaxies for comparison. the isoand the iras data are used to define color-color diagrams and spectral energydistributions (sed). thermal dust emission at two temperatures (one cold at15-30k and one warm at 50-70k) can fit the 60-200 micron sed, with a dustemissivity law proportional to the inverse square of the wavelength. seyfert1's and seyfert 2's are indistinguishable longward of 100 micron, while, asalready seen by iras, the former have flatter seds shortward of 60 micron. amild anti-correlation is found between the [200 - 100] color and the "60 micronexcess". we infer that this is due to the fact that galaxies with a strongstarburst component, and thus a strong 60 micron flux, have a steeperfar-infrared turnover. in non-seyfert galaxies, increasing the luminositycorresponds to increasing the star formation rate, that enhances the 25 and 60micron emission. this shifts the peak emission from around 150 micron in themost quiescent spirals to shorter than 60 micron in the strongest starburstgalaxies.

astro-ph;0509564	clustering of lyman break galaxies at z=4 and 5 in the subaru deep  field: luminosity dependence of the correlation function slope	we explored the clustering properties of lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at z=4and 5 with an angular two-point correlation function on the basis of the verydeep and wide subaru deep field data. we found an apparent dependence of thecorrelation function slope on uv luminosity for lbgs at both z=4 and 5. moreluminous lbgs have a steeper correlation function. to compare theseobservational results, we constructed numerical mock lbg catalogs based on asemianalytic model of hierarchical clustering combined with high-resolutionn-body simulation, carefully mimicking the observational selection effects. theluminosity functions for lbgs predicted by this mock catalog were found to bealmost consistent with the observation. moreover, the overall correlationfunctions of lbgs were reproduced reasonably well. the observed dependence ofthe clustering on uv luminosity was not reproduced by the model, unlesssubsamples of distinct halo mass were considered. that is, lbgs belonging tomore massive dark haloes had steeper and larger-amplitude correlationfunctions. with this model, we found that lbg multiplicity in massive darkhalos amplifies the clustering strength at small scales, which steepens theslope of the correlation function. the hierarchical clustering model couldtherefore be reconciled with the observed luminosity-dependence of the angularcorrelation function, if there is a tight correlation between uv luminosity andhalo mass. our finding that the slope of the correlation function depends onluminosity could be an indication that massive dark halos hosted multiplebright lbgs (abridged).

astro-ph;9411100	the jet-disk symbiosis. ii. interpreting the radio/uv correlations in  quasars	we investigate the correlation between the accretion disk (uv) luminosity andthe radio core emission of a quasar sample. in a radio/$l_{\rm disk}$ plot wefind the quasars to be separated into four classes: core dominated quasars(cdq), lobe dominated quasars (ldq), radio-intermediate quasars (riq) and radioweak quasars. in general the radio core emission scales with the diskluminosity, especially in the radio weak quasars. this shows that radio and uvemission have a common energy source and that the difference between radio loudand radio weak is established already on the parsec scale. we investigate thepossibility that radio jets are responsible for the radio core emission inradio loud and radio weak quasars. comparing our data with a simple jetemission model that takes the limits imposed by energy and mass conservation ina coupled jet-disk system into account, we find that radio loud jets carry atotal power $q_{\rm jet}$ that is at least 1/3 of the observed disk luminosity$l_{\rm disk}$. for the electron population one is forced to postulate anefficient process producing a large number of pairs and/or injecting electronswith a distribution with low-energy cut-off around 50 mev -- secondary pairproduction in hadronic cascades could be such a process. the bulk lorentzfactor of the jet is limited to a narrow region ($3\la\gamma_{\rm j}\la10$)).the radio emission of radio weak quasars can be explained with exactly the sameparameters for a powerful relativistic jet if secondary pair production, assuggested for radio loud jets, is inhibited. there is evidence that riq are therelativistically boosted population of radio weak quasar jets. we can estimatethe hidden disk luminosity of fr ii galaxies and find that this is consistentwith frii being misdirected quasars.

astro-ph;9509037	the observational appearance of slim accretion disks	we reexamine the hypothesis that the optical/uv/soft x-ray continuum ofactive galactic nuclei is thermal emission from an accretion disk. previousstudies have shown that fitting the spectra with the standard, optically thickand geometrically thin accretion disk models often led to luminosities whichcontradict the basic assumptions adopted in the standard model. there is noknown reason why the accretion rates in agn should not be larger than the thindisk limit. in fact, more general, slim accretion disk models areself-consistent even for moderately super-eddington luminosities. we calculatehere spectra from a set of thin and slim, optically thick accretion disks. wediscuss the differences between the thin and slim disk models, stressing theimplications of these differences for the interpretation of the observedproperties of agn. we found that the spectra can be fitted not only by modelswith a high mass and a low accretion rate (as in the case of thin disk fitting)but also by models with a low mass and a high accretion rate. in the first casefitting the observed spectra in various redshift categories gives black holemasses around 10^9 solar masses for a wide range of redshifts, and foraccretion rates ranging from 0.4 to 8 solar masses/year. in the second case theaccretion rate is around 10^2 solar masses/year for all agn and the mass rangesfrom 3*10^6 to 10^8 solar masses. unlike the disks with a low accretion rate,the spectra of the high-accretion-rate disks extend into the soft x-rays. acomparison with observations shows that such disks could produce the soft x-rayexcesses claimed in some agns. we show also that the sequence of our modelswith fixed mass and different accretion rates can explain the time evolution ofthe observed spectra in fairall 9.

astro-ph;9810055	review: understanding galaxy formation and evolution with long  wavelength observations	it is well established in the local universe that regions of highstar-formation rate are dusty. as a result of this physical causal link,galaxies of increasing current star formation activity emit a larger proportionof their bolometric luminosity via dust absorption and re-radiation in thethermal mid- to far-infrared. several new observations indicate that this trendcontinues back to earlier cosmic times, when star formation rates were veryhigh, and a large fraction of the resulting uv power was reprocessed by dustinto the infrared. for studying the more luminous, (and therefore more dusty)galaxies, infrared spectroscopy is crucial even at moderate redshifts. for theless dusty galaxies, we are still driven strongly to longer wavelengths astheir redshifts increase from 5 to 10. on the observational side, infraredastronomy is about to start catching up with optical astronomy in sensitivity,spatial resolution and field-of-view. therefore, long-wavelength observationswill play the key role in our understanding of galaxy formation and evolutionin the ``immature universe."

astro-ph;9810171	a narrowband imaging search for [oiii] emission from galaxies at z&gt;3	we present the results of a narrow-band survey of qso fields at redshiftsthat place the [oiii](5007) emission line in the 1% 2.16micron filter. we haveobserved 3 square arcminutes and detected one emission line candidate object inthe field around pc 1109+4642. we discuss the possibilities that this object isa star-forming galaxy at the qso redshift, z_em=3.313 or a seyfert galaxy. inthe former case, we infer a star formation rate of 170 msun/yr for thiskprime=21.3 object. the galaxy has a compact but resolved morphology, with afwhm=0.6arcs, or 4.2kpc at z=3.313 (h_0=50 km/s/mpc and q_0=0.5). the comovingdensity of such objects in qso environments appears to be 0.0033mpc^3,marginally lower (&lt;= 3sigma) than the density observed for halpha-emitters inabsorption-line fields at z~2.5, but similar to the density of lyman breakgalaxies at z~3. if on the other hand, most of the line emission is [oiii] froma seyfert 2 nucleus at z=3.31, then the high inferred volume density couldimply a large evolution in the seyfert 2 luminosity function from the currentepoch. we find the field containing the object to also contain many faintextended objects in the kprime image, but little significant excess over theexpected number-magnitude relation. we discuss the implication of the emissionline being a longer wavelength line at a lower redshift.

astro-ph;9902231	near-infrared observations of the environments of radio quiet qsos at z  &gt;~ 1	we present the results of an infrared survey of qso fields at z=0.95, 0.995and 1.5. each z&lt;1 field was imaged to typical continuum limits of j=20.5,kprime=19 (5 sigma), and line fluxes of 1.3e10{-16}ergs/cm^2/s (1 sigma)in a 1%interference filter. 16 fields were chosen with z~0.95 targets, 14 with z~0.995and 6 with z~1.5. a total area of 0.05 square degrees was surveyed, and twoemission-line objects were found. we present the infrared and opticalphotometry of these objects. optical spectroscopy has confirmed the redshift ofone object (at z=0.989) and is consistent with the other object having asimilar redshift. we discuss the density of such objects across a range ofredshifts from this survey and others in the literature. we also presentnumber-magnitude counts for galaxies in the fields of radio quiet qsos,supporting the interpretation that they exist in lower density environmentsthan their radio loud counterparts. the j-band number counts are among thefirst to be published in the j=16--20.

astro-ph;9904427	the h$\alpha$ luminosity function and global star formation rate from  redshifts of one to two	we present a luminosity function for h$\alpha$ emission from galaxies atredshifts between 0.7 and 1.9 based on slitless spectroscopy with nicmos onhst. the luminosity function is well fit by a schechter function over the range$6 \times 10^{41} &lt; l(h\alpha) &lt; 2 \times 10^{43} erg/sec$ with $l^* = 7 \times10^{42} erg/sec$ and $\phi^* = 1.7 \times 10^{-3} mpc^{-3}$ for $h_0=50 km/smpc^{-1}$ and $q_0=0.5$. we derive a volume averaged star formation rate at $z= 1.3 \pm 0.5$ of 0.13 m_{\odot} yr^{-1} mpc^{-3} without correction forextinction. the sfr that we derive at $\sim 6500 \aa is a factor of 3 higherthan that deduced from 2800 \aa continua. if this difference is due entirely toreddening, the extinction correction at 2800 \aa is quite significant. theprecise magnitude of the total extinction correction at rest-frame uvwavelengths (e.g. 2800 \aa and 1500 \aa) is sensitive to the relative spatialdistribution of the stars, gas and dust, as well as on the extinction law. inthe extreme case of a homogeneous foreground dust screen and a mw or lmcextinction law, we derive a total extinction at 2800 \aa of 2.1 magnitudes, ora factor of 7 correction to the uv luminosity density. if we use the calzettireddening curve, which was derived for the model where stars, gas and dust arewell mixed and nebular gas suffers more extinction than stars, our estimate ofa$_{2800}$ is increased by more than one magnitude.

0809.5100	star formation rates and metallicities of k-selected star forming  galaxies at z~2	we present spectroscopy of 15 star-forming bzk galaxies (sbzks) with k(ab)&lt;23in the subaru deep field, for which halpha and some other emission lines aredetected in 0.9 to 2.3 micron spectra with a resolution of r=500. using halphaluminosities, we obtain star formation rates (sfrs), and then specific sfrs(ssfrs) dividing sfrs by stellar masses, which are derived from sed fitting tobvri'z'k photometry. it is found that sbzks with higher stellar masses havelarger sfrs. a negative correlation is seen between stellar mass and ssfr,which is consistent with the previous results for z~2 galaxies. this impliesthat a larger growth of stellar mass occurs in less massive galaxies. inaddition, gas-phase oxygen abundances, 12+log(o/h), are derived from the ratioof nii(lambda 6584) to halpha using the n2 index method. we have found acorrelation between stellar mass and oxygen abundance in the sense that moremassive sbzks tend to be more metal rich, which is qualitatively consistentwith the relation for uv-selected z~2 galaxies. however, the metallicity of thesbzks is ~0.2 dex higher than that of uv-selected galaxies with similar stellarmasses, which is significant considering the small uncertainties. the sbzks inour sample have redder r-k colors than the uv-selected galaxies. this galaxycolor-dependence in the oxygen abundance may be caused by older or dustiergalaxies having higher metallicities at z~2.

0810.3004	first results from the lick agn monitoring project: the mass of the  black hole in arp 151	we have recently completed a 64-night spectroscopic monitoring campaign atthe lick observatory 3-m shane telescope with the aim of measuring the massesof the black holes in 13 nearby (z &lt; 0.05) seyfert 1 galaxies with expectedmasses in the range ~10^6-10^7 m_sun. we present here the first results fromthis project -- the mass of the central black hole in arp 151. strongvariability throughout the campaign led to an exceptionally clean hbeta lagmeasurement in this object of 4.25(+0.68/-0.66) days in the observed frame.coupled with the width of the hbeta emission line in the variable spectrum, wedetermine a black hole mass of (7.1 +/- 1.2)x10^6 m_sun, assuming the onken etal. normalization for reverberation-based virial masses. we also findvelocity-resolved lag information within the hbeta emission line which clearlyshows infalling gas in the hbeta-emitting region. further detailed analysis maylead to a full model of the geometry and kinematics of broad line region gasaround the central black hole in arp 151.

0706.0519	cosmic evolution of black holes and spheroids. ii: scaling relations at  z=0.36	we combine hubble space telescope images of a sample of 20 seyfert galaxiesat z=0.36 with spectroscopic information from the keck telescope to determinethe black hole mass - spheroid luminosity relation (m-l), the fundamental plane(fp) of the host galaxies and the m-sigma relation. assuming pure luminosityevolution, we find that the host spheroids had smaller luminosity and stellarvelocity dispersion than today for a fixed m. the offsets correspond to deltalog l_b,0=0.40+-0.11+-0.15 (delta log m = 0.51+-0.14+-0.19) and delta log sigma= 0.13+-0.03+-0.05 (delta log m = 0.54+-0.12+-0.21), respectively for the m-land m-sigma relation. a detailed analysis of known systematic errors andselection effects shows that they cannot account for the observed offset. thedata are inconsistent with pure luminosity evolution and the existence ofuniversal and tight scaling relations. to obey the three local scalingrelations by z=0 the distant spheroids have to grow their stellar mass byapproximately 60% (\delta log m_sph=0.20+-0.14) in the next 4 billion years.the measured evolution can be expressed as m/ m_sph ~ (1+z)^{1.5+-1.0}. basedon the disturbed morphologies of a fraction of the sample (6/20) we suggestcollisional mergers with disk-dominated systems as evolutionary mechanism.
