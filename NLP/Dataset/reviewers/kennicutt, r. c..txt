0903.0183	what is driving the hi velocity dispersion?	we explore what dominant physical mechanism sets the kinetic energy containedin neutral, atomic (hi) gas. we compare the hi line widths predicted fromturbulence driven by supernova (sn) explosions and magneto-rotationalinstability (mri) to direct observations in 11 disk galaxies. we usehigh-quality maps of the hi mass surface density and line width, obtained bythe things survey. we show that all sample galaxies exhibit a systematic radialdecline in the hi line width, which appears to be a generic property of hidisks and also implies a radial decline in kinetic energy density of hi. at agalactocentric radius of r25 there is a characteristic value of the hi velocitydispersion of $10\pm2$ \kms. inside this radius, galaxies show hi line widthsabove the thermal value expected from a warm hi component, implying thatturbulence drivers must be responsible for maintaining this line width.therefore, we compare maps of hi kinetic energy to maps of the star formationrate (sfr) and to predictions for energy generated by mri. we find a positivecorrelation between kinetic energy of hi and sfr. for a given turbulencedissipation timescale we can estimate the energy input required to maintain theobserved kinetic energy. the sn rate implied by the observed recent sfr issufficient to maintain the observed velocity dispersion, if the sn feedbackefficiency is at least \epsilon_sn\simeq0.1. beyond r25, this efficiency wouldhave to increase to unrealistic values, $\epsilon&gt;1$, suggesting thatmechanical energy from young stars does not supply most energy in outer disks.on the other hand, both thermal broadening and turbulence driven by mri canproduce the velocity dispersions and kinetic energies that we observe in thisregime.

0905.4742	heracles: the hera co-line extragalactic survey	we present the hera co-line extragalactic survey (heracles), an atlas of coemission from 18 nearby galaxies that are also part of the hi nearby galaxysurvey (things) and the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings). weused the hera multi-pixel receiver on the iram 30-m telescope to map the coj=2-1 line over the full optical disk (defined by the isophotal radius r_25) ofeach target, at 13" angular resolution and 2.6 km/s velocity resolution. herewe describe the observations and reduction of the data and show channel maps,azimuthally averaged profiles, integrated intensity maps, and peak intensitymaps. the implied h2 masses range from 7 \times 10^6 to 6 \times 10^9 m_sun,with four low metallicity dwarf irregular galaxies yielding only upper limits.in the cases where co is detected, the integrated h2-to-hi ratios range from0.02 - 1.13 and h2-to-stellar mass ratios from 0.01 to 0.25. exponential scalelengths of the co emission for our targets are in the range 0.8 - 3.2 kpc, or0.2 \pm 0.05 r_25. the intensity-weighted mean velocity of co matches that ofhi very well, with a 1\sigma scatter of only 6 km/s. the co j=2-1 / j=1-0 lineratio varies over a range similar to that found in the milky way and othernearby galaxies, \sim 0.6 - 1.0, with higher values found in the centers ofgalaxies. the typical line ratio, \sim 0.8, could be produced by opticallythick gas with an excitation temperature of \sim 10 k.

0707.0395	warm molecular hydrogen in the spitzer sings galaxy sample	(simplified) results on the properties of warm h2 in 57 normal galaxies arederived from h2 rotational transitions, obtained as part of sings. this studyextends previous extragalactic surveys of h2, the most abundant constituent ofthe molecular ism, to more common systems (l_fir = e7 to 6e10 l_sun) of allmorphological and nuclear types. the s(1) transition is securely detected inthe nuclear regions of 86% of sings galaxies with stellar masses above 10^9.5m_sun. the derived column densities of warm h2 (t &gt; ~100 k), even thoughaveraged over kiloparsec-scale areas, are commensurate with those of resolvedpdrs; the median of the sample is 3e20 cm-2. they amount to between 1% and &gt;30%of the total h2. the power emitted in the sum of the s(0) to s(2) transitionsis on average 30% of the [siii] line power, and ~4e-4 of the total infraredpower (tir) within the same area for star-forming galaxies, which is consistentwith excitation in pdrs. the fact that h2 emission scales tightly with pahemission, even though the average radiation field intensity varies by a factorten, can also be understood if both tracers originate predominantly in pdrs,either dense or diffuse. a large fraction of the 25 liner/sy targets, however,strongly depart from the rest of the sample, in having warmer h2 in the excitedstates, and an excess of h2 emission with respect to pahs, tir and [siii]. wepropose a threshold in h2 to pah power ratios, allowing the identification oflow-luminosity agns by an excess h2 excitation. a dominant contribution fromshock heating is favored in these objects. finally, we detect, in nearly halfthe star-forming targets, non-equilibrium ortho to para ratios, consistent withfuv pumping combined with incomplete ortho-para thermalization by collisions,or possibly non-equilibrium pdr fronts advancing into cold gas.

0907.4722	the spitzer local volume legacy: survey description and infrared  photometry	the survey description and the near-, mid-, and far-infrared flux propertiesare presented for the 258 galaxies in the local volume legacy (lvl). lvl is aspitzer space telescope legacy program that surveys the local universe out to11 mpc, built upon a foundation of ultraviolet, h-alpha, and hst imaging from11hugs (11 mpc h-alpha and ultraviolet galaxy survey) and angst (acs nearbygalaxy survey treasury). lvl covers an unbiased, representative, andstatistically robust sample of nearby star-forming galaxies, exploiting thehighest extragalactic spatial resolution achievable with spitzer. as a resultof its approximately volume-limited nature, lvl augments previous spitzerobservations of present-day galaxies with improved sampling of thelow-luminosity galaxy population. the collection of lvl galaxies shows a largespread in mid-infrared colors, likely due to the conspicuous deficiency of 8umpah emission from low-metallicity, low-luminosity galaxies. conversely, thefar-infrared emission tightly tracks the total infrared emission, with adispersion in their flux ratio of only 0.1 dex. in terms of the relationbetween infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio and ultraviolet spectral slope, the lvlsample shows redder colors and/or lower infrared-to-ultraviolet ratios thanstarburst galaxies, suggesting that reprocessing by dust is less important inthe lower mass systems that dominate the lvl sample. comparisons withtheoretical models suggest that the amplitude of deviations from the relationfound for starburst galaxies correlates with the age of the stellar populationsthat dominate the ultraviolet/optical luminosities.

0908.1122	on the interstellar medium and star formation demographics of galaxies  in the local universe	we present a demographic analysis of integrated star formation and gasproperties for a sample of galaxies representative of the overall population atz~0. this research was undertaken in order to characterise the nature of starformation and interstellar medium behaviour in the local universe, and test theextent to which global star formation rates can be seen as dependent on theinterstellar gas content. archival 21 cm derived hi data are compiled from theliterature, and are combined with co (j=1-0) derived h_2 masses to calculateand characterise the total gas content for a large sample of local galaxies.the distribution in stellar mass-normalised hi content is found to exhibit thenoted characteristic transition at stellar masses of ~3x10^10 m_sun, turningoff towards low values, but no such transition is observed in the equivalentdistribution of molecular gas. h-alpha based star formation rates and specificstar formation rates are also compiled for a large (1110) sample of localgalaxies. we confirm two transitions as found in previous work: a turnovertowards low sfrs at high luminosities, indicative of the quenching of sfcharacteristic of the red sequence; and a broadening of the sf distribution inlow-luminosity dwarf galaxies, again to extremely low sfrs of &lt; 0.001 m_sun/yr.however, a new finding is that while the upper luminosity transition ismirrored by the turn over in hi content, suggesting that the low sfrs of thered sequence result from a lack of available gas supply, the transition towardsa large spread of sfrs in the least luminous dwarf galaxies is not matched by aprominent increase in scatter in gas content. possible mass-dependent quenchingmechanisms are discussed, along with speculations that in low mass galaxies,the h-alpha luminosity may not faithfully trace the sfr.

0911.1791	outlying hii regions in hi-selected galaxies	we present results from the first systematic search for outlying hii regions,as part of a sample of 96 emission-line point sources (referred to as eldots -emission-line dots) derived from the noao survey for ionization in neutral gasgalaxies (singg). our automated eldot-finder searches singg narrow-band andcontinuum images for high equivalent width point sources outside the opticalradius of the target galaxy (&gt; 2 x r25 in the r-band). follow-up longslitspectroscopy and deep galex images (exposure time &gt; 1000 s) distinguishoutlying hii regions from background galaxies whose strong emission lines([oiii], hbeta or [oii]) have been redshifted into the singg bandpass. we findthat these deep galex images can serve as a substitute for spectroscopicfollow-up because outlying hii regions separate cleanly from backgroundgalaxies in color-color space. we identify seven singg systems with outlyingmassive star formation that span a large range in halpha luminositiescorresponding to a few o stars in the most nearby cases, and unresolved dwarfsatellite companion galaxies in the most distant cases. six of these sevensystems feature galaxies with nearby companions or interacting galaxies.furthermore, our results indicate that some outlying hii regions are linked tothe extended-uv disks discovered by galex, representing emission from the mostmassive o stars among a more abundant population of lower mass (or older) starclusters. the overall frequency of outlying hii regions in this sample ofgas-rich galaxies is 8 - 11% when we correct for background emission-linegalaxy contamination (~75% of eldots).

0911.3006	spatially resolved study of the physical properties of the ionized gas  in ngc 595	we present integral field spectroscopy (ifs) of ngc 595, one of the mostluminous hii regions in m33. this type of observations allows studying thevariation of the principal emission-line ratios across the surface of thenebula. at each position of the field of view, we fit the main emission-linefeatures of the spectrum within the spectral range 3650-6990a, and create mapsof the principal emission-line ratios for the total surface of the region. theextinction map derived from the balmer decrement and the absorbed h-alphaluminosity show good spatial correlation with the 24 micron emission fromspitzer. we also show here the capability of the ifs to study the existence ofwolf-rayet (wr) stars, identifying the previously catalogued wr stars anddetecting a new candidate towards the north of the region. the ionizationstructure of the region nicely follows the h-alpha shell morphology and isclearly related to the location of the central ionizing stars. the electrondensity distribution does not show strong variations within the hii region norany trend with the h-alpha emission distribution. we study the behaviour withinthe hii region of several classical emission-line ratios proposed asmetallicity calibrators: while [nii]/ha and [nii]/[oiii] show importantvariations, the r23 index is substantially constant across the surface of thenebula, despite the strong variation of the ionization parameter as a functionof the radial distance from the ionizing stars. these results show thereliability in using the r23 index to characterize the metallicity of hiiregions even when only a fraction of the total area is covered by theobservations.

0707.4167	gaps in the cloud cover? comparing extinction measures in spiral disks	dust in galaxies can be mapped by either the fir/sub-mm emission, the opticalor infrared reddening of starlight, or the extinction of a known backgroundsource. we compare two dust extinction measurements for a set of fifteensections in thirteen nearby galaxies, to determine the scale of the dusty ismresponsible for disk opacity: one using stellar reddening and the other a knownbackground source. in our earlier papers, we presented extinction measurementsof 29 galaxies, based on calibrated counts of distant background objectsidentified though foreground disks in hst/wfpc2 images. for the 13 galaxiesthat overlap with the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings), we nowcompare these results with those obtained from an i-l color map. our goal is todetermine whether or not a detected distant galaxy indicates a gap in the dustyism, and hence to better understand the nature and geometry of the diskextinction.  we find that distant galaxies are predominantly in low-extinction sectionsmarked by the color maps, indicating that their number depends both on thecloud cover of {\it spitzer}-resolved dust structures --mostly the spiralarms--and a diffuse, unresolved underlying disk. we note that our infraredcolor map (e[i-l]) underestimates the overall dust presence in these disksseverely, because it implicitly assumes the presence of a dust screen in frontof the stellar distribution.

1002.2894	on the fraction of star clusters surviving the embedded phase	in this paper we derive ages and masses for 276 clusters in the merger galaxyngc 3256. this was achieved by taking accurate photometry in four wavebandsfrom archival hst images. photometric measurements are compared to syntheticstellar population (ssp) models to find the most probable age, mass andextinction. the cluster population of ngc 3256 reveals an increase in the starformation rate over the last 100 million years and the initial cluster massfunction (icmf) is best described by a power law relation with slope $\alpha =1.85 \pm 0.12$. using the observed cluster population for ngc 3256 we calculatethe implied mass of clusters younger than 10 million years old, and convertthis to a cluster formation rate over the last 10 million years. comparison ofthis value with the star formation rate (sfr) indicates the fraction of starsfound within bound clusters after the embedded phase of cluster formation,$\gamma$, is $22.9% \pm^{7.3}_{9.8} $ for ngc 3256. we carried out an in-depthanalysis into the errors associated with such calculations showing that errorsintroduced by the ssp fitting must be taken into account and an unconstrainedmetallicity adds to these uncertainties. observational biases should also beconsidered. using published cluster population data sets we calculate $\gamma$for six other galaxies and examine how $\gamma$ varies with environment. weshow that $\gamma$ increases with the star formation rate density and can bedescribed as a power law type relation of the form $\gamma(%) = (29.0\pm{6.0})\sigma_{sfr}^{0.24\pm0.04} (\msol yr^{-1} kpc^{-2})$.

1003.0961	the calibration of monochromatic far-infrared star formation rate  indicators	(abridged) spitzer data at 24, 70, and 160 micron and ground-based h-alphaimages are analyzed for a sample of 189 nearby star-forming and starburstgalaxies to investigate whether reliable star formation rate (sfr) indicatorscan be defined using the monochromatic infrared dust emission centered at 70and 160 micron. we compare recently published recipes for sfr measures usingcombinations of the 24 micron and observed h-alpha luminosities with thoseusing 24 micron luminosity alone. from these comparisons, we derive a referencesfr indicator for use in our analysis. linear correlations between sfr and the70 and 160 micron luminosity are found for l(70)&gt;=1.4x10^{42} erg/s andl(160)&gt;=2x10^{42} erg/s, corresponding to sfr&gt;=0.1-0.3 m_sun/yr. below thosetwo luminosity limits, the relation between sfr and 70 micron (160 micron)luminosity is non-linear and sfr calibrations become problematic. thedispersion of the data around the mean trend increases for increasingwavelength, becoming about 25% (factor ~2) larger at 70 (160) micron than at 24micron. the increasing dispersion is likely an effect of the increasingcontribution to the infrared emission of dust heated by stellar populations notassociated with the current star formation. the non-linear relation between sfrand the 70 and 160 micron emission at faint galaxy luminosities suggests thatthe increasing transparency of the interstellar medium, decreasing effectivedust temperature, and decreasing filling factor of star forming regions acrossthe galaxy become important factors for decreasing luminosity. the sfrcalibrations are provided for galaxies with oxygen abundance 12+log(o/h)&gt;8.1.at lower metallicity the infrared luminosity no longer reliably traces the sfrbecause galaxies are less dusty and more transparent.

1004.1441	an aromatic inventory of the local volume	using infrared photometry from the spitzer space telescope, we perform thefirst inventory of aromatic feature emission (afe, but also commonly referredto as pah emission) for a statistically complete sample of star-forminggalaxies in the local volume. the photometric methodology involved iscalibrated and demonstrated to recover the aromatic fraction of the irac 8micron flux with a standard deviation of 6% for a training set of 40 singsgalaxies (ranging from stellar to dust dominated) with both suitablemid-infrared spitzer irs spectra and equivalent photometry. a potential factorof two improvement could be realized with suitable 5.5 and 10 micronphotometry, such as what may be provided in the future by jwst. the resultingtechnique is then applied to mid-infrared photometry for the 258 galaxies fromthe local volume legacy (lvl) survey, a large sample dominated in number bylow-luminosity dwarf galaxies for which obtaining comparable mid-infraredspectroscopy is not feasible. we find the total lvl luminosity due to fivestrong aromatic features in the 8 micron complex to be 2.47e10 solarluminosities with a mean volume density of 8.8e6 solar luminosities per cubicmegaparsec. twenty-four of the lvl galaxies, corresponding to a luminosity cutat m = -18.22 in the b band, account for 90% of the aromatic luminosity. usingoxygen abundances compiled from the literature for 129 of the 258 lvl galaxies,we find a correlation between metallicity and the aromatic to total infraredemission ratio but not the aromatic to total 8 micron dust emission ratio. apossible explanation is that metallicity plays a role in the abundance ofaromatic molecules relative to the total dust content, but other factors suchas star formation and/or the local radiation field affect the excitation ofthose molecules.

1005.1611	far-infrared line imaging of the starburst ring in ngc 1097 with the  herschel/pacs spectrometer	ngc 1097 is a nearby sbb galaxy with a seyfert nucleus and a bright starburstring. we study the physical properties of the interstellar medium (ism) in thering using spatially resolved far-infrared spectral maps of the circumnuclearstarburst ring of ngc 1097, obtained with the pacs spectrometer on board theherschel space telescope. in particular, we map the important ism cooling anddiagnostic emission lines of [oi] 63 $\mu$m, [oiii] 88 $\mu$m, [nii] 122$\mu$m, [cii] 158 $\mu$m and [nii] 205 $\mu$m. we observe that in the [oi] 63$\mu$m, [oiii] 88 $\mu$m, and [nii] 122 $\mu$m line maps, the emission isenhanced in clumps along the ne part of the ring. we observe evidence of rapidrotation in the circumnuclear ring, with a rotation velocity of ~220$ kms$^{-1}$ (inclination uncorrected) measured in all lines. the [oi] 63$\mu$m/[cii] 158 $\mu$m ratio varies smoothly throughout the central region,and is enhanced on the northeastern part of the ring, which may indicate astronger radiation field. this enhancement coincides with peaks in the [oi] 63$\mu$m and [oiii] 88 $\mu$m maps. variations of the [nii] 122 $\mu$m/[nii] 205$\mu$m ratio correspond to a range in the ionized gas density between 150 and400 cm$^{-3}$.

1005.1887	enhanced dust heating in the bulges of early-type spiral galaxies	stellar density and bar strength should affect the temperatures of the cool(t ~ 20-30 k) dust component in the inner regions of galaxies, which impliesthat the ratio of temperatures in the circumnuclear regions to the disk shoulddepend on hubble type. we investigate the differences between cool dusttemperatures in the central 3 kpc and disk of 13 nearby galaxies by fittingmodels to measurements between 70 and 500 microns. we attempt to quantifytemperature trends in nearby disk galaxies, with archival data fromspitzer/mips and new observations with herschel/spire, which were acquiredduring the first phases of the herschel observations for the kingfish (keyinsights in nearby galaxies: a far-infrared survey with herschel) sample. wefit single-temperature modified blackbodies to far-infrared and submillimetermeasurements of the central and disk regions of galaxies to determine thetemperature of the component(s) emitting at those wavelengths. we present theratio of central-region-to-disk-temperatures of the cool dust component of 13nearby galaxies as a function of morphological type. we find a significanttemperature gradient in the cool dust component in all galaxies, with a meancenter-to-disk temperature ratio of 1.15 +/- 0.03. the cool dust temperaturesin the central ~3 kpc of nearby galaxies are 23(+/-3)% hotter for morphologicaltypes earlier than sc, and only 9(+/-3)% hotter for later types. thetemperature ratio is also correlated with bar strength, with only stronglybarred galaxies having a ratio over 1.2. the strong radiation field in the highstellar density of a galactic bulge tends to heat the cool dust component tohigher temperatures, at least in early-type spirals with relatively largebulges, especially when paired with a strong bar.

1005.1959	mapping far-ir emission from the central kiloparsec of ngc 1097	using photometry of ngc 1097 from the herschel pacs (photodetector arraycamera and spectrometer) instrument, we study the resolved properties ofthermal dust continuum emission from a circumnuclear starburst ring with aradius ~ 900 pc. these observations are the first to resolve the structure of acircumnuclear ring at wavelengths that probe the peak (i.e. lambda ~ 100micron) of the dust spectral energy distribution. the ring dominates thefar-infrared (far-ir) emission from the galaxy - the high angular resolution ofpacs allows us to isolate the ring's contribution and we find it is responsiblefor 75, 60 and 55% of the total flux of ngc 1097 at 70, 100 and 160 micron,respectively. we compare the far-ir structure of the ring to what is seen atother wavelengths and identify a sequence of far-ir bright knots thatcorrespond to those seen in radio and mid-ir images. the mid- and far-ir bandratios in the ring vary by less than +/- 20% azimuthally, indicating modestvariation in the radiation field heating the dust on ~ 600 pc scales. weexplore various explanations for the azimuthal uniformity in the far-ir colorsof the ring including a lack of well-defined age gradients in the young stellarcluster population, a dominant contribution to the far-ir emission from dustheated by older (&gt; 10 myr) stars and/or a quick smoothing of local enhancementsin dust temperature due to the short orbital period of the ring. finally, weimprove previous limits on the far-ir flux from the inner ~ 600 pc of ngc 1097by an order of magnitude, providing a better estimate of the total bolometricemission arising from the active galactic nucleus and its associated centralstarburst.

1010.1837	the evolution of stellar structures in dwarf galaxies	we present a study of the variation of spatial structure of stellarpopulations within dwarf galaxies as a function of the population age. we usedeep hubble space telescope/advanced camera for surveys imaging of nearby dwarfgalaxies in order to resolve individual stars and create compositecolour-magnitude diagrams (cmds) for each galaxy. using the obtained cmds, weselect blue helium burning stars (bhebs), which can be unambiguously age-datedby comparing the absolute magnitude of individual stars with stellarisochrones. additionally, we select a very young (&lt;10 myr) population of obstars for a subset of the galaxies based on the tip of the young main-sequence.by selecting stars in different age ranges we can then study how the spatialdistribution of these stars evolves with time. we find, in agreement withprevious studies, that stars are born within galaxies with a high degree ofsubstructure which is made up of a continuous distribution of clusters, groupsand associations from parsec to hundreds of parsec scales. these structuresdisperse on timescales of tens to hundreds of myr, which we quantify using thetwo-point correlation function and the q-parameter developed by cartwright &amp;whitworth (2004). on galactic scales, we can place lower limits on the time ittakes to remove the original structure (i.e., structure survives for at leastthis long), tevo, which varies between ~100~myr (ngc~2366) and ~350 myr(ddo~165). this is similar to what we have found previously for the smc(~80~myr) and the lmc (~175 myr). we do not find any strong correlationsbetween tevo and the luminosity of the host galaxy.

1101.4023	the displaced dusty ism of ngc 3077: tidal stripping in the m 81 triplet	we present the detection of extended (~30 kpc^2) dust emission in the tidal\hi\ arm near ngc 3077 (member of the m\,81 triplet) using spire on boardherschel. dust emission in the tidal arm is typically detected where the \hi\column densities are &gt;10^21 cm^-2. the spire band ratios show that the dust inthe tidal arm is significantly colder (~13 k) than in ngc 3077 itself (~31 k),consistent with the lower radiation field in the tidal arm. the total dust massin the tidal arm is ~1.8 x 10^6 m_sun (assuming beta=2), i.e. substantiallylarger than the dust mass associated with ngc 3077 (~2 x 10^5 m_sun). wheredust is detected, the dust-to-gas ratio is 6+/-3 x 10^-3, consistent within theuncertainties with what is found in ngc 3077 and nearby spiral galaxies withgalactic metallicities. the faint hii regions in the tidal arm can not beresponsible for the detected enriched material and are not the main source ofthe dust heating in the tidal arm. we conclude that the interstellar medium(atomic hi, molecules and dust) in this tidal feature was pre-enriched andstripped off ngc 3077 during its recent interaction (~3 x 10^8 yr ago) with m82 and m 81. this implies that interaction can efficiently remove heavyelements and enriched material (dust, molecular gas) from galaxies. asinteractions were more frequent at large lookback times, it is conceivable thatthey could substantially contribute (along with galactic outflows) to theenrichment of the intergalactic medium.

1101.5764	spiral structure in nearby galaxies i. sample, data analysis, and  overview of results	this paper, the first of two, introduces an observational study of spiralstructure in galaxies chosen from the sings survey. near infrared (nir) andoptical data are used to produce mass surface density maps, and from these themorphology of the disc is examined. the aim of this work is to characterise theprevalence of spiral structure in this sample and, in the cases where a clearspiral pattern is found, include the findings in a comparative study (reportedin paper ii). a two-armed (`grand design') spiral pattern is found inapproximately half the galaxies studied, including all those that aredesignated as grand design in the optical, but also including some, but notall, optically flocculent galaxies. it is found that the level ofnon-axisymmetric structure in the galaxies' mass distributions is only modestlyhigher in those galaxies that are classified as `grand design' compared withthose that are not, implying that non-grand design galaxies possess significantpower in higher order modes. there is no evidence that bars preferentiallytrigger the spirals, but they do appear to stir up non-axisymmetric structurein the disc. in contrast, there is evidence that strong/close tidalinteractions with companion galaxies are associated with strong two-armedspiral structure in the infrared, though there are a number of galaxies withrelatively weak infrared spiral structure that do not possess such companions.

1104.0929	the star formation rate distribution function of the local universe	we present total infrared (ir) and ultraviolet (uv) luminosity functionsderived from large representative samples of galaxies at z ~ 0, selected at irand uv wavelengths from the iras iifscz catalogue, and the galex aisrespectively. we augment these with deep spitzer and galex imaging of galaxiesin the 11 mpc local volume legacy survey (lvl), allowing us to extend theseluminosity functions to lower luminosities (~10^6 l_sun), and providing goodconstraints on the slope of the luminosity function at the extreme faint endfor the first time. using conventional star formation prescriptions, wegenerate from our data the sfr distribution function for the local universe. wefind that it has a schechter form, that the faint-end slope has a constantvalue (to the limits of our data) of {\alpha} = -1.51 \pm 0.08, and the'characteristic' sfr is 9.2 m_sun/yr. we also show the distribution function ofthe sfr volume density; we then use this to calculate a value for the total sfrvolume density at z ~ 0 of 0.025 \pm 0.0016 m_sun/yr/mpc^-3, of which ~ 20% isoccurring in starbursts. decomposing the total star formation by infraredluminosity, it can be seen that 9 \pm 1% is due to lirgs, and 0.7 \pm 0.2% isoccuring in ulirgs. by comparing uv and ir emission for galaxies in our sample,we also calculate the fraction of star formation occurring in dust obscuredenvironments, and examine the distribution of dusty star formation: we find avery shallow slope at the highly extincted end, which may be attributable toline of sight orientation effects as well as conventional internal extinction.

1104.1136	ppak wide-field integral field spectroscopy of ngc 628: ii. emission  line abundance analysis	in this second paper of the series, we present the 2-dimensional (2d)emission line abundance analysis of ngc 628, the largest object within the ppakintegral field spectroscopy (ifs) nearby galaxies survey: pings. we introducethe methodology applied to the 2d ifs data in order to extract and deal withlarge spectral samples, from which a 2d abundance analysis can be laterperformed. we obtain the most complete and reliable abundance gradient of thegalaxy up-to-date, by using the largest number of spectroscopic points sampledin the galaxy, and by comparing the statistical significance of differentstrong-line metallicity indicators. we find features not previously reportedfor this galaxy that imply a multi-modality of the abundance gradientconsistent with a nearly flat-distribution in the innermost regions of thegalaxy, a steep negative gradient along the disc and a shallow gradient ornearly-constant metallicity beyond the optical edge of the galaxy. the n/oratio seems to follow the same radial behaviour. we demonstrate that theobserved dispersion in metallicity shows no systematic dependence with thespatial position, signal-to-noise or ionization conditions, implying that thescatter in abundance for a given radius is reflecting a true spatial physicalvariation of the oxygen content. furthermore, by exploiting the 2d ifs data, wewere able to construct the 2d metallicity structure of the galaxy, detectingregions of metal enhancement, and showing that they vary depending on thechoice of the metallicity estimator. the analysis of axisymmetric variations inthe disc of ngc 628 suggest that the physical conditions and the star formationhistory of different-symmetric regions of the galaxy have evolved in adifferent manner.

1111.4438	kingfish -- key insights on nearby galaxies: a far-infrared survey with  herschel: survey description and image atlas	the kingfish project (key insights on nearby galaxies: a far-infrared surveywith herschel) is an imaging and spectroscopic survey of 61 nearby (d &lt; 30 mpc)galaxies, chosen to cover a wide range of galaxy properties and localinterstellar medium (ism) environments found in the nearby universe. its broadgoals are to characterize the ism of present-day galaxies, the heating andcooling of their gaseous and dust components, and to better understand thephysical processes linking star formation and the ism. kingfish is a directdescendant of the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings), whichproduced complete spitzer imaging and spectroscopic mapping and a comprehensiveset of multi-wavelength ancillary observations for the sample. the herschelimaging consists of complete maps for the galaxies at 70, 100, 160, 250, 350,and 500 microns. the spectal line imaging of the principal atomic ism coolinglines ([oi]63um, [oiii]88um, [nii]122,205um, and [cii]158um) covers thesubregions in the centers and disks that already have been mapped in themid-infrared with spitzer. the kingfish and sings multi-wavelength datasetscombined provide panchromatic mapping of the galaxies sufficient to resolveindividual star-forming regions, and tracing the important heating and coolingchannels of the ism, across a wide range of local extragalactic ismenvironments. this paper summarizes the scientific strategy for kingfish, theproperties of the galaxy sample, the observing strategy, and data processingand products. it also presents a combined spitzer and herschel image atlas forthe kingfish galaxies, covering the wavelength range 3.6 -- 500 microns. allimaging and spectroscopy data products will be released to the herschel usergenerated product archives.

1207.1301	mapping the cold dust temperatures and masses of nearby kingfish  galaxies with herschel	taking advantage of the sensitivity and angular resolution of the herschelspace observatory at far-infrared and submm wavelengths, we aim to characterizethe physical properties of cold dust within nearby galaxies and study therobustness of the parameters we derive using different modified blackbodymodels. for a pilot subsample of the kingfish program, we perform 2 temperaturefits of the spitzer and herschel photometric data (24 to 500um), with a warmand a cold component, globally and in each resolution element.at global scales,we observe ranges of values for beta_c(0.8 to 2.5) and tc(19.1 to 25.1k).wecompute maps of our parameters with beta fixed or free to test the robustnessof the temperature and dust surface density maps we deduce. when the emissivityis fixed, we observe temperature gradients as a function of radius.when theemissivity is fitted as a free parameter, barred galaxies tend to have uniformfitted emissivities.gathering resolved elements in a tc-beta_c diagramunderlines an anti-correlation between the two parameters.it remains difficultto assess whether the dominant effect is the physics of dust grains, noise, ormixing along the line of sight and in the beam. we finally observe in bothcases that the dust column density peaks in central regions of galaxies and barends (coinciding with molecular gas density enhancements usually found in theselocations).we also quantify how the total dust mass varies with our assumptionsabout the emissivity index as well as the influence of the wavelength coverageused in the fits. we show that modified blackbody fits using a shallowemissivity (beta_c &lt; 2.0) lead to significantly lower dust masses compared tothe beta_c &lt; 2.0 case, with dust masses lower by up to 50% if beta_c=1.5 forinstance.the working resolution affects our total dust mass estimates: massesincrease from global fits to spatially-resolved fits.

1207.4186	modeling dust and starlight in galaxies observed by spitzer and  herschel: ngc 628 and ngc 6946	we characterize the dust in ngc628 and ngc6946, two nearby spiral galaxies inthe kingfish sample. with data from 3.6um to 500um, dust models are stronglyconstrained. using the draine &amp; li (2007) dust model, (amorphous silicate andcarbonaceous grains), for each pixel in each galaxy we estimate (1) dust masssurface density, (2) dust mass fraction contributed by polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons (pah)s, (3) distribution of starlight intensities heating thedust, (4) total infrared (ir) luminosity emitted by the dust, and (5) irluminosity originating in regions with high starlight intensity. we obtain mapsfor the dust properties, which trace the spiral structure of the galaxies. thedust models successfully reproduce the observed global and resolved spectralenergy distributions (seds). the overall dust/h mass ratio is estimated to be0.0082+/-0.0017 for ngc628, and 0.0063+/-0.0009 for ngc6946, consistent withwhat is expected for galaxies of near-solar metallicity. our derived dustmasses are larger (by up to a factor 3) than estimates based onsingle-temperature modified blackbody fits. we show that the sed fits aresignificantly improved if the starlight intensity distribution includes a(single intensity) "delta function" component. we find no evidence forsignificant masses of cold dust t&lt;12k. discrepancies between pacs and mipsphotometry in both low and high surface brightness areas result in largeuncertainties when the modeling is done at pacs resolutions, in which casespire, mips70 and mips160 data cannot be used. we recommend against attemptingto model dust at the angular resolution of pacs.

1208.1117	integral field spectroscopy of a sample of nearby galaxies: ii.  properties of the h ii regions	in this work we analyze the spectroscopic properties of a large number of hii regions, \sim2600, located in 38 galaxies. the sample of galaxies has beenassembled from the face-on spirals in the pings survey and a sample describedin m\'armol-queralt\'o (2011, henceforth paper i). all the galaxies wereobserved using integral field spectroscopy with a similar setup, covering theiroptical extension up to \sim2.4 effective radii within a wavelength range from\sim3700 to \sim6900{\aa}. we develop a new automatic procedure to detect h iiregions, based on the contrast of the h{\alpha} intensity maps. once detected,the procedure provides us with the integrated spectra of each individualsegmented region. a well-tested automatic decoupling procedure has been appliedto remove the underlying stellar population, deriving the main proper- ties ofthe strongest emission lines in the considered wavelength range (covering from[o ii] {\lambda}3727 to [s ii] {\lambda}6731). a final catalogue of thespectroscopic properties of these regions has been created for each galaxy. inthe current study we focused on the understanding of the average properties ofthe h ii regions and their radial distributions. we find that the gas-phaseoxygen abundance and the h{\alpha} equivalent width present negative andpositive gradient, respectively. the distribution of slopes is statisticallycompatible with a random gaussian distribution around the mean value, if theradial distances are measured in units of the respective effective radius. nodifference in the slope is found for galaxies of different morphologies:barred/non-barred, grand-design/flocculent. therefore, the effective radius isa universal scale length for gradients in the evolution of galaxies. otherproperties have a larger variance across each object.

1212.1208	the co-to-h2 conversion factor and dust-to-gas ratio on kiloparsec  scales in nearby galaxies	we present kiloparsec (kpc) spatial resolution maps of the co-to-h2conversion factor (alpha_co) and dust-to-gas ratio (dgr) in 26 nearby,star-forming galaxies. we have simultaneously solved for alpha_co and dgr byassuming that the dgr is approximately constant on kpc scales. with thisassumption, we can combine maps of dust mass surface density, co integratedintensity and hi column density to solve for both alpha_co and dgr with noassumptions about their value or dependence on metallicity or other parameters.such a study has just become possible with the availability of high resolutionfar-ir maps from the herschel key program kingfish, 12co j=(2-1) maps from theiram 30m large program heracles and hi 21-cm line maps from things. we use afixed ratio between the (2-1) and (1-0) lines to present our alpha_co resultson the more typically used 12co j=(1-0) scale and show using literaturemeasurements that variations in the line ratio do not effect our results. intotal, we derive 782 individual solutions for alpha_co and dgr. on average,alpha_co = 3.1 msun pc^-2 (k km s^-1)^-1 for our sample with a standarddeviation of 0.3 dex. within galaxies we observe a generally flat profile ofalpha_co as a function of galactocentric radius. however, most galaxies exhibita lower alpha_co in the central kpc---a factor of ~2 below the galaxy mean, onaverage. in some cases, the central alpha_co value can be factors of 5 to 10below the standard milky way (mw) value of alpha_co,mw =4.4 msun pc^-2 (k kms^-1)^-1. while for alpha_co we find only weak correlations with metallicity,dgr is well-correlated with metallicity, with an approximately linear slope.finally, we present several recommendations for choosing an appropriatealpha_co for studies of nearby galaxies.

1302.4363	calibration of the total infrared luminosity of nearby galaxies from  spitzer and herschel bands	we present new empirical calibrations to estimate resolved and integratedtotal infrared luminosities from spitzer and herschel bands used asmonochromatic or combined tracers. we base our calibrations on resolvedelements of nearby galaxies (3 to 30 mpc) observed with herschel. we perform aresolved sed modelling of these objects using the draine and li (2007) dustmodels and investigate the influence of the addition of spire measurements inthe estimation of ltir. we find that using data up to 250 um leads to localltir values consistent with those obtained with a complete coverage (up to 500um) within 10 per cent for most of our resolved elements. we then study thedistribution of energy in the resolved seds of our galaxies. the bulk of energy(30-50 per cent) is contained in the (70-160 um) band. the (24-70 um) fractiondecreases with increasing metallicity. the (160-1100 um) submillimeter band canaccount for up to 25 per cent of the ltir in metal-rich galaxies. weinvestigate the correlation between tir surface brightnesses/luminosities andmonochromatic spitzer and herschel surface brightnesses/luminosities. the threepacs bands can be used as reliable monochromatic estimators of the ltir, the100 um band being the most reliable monochromatic tracer. there is also astrong correlation between the spire 250um and ltir, although with more scatterthan for the pacs relations. we also study the ability of our monochromaticrelations to reproduce integrated ltir of nearby galaxies as well as ltir ofz=1-3 sources. finally, we provide calibration coefficients that can be used toderive tir surface brightnesses/luminosities from a combination of spitzer andherschel surface brightnesses/fluxes and analyse the associated uncertainties.

1305.2923	mapping dust through emission and absorption in nearby galaxies	dust has long been identified as a barrier to measuring inherent galaxyproperties. however, the link between dust and attenuation is notstraightforward and depends on both the amount of dust and its distribution.herschel imaging of nearby galaxies undertaken as part of the kingfish projectallows us to map the dust as seen in emission with unprecedented sensitivityand ~1 kpc resolution. we present here new optical integral field unitspectroscopy for eight of these galaxies that provides complementary 100-200 pcscale maps of the dust attenuation through observation of the reddening in boththe balmer decrement and the stellar continuum. the stellar continuumreddening, which is systematically less than that observed in the balmerdecrement, shows no clear correlation with the dust, suggesting that thedistribution of stellar reddening acts as a poor tracer of the overall dustcontent. the brightest hii regions are observed to be preferentially located industy regions, and we do find a correlation between the balmer line reddeningand the dust mass surface density for which we provide an empirical relation.some of the high-inclination systems in our sample exhibit high extinction, butwe also find evidence that unresolved variations in the dust distribution onscales smaller than 500 pc may contribute to the scatter in this relation. wecaution against the use of integrated a_v measures to infer global dustproperties.

1308.4271	the nature of liner galaxies: ubiquitous hot old stars and rare  accreting black holes	galaxies, which often contain ionised gas, sometimes also exhibit a so-calledlow-ionisation nuclear emission line region (liner). for 30 years this wasattributed to a central mass-accreting supermassive black hole (agn) of lowluminosity, making liner galaxies the largest agn-sub-population, dominating innumbers over higher luminosity seyfert galaxies and quasars. this, however,poses a serious problem. while the inferred energy balance is plausible, manyliners clearly do not contain any other independent signatures of an agn. usingintegral field spectroscopic data from the califa survey, we aim at comparingthe observed radial surface brightness profiles with what is expected fromillumination by an agn. essential for this analysis is a proper extraction ofemission-lines, especially weak lines such as the balmer hb line which issuperposed on an absorption trough. to accomplish this, we use the gandalf codewhich simultaneously fits the underlying stellar continuum and emission lines.we show for 48 galaxies with liner-like emission, that the radial emission-linesurface brightness profiles are inconsistent with ionisation by a centralpoint-source and hence cannot be due to an agn alone. the most probableexplanation for the excess liner-like emission is ionisation by evolved starsduring the short but very hot and energetic phase known as post-agb. this leadsus to an entirely new interpretation. post-agb stars are ubiquitous and theirionising effect should be potentially observable in every galaxy with gaspresent and stars older than ~1 gyr, unless a stronger radiation field fromyoung hot stars or an agn outshines them. this means that galaxies withliner-like emission are in fact not a class defined by a property, but ratherby the absence of a property. it also explains why liner emission is observedmostly in massive galaxies with old stars and little star formation.

1309.0817	towards a removal of temperature dependencies from abundance  determinations	the metal content of a galaxy is a key property for distinguishing betweenviable galaxy evolutionary scenarios, and it strongly influences many of thephysical processes in the interstellar medium. an absolute and robustdetermination of extragalactic metallicities is essential in constrainingmodels of chemical enrichment and chemical evolution, however, current gasphase abundance determinations from optical fine-structure lines are uncertainto 0.8 dex as conversion of these optical line fluxes to abundances is stronglydependent on the electron temperature of the ionized gas. in contrast, thefar-ir emission lines can be used to derive an o++ abundance that is relativelyinsensitive to temperature, while the ratio of the optical to far-ir linesprovides a consistent temperature to be used in the derivation of an o$^+$abundance. we present observations of the [o iii] 88 \micron\ fine-structureline in ngc 628 that were obtained as part of the kingfish program. these dataare combined with optical ifu data to derive oxygen abundances for seven hiiregions. we find the abundance of these regions to all lie between the high andlow values of strong line calibrations and in agreement with estimates thatassume temperature fluctuations are present in the hii regions.

1407.4547	big fish in small ponds: massive stars in the low mass clusters of m83	we have used multi-wavelength hubble space telescope wfc3 data of thestarbursting spiral galaxy m83 in order to measure variations in the upper endof the stellar initial mass function (uimf) using the production rate ofionizing photons in unresolved clusters with ages $\leq$ 8 myr. as in earlierpapers on m51 and ngc 4214, the upper end of the stellar imf in m83 isconsistent with an universal imf, and stochastic sampling of the stellarpopulations in the $\lessapprox$ 10$^{3}$ msun clusters are responsible for anydeviations in this universality. the ensemble cluster population, as well asindividual clusters, also imply that the most massive star in a cluster doesnot depend on the cluster mass. in fact, we have found that these smallclusters seem to have an over-abundance of ionizing photons when compared to anexpected universal or truncated imf. this also suggests that the presence ofmassive stars in these clusters does not affect the star formation in adestructive way.

1409.5916	cool dust heating and temperature mixing in nearby star-forming galaxies	physical conditions of the interstellar medium in galaxies are closely linkedto the ambient radiation field and the heating of dust grains. in order tocharacterize dust properties in galaxies over a wide range of physicalconditions, we present here the radial surface brightness profiles of theentire sample of 61 galaxies from key insights into nearby galaxies:far-infrared survey with herschel (kingfish). the main goal of our work is thecharacterization of the grain emissivities, dust temperatures, and interstellarradiation fields responsible for heating the dust. after fitting the dust andstellar radial profiles with exponential functions, we fit the far-infraredspectral energy distribution (sed) in each annular region withsingle-temperature modified black bodies using both variable (mbbv) and fixed(mbbf) emissivity indices beta, as well as with physically motivated dustmodels. results show that while most sed parameters decrease with radius, theemissivity index beta also decreases with radius in some galaxies, but inothers is increasing, or rising in the inner regions and falling in the outerones. despite the fixed grain emissivity (average beta~ 2.1) of thephysically-motivated models, they are well able to accommodate flat spectralslopes with beta&lt;= 1. we find that flatter slopes (beta&lt;= 1.5) are associatedwith cooler temperatures, contrary to what would be expected from the usualtdust-beta degeneracy. this trend is related to variations in umin since betaand umin are very closely linked over the entire range in umin sampled by thekingfish galaxies: low umin is associated with flat beta&lt;=1. both these resultsstrongly suggest that the low apparent \beta values (flat slopes) in mbbv fitsare caused by temperature mixing along the line-of-sight, rather than byintrinsic variations in grain properties. abstract truncated for arxiv.

1409.7123	[cii] 158 $\mu$m emission as a star formation tracer	the [cii] 157.74 $\mu$m transition is the dominant coolant of the neutralinterstellar gas, and has great potential as a star formation rate (sfr)tracer. using the herschel kingfish sample of 46 nearby galaxies, weinvestigate the relation of [cii] surface brightness and luminosity with sfr.we conclude that [cii] can be used for measurements of sfr on both global andkiloparsec scales in normal star-forming galaxies in the absence of strongactive galactic nuclei (agn). the uncertainty of the $\sigma_{\rm[cii]}-\sigma_{\rm sfr}$ calibration is $\pm$0.21 dex. the main source ofscatter in the correlation is associated with regions that exhibit warm ircolors, and we provide an adjustment based on ir color that reduces thescatter. we show that the color-adjusted $\sigma_{\rm[cii]}-\sigma_{\rm sfr}$correlation is valid over almost 5 orders of magnitude in $\sigma_{\rm sfr}$,holding for both normal star-forming galaxies and non-agn luminous infraredgalaxies. using [cii] luminosity instead of surface brightness to estimate sfrsuffers from worse systematics, frequently underpredicting sfr in luminousinfrared galaxies even after ir color adjustment (although this depends on thesfr measure employed). we suspect that surface brightness relations are betterbehaved than the luminosity relations because the former are more closelyrelated to the local far-uv field strength, most likely the main parametercontrolling the efficiency of the conversion of far-uv radiation into gasheating. a simple model based on starburst99 population-synthesis code toconnect sfr to [cii] finds that heating efficiencies are $1\%-3\%$ in normalgalaxies.

1410.7456	legacy extragalactic uv survey (legus) with the hubble space telescope.  i. survey description	the legacy extragalactic uv survey (legus) is a cycle 21 treasury program onthe hubble space telescope, aimed at the investigation of star formation andits relation with galactic environment in nearby galaxies, from the scales ofindividual stars to those of ~kpc-size clustered structures. five-band imaging,from the near-ultraviolet to the i-band, with the wide field camera 3, plusparallel optical imaging with the advanced camera for surveys, is beingcollected for selected pointings of 50 galaxies within the local 12 mpc. thefilters used for the observations with the wide field camera 3 are: f275w(2,704a), f336w(3,355 a), f438w(4,325 a), f555w(5,308 a), and f814w(8,024 a); theparallel observations with the advanced camera for surveys use the filters:f435w(4,328 a), f606w(5,921 a), and f814w(8,057 a). the multi-band images areyielding accurate recent (&lt;~50 myr) star formation histories from resolvedmassive stars and the extinction-corrected ages and masses of star clusters andassociations. the extensive inventories of massive stars and clustered systemswill be used to investigate the spatial and temporal evolution of starformation within galaxies. this will, in turn, inform theories of galaxyevolution and improve the understanding of the physical underpinning of thegas-star formation relation and the nature of star formation at high redshift.this paper describes the survey, its goals and observational strategy, and theinitial science results. because legus will provide a reference survey and afoundation for future observations with jwst and with alma, a large number ofdata products are planned for delivery to the community.

1411.5792	spiral structure in nearby galaxies ii. comparative analysis and  conclusions	this paper presents a detailed analysis of two-armed spiral structure in asample of galax- ies from the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings),with particular focus on the relationships between the properties of the spiralpattern in the stellar disc and the global struc- ture and environment of theparent galaxies. following paper i we have used a combination of spitzer spacetelescope mid-infrared imaging and visible multi-colour imaging to isolate thespiral pattern in the underlying stellar discs, and we examine the systematicbehaviours of the observed amplitudes and shapes (pitch angles) of thesespirals. in general, spiral morphology is found to correlate only weakly atbest with morphological parameters such as stellar mass, gas fraction,disc/bulge ratio, and vflat. in contrast to weak correlations with galaxystructure a strong link is found between the strength of the spiral arms andtidal forcing from nearby companion galaxies. this appears to support thelongstanding suggestion that either a tidal interaction or strong bar is anecessary condition for driving grand-design spiral structure. the pitch anglesof the stellar arms are only loosely correlated with the pitch angles of thecorresponding arms traced in gas and young stars. we find that the strength ofthe shock in the gas and the contrast in the star formation rate are stronglycorrelated with the stellar spiral amplitude.

1507.03801	star formation in the local universe from the califa sample. i.  calibrating the sfr using ifs data	the star formation rate (sfr) is one of the main parameters used to analyzethe evolution of galaxies through time. the need for recovering the lightreprocessed by dust commonly requires the use of low spatial resolutionfar-infrared data. recombination-line luminosities provide an alternative,although uncertain dust-extinction corrections based on narrow-band imaging orlong-slit spectroscopy have traditionally posed a limit to their applicability.integral field spectroscopy (ifs) is clearly the way to overcome suchlimitation. we obtain integrated h{\alpha}, ultraviolet (uv) and infrared(ir)-based sfr measurements for 272 galaxies from the califa survey at 0.005 &lt;z &lt; 0.03 using single-band and hybrid tracers. we provide updated calibrations,both global and split by properties (including stellar mass and morphologicaltype), referred to h{\alpha}. the extinction-corrected h{\alpha} luminosityagrees with the updated hybrid sfr estimators based on either uv or h{\alpha}plus ir luminosity over the full range of sfrs (0.03-20 m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$).the coefficient that weights the amount of energy produced by newly-born starsthat is reprocessed by dust on the hybrid tracers, a$_{ir}$, shows a largedispersion. however, it does not became increasingly small at highattenuations, as expected if significant highly-obscured h$\alpha$ emissionwould be missed. lenticulars, early-type spirals and type-2 agn host galaxiesshow smaller coefficients due to the contribution of optical photons and agn todust heating. in the local universe the h{\alpha} luminosity derived from ifsobservations can be used to measure sfr, at least in statistically-significant,optically-selected galaxy samples. the analysis of the sfr calibrations bygalaxies properties could be potentially used by other works to study theimpact of different selection criteria in the sfr values derived.

1508.04476	the brightest young star clusters in ngc 5253	the nearby dwarf starburst galaxy ngc5253 hosts a number of young, massivestar clusters, the two youngest of which are centrally concentrated andsurrounded by thermal radio emission (the `radio nebula'). to investigate therole of these clusters in the starburst energetics, we combine new and archivalhubble space telescope images of ngc5253 with wavelength coverage from 1500 angto 1.9 micron in 13 filters. these include h-alpha, p-beta, and p-alpha, andthe imaging from the hubble treasury program legus (legacy extragalactic uvsurvey). the extraordinarily well-sampled spectral energy distributions enablemodeling with unprecedented accuracy the ages, masses, and extinctions of the 9optically brightest clusters (m_v &lt; -8.8) and the two young radio nebulaclusters. the clusters have ages ~1-15 myr and masses ~1x10^4 - 2.5x10^5 m_sun.the clusters' spatial location and ages indicate that star formation has becomemore concentrated towards the radio nebula over the last ~15 myr. the mostmassive cluster is in the radio nebula; with a mass 2.5x10^5 m_sun and an age~1 myr, it is 2-4 times less massive and younger than previously estimated. itis within a dust cloud with a_v~50 mag, and shows a clear nearir excess, likelyfrom hot dust. the second radio nebula cluster is also ~1 myr old, confirmingthe extreme youth of the starburst region. these two clusters account for abouthalf of the ionizing photon rate in the radio nebula, and will eventuallysupply about 2/3 of the mechanical energy in present-day shocks. additionalsources are required to supply the remaining ionizing radiation, and mayinclude very massive stars.

0705.3377	the calibration of mid-infrared star formation rate indicators	with the goal of investigating the degree to which the mid-infrared emissiontraces the star formation rate (sfr), we analyze spitzer 8 um and 24 um data ofstar-forming regions in a sample of 33 nearby galaxies with availablehst/nicmos images in the paschen-alpha (1.8756 um) emission line. the galaxiesare drawn from the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings) sample, andcover a range of morphologies and a factor ~10 in oxygen abundance. publisheddata on local low-metallicity starburst galaxies and luminous infrared galaxiesare also included in the analysis. both the stellar-continuum-subtracted 8 umemission and the 24 um emission correlate with the extinction-correctedpa-alpha line emission, although neither relationship is linear. simple modelsof stellar populations and dust extinction and emission are able to reproducethe observed non-linear trend of the 24 um emission versus number of ionizingphotons, including the modest deficiency of 24 um emission in the lowmetallicity regions, which results from a combination of decreasing dustopacity and dust temperature at low luminosities. conversely, the trend of the8 um emission as a function of the number of ionizing photons is not wellreproduced by the same models. the 8 um emission is contributed, in largermeasure than the 24 um emission, by dust heated by non-ionizing stellarpopulations, in agreement with previous findings. two sfr calibrations, oneusing the 24 um emission and the other using a combination of the 24 um andh-alpha luminosities (kennicutt et al. 2007), are presented. no calibration ispresented for the 8 um emission, because of its significant dependence on bothmetallicity and environment. the calibrations presented here should be directlyapplicable to systems dominated by on-going star formation.

astro-ph;0507645	infrared spectral energy distributions of nearby galaxies	the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings) is carrying out acomprehensive multi-wavelength survey on a sample of 75 nearby galaxies. the1-850um spectral energy distributions are presented using broadband imagingdata from spitzer, 2mass, iso, iras, and scuba. the infrared colors derivedfrom the globally-integrated spitzer data are generally consistent with theprevious generation of models that were developed based on global data fornormal star-forming galaxies, though significant deviations are observed.spitzer's excellent sensitivity and resolution also allow a detailedinvestigation of the infrared spectral energy distributions for variouslocations within the three large, nearby galaxies ngc3031 (m81), ngc5194 (m51),and ngc7331. strong correlations exist between the local star formation rateand the infrared colors f_nu(70um)/f_nu(160um) and f_nu(24um)/f_nu(160um),suggesting that the 24 and 70um emission are useful tracers of the local starformation activity level. preliminary evidence indicates that variations in the24um emission, and not variations in the emission from polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons at 8um, drive the variations in the f_nu(8.0um)/f_nu(24um) colorswithin ngc3031, ngc5194, and ngc7331. if the galaxy-to-galaxy variations inspectral energy distributions seen in our sample are representative of therange present at high redshift then extrapolations of total infraredluminosities and star formation rates from the observed 24um flux will beuncertain at the factor-of-five level (total range). the correspondinguncertainties using the redshifted 8.0um flux (e.g. observed 24um flux for az=2 source) are factors of 10-20. considerable caution should be used wheninterpreting such extrapolated infrared luminosities.

astro-ph;0610688	an ultraviolet-to-radio broadband spectral atlas of nearby galaxies	the ultraviolet-to-radio continuum spectral energy distributions arepresented for all 75 galaxies in the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey(sings). a principal component analysis of the sample shows that most of thesample's spectral variations stem from two underlying components, onerepresentative of a galaxy with a low infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio and onerepresentative of a galaxy with a high infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio. theinfluence of several parameters on the infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio is studied(e.g., optical morphology, disk inclination, far-infrared color, ultravioletspectral slope, and star formation history). consistent with our understandingof normal star-forming galaxies, the sings sample of galaxies in comparison tomore actively star-forming galaxies exhibits a larger dispersion in theinfrared-to-ultraviolet versus ultraviolet spectral slope correlation. earlytype galaxies, exhibiting low star formation rates and high optical surfacebrightnesses, have the most discrepant infrared-to-ultraviolet correlation.these results suggest that the star formation history may be the dominantregulator of the broadband spectral variations between galaxies. finally, a newdiscovery shows that the 24 micron morphology can be a useful tool forparametrizing the global dust temperature and ultraviolet extinction in nearbygalaxies. the dust emission in dwarf/irregular galaxies is clumpy and warmaccompanied by low ultraviolet extinction, while in spiral galaxies there istypically a much larger diffuse component of cooler dust and averageultraviolet extinction. for galaxies with nuclear 24 micron emission, the dusttemperature and ultraviolet extinction are relatively high compared to diskgalaxies.

0810.2391	geometrically derived timescales for star formation in spiral galaxies	we estimate a characteristic timescale for star formation in the spiral armsof disk galaxies, going from atomic hydrogen (hi) to dust-enshrouded massivestars. drawing on high-resolution hi data from the hi nearby galaxy survey and24$\mu$m images from the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey we measure theaverage angular offset between the hi and 24$\mu$m emissivity peaks as afunction of radius, for a sample of 14 nearby disk galaxies. we model theseoffsets assuming an instantaneous kinematic pattern speed, $\omega_p$, and atimescale, t(hi--&gt;24$\mu$m), for the characteristic time span between the dense\hi phase and the formation of massive stars that heat the surrounding dust.fitting for $\omega_p$ and t(hi--&gt;24$\mu$m), we find that the radial dependenceof the observed angular offset (of the \hi and 24$\mu$m emission) is consistentwith this simple prescription; the resulting corotation radii of the spiralpatterns are typically $r_{cor}\simeq 2.7 r_{s}$, consistent with independentestimates. the resulting values of t(hi--&gt;24$\mu$m) for the sample are in therange 1--4 myr. we have explored the possible impact of non-circular gasmotions on the estimate of t(hi--&gt;24$\mu$m) and have found it to besubstantially less than a factor of 2. this implies that a short timescale forthe most intense phase of the ensuing star formation in spiral arms, andimplies a considerable fraction of molecular clouds exist only for a few myrbefore forming stars. however, our analysis does not preclude that somemolecular clouds persist considerably longer. if much of the star formation inspiral arms occurs within this short interval t(hi--&gt;24$\mu$m), then starformation must be inefficient, in order to avoid the short-term depletion ofthe gas reservoir.

0811.4190	the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey: a high-resolution  spectroscopy anthology	high resolution mid-infrared spectra are presented for 155 nuclear andextranuclear regions from the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings).the fluxes for nine atomic forbidden and three molecular hydrogen mid-infraredemission lines are also provided, along with upper limits in key lines forinfrared-faint targets. the sings sample shows a wide range in the ratio of[siii]18.71um/[siii]33.48um, but the average ratio of the ensemble indicates atypical interstellar electron density of 300-400 cm^{-3} on ~23"x15" scales and500-600 cm^{-3} using ~11"x9" apertures, independent of whether the regionprobed is a star-forming nuclear, a star-forming extranuclear, or an agnenvironment. evidence is provided that variations in gas-phase metallicity playan important role in driving variations in radiation field hardness, asindicated by [neiii]15.56um/[neii]12.81um, for regions powered by starformation. conversely, the radiation hardness for galaxy nuclei powered byaccretion around a massive black hole is independent of metal abundance.furthermore, for metal-rich environments agn are distinguishable fromstar-forming regions by significantly larger [neiii]15.56um/[neii]12.81umratios. finally, [feii]25.99um/[neii]12.81um versus [siii]34.82um/[siii]33.48umalso provides an empirical method for discerning agn from normal star-formingsources. however, similar to [neiii]15.56um/[neii]12.81um, these mid-infraredline ratios lose their agn/star-formation diagnostic powers for very lowmetallicity star-forming systems with hard radiation fields.
