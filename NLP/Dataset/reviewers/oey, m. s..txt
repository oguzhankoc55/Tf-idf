0911.1791	outlying hii regions in hi-selected galaxies	we present results from the first systematic search for outlying hii regions,as part of a sample of 96 emission-line point sources (referred to as eldots -emission-line dots) derived from the noao survey for ionization in neutral gasgalaxies (singg). our automated eldot-finder searches singg narrow-band andcontinuum images for high equivalent width point sources outside the opticalradius of the target galaxy (&gt; 2 x r25 in the r-band). follow-up longslitspectroscopy and deep galex images (exposure time &gt; 1000 s) distinguishoutlying hii regions from background galaxies whose strong emission lines([oiii], hbeta or [oii]) have been redshifted into the singg bandpass. we findthat these deep galex images can serve as a substitute for spectroscopicfollow-up because outlying hii regions separate cleanly from backgroundgalaxies in color-color space. we identify seven singg systems with outlyingmassive star formation that span a large range in halpha luminositiescorresponding to a few o stars in the most nearby cases, and unresolved dwarfsatellite companion galaxies in the most distant cases. six of these sevensystems feature galaxies with nearby companions or interacting galaxies.furthermore, our results indicate that some outlying hii regions are linked tothe extended-uv disks discovered by galex, representing emission from the mostmassive o stars among a more abundant population of lower mass (or older) starclusters. the overall frequency of outlying hii regions in this sample ofgas-rich galaxies is 8 - 11% when we correct for background emission-linegalaxy contamination (~75% of eldots).

1004.2833	the first chemical abundance analysis of k giants in the inner galactic  disc	the elemental abundance structure of the galactic disc has been extensivelystudied in the solar neighbourhood using long-lived stars such as f and gdwarfs or k and m giants. these are stars whose atmospheres preserve thechemical composition of their natal gas clouds, and are hence excellent tracersof the chemical evolution of the galaxy. as far as we are aware, there are nosuch studies of the inner galactic disc, which hampers our ability to constrainand trace the origin and evolution of the milky way. therefore, we aim in thisstudy to establish the elemental abundance trend(s) of the disc(s) in the innerregions of the galaxy. based on equivalent width measurements inhigh-resolution spectra obtained with the mike spectrograph on the magellan iitelescope on las campanas in chile, we determine elemental abundances for 44k-type red giant stars in the inner galactic disc, located at galactocentricdistances of 4-7\,kpc. the analysis method is identical to the one recentlyused on red giant stars in the galactic bulge and in the nearby thin and thickdiscs, enabling us to perform a truly differential comparison of the differentstellar populations. we present the first detailed elemental abundance study ofa significant number of red giant stars in the inner galactic disc. we findthat these inner disc stars show the same type of chemical and kinematicaldichotomy as the thin and thick discs show in the solar neighbourhood. theabundance trends of the inner disc agree very well with those of the nearbythick disc, and also to those of the bulge. the chemical similarities betweenthe bulge and the galactic thick disc stellar populations indicate that theyhave similar chemical histories, and any model trying to understand theformation and evolution of either of the two should preferably incorporate bothof them.

0708.1138	progressive star formation in the young smc cluster ngc 602	ngc 602 is a young stellar cluster located in a peripheral region of thesmall magellanic cloud known as the wing. far from the main body of the galaxyand abutting the magellanic bridge, the smc's wing is characterized by low gasand stellar content. with deep optical imaging from the advanced camera forsurveys (acs) aboard the hubble space telescope (hst), we have discovered anextensive pre-main sequence (pms) population, with stellar masses in the range0.6-3 solar masses. these low mass pms stars formed coevally with the centralcluster about 4 myr ago. spitzer space telescope (spitzer) images of the sameregion from the infrared array camera (irac) also reveal a population of youngstellar objects (ysos), some of which are still embedded in nebular materialand most of which likely formed even more recently than the young starsdetected with hst/acs imaging. we infer that star formation started in thisregion about 4 myr ago with the formation of the central cluster and graduallypropagated towards the outskirts where star formation is presently ongoing.

1005.1865	the herschel revolution: unveiling the morphology of the high mass star  formation sites n44 and n63 in the lmc	we study the structure of the medium surrounding sites of high-mass starformation to determine the interrelation between the hii regions and theenvironment from which they were formed. the density distribution of thesurroundings is key in determining how the radiation of the newly formed starsinteracts with the surrounds in a way that allows it to be used as a starformation tracer. we present new herschel/spire 250, 350 and 500 mum data oflha 120-n44 and lha 120-n63 in the lmc. we construct average spectral energydistributions (seds) for annuli centered on the ir bright part of the starformation sites. the annuli cover ~10-~100 pc. we use a phenomenological dustmodel to fit these seds to derive the dust column densities, characterise theincident radiation field and the abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonmolecules. we see a factor 5 decrease in the radiation field energy density asa function of radial distance around n63. n44 does not show a systematic trend.we construct a simple geometrical model to derive the 3-d density profile ofthe surroundings of these two regions. herschel/spire data have proven veryefficient in deriving the dust mass distribution. we find that the radiationfield in the two sources behaves very differently. n63 is more or lessspherically symmetric and the average radiation field drops with distance. n44shows no systematic decrease of the radiation intensity which is probably dueto the inhomogeneity of the surrounding molecular material and to the complexdistribution of several star forming clusters in the region.

1010.2727	a multiwavelength study on the fate of ionizing radiation in local  starbursts	the fate of ionizing radiation is vital for understanding cosmic ionization,energy budgets in the interstellar and intergalactic medium, and star formationrate indicators. the low observed escape fractions of ionizing radiation havenot been adequately explained, and there is evidence that some starbursts havehigh escape fractions. we examine the spectral energy distributions of a sampleof local star-forming galaxies, containing thirteen local starburst galaxiesand ten of their ordinary star-forming counterparts, to determine if thereexist significant differences in the fate of ionizing radiation in thesegalaxies. we find that the galaxy-to-galaxy variations in the seds is muchlarger than any systematic differences between starbursts and non-starbursts.for example, we find no significant differences in the total absorption ofionizing radiation by dust, traced by the 24um, 70um, and 160um mips bands ofthe spitzer space telescope, although the dust in starburst galaxies appears tobe hotter than that of non-starburst galaxies. we also observe no excessultraviolet flux in the galex bands that could indicate a high escape fractionof ionizing photons in starburst galaxies. the small h-alpha fractions of thediffuse, warm ionized medium in starburst galaxies are apparently due totemporarily boosted h-alpha luminosity within the star-forming regionsthemselves, with an independent, constant wim luminosity. this independence ofthe wim and starburst luminosities contrasts with wim behavior in non-starburstgalaxies and underscores our poor understanding of radiation transfer in bothordinary and starburst galaxies.

1010.5273	the sparsest clusters with o stars	there is much debate on how high-mass star formation varies with environment,and whether the sparsest star-forming environments are capable of formingmassive stars. to address this issue, we have observed eight apparentlyisolated ob stars in the smc using hst's advanced camera for surveys. five ofthese objects appear as isolated stars, two of which are confirmed to berunaways. the remaining three objects are found to exist in sparse clusters,with &lt;10 companion stars revealed, having masses of 1-4 solar mass. stochasticeffects dominate in these sparse clusters, so we perform monte carlosimulations to explore how our observations fit within the framework ofempirical, galactic cluster properties. we generate clusters using a simplistic-2 power-law distribution for either the number of stars per cluster (n_*) orcluster mass (m_cl). these clusters are then populated with stars randomlychosen from a kroupa imf. we find that simulations with cluster lower-masslimits of m_cl,lo &gt;20 solar mass and n_*,lo &gt;40 match best with observations ofsmc and galactic ob star populations. we examine the mass ratio of thesecond-most massive and most massive stars (m_max,2/m_max), finding that ourobservations all exist below the 20th percentile of our simulated clusters.however, all of our observed clusters lie within the parameter space spanned bythe simulated clusters, although some are in the lowest 5th percentilefrequency. these results suggest that clusters are built stochastically byrandomly sampling stars from a universal imf with a fixed stellar upper-masslimit. in particular, we see no evidence to suggest a m_max - m_cl relation.our results may be more consistent with core accretion models of star formationthan with competitive accretion models, and they are inconsistent with theproposed steepening of the integrated galaxy imf (igimf).

1101.0280	observational constraints on superbubble x-ray energy budgets	the hot, x-ray-emitting gas in superbubbles imparts energy and enrichedmaterial to the interstellar medium (ism) and generates the hot ionized medium,the ism's high-temperature component. the evolution of superbubble energybudgets is not well understood, however, and the processes responsible forenhanced x-ray emission in superbubbles remain a matter of debate. we presentchandra acis-s observations of two x-ray-bright superbubbles in the largemagellanic cloud (lmc), dem l50 (n186) and dem l152 (n44), with an emphasis ondisentangling the true superbubble x-ray emission from non-related diffuseemission and determining the spatial origin and spectral variation of the x-rayemission. an examination of the superbubble energy budgets shows that on theorder of 50% of the x-ray emission comes from regions associated with supernovaremnant (snr) impacts. we find some evidence of mass-loading due to swept-upclouds and metallicity enrichment, but neither mechanism provides a significantcontribution to the x-ray luminosities. we also find that one of thesuperbubbles, dem l50, is likely not in collisional ionization equilibrium. wecompare our observations to the predictions of the standard weaver et al. modeland to 1-d hydrodynamic simulations including cavity supernova impacts on theshell walls. our observations show that mass-loading due to thermal evaporationfrom the shell walls and snr impacts are the dominant source of enhanced x-rayluminosities in superbubbles. these two processes should affect mostsuperbubbles, and their contribution to the x-ray luminosity must be consideredwhen determining the energy available for transport to the ism.

1102.4779	an introduction to the chandra carina complex project	the great nebula in carina provides an exceptional view into the violentmassive star formation and feedback that typifies giant hii regions andstarburst galaxies. we have mapped the carina star-forming complex in x-rays,using archival chandra data and a mosaic of 20 new 60ks pointings using thechandra x-ray observatory's advanced ccd imaging spectrometer, as a testbed forunderstanding recent and ongoing star formation and to probe carina's regionsof bright diffuse x-ray emission. this study has yielded a catalog ofproperties of &gt;14,000 x-ray point sources; &gt;9800 of them have multiwavelengthcounterparts. using chandra's unsurpassed x-ray spatial resolution, we haveseparated these point sources from the extensive, spatially-complex diffuseemission that pervades the region; x-ray properties of this diffuse emissionsuggest that it traces feedback from carina's massive stars. in thisintroductory paper, we motivate the survey design, describe the chandraobservations, and present some simple results, providing a foundation for the15 papers that follow in this special issue and that present detailed catalogs,methods, and science results.

1103.1606	the integrated diffuse x-ray emission of the carina nebula compared to  other massive star-forming regions	the chandra carina complex project (cccp) has shown that the carina nebuladisplays bright, spatially-complex soft diffuse x-ray emission. here we `sumup' the cccp diffuse emission work by comparing the global morphology andspectrum of carina's diffuse x-ray emission to other famous sites of massivestar formation with pronounced diffuse x-ray emission: m17, ngc 3576, ngc 3603,and 30 doradus. all spectral models require at least two diffuse thermal plasmacomponents to achieve adequate spectral fits, a softer component with kt =0.2--0.6 kev and a harder component with kt = 0.5--0.9 kev. in several casesthese hot plasmas appear to be in a state of non-equilibrium ionization thatmay indicate recent and current strong shocks. a cavity north of the embeddedgiant hii region ngc 3576 is the only region studied here that exhibits harddiffuse x-ray emission; this emission appears to be nonthermal and is likelydue to a recent cavity supernova, as evidenced by a previously-known pulsar andnewly-discovered pulsar wind nebula also seen in this cavity. all of thesetargets exhibit x-ray emission lines that are not well-modeled byvariable-abundance thermal plasmas and that might be attributed to chargeexchange at the shock between the hot, tenuous, x-ray-emitting plasma and cold,dense molecular material; this is likely evidence for dust destruction at themany hot/cold interfaces that characterize massive star-forming regions.

1103.2170	dust emission from evolved and unevolved hii regions in the large  magellanic cloud	we present a study of the dust properties of 12 classical and superbubble hiiregions in the large magellanic cloud. we use infrared photometry from spitzer(8, 24, 70, and 160 \mum bands), obtained as part of the surveying the agentsof a galaxy's evolution (sage) program, along with archival spectroscopicclassifications of the ionizing stars to examine the role of stellar sources ondust heating and processing. our infrared observations show surprisingly littlecorrelation between the emission properties of the dust and the effectivetemperatures or bolometric magnitudes of stars in the hii regions, suggestingthat the hii region evolutionary timescale is not on the order of the dustprocessing timescale. we find that the infrared emission of superbubbles andclassical hii regions shows little differentiation between the two classes,despite the significant differences in age and morphology. we do detect acorrelation of the 24 \mum emission from hot dust with the ratio of 70 to 160\mum flux. this correlation can be modeled as a trend in the temperature of aminority hot dust component, while a majority of the dust remains significantlycooler.

1106.1914	a first constraint on the thick disk scale length: differential radial  abundances in k giants at galactocentric radii 4, 8, and 12 kpc	based on high-resolution spectra obtained with the mike spectrograph on themagellan telescopes we present detailed elemental abundances for 20 red giantstars in the outer galactic disk, located at galactocentric distances between 9and 13 kpc. the outer disk sample is complemented with samples of red giantsfrom the inner galactic disk and the solar neighbourhood, analysed usingidentical methods. for galactocentric distances beyond 10 kpc, we only findchemical patterns associated with the local thin disk, even for stars far abovethe galactic plane. our results show that the relative densities of the thickand thin disks are dramatically different from the solar neighbourhood, and wetherefore suggest that the radial scale length of the thick disk is muchshorter than that of the thin disk. we make a first estimate of the thick diskscale-length of l_thick=2.0 kpc, assuming l_thin=3.8 kpc for the thin disk. wesuggest that radial migration may explain the lack of radial age, metallicity,and abundance gradients in the thick disk, possibly also explaining the linkbetween the thick disk and the metal-poor bulge.

0710.0558	the stellar mass distribution in the giant star forming region ngc 346	deep f555w and f814w hubble space telescope acs images are the basis for astudy of the present day mass function (pdmf) of ngc346, the largest activestar forming region in the small magellanic cloud (smc). we find a pdmf slopeof gamma=-1.43+/-0.18 in the mass range 0.8-60 mo, in excellent agreement withthe salpeter initial mass function (imf) in the solar neighborhood. caveats onthe conversion of the pdmf to the imf are discussed. the pdmf slope changes, asa function of the radial distance from the center of the ngc 346 star cluster,indicating a segregation of the most massive stars. this segregation is likelyprimordial considering the young age (~3 myr) of ngc346, and its clumpystructure which suggests that the cluster has likely not had sufficient time torelax. comparing our results for ngc346 with those derived for other starclusters in the smc and the milky way (mw), we conclude that, while the starformation process might depend on the local cloud conditions, the imf does notseem to be affected by general environmental effects such as galaxy type,metallicity, and dust content.

1108.2287	on the origin of the salpeter slope for the initial mass function	we suggest that the intrinsic, stellar initial mass function (imf) follows apower-law slope gamma=2, inherited from hierarchical fragmentation of molecularclouds into clumps and clumps into stars. the well-known, logarithmic salpeterslope gamma=1.35 in clusters is then the aggregate slope for all thestar-forming clumps contributing to an individual cluster, and it is steeperthan the intrinsic slope within individual clumps because the smalleststar-forming clumps contributing to any given cluster are unable to form thehighest-mass stars. our monte carlo simulations demonstrate that the salpeterpower-law index is the limiting value obtained for the cluster imf when thelower-mass limits for allowed stellar masses and star-forming clumps areeffectively equal, m_lo = m_lo. this condition indeed is imposed for thehigh-mass imf tail by the turn-over at the characteristic value m_c ~ 1 m_sun.imf slopes of gamma ~ 2 are obtained if the stellar and clump upper-mass limitsare also equal m_up = m_up ~ 100 m_sun, and so our model explains the observedrange of imf slopes between gamma ~ 1 to 2. flatter slopes of gamma = 1 areexpected when m_lo &gt; m_up, which is a plausible condition in starbursts, wheresuch slopes are suggested to occur. while this model is a simplisticparameterization of the star-formation process, it seems likely to capture theessential elements that generate the salpeter tail of the imf for massivestars. these principles also likely explain the igimf effect seen inlow-density star-forming environments.

1109.6360	an ionization cone in the dwarf starburst galaxy ngc 5253	there are few observational constraints on how the escape of ionizing photonsfrom starburst galaxies depends on galactic parameters. here, we report on thefirst major detection of an ionization cone in ngc 5253, a nearby starburstgalaxy. this high-excitation feature is identified by mapping the emission-lineratios in the galaxy using [s iii] lambda 9069, [s ii] lambda 6716, and h_alphanarrow-band images from the maryland-magellan tunable filter at las campanasobservatory. the ionization cone appears optically thin, which is suggestive ofthe escape of ionizing photons. the cone morphology is narrow with an estimatedsolid angle covering just 3% of 4pi steradians, and the young, massive clustersof the nuclear starburst can easily generate the radiation required to ionizethe cone. although less likely, we cannot rule out the possibility of anobscured agn source. an echelle spectrum along the minor axis shows complexkinematics that are consistent with outflow activity. the narrow morphology ofthe ionization cone supports the scenario that an orientation bias contributesto the difficulty in detecting lyman continuum emission from starbursts andlyman break galaxies.

1109.6655	the imf of field ob stars in the small magellanic cloud	the population of field ob stars are an important component of a galaxy'sstellar content, representing 20-30% of the massive stars. to study thispopulation, we have undertaken the runaways and isolated o type starspectroscopic survey of the smc (riots4). riots4 surveys a spatially completesample of &gt;350 field ob stars in the small magellanic cloud and will serve as akey probe of runaways, binaries, and the stellar imf in the field massive starpopulation. here, we focus on the field imf, which provides an empirical probeof the star-forming process and is a fundamental property of a stellarpopulation. together with photometry from the ogle survey, riots4 will yield adefinitive stellar imf for the smc field massive star population. we presentpreliminary results that suggests the field imf is much steeper, gamma = 2.9,than the canonical stellar imf of gamma = 1.35. despite the steep slope, we seeno evidence of a stellar upper mass limit, up to our highest mass star of 65solar masses.

1202.3334	the optical depth of h ii regions in the magellanic clouds	we exploit ionization-parameter mapping as a powerful tool to measure theoptical depth of star-forming hii regions. our simulations using thephotoionization code cloudy and our new, surfbright surface brightnesssimulator demonstrate that this technique can directly diagnose mostdensity-bounded, optically thin nebulae using spatially resolved emission linedata. we apply this method to the large and small magellanic clouds, using thedata from the magellanic clouds emission line survey. we generate new hiiregion catalogs based on photoionization criteria set by the observedionization structure in the [sii]/[oiii] ratio and ha surface brightness. theluminosity functions from these catalogs generally agree with those fromha-only surveys. we then use ionization-parameter mapping to crudely classifyall the nebulae into optically thick vs optically thin categories, yieldingfundamental new insights into lyman continuum radiation transfer. we find thatin both galaxies, the frequency of optically thin objects correlates with haluminosity, and that the numbers of these objects dominate above log l\geq37.0.the frequencies of optically thin objects are 40% and 33% in the lmc and smc,respectively. similarly, the frequency of optically thick regions correlateswith h i column density, with optically thin objects dominating at the lowestn(hi). the integrated escape luminosity of ionizing radiation is dominated bythe largest regions, and corresponds to luminosity-weighted, ionizing escapefractions from the h ii region population of \geq0.42 and \geq0.40 in the lmcand smc, respectively. these values correspond to global galactic escapefractions of 4% and 11%, respectively. this is sufficient to power theionization rate of the observed diffuse ionized gas in both galaxies. ourresults suggest the possibility of significant galactic escape fractions oflyman continuum radiation.

1208.1674	projected rotational velocities and stellar characterization of 350 b  stars in the nearby galactic disk	projected rotational velocities (vsini) are presented for a sample of 350early b-type main sequence stars in the nearby galactic disk. the stars arelocated within ~1.5 kpc from the sun, and the great majority within 700 pc. theanalysis is based on high-resolution spectra obtained with the mikespectrograph on the magellan clay 6.5-m telescope at the las campanasobservatory in chile.spectral types were estimated based on relativeintensities of some key line absorption ratios and comparisons to syntheticspectra. effective temperatures were estimated from the reddening-free q index,and projected rotational velocities were then determined via interpolation on apublished grid that correlates the synthetic full width at half maximum of thehe i lines at 4026, 4388 and 4471 a with vsini. as the sample has been selectedsolely on the basis of spectral types it contains an selection of b stars inthe field, in clusters, and in ob associations. the vsini distribution obtainedfor the entire sample is found to be essentially flat for vsini values between0-150 km/s, with only a modest peak at low projected rotational velocities.considering subsamples of stars, there appears to be a gradation in the vsinidistribution with the field stars presenting a larger fraction of the slowrotators and the cluster stars distribution showing an excess of stars withvsini between 70 and 130 km/s. furthermore, for a subsample of potentialrunaway stars we find that the vsini distribution resembles the distributionseen in denser environments, which could suggest that these runaway stars havebeen subject to dynamical ejection mechanisms.

1212.1205	the initial mass function of field ob stars in the small magellanic  cloud	some theories of star formation suggest massive stars may only form inclustered environments, which would create a deficit of massive stars in lowdensity environments. observationally, massey (2002) finds such a deficit insamples of the field population in the small and large magellanic clouds, withan imf slope of {\gamma} ~ 4. these imf measurements represent some of thelargest known deviations from the standard salpeter imf slope of {\gamma}=1.35.here, we carry out a comprehensive investigation of the mass function above 20solar masses for the entire field population of the small magellanic cloud,based on data from the runaways and isolated o type star spectroscopic surveyof the smc (riots4). this is a spatially complete census of the entire field obstar population of the smc obtained with the imacs multi-object spectrographand mike echelle spectrograph on the magellan telescopes. based on monte-carlosimulations of the evolved present-day mass function, we find the slope of thefield imf above 20 solar masses is {\gamma}=2.3+/-0.4. we extend our imfmeasurement to lower masses using bv photometry from the ogle ii survey. we usea statistical approach to generate a probability distribution for the mass ofeach star from the ogle photometry, and we again find {\gamma}=2.3+/-0.6 forstellar masses from 7-20 solar masses. the discovery and removal of tenrunaways in our riots4 sample steepens the field imf slope to{\gamma}=2.8+/-0.5. we discuss the possible effects of binarity andstar-formation history on our results, and conclude that the steep fieldmassive star imf is most likely a real effect.

1212.5487	single-star hii regions as a probe of massive star spectral energy  distributions	the shape of the ob-star spectral energy distribution is a critical componentin many diagnostics of the ism and galaxy properties. we use single-star hiiregions from the lmc to quantitatively examine the ionizing seds from widelyavailable costar, tlusty, and wm-basic atmosphere grids. we evaluate thestellar atmosphere models by matching the emission-line spectra that theypredict from cloudy photoionization simulations with those observed from thenebulae. the atmosphere models are able to reproduce the observed opticalnebular line ratios, except at the highest energy transitions &gt; 40 ev, assumingthat the gas distribution is non-uniform. overall we find that simulationsusing wm-basic produce the best agreement with the observed line ratios. therate of ionizing photons produced by the model seds is consistent with the ratederived from the \halpha\ luminosity for standard, log(g) = 4.0 models adoptedfrom the atmosphere grids. however, there is a systematic offset between therate of ionizing photons from different atmosphere models that is correlatedwith the relative hardness of the seds. in general wm-basic and tlustyatmosphere models predict similar effective temperatures, while costar predictseffective temperatures that are cooler by a few thousand degrees. we compareour effective temperatures, which depend on the nebular ionization balance, toconventional photospheric-based calibrations from the literature. we suggestthat in the future, spectral type to effective temperature calibrations can beconstructed from nebular data.

1301.0530	the origin and optical depth of ionizing radiation in the "green pea"  galaxies	although lyman continuum (lyc) radiation from star-forming galaxies likelydrove the reionization of the universe, observations of star-forming galaxiesat low redshift generally indicate low lyc escape fractions. however, theextreme [o iii]/[o ii] ratios of the z=0.1-0.3 green pea galaxies may be due tohigh escape fractions of ionizing radiation. to analyze the lyc optical depthsand ionizing sources of these rare, compact starbursts, we compare nebularphotoionization and stellar population models with observed emission lines inthe peas' sdss spectra. we focus on the six most extreme green peas, thegalaxies with the highest [o iii]/[o ii] ratios and the best candidates forescaping ionizing radiation. the balmer line equivalent widths and he i{\lambda}3819 emission in the extreme peas support young ages of 3-5 myr, andhe ii {\lambda}4686 emission in five extreme peas signals the presence of hardionizing sources. ionization by active galactic nuclei or high-mass x-raybinaries is inconsistent with the peas' line ratios and ages. although stackedspectra reveal no wolf-rayet (wr) features, we tentatively detect wr featuresin the sdss spectra of three extreme peas. based on the peas' ages and lineratios, we find that wr stars, chemically homogeneous o stars, or shocks couldproduce the observed he ii emission. if hot stars are responsible, the peas'optical depths are ambiguous. however, accounting for emission from shockslowers the inferred optical depth and suggests that the peas may be opticallythin. the peas' ages likely optimize the escape of lyman-continuum radiation;they are old enough for supernovae and stellar winds to reshape theinterstellar medium, but young enough to possess large numbers of uv-luminous oor wr stars.

1311.2227	new constraints on the escape of ionizing photons from starburst  galaxies using ionization-parameter mapping	the fate of ionizing radiation in starburst galaxies is key to understandingcosmic reionization. however, the galactic parameters on which the escapefraction of ionizing radiation depend are not well understood.ionization-parameter mapping provides a simple, yet effective, way to study theradiative transfer in starburst galaxies. we obtain emission-line ratio maps of[siii]/[sii] for six, nearby, dwarf starbursts: ngc 178, ngc 1482, ngc 1705,ngc 3125, ngc 7126, and he 2-10. the narrow-band images are obtained with themaryland-magellan tunable filter at las campanas observatory. using these data,we previously reported the discovery of an optically thin ionization cone inngc 5253, and here we also discover a similar ionization cone in ngc 3125. thislatter cone has an opening angle of 40+/-5 degrees (0.4 ster), indicating thatthe passageways through which ionizing radiation may travel correspond to asmall solid angle. additionally, there are three sample galaxies that havewinds and/or superbubble activity, which should be conducive to escapingradiation, yet they are optically thick. these results support the scenariothat an orientation bias limits our ability to directly detect escaping lymancontinuum in many starburst galaxies. a comparison of the star-formationproperties and histories of the optically thin and thick galaxies is consistentwith the model that high escape fractions are limited to galaxies that are oldenough (&gt; 3 myr) for mechanical feedback to have cleared optically thinpassageways in the ism, but young enough (&lt; 5 myr) that the ionizing stars arestill present.

1402.4429	the origin and optical depth of ionizing photons in the green pea  galaxies	our understanding of radiative feedback and star formation in galaxies athigh redshift is hindered by the rarity of similar systems at low redshift.however, the recently identified green pea (gp) galaxies are similar tohigh-redshift galaxies in their morphologies and star formation rates and arevital tools for probing the generation and transmission of ionizing photons.the gps contain massive star clusters that emit copious amounts of high-energyradiation, as indicated by intense [oiii] 5007 emission and heii 4686 emission.we focus on six gp galaxies with high ratios of [o iii] 5007,4959/[o ii] 3727~10 or more. such high ratios indicate gas with a high ionization parameter ora low optical depth. the gp line ratios and ages point to chemicallyhomogeneous massive stars, wolf-rayet stars, or shock ionization as the mostlikely sources of the he ii emission. models including shock ionization suggestthat the gps may have low optical depths, consistent with a scenario in whichionizing photons escape along passageways created by recent supernovae. the gpsand similar galaxies can shed new light on cosmic reionization by revealing howionizing photons propagate from massive star clusters to the intergalacticmedium.

1406.4413	linking ly-alpha and low-ionization transitions at low optical depth	we suggest that low optical depth in the lyman continuum (lyc) may relate thely-alpha emission, c ii and si ii absorption, and c ii* and si ii* emissionseen in high-redshift galaxies. we base this analysis on hubble space telescopecos spectra of four green pea (gp) galaxies, which may be analogs of z&gt;2ly-alpha emitters (laes). in the two gps with the strongest ly-alpha emission,the ly-alpha line profiles show reduced signs of resonant scattering. instead,the ly-alpha profiles resemble the h-alpha line profiles of evolved starejecta, suggesting that the ly-alpha emission originates from a low columndensity and similar outflow geometry. the weak c ii absorption and presence ofnon-resonant c ii* emission in these gps support this interpretation and implya low lyc optical depth along the line of sight. in two additional gps, weakly-alpha emission and strong c ii absorption suggest a higher optical depth.these two gps differ in their ly-alpha profile shapes and c ii* emissionstrengths, however, indicating different inclinations of the outflows to ourline of sight. with these four gps as examples, we explain the observed trendslinking ly-alpha, c ii, and c ii* in stacked lae spectra, in the context ofoptical depth and geometric effects. specifically, in some galaxies with strongly-alpha emission, a low lyc optical depth may allow ly-alpha to escape withreduced scattering. furthermore, c ii absorption, c ii* emission, and ly-alphaprofile shape can reveal the optical depth, constrain the orientation ofneutral outflows in laes, and identify candidate lyc emitters.

1411.3185	discovery of the earliest-type oe stars in the small magellanic cloud	no classical oe/be stars with spectral type earlier than o7.5e have beenidentified to date in the milky way (mw). this is consistent with the decretiondisk model because strong stellar winds cause early-type o stars to loseangular momentum, thereby preventing them from rotating fast enough to spin outdecretion disks. how- ever, metal-poor o stars have weaker stellar winds,allowing the stars to retain angular momentum. therefore, low-metallicityenvironments should promote the formation of oe stars, including those ofearlier spectral types than observed in high-metallicity en- vironments. usingthe riots4 survey, a spatially complete spectroscopic survey of smallmagellanic cloud (smc) field ob stars taken with the imacs multi-slit spec-trograph at the magellan baade telescope, we identify 25-31 smc field oe stars,which account for 20-28% of smc field o stars. this fraction is significantlyhigher than in the mw, where &lt; 10-15% of o stars display the be phenomenon. wealso present 5-7 oe stars of spectral type ranging from o5.5e to o7e, allearlier spectral types than the earliest mw oe star. these early type oe starsrepresent 20-23% of our smc oe stars, a dramatic increase compared to the mw,where no oe stars have been identified with these early spectral types. thus,the higher frequencies of oe stars and their earlier spectral range in themetal-poor smc are consistent with the decretion disk model.

1506.05081	from hi to stars: hi depletion in starbursts and star-forming galaxies  in the alfalfa h-alpha survey	hi in galaxies traces the fuel for future star formation and reveals theeffects of feedback on neutral gas. using a statistically uniform, hi-selectedsample of 565 galaxies from the alfalfa h-alpha survey, we explore hiproperties as a function of star formation activity. alfalfa h-alpha providesr-band and h-alpha imaging for a volume-limited subset of the 21-cm alfalfasurvey. we identify eight starbursts based on h-alpha equivalent width and sixwith enhanced star formation relative to the main sequence. both starbursts andnon-starbursts have similar hi to stellar mass ratios (mhi/m*), which suggeststhat feedback is not depleting the starbursts' hi. consequently, the starburstsdo have shorter hi depletion times (t_dep), implying more efficient hi-to-h2conversion. while major mergers likely drive this enhanced efficiency in somestarbursts, the lowest mass starbursts may experience periodic bursts,consistent with enhanced scatter in t_dep at low m*. two starbursts appear tobe pre-coalescence mergers; their elevated mhi/m* suggest that hi-to-h2conversion is still ongoing at this stage. by comparing with the gass sample,we find that t_dep anti-correlates with stellar surface density for disks,while spheroids show no such trend. among early-type galaxies, t_dep does notcorrelate with bulge-to-disk ratio; instead, the gas distribution may determinethe star formation efficiency. finally, the weak connection between galaxies'specific star formation rates and mhi/m* contrasts with the well-knowncorrelation between mhi/m* and color. we show that dust extinction can explainthe hi-color trend, which may arise from the relationship between m*, mhi, andmetallicity.

astro-ph;0003311	calibration of nebular emission-line diagnostics: ii. abundances	(abridged) we examine standard methods of measuring nebular chemicalabundances, including estimates based on direct t_e measurements, and alsobright-line diagnostics. we use observations of 4 lmc hii regions whoseionizing stars have classifications ranging from o7 to wn3. we assume a 2-zonet_e structure to compute ionic abundances. we compare with photoionizationmodels tailored to the properties of the individual objects, and emphasize theimportance of correctly relating t_e in the two zones, which can otherwisecause errors of ~0.2 dex in abundance estimates. there are no spatialvariations to within 0.1 - 0.15 dex in any of the objects, even one hosting 3wr stars.  our data agree with the modeled r23 and s23 diagnostics of o and s. wepresent the first theoretical tracks for s23, which are in excellent agreementwith a larger dataset. however, contrary to earlier suggestions, s23 is muchmore sensitive to the ionization parameter than is r23, because s23 does notsample s iv. we therefore introduce s234 = ([sii]+[siii]+[siv])/h-beta.predicted and observed spatial variations in s234 are dramatically reduced incontrast to s23. the intensity of [siv]10.5 microns is easily estimated from asimple relation between [siv]/[siii] and [oiii]/[oii]. this method ofestimating s234 yields excellent agreement with our models, hence we give atheoretical calibration for s234. the double-valued structure of s23 and s234remains an important problem as for r23, and presently we consider the sdiagnostics reliable only at z &lt; 0.5 z_sol. however, the slightly largerdynamic range and excellent compatibility with theoretical predictions suggestthe s diagnostics to be more effective abundance indicators than r23.

astro-ph;0208430	structure and dynamics of candidate o star bubbles in n44	dynamical studies of superbubbles and wolf-rayet ring nebulae showdiscrepancies from the standard, adiabatic model for wind-blown bubbles. wetherefore study the physical properties and kinematics of three candidatebubbles blown by single o stars, to evaluate whether these discrepancies arealso found in these simpler objects. our sample candidates are n44f, n44j, andn44m, in the outskirts of the hii complex n44 in the large magellanic cloud. wehave obtained ground-based and hst emission-line images and high dispersionechelle spectra for these objects. from the halpha luminosities and the[oiii]/halpha ratios of these nebulae, we estimate the spectral types of theionizing stars to be o7v, o9.5v and o9.5v for n44f, n44j, and n44m,respectively. we find that the observed expansion velocity of 12 km/s for n44fis consistent with the stellar wind luminosity expected from the centralionizing star, as predicted by the standard bubble model. the observed upperlimits for the expansion velocities of n44j and n44m are also compatible withthe expected values, within the uncertainties. we also report the discovery inn44f of strongly-defined dust columns, similar to those seen in the eaglenebula. the photoevaporation of these dense dust features may be kinematicallyimportant and may actually govern the evolution of the shell. the inclusion ofphotoevaporation processes may thus undermine the apparent agreement betweenthe observed bubble dynamics and the simple adiabatic models.

astro-ph;0208442	galactic porosity and a star formation threshold for the escape of  ionising radiation from galaxies	the spatial distribution of star formation within galaxies strongly affectsthe resulting feedback processes. previous work has considered the case of asingle, concentrated nuclear starburst, and also that of distributed singlesupernovae (sne). here, we consider ism structuring by sne originating inspatially distributed clusters having a cluster membership spectrum given bythe observed hii region luminosity function. we show that in this case, thevolume of hi cleared per sn is considerably greater than in either of the twocases considered hitherto.  we derive a simple relationship between the ``porosity'' of the ism and thestar formation rate (sfr), and deduce a critical sfr_crit, at which the ismporosity is unity. this critical value describes the case in which the snmechanical energy output over a timescale t_e is comparable with the ism``thermal'' energy contained in random motions; t_e is the duration of snmechanical input per superbubble. this condition also defines a critical gasconsumption timescale t_exh, which for a salpeter imf and random velocities of\simeq 10 km s-1 is roughly 10e10 years.  we draw a link between porosity and the escape of ionising radiation fromgalaxies, arguing that high escape fractions are expected if sfr &gt;~ sfr_crit.the lyman break galaxies, which are presumably subject to infall on a timescale&lt; t_exh, meet this criterion, as is consistent with the significant leakage ofionising photons inferred in these systems. we suggest the utility of thissimple parameterisation of escape fraction in terms of sfr for semi-empiricalmodels of galaxy formation and evolution and for modeling mechanical andchemical feedback effects.

astro-ph;0211344	the number and metallicities of the most metal-poor stars	simple, one-zone models for inhomogeneous chemical evolution of the galactichalo are used to predict the number fraction of zero-metallicity, populationiii stars, which currently is empirically estimated at &lt; 4e-4. these analyticmodels minimize the number of free parameters, highlighting the mostfundamental constraints on halo evolution. there are disagreements of at leastan order of magnitude between observations and predictions in limiting casesfor both homogeneous simple model and simple inhomogeneous model (sim). hence,this demonstrates a quantitative, unambiguous discrepancy in the observed andexpected fraction of population iii stars. we explore how the metallicitydistribution of the parent enrichment events f(z_0) drives the sim andpredictions for the population iii fraction. the sim shows that thepreviously-identified "high halo" and "low halo" populations are consistentwith a continuous evolutionary progression, and therefore may not necessarilybe physically distinct populations. possible evolutionary scenarios for haloevolution are discussed within the sim's simplistic one-zone paradigm.  the values of z_0 depend strongly on metal dispersal processes, thus weinvestigate interstellar mixing and mass transport, for the first timeexplicitly incorporating this into a semi-analytic chemical evolution model.diffusion is found to be inefficient for all phases, including the hot phase,of the interstellar medium (ism): relevant diffusion lengths are 2 - 4 ordersof magnitude smaller than corresponding length scales for turbulent mixing.rough relations for dispersal processes are given for multiphase ism. thesesuggest that the expected low-metallicity threshold above zero is consistentwith the currently observed limit.

astro-ph;0212052	discussion: star formation within galaxies	this discussion session focused on star formation within galactic scales. weattempt to identify the dominant physical processes and parameters thatcharacterize star formation, and to identify key questions that illuminatethese phenomena. the discussion was delineated by the following cycle of threequestions: (a) is the top of the hii lf physically distinct? (b) how doesmassive star feedback affect the ism and star formation? (c) how do ismproperties affect the hii lf? finally, is one of these three questions thefundamental one of the cycle?  corresponding answers emerged from the discussion: (a) the hii lf to date isa continuous power law; (b) there are both positive and negative feedbackeffects, which are poorly understood; (c) the hii lf appears remarkablyindependent of ism properties. therefore, we suggest that the resultantfundamental question is: ``is the hii lf and parent stellar cluster membershipfunction universal?'' this is analogous to the related question of a universalstellar imf. understanding the relationship, if any, between the imf, clustermembership function, and ism properties may finally lead to a quantitativetheory of star formation.

astro-ph;0307131	the local group as an astrophysical laboratory for massive star feedback	the feedback effects of massive stars on their galactic and intergalacticenvironments can dominate evolutionary processes in galaxies and affect cosmicstructure in the universe. only the local group offers the spatial resolutionto quantitatively study feedback processes on a variety of scales. lymancontinuum radiation from hot, luminous stars ionizes hii regions and isbelieved to dominate production of the warm component of the interstellarmedium (ism). some of this radiation apparently escapes from galaxies into theintergalactic environment. supernovae and strong stellar winds generate shellstructures such as supernova remnants, stellar wind bubbles, and superbubblesaround ob associations. hot (10^6 k) gas is generated within these shells, andis believed to be the origin of the hot component of the ism. superbubbleactivity thus is likely to dominate the ism structure, kinematics, and phasebalance in star-forming galaxies. galactic superwinds in starburst galaxiesenable the escape of mass, ionizing radiation, and heavy elements. althoughmany important issues remain to be resolved, there is little doubt thatfeedback processes plays a fundamental role in energy cycles on scales rangingfrom individual stars to cosmic structure. this contribution reviews studies ofradiative and mechanical feedback in the local group.

astro-ph;0312051	massive field stars and the stellar clustering law	the distribution of n*, the number of ob stars per association or cluster,appears to follow a universal power-law form $n*^{-2}$ in the local universe.we evaluate the distribution of n* in the small magellanic cloud using recentbroadband optical and space-ultraviolet data, with special attention to thelowest values of n*. we find that the power-law distribution in n* continuessmoothly down to n*=1. this strongly suggests that the formation of fieldmassive stars is a continuous process with those in associations, and that thefield stars do not originate from a different star formation mode. our resultsare consistent with the model that field massive stars represent the mostmassive members in groups of smaller stars, as expected if the clustering lawapplies to much lower masses as is expected from the stellar initial massfunction (imf). these results are consistent with the simultaneous existence ofa universal imf and a universal clustering law. jointly, these laws imply thatthe fraction of field ob stars typically ranges from about 35% to 7% for mostastrophysical situations, with an inverse logarithmic dependence on the mostpopulous cluster, and hence, on galaxy size and/or star formation rate. thereare important consequences for global feedback effects in galaxies: field starsshould therefore contribute proportionately to the volume of the warm ionizedmedium, and equal relative contributions by superbubbles of all sizes to theinterstellar porosity are expected.

astro-ph;0501136	hierarchical triggering of star formation by superbubbles in w3/w4	it is generally believed that expanding superbubbles and mechanical feedbackfrom massive stars trigger star formation, because there are numerous examplesof superbubbles showing secondary star formation at their edges. however, whilethese systems show an age sequence, they do not provide strong evidence of acausal relationship. the w3/w4 galactic star-forming complex suggests athree-generation hierarchy: the supergiant shell structures correspond to theoldest generation; these triggered the formation of ic 1795 in w3, theprogenitor of a molecular superbubble; which in turn triggered the currentstar-forming episodes in the embedded regions w3-north, w3-main, and w3-oh. wepresent ubv photometry and spectroscopic classifications for ic 1795, whichshow an age of 3 - 5 myr. this age is intermediate between the reported 6 - 20myr age of the supergiant shell system, and the extremely young ages (10^4 -10^5 yr) for the embedded knots of ultracompact hii regions, w3-north, w3-main,and w3-oh. thus, an age sequence is indeed confirmed for the entire w3/w4hierarchical system. this therefore provides some of the first convincingevidence that superbubble action and mechanical feedback are indeed atriggering mechanism for star formation.

astro-ph;0606356	spitzer survey of the large magellanic cloud, surveying the agents of a  galaxy's evolution (sage) i: overview and initial results	we are performing a uniform and unbiased, ~7x7 degrees imaging survey of thelarge magellanic cloud (lmc), using the irac and mips instruments on board thespitzer space telescope in order to survey the agents of a galaxy's evolution(sage), the interstellar medium (ism) and stars in the lmc. the detection ofdiffuse ism with column densities &gt;1.2x10^21 h cm^-2 permits detailed studiesof dust processes in the ism. sage's point source sensitivity enables acomplete census of newly formed stars with masses &gt;3 solar masses that willdetermine the current star formation rate in the lmc. sage's detection ofevolved stars with mass loss rates &gt;1x10^-8 solar masses per year will quantifythe rate at which evolved stars inject mass into the ism of the lmc. theobserving strategy includes two epochs in 2005, separated by three months, thatboth mitigate instrumental artifacts and constrain source variability. the sagedata are non-proprietary. the data processing includes irac and mips pipelinesand a database for mining the point source catalogs, which will be released tothe community in support of spitzer proposal cycles 4 and 5. we present initialresults on the epoch 1 data with a special focus on the n79 and n83 region. thesage epoch 1 point source catalog has ~4 million sources. the point sourcecounts are highest for the irac 3.6 microns band and decrease dramaticallytowards longer wavelengths consistent with the fact that stars dominate thepoint source catalogs and that the dusty objects, e.g. young stellar objectsand dusty evolved stars that detected at the longer wavelengths, are rare incomparison. we outline a strategy for identifying foreground mw stars, that maycomprise as much as 18% of the source list, and background galaxies, that maycomprise ~12% of the source list.

astro-ph;0608189	spitzer sage survey of the large magellanic cloud ii: evolved stars and  infrared color magnitude diagrams	color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) are presented for the spitzer sage (surveyingthe agents of a galaxy's evolution) survey of the large magellanic cloud (lmc).irac and mips 24 um epoch one data are presented. these data represent thedeepest, widest mid-infrared cmds of their kind ever produced in the lmc.combined with the 2mass survey, the diagrams are used to delineate the evolvedstellar populations in the large magellanic cloud as well as galacticforeground and extragalactic background populations. some 32000 evolved starsbrighter than the tip of the red giant branch are identified. of these,approximately 17500 are classified as oxygen-rich, 7000 carbon-rich, andanother 1200 as ``extreme'' asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars. brightermembers of the latter group have been called ``obscured'' agb stars in theliterature owing to their dusty circumstellar envelopes. a large number (1200)of luminous oxygen--rich agb stars/m supergiants are also identified. finally,there is strong evidence from the 24 um mips channel that previouslyunexplored, lower luminosity oxygen-rich agb stars contribute significantly tothe mass loss budget of the lmc (1200 such sources are identified).

astro-ph;0609330	past and present star formation in the smc: ngc 346 and its neighborhood	in the quest of understanding how star formation occurs and propagates in thelow metallicity environment of the small magellanic cloud (smc), we acquireddeep f555w (~v), and f814w (~i) hst/acs images of the young and massive starforming region ngc 346. these images and their photometric analysis provide uswith a snapshot of the star formation history of the region. we find evidencefor star formation extending from ~10 gyr in the past until ~150 myr in thefield of the smc. the youngest stellar population (~3 +/- 1 myr) is associatedwith the ngc 346 cluster. it includes a rich component of low mass pre-mainsequence stars mainly concentrated in a number of sub-clusters, spatially co-located with co clumps previously detected by rubio et al. (2000). within ouranalysis uncertainties, these sub-clusters appear coeval with each other. themost massive stars appear concentrated in the central sub-clusters, indicatingpossible mass segregation. a number of embedded clusters are also observed.this finding, combined with the overall wealth of dust and gas, could implythat star formation is still active. an intermediate age star cluster, bs90,formed ~4.3 +/-0.1 gyr ago, is also present in the region. thus, this region ofthe smc has supported star formation with varying levels of intensity over muchof the cosmic time.

astro-ph;0610754	hercules stream stars and the metal-rich thick disk	using the mike spectrograph, mounted on the 6.5 m magellan/clay telescope atthe las campanas observatory in chile, we have obtained high-resolution spectrafor 60 f and g dwarf stars, all likely members of a density enhancement in thelocal velocity distribution, referred to as the hercules stream. comparing withan existing sample of 102 thin and thick disk stars we have used spacevelocities, detailed elemental abundances, and stellar ages to trace the originof the hercules stream. we find that the hercules stream stars show a widespread in stellar ages, metallicities, and element abundances. however, thespreads are not random but separate the hercules stream into the abundance andage trends as outlined by either the thin disk or the thick disk. we henceclaim that the major part of the hercules stream actually are thin and thickdisk stars. these diverse properties of the hercules stream point toward adynamical origin, probably caused by the galactic bar. however, we can at themoment not entirely rule out that the hercules stream could be the remnants ofa relatively recent merger event.

astro-ph;0703033	the survey for ionization in neutral-gas galaxies: iii. diffuse, warm  ionized medium and escape of ionizing radiation	we use the first data release from the singg h-alpha survey of hi-selectedgalaxies to study the quantitative behavior of the diffuse, warm ionized medium(wim) across the range of properties represented by these 109 galaxies. themean fraction f_wim of diffuse ionized gas in this sample is 0.59+/- 0.19,slightly higher than found in previous samples. since lower surface-brightnessgalaxies tend to have higher f_wim, we believe that most of this difference isdue to selection effects favoring large, optically-bright, nearby galaxies withhigh star-formation rates. as found in previous studies, there is noappreciable correlation with hubble type or total star-formation rate. however,we find that starburst galaxies, defined here by an h-alpha surface brightness&gt; 2.5x 10^39 erg s^-1 kpc^-2 within the h-alpha half-light radius, do show muchlower fractions of diffuse h-alpha emission. the cause apparently is notdominated by a lower fraction of field ob stars. however, it is qualitativelyconsistent with an expected escape of ionizing radiation above a thresholdstar-formation rate, predicted from our model in which the ism is shredded bypressure-driven supernova feedback. the hi gas fractions in the starburstgalaxies are also lower, suggesting that the starbursts are consuming andionizing all the gas, and thus promoting regions of density-bounded ionization.if true, these effects imply that some amount of lyman continuum radiation isescaping from most starburst galaxies, and that wim properties and outflowsfrom mechanical feedback are likely to be pressure-driven. however, in view ofprevious studies showing that the escape fraction of ionizing radiation isgenerally low, it is likely that other factors also drive the low fractions ofdiffuse ionized gas in starbursts.

astro-ph;0703036	massive stars: feedback effects in the local universe	we examine self-consistent parameterizations of the high-mass stellarpopulation and resulting feedback, including mechanical, radiative, andchemical feedback, as we understand them locally. to date, it appears that themassive star population follows simple power-law clustering that extends downto individual field ob stars, and the robust stellar imf seems to have aconstant upper-mass limit. these properties result in specific patterns in thehii region lf and ionization of the diffuse, warm ionized medium. the resultingsne generate superbubbles whose size distribution is also described by a simplepower law, and from which a galaxy's porosity parameter is easily derived. acritical star-formation threshold can then be estimated, above which the escapeof lyman continuum photons, hot gas, and nucleosynthetic products is predicted.a first comparison with a large h-alpha sample of galaxies is broadlyconsistent with this prediction, and suggests that ionizing photons likelyescapes from starburst galaxies. the superbubble size distribution also offersa basis for a simple inhomogeneous model for galactic chemical evolution, whichis especially relevant to metal-poor systems and instantaneous metallicitydistributions. this model offers an alternative interpretation of the galactichalo metallicity distribution and emphasizes the relative importance ofstar-formation intensity, in addition to age, in a system's evolution. thefraction of zero-metallicity, population iii stars is easily predicted for anysuch model. we emphasize that all these phenomena can be modeled in a simple,analytic framework over an extreme range in scale, offering powerful tools forunderstanding the role of massive stars in the cosmos.

astro-ph;9703104	the superbubble size distribution in the interstellar medium of galaxies	we use the standard, adiabatic shell evolution to predict the sizedistribution n(r) for populations of ob superbubbles in a uniform ism. wederive n(r) for simple cases of superbubble creation rate and mechanicalluminosity function (mlf). for r &lt; the characteristic radius r_e, n(r) isdominated by stalled objects, while for r&gt;r_e it is dominated by growingobjects. we also briefly investigate n(r) resulting from momentum-conservingshell evolution. we predict a peak in n(r) corresponding to individual snrs. toestimate the mlf, we also examine evolutionary effects on the hii regionluminosity function (hii lf), finding that for nebular luminosity fading as apower law in time, there is a minimum observed slope for the hii lfs.comparison with the largely complete hi hole catalog for the smc showssurprising agreement in the predicted and observed slope of n(r), suggestingthat no other fundamental process is needed to explain the size distribution ofshells in the smc. further comparison with largely incomplete hi data for m31,m33, and holmberg ii is also encouraging. we present expressions for the ismporosity parameters, and estimate that they are substantially &lt;1 for all of thegalaxies except holmberg ii. most of these galaxies therefore may not bestrongly dominated by a hot interstellar component. however, porosity resultsfor the galaxy remain inconclusive.

astro-ph;9712157	on the form of the hii region luminosity function	observed variations in the hii region luminosity function (hii lf) seen inspiral arm vs. interarm regions, and different galactic hubble type, can beexplained simply by evolutionary effects and maximum number of ionizing starsper cluster. we present monte carlo simulations of the hii lf, drawing thenumber of ionizing stars n_* from a power-law distribution of constant slope,and the stellar masses from a salpeter imf with an upper-mass limit of 100m_sol. we investigate the evolution of the hii lf, as determined by stellarmain-sequence lifetimes and ionizing luminosities, for a single burst case andcontinuous creation of the nebular population. shallower hii lf slopes measuredfor the arms of spiral galaxies can be explained as a composite slope, expectedfor a zero-age burst population, whereas the interarm regions tend to bedominated by evolved rich clusters described by a single, steeper slope.steeper slopes in earlier-type galaxies can be explained simply by a lowermaximum n_* cutoff found for the parent ob associations. the form of the hii lfcan reveal features of the most recent (~&lt; 10 myr) star formation history innearby galaxies.

astro-ph;9806009	shell formation and star formation in superbubble dem 192	was star formation in the ob associations, lh 51 and lh 54, triggered by thegrowth of the superbubble dem 192? to examine this possibility, we investigatethe stellar contents and star formation history, and model the evolution of theshell. h-r diagrams constructed from ubv photometry and spectralclassifications indicate highly coeval star formation, with the entire massivestar population having an age of ~&lt; 2-3 myr. however, lh 54 is constrained toan age of ~3 myr by the presence of a wr star, and the imf for lh 51 suggests alower-mass limit implying an age of 1-2 myr. there is no evidence of an earlierstellar population to create the superbubble, but the modeled shell kinematicsare consistent with an origin due to the strongest stellar winds of lh 54. itmight therefore be possible that lh 54 created the superbubble, which in turnmay have triggered the creation of lh 51. within the errors, the spatialdistribution of stellar masses and imf appear uniform within the associations.  we reinvestigate the estimates for stellar wind power l_w(t), during theh-burning phase, and note that revised mass-loss rates yield a significantlydifferent form for l_w(t), and may affect stellar evolution timescales. we alsomodel superbubble expansion into an ambient medium with a sudden, discontinuousdrop in density, and find that this can easily reproduce the anomalously highshell expansion velocities seen in many superbubbles.

astro-ph;9912363	calibration of nebular emission-line diagnostics: i. stellar effective  temperatures	we present a detailed comparison of optical h ii region spectra tophotoionization models based on modern stellar atmosphere models. we examineboth spatially resolved and integrated emission-line spectra of the hii regionsdem l323, dem l243, dem l199, and dem l301 in the large magellanic cloud. thepublished spectral classifications of the dominant stars range from o7 to wn3,and morphologies range from stromgren sphere to shell structure. two of theobjects include snr contamination. the overall agreement with the predictionsis generally within 0.2 dex for major diagnostic line ratios. an apparentpattern in the remaining discrepancies is that the predicted t_e is ~1000 khotter than observed. (abridged)  our analysis of the complex dem l199 allows a nebular emission-line test ofunprecedented detail for wr atmospheres. surprisingly, we find no nebular he ii4686 emission, despite the fact that both of the dominant wn3 stars should behot enough to fully ionize he i in their atmospheres.  we confirm that the \eta-prime emission-line parameter is not as useful ashoped for determining the ionizing stellar effective temperature, t*. bothempirically and theoretically, we find that it is insensitive for t* &gt;40 kk,and that it also varies spatially. the shock-contaminated objects show that\eta-prime will also yield a spuriously high t* in the presence of shocks. itis furthermore sensitive to shell morphology. we suggest [ne iii]/hb as anadditional probe of t*. although it is abundance-dependent, [ne iii]/hb hashigher sensitivity to t*, is independent of morphology, and is insensitive toshocks in our objects. we attempt a first empirical calibration of thesenebular diagnostics of t*.

0810.5062	the dependence of hii region properties on global and local surface  brightness within galaxy discs	using b, r, and h-alpha images of roughly equal-sized samples of low surfacebrightness (lsb) and high surface brightness (hsb) galaxies (~40 galaxiesapiece), we have explored the dependence of hii region properties on local andglobal disc surface brightness. we have done this by constructing co-added hiiregion luminosity functions (lfs) according to local and central disc surfacebrightness and fitting schechter functions to these lfs. the results show thatthe shape of the hii region lf within lsb galaxies does not change noticeablyas different limiting (i.e., mu&gt;mu_lim) local surface brightness values areused. however, the lfs for hsb galaxies have larger values of l_* and are lesssteep at the faint-end than those of lsb galaxies for limiting b-band localsurface brightness values as faint as mu_b,lim~23-24. both the lfs and the datafor individual hii regions show that luminous (log l&gt;39 ergs/s) hii regions aremuch more common within hsb discs than within lsb discs, implying that thenewly formed star clusters are also larger. taking this into account along withthe results of monte carlo simulations, the shapes of the lfs imply that theregions within lsb discs and those within the lsb areas of hsb discs arerelatively old (~5 myr) while the regions within hsb discs for mu_b&lt;24 aresignificantly younger (&lt;1 myr). since the majority of the lsb galaxies do nothave noticeable spiral arms and the majority of the hsb galaxies do, this mayindicate a transition within hsb discs from spiral arm-driven star formation toa more locally driven, possibly sporadic form of star formation at mu_b~24, atransition that does not appear to occur within lsb discs.
