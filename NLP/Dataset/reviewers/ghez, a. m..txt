0706.1782	a constant spectral index for sagittarius a* during infrared/x-ray  intensity variations	we report the first time-series of broadband infrared (ir) color measurementsof sgr a*, the variable emission source associated with the supermassive blackhole at the galactic center. using the laser and natural guide star ao systemson the keck ii telescope, we imaged sgr a* in multiple near-infrared broadbandfilters with a typical cycle time of ~3 min during 4 observing runs(2005-2006), two of which were simultaneous with chandra x-ray measurements. inspite of the large range of dereddened flux densities for sgr a* (2-30 mjy),all of our near-ir measurements are consistent with a constant spectral indexof alpha = -0.6+-0.2. furthermore, this value is consistent with the spectralindices observed at x-ray wavelengths during nearly all outbursts; which isconsistent with the synchrotron self-compton model for the production of thex-ray emission. during the coordinated observations, one ir outburst occurs &lt;36min after a possibly associated x-ray outburst, while several similar iroutbursts show no elevated x-ray emission. a variable x-ray to ir ratio andconstant infrared spectral index challenge the notion that the ir and x-rayemission are connected to the same electrons. we, therefore, posit that thepopulation of electrons responsible for both the ir and x-ray emission aregenerated by an acceleration mechanism that leaves the bulk of the electronenergy distribution responsible for the ir emission unchanged, but has avariable high-energy cutoff. occasionally a tail of electrons &gt;1 gev isgenerated, and it is this high-energy tail that gives rise to the x-rayoutbursts. one possible explanation for this type of variation is from theturbulence induced by a magnetorotational instability, in which the outer scalelength of the turbulence varies and changes the high-energy cutoff.

1001.4800	high precision dynamical masses of very low mass binaries	[abridged] we present the results of a 3 year monitoring program of a sampleof very low mass (vlm) field binaries using both astrometric and spectroscopicdata obtained in conjunction with the laser guide star adaptive optics systemon the w.m. keck ii 10 m telescope. fifteen systems have undergone sufficientorbital motion, allowing us to derive their relative orbital parameters andhence their total system mass. these measurements triple the number of massesfor vlm objects. among the 11 systems with both astrometric and spectroscopicmeasurements, six have sufficient radial velocity variations to allow us toobtain individual component masses. this is the first derivation of thecomponent masses for five of these systems. altogether, the orbital solutionsof these low mass systems show a correlation between eccentricity and orbitalperiod, consistent with their higher mass counterparts. in our primaryanalysis, we find that there are systematic discrepancies between our dynamicalmass measurements and the predictions of theoretical evolutionary models(tucson and lyon) with both models either underpredicting or overpredicting themost precisely determined dynamical masses. these discrepancies are a functionof spectral type, with late m through mid l systems tending to have theirmasses underpredicted, while one t type system has its mass overpredicted.these discrepancies imply that either the temperatures predicted byevolutionary and atmosphere models are inconsistent for an object of a givenmass, or the mass-radius relationship or cooling timescales predicted by theevolutionary models are incorrect. if these spectral type trends hold into theplanetary mass regime, the implication is that the masses of directly imagedextrasolar planets are overpredicted by the evolutionary models.

1004.1436	ultracool field brown dwarf candidates selected at 4.5 microns	we have identified a sample of cool field brown dwarf candidates using iracdata from the spitzer deep, wide-field survey (sdwfs). the candidates wereselected from 400,000 sdwfs sources with [4.5] &lt;= 18.5 mag and required to have[3.6]-[4.5] &gt;= 1.5 and [4.5] - [8.0] &lt;= 2.0 on the vega system. the first colorrequirement selects objects redder than all but a handful of presently knownbrown dwarfs with spectral classes later than t7, while the second eliminates14 probable reddened agn. optical detection of 4 of the remaining 18 sourcesimplies they are likely also agn, leaving 14 brown dwarf candidates. for two ofthe brightest candidates (sdwfs j143524.44+335334.6 and sdwfsj143222.82+323746.5), the spectral energy distributions including near-infrareddetections suggest a spectral class of ~ t8. the proper motion is &lt; 0.25 "/yr,consistent with expectations for a luminosity inferred distance of &gt;70 pc. thereddest brown dwarf candidate (sdwfs j143356.62+351849.2) has [3.6] -[4.5]=2.24 and h - [4.5] &gt; 5.7, redder than any published brown dwarf in thesecolors, and may be the first example of the elusive y-dwarf spectral class.models from burrows et al. (2003) predict larger numbers of cool brown dwarfsshould be found for a chabrier (2003) mass function. suppressing the model[4.5] flux by a factor of two, as indicated by previous work, brings theburrows models and observations into reasonable agreement. the recentlylaunched wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise) will probe a volume ~40xlarger and should find hundreds of brown dwarfs cooler than t7.

1008.1727	probing local density inhomogeneities in the circumstellar disk of a be  star using the new spectro-astrometry mode at the keck interferometer	we report on the successful science verification phase of a new observingmode at the keck interferometer, which provides a line-spread function widthand sampling of 150km/s at k'-band, at a current limiting magnitude of k'~7magwith spatial resolution of lam/2b ~2.7mas and a measured differential phasestability of unprecedented precision (3mrad at k=5mag, which represents 3uas onsky or a centroiding precision of 10^-3). the scientific potential of this modeis demonstrated by the presented observations of the circumstellar disk of theevolved be-star 48lib. in addition to indirect methods such as multi-wavelengthspectroscopy and polaritmetry, the here described spectro-interferometricastrometry provides a new tool to directly constrain the radial densitystructure in the disk. we resolve for the first time several pfund emissionlines, in addition to brgam, in a single interferometric spectrum, and withadequate spatial and spectral resolution and precision to analyze the radialdisk structure in 48lib. the data suggest that the continuum and pf-emissionoriginates in significantly more compact regions, inside of the brgam emissionzone. thus, spectro-interferometric astrometry opens the opportunity todirectly connect the different observed line profiles of brgam and pfund in thetotal and correlated flux to different disk radii. the gravitational potentialof a rotationally flattened be star is expected to induce a one-armed densityperturbation in the circumstellar disk. such a slowly rotating disk oscillationhas been used to explain the well known periodic v/r spectral profilevariability in these stars, as well as the observed v/r cycle phase shiftsbetween different disk emission lines. the differential line properties andlinear constraints set by our data lend support to the existence of aradius-dependent disk density perturbation.

0710.0827	multiple protostellar systems. ii. a high resolution near-infrared  imaging survey in nearby star-forming regions	(abridged) our project endeavors to obtain a robust view of multiplicityamong embedded class i and flat spectrum protostars in a wide array of nearbymolecular clouds to disentangle ``universal'' from cloud-dependent processes.we have used near-infrared adaptive optics observations at the vlt through theh, ks and l' filters to search for tight companions to 45 class i and flatspectrum protostars located in 4 different molecular clouds (taurus-auriga,ophiuchus, serpens and l1641 in orion). we complemented these observations withpublished high-resolution surveys of 13 additional objects in taurus andophiuchus. we found multiplicity rates of 32+/-6% and 47+/-8% over the 45-1400au and 14-1400 au separation ranges, respectively. these rates are in excellentagreement with those previously found among t tauri stars in taurus andophiuchus, and represent an excess of a factor ~1.7 over the multiplicity rateof solar-type field stars. we found no non-hierarchical triple systems, nor anyquadruple or higher-order systems. no significant cloud-to-cloud difference hasbeen found, except for the fact that all companions to low-mass orionprotostars are found within 100 au of their primaries whereas companions foundin other clouds span the whole range probed here. based on this survey, weconclude that core fragmentation always yields a high initial multiplicityrate, even in giant molecular clouds such as the orion cloud or in clusteredstellar populations as in serpens, in contrast with predictions of numericalsimulations. the lower multiplicity rate observed in clustered class ii andclass iii populations can be accounted for by a universal set of properties foryoung systems and subsequent ejections through close encounters with unrelatedcluster members.

1202.5555	rotational velocities of individual components in very low mass binaries	we present rotational velocities for individual components of eleven very lowmass (vlm) binaries with spectral types between m7 and l7.5. these results arebased on observations taken with the near-infrared spectrograph, nirspec, andthe keck ii laser guide star adaptive optics (lgs ao) system. we find that theobserved sources tend to be rapid rotators (vsini &gt; 10 km/s), consistent withprevious seeing-limited measurements of vlm objects. the two sources with thelargest vsini, lp 349-25b and hd 130948c, are rotating at ~30% of their breakup speed, and are among the most rapidly rotating vlm objects known.furthermore, five binary systems, all with orbital semi-major axes &lt;3.5 au,have component vsini values that differ by greater than 3sigma. to bring thebinary components with discrepant rotational velocities into agreement wouldrequire the rotational axes to be inclined with respect to each other, and thatat least one component is inclined with respect to the orbital plane.alternatively, each component could be rotating at a different rate, eventhough they have similar spectral types. both differing rotational velocitiesand inclinations have implications for binary star formation and evolution. wealso investigate possible dynamical evolution in the triple system hd130948a-bc. the close binary brown dwarfs b and c have significantly differentvsini values. we demonstrate that components b and c could have been torquedinto misalignment by the primary star, a, via orbital precession. such ascenario can also be applied to another triple system in our sample, gj569a-bab. interactions such as these may play an important role in thedynamical evolution of very low mass binaries. finally, we note that two of thebinaries with large differences in component vsini, lp 349-25ab and 2mass0746+20ab, are also known radio sources.

1206.1364	disentangling confused stars at the galactic center with long baseline  infrared interferometry	we present simulations of keck interferometer astra and vlti gravityobservations of mock star fields in orbit within ~50 milliarcseconds of sgr a*.dual-field phase referencing techniques, as implemented on astra and plannedfor gravity, will provide the sensitivity to observe sgr a* with infraredinterferometers. our results show an improvement in the confusion noise limitover current astrometric surveys, opening a window to study stellar sources inthe region. since the keck interferometer has only a single baseline, theimprovement in the confusion limit depends on source position angles. thegravity instrument will yield a more compact and symmetric psf, providing animprovement in confusion noise which will not depend as strongly on positionangle. our keck results show the ability to characterize the star field ascontaining zero, few, or many bright stellar sources. we are also able todetect and track a source down to mk~18 through the least confused regions ofour field of view at a precision of ~200 microarcseconds along the baselinedirection. this level of precision improves with source brightness. our gravityresults show the potential to detect and track multiple sources in the field.gravity will perform ~10 microarcsecond astrometry on a mk=16.3 source and ~200microarcsecond astrometry on a mk=18.8 source in six hours of monitoring acrowded field. monitoring the orbits of several stars will provide the abilityto distinguish between multiple post-newtonian orbital effects, including thosedue to an extended mass distribution around sgr a* and to low-order generalrelativistic effects. early characterizations of the field by astra includingthe possibility of a precise source detection, could provide valuableinformation for future gravity implementation and observation.

1208.3466	adaptive optics observations of the galactic center young stars	adaptive optics observations have dramatically improved the quality andversatility of high angular resolution measurements of the center of ourgalaxy. in this paper, we quantify the quality of our adaptive opticsobservations and report on the astrometric precision for the young stellarpopulation that appears to reside in a stellar disk structure in the centralparsec. we show that with our improved astrometry and a 16 year baseline,including 10 years of speckle and 6 years of laser guide star ao imaging, wereliably detect accelerations in the plane of the sky as small as 70microarcsec/yr/yr (~2.5 km/s/yr) and out to a projected radius from thesupermassive black hole of 1.5" (~0.06 pc). with an increase in sensitivity toaccelerations by a factor of ~6 over our previous efforts, we are able todirectly probe the kinematic structure of the young stellar disk, which appearsto have an inner radius of 0.8". we find that candidate disk members are oneccentric orbits, with a mean eccentricity of &lt; e &gt; = 0.30 +/- 0.07. sucheccentricities cannot be explained by the relaxation of a circular disk with anormal initial mass function, which suggests the existence of a top-heavy imfor formation in an initially eccentric disk.

1304.5280	keck observations of the galactic center source g2: gas cloud or star?	we present new observations and analysis of g2 - the intriguing redemission-line object which is quickly approaching the galaxy's central blackhole. the observations were obtained with the laser guide star adaptive opticssystems on the w. m. keck i and ii telescopes and include spectroscopy (r ~3600) centered on the hydrogen br-gamma line as well as k' (2.1 micrometer) andl' (3.8 micrometer) imaging. analysis of these observations shows the br-gammaline emission has a positional offset from the l' continuum. this offset islikely due to background source confusion at l'. we therefore present the firstorbital solution derived from br-gamma line astrometry, which when coupled withradial velocity measurements, results in a later time of closest approach(2014.21 +/- 0.14), closer periastron (130 au, 1900rs), and higher eccentricity(0.9814 +/- 0.0060) compared to a solution using l' astrometry. the new orbitcasts doubt on previous associations of g2 and a low surface brightness "tail".it is shown that g2 has no k' counterpart down to k' ~ 20 mag. g2's l'continuum and the br-gamma line-emission is unresolved in almost all epochs;however it is marginally extended in our highest quality br-gamma data set from2006 and exhibits a clear velocity gradient at that time. while theobservations altogether suggest that g2 has a gaseous component which istidally interacting with the central black hole, there is likely a central starproviding the self-gravity necessary to sustain the compact nature of thisobject.

1306.4122	substellar multiplicity in the hyades cluster	we present the first high-angular resolution survey for multiple systemsamong very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the hyades open cluster. usingthe keck\,ii adaptive optics system, we observed a complete sample of 16objects with estimated masses $\lesssim$0.1 msun. we have identified threeclose binaries with projected separation $\lesssim$0.11", or $\lesssim$5 au. anumber of wide, mostly faint candidate companions are also detected in ourimages, most of which are revealed as unrelated background sources based onastrometric and/or photometric considerations. the derived multiplicityfrequency, 19+13/-6 % over the 2-350 au range, and the rarity of systems widerthan 10 au are both consistent with observations of field very low-massobjects. in the limited 3-50 au separation range, the companion frequency isessentially constant from brown dwarfs to solar-type stars in the hyadescluster, which is also in line with our current knowledge for field stars.combining the binaries discovered in this surveys with those already known inthe pleiades cluster reveals that very low-mass binaries in open clusters, aswell as in star-forming regions, are skewed toward lower mass ratios ($0.6\lesssim q \lesssim 0.8$) than are their field counterparts, a result thatcannot be accounted for by selection effects. although the possibility ofsevere systematic errors in model-based mass estimates for very low-mass starscannot be completely excluded, it is unlikely to explain this difference. wespeculate that this trend indicates that surveys among very low-mass fieldstars may have missed a substantial population of intermediate mass ratiosystems, implying that these systems are more common and more diverse thanpreviously thought.

1307.2299	stellar and circumstellar properties of visual binaries in the orion  nebula cluster	our general understanding of multiple star and planet formation is primarilybased on observations of young multiple systems in low density regions liketau-aur and oph. since many, if not most, of the stars are born in clusters,observational constraints from young binaries in those environments arefundamental for understanding both the formation of multiple systems andplanets in multiple systems throughout the galaxy. we build upon the largestsurvey for young binaries in the orion nebula cluster (onc) which is based onhubble space telescope observations to derive both stellar and circumstellarproperties of newborn binary systems in this cluster environment. we presentadaptive optics spatially-resolved jhkl'-band photometry and k-bandr$\sim$\,5000 spectra for a sample of 8 onc binary systems from this database.we characterize the stellar properties of binary components and obtain a censusof protoplanetary disks through k-l' color excess. for a combined sample of oncbinaries including 7 additional systems with nir spectroscopy from theliterature, we derive mass ratio and relative age distributions. we compare thestellar and circumstellar properties of binaries in onc with those in tau-aurand oph from samples of binaries with stellar properties derived for eachcomponent from spectra and/or visual photometry and with a disk census obtainedthrough k-l color excess. the mass ratio distribution of onc binaries is foundto be indistinguishable from that of tau-aur and, to some extent, to that ofoph in the separation range 85-560\,au and for primary mass in the range 0.15to 0.8\,m$_{\sun}$.a trend toward a lower mass ratio with larger separation issuggested in onc binaries which is not seen in tau-aur binaries.the componentsof onc binaries are found to be significantly more coeval than the overall oncpopulation and as coeval as components of binaries in tau-aur and oph[...]

1403.5289	a formal method for identifying distinct states of variability in  time-varying sources: sgra* as an example	continuously time variable sources are often characterized by their powerspectral density and flux distribution. these quantities can undergo dramaticchanges over time if the underlying physical processes change. however, somechanges can be subtle and not distinguishable using standard statisticalapproaches. here, we report a methodology that aims to identify distinct butsimilar states of time variability. we apply this method to the galacticsupermassive black hole, where 2.2 um flux is observed from a source associatedwith sgra*, and where two distinct states have recently been suggested. ourapproach is taken from mathematical finance and works with conditional fluxdensity distributions that depend on the previous flux value. the discrete,unobserved (hidden) state variable is modeled as a stochastic process and thetransition probabilities are inferred from the flux density time series. usingthe most comprehensive data set to date, in which all keck and a majority ofthe publicly available vlt data have been merged, we show that sgra* issufficiently described by a single intrinsic state. however the observed fluxdensities exhibit two states: a noise-dominated and a source-dominated one. ourmethodology reported here will prove extremely useful to assess the effects ofthe putative gas cloud g2 that is on its way toward the black hole and mightcreate a new state of variability.

astro-ph;0011135	keck diffraction-limited imaging of the young quadruple star system hd  98800	this paper presents diffraction-limited 1-18 micron images of the youngquadruple star system hd 98800 obtained with the w. m. keck 10-m telescopesusing speckle and adaptive optics imaging at near-ir wavelengths and directimaging at mid-ir wavelengths. the two components of the visual binary, a andb, both themselves spectroscopic binaries, were separable at all wavelengths,allowing us to determine their stellar and circumstellar properties. combiningthese observations with spectroscopic data from the literature, we derive anage of 10 myr, masses of 0.93 and 0.64 m_sun and an inclination angle of 58 degfor the spectroscopic components of hd 98800 b, and an age of 10 myr and a massof 1.1 m_sun for hd 98800 aa. our data confirm that the large mid-ir excess isentirely associated with hd 98800 b. this excess exhibits a black bodytemperature of 150 k and a strong 10 micron silicate emission feature. thetheoretical equilibrium radius of large, perfectly absorbing, 150 k grainsaround hd 98800 b is 2.4 au, suggesting a circum-spectroscopic binarydistribution. our observations set important upper limits on the size of theinner dust radius of ~2 au (mid-ir data) and on the quantity of scattered lightof &lt;10% (h-band data). for an inner radius of 2 au, the dust distribution musthave a height of at least 1 au to account for the fractional dust luminosity of\~20% l_b. based on the scattered light limit, the dust grains responsible forthe excess emission must have an albedo of &lt;0.33. the presence of the prominentsilicate emission feature at 10 microns implies dust grain radii of &gt;2 microns.the total mass of the dust, located in a circumbinary disk around the hd 98800b, is &gt;0.002 m_earth. the orbital dynamics of the a-b pair are likelyresponsible for the disk geometry.

astro-ph;0103098	observational constraints on the formation and evolution of binary stars	we present a high spatial resolution uv to nir survey of 44 young binarystars in taurus with separations of 10-1000 au. the primary results include:(1) the relative ages of binary star components are more similar than therelative ages of randomly paired single stars, supporting coeval formation. (2)only one of the companion masses is substellar, and hence the apparentoverabundance of t tauri star companions relative to main-sequence starcompanions can not be explained by a wealth of substellar secondaries thatwould have been missed in main-sequence surveys. (3) roughly 10% of t tauribinary star components have very red nir colors (k-l &gt; 1.4) and unusually highmass accretion rates. this phenomenon does not appear to be restricted tobinary systems, however, since a comparable fraction of single t tauri starsexhibit the same properties. (4) although the disk lifetimes of single starsare roughly equal to their stellar ages, the disk lifetimes of binary stars arean order of magnitude less than their ages. (5) the accretion rates for bothsingle and binary t tauri stars appear to be moderately mass dependent. (6)although most classical t tauri star binaries retain both a circumprimary and acircumsecondary disk, there are several systems with only a circumprimary disk.together with the relative accretion rates, this suggests that circumprimarydisks survive longer, on average, than circumsecondary disks. (7) the disklifetimes, mass ratios, and relative accretion signatures of the closestbinaries (10-100 au) suggest that they are being replenished from acircumbinary reservoir with low angular momentum. overall, these resultssupport fragmentation as the dominant binary star formation mechanism.

astro-ph;0112103	resolved near-infrared spectroscopy of the mysterious pre-main sequence  binary systems t tau s	we obtained new near-infrared images of the prototypical pre-main sequencetriple system t tau, as well as the first resolved medium-resolution spectra ofthe close pair t tau s. at the time of our observations, the tight binary had a13 au projected separation and showed significant motion since its discovery,three years before. the orbit cannot be strongly constrained yet, but theobserved motion of t tau sb with respect to t tau sa suggests that the systemis at least as massive as t tau n itself. this may indicate that t tau n is notthe most massive star in the system. the spectrum of t tau sa, which is totallyfeatureless except for a strong br gamma emission line, identifies thiscomponent with the ``infrared companion'', whose exact nature remains obscurebut may be the consequence of it being the most massive component of thesystem. contrasting sharply with t tau sa, the spectrum of t tau sb showsnumerous photospheric features consistent with an early-m spectral type. thepresence of a strong br gamma emission line and of a significant veilingcontinuum classifies this object as a deeply embedded t tauri star. from theseobservations, we conclude that both components of t tau s are embedded in theirown dense circumstellar cocoon of material, which are probably fed by a muchmore extended structure.

astro-ph;0204372	spatially resolved observations of the galactic center source, irs 21	we present diffraction-limited 2-25 micron images obtained with the w. m.keck 10-m telescopes that spatially resolve the cool source, irs 21, one of asmall group of enigmatic objects in the central parsec of our galaxy that haveeluded classification. modeled as a gaussian, the azimuthally-averagedintensity profile of irs 21 has a half-width half-maximum (hwhm) size of650+/-80 au at 2.2 microns and an average hwhm size of 1600+/-200 au atmid-infrared wavelengths. these large apparent sizes imply an extendeddistribution of dust. the mid-infrared color map indicates that irs 21 is aself-luminous source rather than an externally heated dust clump as originallysuggested. the spectral energy distribution has distinct near- and mid-infraredcomponents. a simple radiative transfer code, which simultaneously fits thenear- and mid- infrared photometry and intensity profiles, supports a model inwhich the near-infrared radiation is scattered and extincted light from anembedded central source, while the mid-infrared emission is from thermallyre-radiating silicate dust. we argue that irs 21 (and by analogy the otherluminous sources along the northern arm) is a massive star experiencing rapidmass loss and plowing through the northern arm, thereby generating a bow shock,which is spatially resolved in our observations.

astro-ph;0204465	nicmos images of the gg tau circumbinary disk	we present deep, near-infrared images of the circumbinary disk surroundingthe pre-main-sequence binary star, gg tau a, obtained with nicmos aboard thehubble space telescope. the spatially resolved proto-planetary disk scattersroughly 1.5% of the stellar flux, with a near-to-far side flux ratio of ~1.4,independent of wavelength, and colors that are comparable to the centralsource; all of these properties are significantly different from the earlierground-based observations. new monte carlo scattering simulations of the diskemphasize that the general properties of the disk, such as disk flux, near sideto far side flux ratio and integrated colors, can be approximately reproducedusing ism-like dust grains, without the presence of either circumstellar disksor large dust grains, as had previously been suggested. a single parameterphase function is fitted to the observed azimuthal variation in disk flux,providing a lower limit on the median grain size of 0.23 micron. our analysis,in comparison to previous simulations, shows that the major limitation to thestudy of grain growth in t tauri disk systems through scattered light lies inthe uncertain ism dust grain properties. finally, we use the 9 year baseline ofastrometric measurements of the binary to solve the complete orbit, assumingthat the binary is coplanar with the circumbinary ring. we find that theestimated 1 sigma range on disk inner edge to semi-major axis ratio, 3.2 &lt;rin/a &lt; 6.7, is larger than that estimated by previous sph simulations ofbinary-disk interactions.

astro-ph;0208239	limits on the short term variability of sagittarius a* in the  near-infrared	the recent detection of a 3-hr x-ray flare by the chandra observatory hasraised the possibility of enhanced emission over a broad range of wavelengthsfrom sgr a*, the suspected 2.6 x 10^6 solar mass black hole at the galacticcenter, during a flaring event. we have, therefore, reconstructed 3-hr datasets from 2 micron speckle and adaptive optics images (theta_core = 50 - 100mas) obtained with the w. m. keck 10-m telescopes between 1995 and 2001. in 25separate observations, no evidence of any significant excess emissionassociated with sgr a* was detected. the lowest of our detection limits givesan observed limit for the quiescent state of sgr a* of 0.09+/-0.005 mjy, or,equivalently, a dereddened value of 2.0+/-0.1 mjy, which is a factor of 2 lowerthan the best previously published quiescent value. under the assumption thatthere are random 3-hr flares producing both enhanced x-ray and near-infraredemission, our highest limit constrains the variable state of sgr a* to &lt;0.8 mjy(observed) or 19 mjy (dereddened). these results suggest that the model favoredby markoff et al. (2001), in which the flare is produced through local heatingof relativistic particles surrounding sgr a* (e.g., a sudden magneticreconnection event), is unlikely, because it predicts peak 2 micron emission of300 mjy, well above our detection limit.

astro-ph;0302299	the first measurement of spectral lines in a short-period star bound to  the galaxy's central black hole: a paradox of youth	we have obtained the first detection of spectral absorption lines in one ofthe high-velocity stars in the vicinity of the galaxy's central supermassiveblack hole. both brgamma (2.1661 micron) and he i (2.1126 micron) are seen inabsorption in s0-2 with equivalent widths (2.8+-0.3 ang &amp; 1.7+-0.4 ang) and aninferred stellar rotational velocity (220+-40 km/s) that are consistent withthat of an o8-b0 dwarf, which suggests that it is a massive (~15 msun), young(&lt;10 myr) main sequence star. this presents a major challenge to star formationtheories, given the strong tidal forces that prevail over all distances reachedby s0-2 in its current orbit (130 - 1900 au) and the difficulty in migratingthis star inward during its lifetime from further out where tidal forces shouldno longer preclude star formation. the radial velocity measurements (-510+-40km/s) and our reported proper motions for s0-2 strongly constrain its orbit,providing a direct measure of the black hole mass of 4.1(+-0.6)x10^6(ro/8kpc)^3msun. the keplerian orbit parameters have uncertainities that are reduced by afactor of 2-3 compared to previously reported values and include, for the firsttime, an independent solution for the dynamical center; this location, whileconsistent with the nominal infrared position of sgr a*, is localized to afactor of 5 more precisely (+-2 milli-arcsec). furthermore, the ambiguity inthe inclination of the orbit is resolved with the addition of the radialvelocity measurement, indicating that the star is behind the black hole at thetime of closest approach and counter-revolving against the galaxy. with furtherradial velocity measurements in the next few years, the orbit of s0-2 willprovide the most robust estimate of the distance to the galactic center.

astro-ph;0303151	full three dimensional orbits for multiple stars on close approaches to  the central supermassive black hole	with the advent of adaptive optics on the w. m. keck 10 m telescope, twosignificant steps forward have been taken in building the case for asupermassive black hole at the center of the milky way and understanding theblack hole's effect on its environment. using adaptive optics and speckleimaging to study the motions of stars in the plane of sky with +-~2 masprecision over the past 7 years, we have obtained the first simultaneousorbital solution for multiple stars. among the included stars, three are newlyidentified (s0-16, s0-19, s0-20). the most dramatic orbit is that of the newlyidentified star s0-16, which passed a mere 60 au from the central dark mass ata velocity of 9,000 km/s in 1999. the orbital analysis results in a new centraldark mass estimate of 3.6(+-0.4)x10^6(d/8kpc)^3 mo. this dramaticallystrengthens the case for a black hole at the center of our galaxy, by confiningthe dark matter to within a radius of 0.0003 pc or 1,000 rsh and therebyincreasing the inferred dark mass density by four orders of magnitude comparedto earlier estimates.  with the introduction of an adaptive-optics-fed spectrometer, we haveobtained the spectra of these high-velocity stars, which suggest that they aremassive (~15 mo), young (&lt;10 myr) main sequence stars. this presents a majorchallenge to star formation theories, given the strong tidal forces thatprevail over all distances reached by these stars in their current orbits andthe difficulty in migrating these stars inward during their lifetime fromfurther out where tidal forces should no longer preclude star formation.

0808.2870	measuring distance and properties of the milky way's central  supermassive black hole with stellar orbits	we report new precision measurements of the properties of our galaxy'ssupermassive black hole. based on astrometric (1995-2007) and radial velocity(2000-2007) measurements from the w. m. keck 10-meter telescopes, a fullyunconstrained keplerian orbit for the short period star s0-2 provides valuesfor ro of 8.0+-0.6 kpc, m_bh of 4.1+-0.6x10^6 mo, and the black hole's radialvelocity, which is consistent with zero with 30 km/s uncertainty. if the blackhole is assumed to be at rest with respect to the galaxy, we can furtherconstrain the fit and obtain ro = 8.4+-0.4 kpc and m_bh = 4.5+-0.4x10^6 mo.more complex models constrain the extended dark mass distribution to be lessthan 3-4x10^5 mo within 0.01 pc, ~100x higher than predictions from stellar andstellar remnant models. for all models, we identify transient astrometricshifts from source confusion and the assumptions regarding the black hole'sradial motion as previously unrecognized limitations on orbital accuracy andthe usefulness of fainter stars. future astrometric and rv observations willremedy these effects. our estimates of ro and the galaxy's local rotationspeed, which it is derived from combining ro with the apparent proper motion ofsgr a*, (theta0 = 229+-18 km/s), are compatible with measurements made usingother methods. the increased black hole mass found in this study, compared tothat determined using projected mass estimators, implies a longer period forthe innermost stable orbit, longer resonant relaxation timescales for stars inthe vicinity of the black hole and a better agreement with the m_bh-sigmarelation.

astro-ph;0503572	a remarkable low-mass x-ray binary within 0.1 pc of the galactic center	recent x-ray and radio observations have identified a transient low-massx-ray binary (lmxb) located only 0.1 pc in projection from the galactic center,cxogc j174540.0-290031. in this paper, we report the detailed analysis of x-rayand infrared observations of the transient and its surroundings. chandrabservations detect the source at a flux of f_x = 2e-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (2-8kev). after accounting for absorption both in the interstellar medium and inmaterial local to the source, the implied luminosity of the source is only l_x= 4e34 erg/s (2-8 kev; d=8 kpc). however, the diffuse x-ray emission near thesource also brightened by a factor of 2. the enhanced diffuse x-ray emissionlies on top of a known ridge of dust and ionized gas that is visible infraredimages. we interpret the x-ray emission as scattered flux from the outburst,and determine that the peak luminosity of cxogc j174540.0-290031 was &gt;2e36erg/s. we suggest that the relatively small observed flux results from the factthat the system is observed nearly edge-on, so that the accretion diskintercepts most of the flux emitted along our line of sight. we compare theinferred peak x-ray luminosity to that of the radio jet. the ratio of the x-rayto radio luminosities, l_x/l_r&lt;1e4, is considerably smaller than in other knownlmxbs (&gt; 1e5). this is probably because the jets are radiating with unusuallyhigh efficiency at the point where they impact the surrounding interstellarmedium. this hypothesis is supported by a comparison with mid-infrared imagesof the surrounding dust. finally, we find that the minimum power required toproduce the jet, l_jet~1e37 erg/s, is comparable to the inferred peak x-rayluminosity. this is the most direct evidence yet obtained that lmxbs accretingat low rates release about half of their energy as jets.

astro-ph;0504276	irs 16sw - a new comoving group of young stars in the central parsec of  the milky way	one of the most perplexing problems associated with the supermassive blackhole at the center of our galaxy is the origin of the young stars in its closevicinity. using proper motion measurements and stellar number density countsbased on 9 years of diffraction-limited k(2.2 micron)-band speckle imaging atthe w. m. keck 10-meter telescopes, we have identified a new comoving group ofstars, which we call the irs 16sw comoving group, located 1.9" (0.08 pc, inprojection) from the central black hole. four of the five members of thiscomoving group have been spectroscopically identified as massive young stars,specifically he i emission-line stars and obn stars. this is the second youngcomoving group within the central parsec of the milky way to be recognized andis the closest, by a factor of 2, in projection to the central black hole.these comoving groups may be the surviving cores of massive infalling starclusters that are undergoing disruption in the strong tidal field of thecentral supermassive black hole.

astro-ph;0504352	the circumstellar environment of t tau s at high spatial and spectral  resolution	we have obtained the first high spatial (0.05'') and spectral (r~35000)resolution 2 micron spectrum of the t tau s tight binary system using adaptiveoptics on the keck ii telescope. we have also obtained the first 3.8 and 4.7micron images that resolve the three components of the t tau multiple system,as well as new 1.6 and 2.2 micron images. together with its very rednear-infrared colors, the spectrum of t tau sb shows that this t tauri star isextincted by a roughly constant extinction of av~15 mag, which is probably the0.7''x0.5'' circumbinary structure recently observed in absorption in theultraviolet. t tau sa, which is also observed through this screen and isactively accreting, further possesses a small edge-on disk that is evidenced bywarm (390 k), narrow overtone co rovibrational absorption features in ourspectrum. we find that t tau sa is most likely an intermediate-mass starsurrounded by a semi-transparent 2-3 au-radius disk whose asymmetries and shortkeplerian rotation explain the large photometric variability of the source onrelatively short timescales. we also show that molecular hydrogen emissionexclusively arises from the gas that surrounds t tau s and that its spatial andkinematic structure, while providing suggestive evidence for a jet-likestructure, is highly complex.

astro-ph;0508664	the first laser guide star adaptive optics observations of the galactic  center: sgr a*'s infrared color and the extended red emission in its vicinity	(abridged) we present the first laser guide star adaptive optics (lgs-ao)observations of the galactic center. lgs-ao has dramatically improved thequality, robustness, and versatility with which high angular resolutioninfrared images of the galactic center can be obtained with the w. m. keck ii10-meter telescope. specifically, strehl ratios of 0.7 and 0.3 at l'[3.8micron] and k'[2.1 micron], respectively, are achieved in these lgs-ao images.during our observations, the infrared counterpart to the central supermassiveblack hole, sgr a*-ir, showed significant infrared intensity variations, withobserved l' magnitudes ranging from 12.6 to 14.5 mag. the faintest end of ourl' detections, 1.3 mjy (dereddened), is the lowest level of emission yetobserved for this source by a factor of 3. no significant variation in thelocation of sgra*-ir is detected as a function of either wavelength orintensity. near a peak in its intensity, we obtained the first measurement ofsgra*-ir's k'-l' color (3.0 +- 0.2 mag, observed), which corresponds to anintrinsic spectral index of -0.5 +- 0.3. this is significantly bluer than otherrecent infrared measurements. because our measurement was taken at a time whensgr a* was ~6 times brighter in the infrared than the other measurements, weposit that the spectral index of the emission arising from the vicinity of ourgalaxy's central black hole may depend on the strength of the flare, withstronger flares giving rise to a higher fraction of high energy electrons inthe emitting region.

astro-ph;0509728	investigating disk evolution: a high spatial resolution mid-infrared  survey of t tauri stars	we present a high spatial resolution, 10-20 micron survey of 65 t tauribinary stars in taurus, ophiuchus, and corona australis using the keck 10 mtelescopes. designed to probe the inner ~1 au region of the circumstellar disksaround the individual stellar components in these binary systems, this studyincreases the number of binaries with spatially resolved measurements at 10micron by a factor of ~5. combined with resolved near-infrared photometry andspectroscopic accretion diagnostics, we find that ~10% of stars with amid-infrared excess do not appear to be accreting. in contrast to an activelyaccreting disk system, these passive disks have significantly lowernear-infrared colors that are, in most cases, consistent with photosphericemission, suggesting the presence of an inner disk hole. in addition, thereappears to be a spectral type/mass dependence associated with the presence of apassive disk, with all passive disks occurring around m type stars. thepossibility that the passive disks are caused by the presence of an as yetundetected companion at a small separation (0.3-3 au) is possible for anyindividual system, however, it cannot account for the spectral type dependenceof the passive disk sample as a whole. we propose that these passive disksrepresent a subset of t tauri stars that are undergoing significant diskevolution. the fraction of observed passive disks and the observed spectraltype dependence can both be explained by models of disk evolution that includedisk photoevaporation from the central star.

astro-ph;0608018	accurate stellar masses in the multiple system t tau	the goal of this study is to obtain accurate estimates for the individualmasses of the components of the tight binary system t tau s in order to settlethe ongoing debate on the nature of t tau sa, a so-called infrared companion.we take advantage of the fact that t tau s belongs to a triple system composedof two hierarchical orbits to simultaneously analyze the motion of t tau sb inthe rest frames of t tau sa and t tau n. with this method, it is possible topinpoint the location of the center of mass of t tau s and, thereby, todetermine individual masses for t tau sa and t tau sb with no prior assumptionabout the mass/flux ratio of the system. this improvement over previous studiesof the system results in much better constraints on orbital parameters. we findindividual masses of 2.73+/-0.31 msun for t tau sa and of 0.61+/-0.17 msun fort tau sb (in agreement with its early-m spectral type), including theuncertainty on the distance to the system. these are among the most preciseestimates of the mass of any pre-main sequence star, a remarkable result sincethis is the first system in which individual masses of t tauri stars can bedetermined from astrometry only. this model-independent analysis confirms thatt tau sa is an intermediate-mass star, presumably a very young herbig ae star,that may possess an almost edge-on disk.

astro-ph;0703567	new very low mass binaries in the taurus star-forming region	we surveyed thirteen very low mass (vlm; m &lt; 0.2 m_sun) objects in the taurusstar-forming region using near-infrared diffraction-limited imaging techniqueson the w.m. keck i 10 m telescope. of these thirteen, five were found to bebinary, with separations ranging from 0.04" to 0.6" and flux ratios from 1.4 to3.7. in all cases, the companions are likely to be physically associated withthe primaries (probability &gt; 4-sigma). using the theoretical models of baraffeet al. (1998), we find that all five new companions, as well as one of theprimaries, are likely brown dwarfs. the discovery of these systems thereforeincreases the total number of known, young vlm binaries by ~50%. these newsystems, along with other young vlm binaries from the literature, haveproperties that differ significantly from older field vlm binaries in that theyoung systems have wider separations and lower mass ratios, supporting the ideathat vlm binaries undergo significant dynamical evolution ~5 - 10 myr aftertheir formation. the range of separations of these binaries, four of which areover 30 au, argues against the ejection scenario of brown dwarf formation.while several of the young, vlm binaries discovered in this study have lowerbinding energies than the previously suggested minimum for vlm binaries, theapparent minimum is still significantly higher than that found among highermass binaries. we suggest that this discrepancy may be due to the small mass ofa vlm binary relative to the average perturbing star, leading to moresubstantial changes in their binding energy over time.

astro-ph;9801216	the multiplicity of the hyades and its implications for binary star  formation and evolution	a 2.2 micron speckle imaging survey of 167 bright (k $&lt; 8.5$ mag) hyadesmembers reveals a total of 33 binaries with separations spanning 0."044 to1."34 and magnitude differences as large as 5.5 mag. of these binaries, 13 arenew detections. combining the results of this survey with previous radialvelocity, optical speckle, and direct imaging hyades surveys, the detectedmultiplicity of the sample is: 98 singles, 59 binaries, and 10 triples.  a statistical analysis of this sample investigates a variety of multiple starformation and evolution theories. accounting for the inability to detect highflux ratio binaries results in an implied companion star fraction (csf) of 0.30+/- 0.06 in this separation range 0."1 to 1."07 (5 to 50 au). the hyades csf isintermediate between the values derived from observations of t tauri stars (ttauri csf=0.40 +/- 0.08) and solar neighborhood g-dwarfs (g-dwarf csf=0.14 +/-0.03). this result allows for an evolution of the csf from an initially highvalue for the pre-main sequence to that found for main sequence stars. withinthe hyades, the csf is independent of the radial distance from the clustercenter and the primary star mass. the distribution of mass ratios is best fitby a power law q^(-1.3 +/- 0.3) and shows no dependence on the primary mass,binary separation, or the radial distance from the cluster center. overall, thehyades data are consistent with scale-free fragmentation, but inconsistent withcapture in small clusters and disk-assisted capture in small clusters. withouttestable predictions, scale-dependent fragmentation and disk fragmentationcannot be assessed with the hyades data.

astro-ph;9909363	deep 10 and 18 micron imaging of the hr 4796a circumstellar disk:  transient dust particles &amp; tentative evidence for a brightness asymmetry	we present new 10.8 and 18.2 micron images of hr 4796a, a young a0v star thatwas recently discovered to have a spectacular, nearly edge-on, circumstellardisk prominent at ~20 microns (jayawardhana et al. 1998; koerner et al. 1998).these new images, obtained with oscir at keck ii, show that the disk's size at10 microns is comparable to its size at 18 microns. therefore, the 18micron-emitting dust may also emit some, or all, of the 10 micron radiation.using these multi-wavelength images, we determine a "characteristic" diameterof 2-3 microns for the mid-infrared-emitting dust particles if they arespherical and composed of astronomical silicates. particles this small areexpected to be blown out of the system by radiation pressure in a few hundredyears, and therefore these particles are unlikely to be primordial. dynamicalmodeling of the disk (wyatt et al. 2000) indicates that the disk surfacedensity is relatively sharply peaked near 70 au, which agrees with the meanannular radius deduced by schneider et al. (1999) from their nicmos images. wepresent evidence (~1.8 sigma significance) for a brightness asymmetry that mayresult from the presence of the hole and the gravitational perturbation of thedisk particle orbits by the low-mass stellar companion or a planet. this"pericenter glow," which must still be confirmed, results from a very small (afew au) shift of the disk's center of symmetry relative to the central star hr4796a; one side of the inner boundary of the annulus is shifted towards hr4796a, thereby becoming warmer and more infrared-emitting. the possibledetection of pericenter glow implies that the detection of even complexdynamical effects of planets on disks is within reach.
