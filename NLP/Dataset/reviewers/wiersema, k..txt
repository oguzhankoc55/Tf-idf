0706.1345	spectroscopy and multiband photometry of the afterglow of intermediate  duration gamma-ray burst 040924 and its host galaxy	we present optical photometry and spectroscopy of the afterglow and hostgalaxy of gamma-ray burst 040924. this grb had a rather short duration of t90~2.4s, and a well sampled optical afterglow light curve. we aim to use thisdataset to find further evidence that this burst is consistent with a massivestar core-collapse progenitor. we combine the afterglow data reported here withdata taken from the literature and compare the host properties with surveydata. we find that the global behaviour of the optical afterglow is well fit bya broken power-law, with a break at ~0.03 days. we determine the redshift z =0.858 +/- 0.001 from the detected emission lines in our spectrum. using thespectrum and photometry we derive global properties of the host, showing it tohave similar properties to long grb hosts. we detect the [ne iii] emission linein the spectrum, and compare the fluxes of this line of a sample of 15 long grbhost galaxies with survey data, showing the long grb hosts to be comparable tolocal metal-poor emission line galaxies in their [ne iii] emission. we fit thesupernova bump accompanying this burst, and find that it is similar to otherlong grb supernova bumps, but fainter. all properties of grb 040924 areconsistent with an origin in the core-collapse of a massive star: thesupernova, the spectrum and sed of the host and the afterglow.

0906.1577	a glimpse of the end of the dark ages: the gamma-ray burst of 23 april  2009 at redshift 8.3	it is thought that the first generations of massive stars in the universewere an important, and quite possibly dominant, source of the ultra-violetradiation that reionized the hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (igm); astate in which it has remained to the present day. measurements of cosmicmicrowave background anisotropies suggest that this phase-change largely tookplace in the redshift range z=10.8 +/- 1.4, while observations of quasars andlyman-alpha galaxies have shown that the process was essentially completed byz=6. however, the detailed history of reionization, and characteristics of thestars and proto-galaxies that drove it, remain unknown. further progress inunderstanding requires direct observations of the sources of ultra-violetradiation in the era of reionization, and mapping the evolution of the neutralhydrogen fraction through time. the detection of galaxies at such redshifts ishighly challenging, due to their intrinsic faintness and high luminositydistance, whilst bright quasars appear to be rare beyond z~7. here we reportthe discovery of a gamma-ray burst, grb 090423, at redshift z=8.26 -0.08 +0.07.this is well beyond the redshift of the most distant spectroscopicallyconfirmed galaxy (z=6.96) and quasar (z=6.43). it establishes that massivestars were being produced, and dying as grbs, ~625 million years after the bigbang. in addition, the accurate position of the burst pinpoints the location ofthe most distant galaxy known to date. larger samples of grbs beyond z~7 willconstrain the evolving rate of star formation in the early universe, whilerapid spectroscopy of their afterglows will allow direct exploration of theprogress of reionization with cosmic time.

0907.2462	a new analysis of the short-duration, hard-spectrum grb 051103, a  possible extragalactic sgr giant flare	grb 051103 is considered to be a candidate soft gamma repeater (sgr)extragalactic giant magnetar flare by virtue of its proximity on the sky tom81/m82, as well as its time history, localization, and energy spectrum. wehave derived a refined interplanetary network localization for this burst whichreduces the size of the error box by over a factor of two. we examine its timehistory for evidence of a periodic component, which would be one signature ofan sgr giant flare, and conclude that this component is neither detected nordetectable under reasonable assumptions. we analyze the time-resolved energyspectra of this event with improved time- and energy resolution, and concludethat although the spectrum is very hard, its temporal evolution at late timescannot be determined, which further complicates the giant flare association. wealso present new optical observations reaching limiting magnitudes of r &gt; 24.5,about 4 magnitudes deeper than previously reported. in tandem withserendipitous observations of m81 taken immediately before and one month afterthe burst, these place strong constraints on any rapidly variable sources inthe region of the refined error ellipse proximate to m81. we do not find anyconvincing afterglow candidates from either background galaxies or sources inm81, although within the refined error region we do locate two uv bright starforming regions which may host sgrs. a supernova remnant (snr) within the errorellipse could provide further support for an sgr giant flare association, butwe were unable to identify any snr within the error ellipse. these data stilldo not allow strong constraints on the nature of the grb 051103 progenitor, andsuggest that candidate extragalactic sgr giant flares will be difficult,although not impossible, to confirm.

0907.3449	low-resolution spectroscopy of gamma-ray burst optical afterglows:  biases in the swift sample and characterization of the absorbers	(abridged). we present a sample of 77 optical afterglows (oas) of swiftdetected grbs for which spectroscopic follow-up observations have been secured.we provide linelists and equivalent widths for all detected lines redward ofly-alpha. we discuss to what extent the current sample of swift bursts with oaspectroscopy is a biased subsample of all swift detected grbs. for that purposewe define an x-ray selected sample of swift bursts with optimal conditions forground-based follow up from the period march 2005 to september 2008; 146 burstsfulfill our sample criteria. we derive the redshift distribution for thissample and conclude that less than 19% of swift bursts are at z&gt;7. we comparethe high energy properties for three sub-samples of bursts in the sample: i)bursts with redshifts measured from oa spectroscopy, ii) bursts with detectedoa, but no oa-based redshift, and iii) bursts with no detection of the oa. thebursts in group i) have significantly less excess x-ray absorption than burstsin the other two groups. in addition, the fraction of dark bursts is 14% ingroup i), 38% in group ii) and &gt; 39% in group iii). from this we conclude thatthe sample of grbs with oa spectroscopy is not representative for all swiftbursts, most likely due to a bias against the most dusty sight-lines. finally,we characterize grb absorption systems as a class and compare them to qsoabsorption systems, in particular dlas. on average grb absorbers arecharacterized by significantly stronger ews for hi as well as for both low andhigh ionization metal lines than what is seen in intervening qso absorbers.based on the z&gt;2 bursts in the sample we place a 95% confidence upper limit of7.5% on the mean escape fraction of ionizing photons from star-forminggalaxies.

0907.4578	multi-wavelength observations of the energetic grb 080810: detailed  mapping of the broadband spectral evolution	grb 080810 was one of the first bursts to trigger both swift and the fermigamma-ray space telescope. it was subsequently monitored over the x-ray anduv/optical bands by swift, in the optical by rotse and a host of othertelescopes and was detected in the radio by the vla. the redshift of z= 3.355+/- 0.005 was determined by keck/hires and confirmed by rtt150 and not. theprompt gamma/x-ray emission, detected over 0.3-10^3 kev, systematically softensover time, with e_peak moving from ~600 kev at the start to ~40 kev around 100s after the trigger; alternatively, this spectral evolution could be identifiedwith the blackbody temperature of a quasithermal model shifting from ~60 kev to~3 kev over the same time interval. the first optical detection was made at 38s, but the smooth, featureless profile of the full optical coverage impliesthat this originated from the afterglow component, not the pulsed/flaringprompt emission.  broadband optical and x-ray coverage of the afterglow at the start of thefinal x-ray decay (~8 ks) reveals a spectral break between the optical andx-ray bands in the range 10^15 - 2x10^16 hz. the decay profiles of the x-rayand optical bands show that this break initially migrates blueward to thisfrequency and then subsequently drifts redward to below the optical band by~3x10^5 s. grb 080810 was very energetic, with an isotropic energy output forthe prompt component of 3x10^53 erg and 1.6x10^52 erg for the afterglow; thereis no evidence for a jet break in the afterglow up to six days following theburst.

1003.4250	grb 090902b: afterglow observations and implications	the optical-infrared afterglow of the lat-detected long duration burst, grb090902b, has been observed by several instruments. the earliest detection byrotse-iiia occurred 80 minutes after detection by the gbm instrument onboardthe fermi gamma-ray space telescope, revealing a bright afterglow and a decayslope suggestive of a reverse shock origin. subsequent optical-ir observationsfollowed the light curve for 6.5 days. the temporal and spectral behavior atoptical-infrared frequencies is consistent with synchrotron fireball modelpredictions; the cooling break lies between optical and xrt frequencies ~ 1.9days after the burst. the inferred electron energy index is $p = 1.8 \pm 0.2$,which would however imply an x-ray decay slope flatter than observed. the xrtand lat data have similar spectral indices and the observed steeper value ofthe lat temporal index is marginally consistent with the predicted temporaldecay in the radiative regime of the forward shock model. absence of a jetbreak during the first 6 days implies a collimation-corrected $\gamma$-rayenergy $e_{\gamma} &gt; 2.2\times10^{52}\rm$ ergs, one of the highest ever seen ina long-duration grbs. more events combining gev photon emission withmulti-wavelength observations will be required to constrain the nature of thecentral engine powering these energetic explosions and to explore thecorrelations between energetic quanta and afterglow emission.

1004.2919	discovery of the nearby long, soft grb 100316d with an associated  supernova	we report the swift discovery of nearby long, soft gamma-ray burst grb100316d, and the subsequent unveiling of its low redshift host galaxy andassociated supernova. we derive the redshift of the event to be z = 0.0591 +/-0.0001 and provide accurate astrometry for the grb-sn. we study the extremelyunusual prompt emission with time-resolved gamma-ray to x-ray spectroscopy, andfind that the spectrum is best modelled with a thermal component in addition toa synchrotron emission component with a low peak energy. the x-ray light curvehas a remarkably shallow decay out to at least 800 s. the host is a bright,blue galaxy with a highly disturbed morphology and we use gemini south, vlt andhst observations to measure some of the basic host galaxy properties. wecompare and contrast the x-ray emission and host galaxy of grb 100316d to asubsample of grb-sne. grb 100316d is unlike the majority of grb-sne in itsx-ray evolution, but resembles rather grb 060218, and we find that these twoevents have remarkably similar high energy prompt emission properties.comparison of the host galaxies of grb-sne demonstrates, however, that there isa great diversity in the environments in which grb-sne can be found. grb100316d is an important addition to the currently sparse sample ofspectroscopically confirmed grb-sne, from which a better understanding of longgrb progenitors and the grb--sn connection can be gleaned.

1005.3029	discovery of a new soft gamma repeater, sgr j1833-0832	on 2010 march 19, the swift/burst alert telescope triggered on a short burstwith temporal and spectral characteristics similar to those of soft gammarepeater (sgr) bursts. the source location, however, did not coincide with anyknown sgr. subsequent observations of the source error box with the swift/x-raytelescope and the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte) led to the discovery of anew x-ray source, with a spin period of 7.56 s, confirming sgr j1833-0832 as anew magnetar. based on our detailed temporal and spectral analyses, we showthat the new sgr is rapidly spinning down (4 x 10^{-12} s/s) and find aninferred dipole magnetic field of 1.8 x 10^{14} g. we also show that the x-rayflux of sgr j1833-0832 remained constant for approximately 20 days followingthe burst and then started to decline. we derived an accurate location of thesource with the chandra x-ray observatory and we searched for a counterpart indeep optical and infrared observations of sgr j1833-0832, and for radio pulsedemission with the westerbork radio synthesis telescope. finally, we compare thespectral and temporal properties of the source to the other magnetarcandidates.

1007.4769	challenging grb models through the broadband dataset of grb060908	context: multiwavelength observations of gamma-ray burst prompt and afterglowemission are a key tool to disentangle the various possible emission processesand scenarios proposed to interpret the complex gamma-ray burst phenomenology.aims: we collected a large dataset on grb060908 in order to carry out acomprehensive analysis of the prompt emission as well as the early and lateafterglow. methods: data from swift-bat, -xrt and -uvot together with data froma number of different ground-based optical/nir and millimeter telescopesallowed us to follow the afterglow evolution from about a minute from thehigh-energy event down to the host galaxy limit. we discuss the physicalparameters required to model these emissions. results: the prompt emission ofgrb060908 was characterized by two main periods of activity, spaced by a fewseconds of low intensity, with a tight correlation between activity andspectral hardness. observations of the afterglow began less than one minuteafter the high-energy event, when it was already in a decaying phase, and itwas characterized by a rather flat optical/nir spectrum which can beinterpreted as due to a hard energy-distribution of the emitting electrons. onthe other hand, the x-ray spectrum of the afterglow could be fit by a rathersoft electron distribution. conclusions: grb060908 is a good example of agamma-ray burst with a rich multi-wavelength set of observations. theavailability of this dataset, built thanks to the joint efforts of manydifferent teams, allowed us to carry out stringent tests for variousinterpretative scenarios showing that a satisfactorily modeling of this eventis challenging. in the future, similar efforts will enable us to obtainoptical/nir coverage comparable in quality and quantity to the x-ray data formore events, therefore opening new avenues to progress gamma-ray burstresearch.

1007.5357	vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of the grb 090926a afterglow	the aim of this paper is to study the environment and intervening absorbersof the gamma-ray burst grb 090926a through analysis of optical spectra of itsafterglow. we analyze medium resolution spectroscopic observations (r=10 000,corresponding to 30 km/s, s/n=15 - 30 and wavelength range 3000-25000) of theoptical afterglow of grb 090926a, taken with x-shooter at the vlt ~ 22 hr afterthe grb trigger. the spectrum shows that the ism in the grb host galaxy at z =2.1071 is rich in absorption features, with two components contributing to theline profiles. in addition to the ground state lines, we detect c ii, o i, siii, fe ii and ni ii excited absorption features. no host galaxy emission lines,molecular absorption features nor diffuse interstellar bands are detected inthe spectrum. the hydrogen column density associated to grb 090926a is logn_h/cm^{-2} = 21.60 +/- 0.07, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in therange [x/h] =3.2x10^{-3}-1.2x10^{-2} with respect to the solar values, i.e.,among the lowest values ever observed for a grb host galaxy. a comparison withgalactic chemical evolution models has suggested that the host of grb090926a islikely to be a dwarf irregular galaxy. we put an upper limit to the hydrogenmolecular fraction of the host galaxy ism, which is f &lt; 7x10^{-7}. we deriveinformation on the distance between the host absorbing gas and the site of thegrb explosion. the distance of component i is found to be 2.40 +/- 0.15 kpc,while component ii is located far away from the grb, possibly at ~ 5 kpc. thesevalues are compatible with that found for other grbs.

1011.3515	swift follow-up of unidentified x-ray sources in the xmm-newton slew  survey	we present deep swift follow-up observations of a sample of 94 unidentifiedx-ray sources from the xmm-newton slew survey. the x-ray telescope on-boardswift detected 29% of the sample sources; the flux limits for undetectedsources suggests the bulk of the slew survey sources are drawn from one or moretransient populations. we report revised x-ray positions for the xrt-detectedsources, with typical uncertainties of 2.9", reducing the number of cataloguedoptical matches to just a single source in most cases. we characterise thesources detected by swift through their x-ray spectra and variability and viauvot photometry and catalogued nir, optical and radio observations. six sourcescan be associated with known objects and 8 may be associated with unidentifiedrosat sources within the 3-sigma error radii of our revised x-ray positions. wefind 10 of the 30 xrt-detected sources are clearly stellar in nature, includingone periodic variable star and 2 high proper motion stars. for 11 sources wepropose an agn classification, among which 4 are detected with bat and 3 haveredshifts spanning z = 0.2 - 0.9 obtained from the literature or from opticalspectroscopy presented here. the 67 slew survey sources we do not detect withswift are studied via their characteristics in the slew survey and bycomparison with the xrt and bat detected population. we suggest that these aremostly if not all extragalactic, though unlikely to be highly absorbed sourcesin the x-rays such as compton thick agn. a large number of these are highlyvariable soft x-ray sources. a small fraction of mainly hard-band detectionsmay be spurious. this follow-up programme brings us a step further tocompleting the identifications of a substantial sample of xmm-newton slewsurvey sources, important for understanding the nature of the transient sky andallowing flux-limited samples to be constructed.

1012.1466	a tale of two grb-sne at a common redshift of z = 0.54	we present ground-based and hst optical observations of the opticaltransients (ots) of long-duration gamma ray bursts (grbs) 060729 and 090618,both at a redshift of z = 0.54. for grb 060729, bumps are seen in the opticallight curves (lcs), and the late-time broadband spectral energy distributions(seds) of the ot resemble those of local type ic supernovae (sne). for grb090618, the dense sampling of our optical observations has allowed us to detectwell-defined bumps in the optical lcs, as well as a change in colour, that areindicative of light coming from a core-collapse sn. the accompanying sne forboth events are individually compared with sn1998bw, a known grb-supernova, andsn1994i, a typical type ic supernova without a known grb counterpart, and inboth cases the brightness and temporal evolution more closely resemblesn1998bw. we also exploit our extensive optical and radio data for grb 090618,as well as the publicly-available swift -xrt data, and discuss the propertiesof the afterglow at early times. in the context of a simple jet-like model, theafterglow of grb 090618 is best explained by the presence of a jet-break att-to &gt; 0.5 days. we then compare the rest-frame, peak v -band absolutemagnitudes of all of the grb and x-ray flash (xrf)-associated sne with a largesample of local type ibc sne, concluding that, when host extinction isconsidered, the peak magnitudes of the grb/xrf-sne cannot be distinguished fromthe peak magnitudes of non-grb/xrf sne.

1101.0814	the extinction properties of long grb host galaxies from h and he i  recombination lines	in this paper we show how a self-consistent treatment of hydrogen and heliumemission line fluxes of the hosts of long gamma-ray bursts can result inimproved understanding of the dust properties in these galaxies. in particular,we find that even with modest signal to noise spectroscopy we can differentiatedifferent values for r_v, the ratio of total to selective extinction. theinclusion of paschen and brackett lines, even at low signal to noise, greatlyincrease the accuracy of the derived reddening. this method is often associatedwith strong systematic errors, caused by the need for multiple instruments tocover the wide wavelength range, the requirement to separate stellar hydrogenabsorption from the nebular emission, and because of the dependancy of thepredicted line fluxes on the electron temperature. we show how these threesystematic errors can be negated, by using suitable instrumentation (inparticular x-shooter on the very large telescope) and wide wavelength coverage.we demonstrate this method using an extensive optical and near-infraredspectroscopic campaign of the host galaxy of gamma-ray burst 060218 (sn2006aj), obtained with fors1, uves and isaac on the vlt, covering a broadwavelength range with both high and low spectral resolution. we contrast ourfindings of this source with x-shooter data of a star forming region in thehost of grb 100316d, and show the improvement over existing published fluxes oflong grb hosts.

0704.2525	a case of mistaken identity? grb 060912a and the nature of the long --  short grb divide	we investigate the origin of the grb 060912a, which has observationalproperties that make its classification as either a long or short burstambiguous. short duration grbs (sgrbs) are thought to have typically lowerenergies than long duration bursts, can be found in galaxies with populationsof all ages and are likely to originate from different progenitors to the longduration bursts. however, it has become clear that duration alone isinsufficient to make a distinction between the two populations in many cases,leading to a desire to find additional discriminators of burst type. grb060912a had a duration of 6 s and occurred only ~10 arcsec from a bright, lowredshift ($z=0.0936$) elliptical galaxy, suggesting that this may have been thehost, which would favour it being a short-burst. however, our deep opticalimaging and spectroscopy of the location of grb 060912a using the vlt showsthat grb 060912a more likely originates in a distant star forming galaxy atz=0.937, and is most likely a long burst. this demonstrates the risk inidentifying bright, nearby galaxies as the hosts of given grbs without furthersupporting evidence. further, it implies that, in the absence of secureidentifications, "host" type, or more broadly discriminators which rely ongalaxy redshifts, may not be good indicators of the true nature of any givengrb.

1105.4915	a photometric redshift of z ~ 9.4 for grb 090429b	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) serve as powerful probes of the early universe, withtheir luminous afterglows revealing the locations and physical properties ofstar forming galaxies at the highest redshifts, and potentially locating firstgeneration (population iii) stars. since grb afterglows have intrinsically verysimple spectra, they allow robust redshifts from low signal to noisespectroscopy, or photometry. here we present a photometric redshift of z~9.4for the swift-detected grb 090429b based on deep observations withgemini-north, the very large telescope, and the grb optical and near-infrareddetector. assuming a small magellanic cloud dust law (which has been found in amajority of grb sight-lines), the 90% likelihood range for the redshift is 9.06&lt; z &lt; 9.52, although there is a low-probability tail to somewhat lowerredshifts. adopting milky way or large magellanic cloud dust laws leads to verysimilar conclusions, while a maiolino law does allow somewhat lower redshiftsolutions, but in all cases the most likely redshift is found to be z&gt;7. thenon-detection of the host galaxy to deep limits (y_ab &gt;~ 28 mag, which wouldcorrespond roughly to 0.001 l* at z=1) in our late time optical and infraredobservations with the hubble space telescope strongly supports the extremeredshift origin of grb 090429b, since we would expect to have detected anylow-z galaxy, even if it were highly dusty. finally, the energetics of grb090429b are comparable to those of other grbs, and suggest that its progenitoris not greatly different to those of lower redshift bursts.

1107.3748	grb 070125 and the environments of spectral-line poor afterglow  absorbers	grb 070125 is among the most energetic bursts detected and the mostextensively observed so far. nevertheless, unresolved issues are still open inthe literature on the physics of the afterglow and on the grb environment. inparticular, grb 070125 was claimed to have exploded in a galactic haloenvironment, based on the uniqueness of the optical spectrum and thenon-detection of an underlying host galaxy. in this work we collect allpublicly available data and address these issues by modelling the nir-to-x-rayspectral energy distribution (sed) and studying the high signal-to-noisevlt/fors afterglow spectrum in comparison with a larger sample of grbabsorbers. the sed reveals a synchrotron cooling break in the uv, lowequivalent hydrogen column density and little reddening caused by a lmc- orsmc-type extinction curve. from the weak mgii absorption at z=1.5477 in thespectrum, we derived logn(mgii)=12.96+0.13-0.18 and upper limits on the ioniccolumn density of several metals. these suggest that the grb absorber is mostlikely an lls with a 0.03z\odot&lt;z&lt;1.3z\odot metallicity. the comparison withother grb absorbers places grb070125 at the low end of the absorption lineequivalent width distribution, confirming that weak spectral features andspectral-line poor absorbers are not so uncommon in afterglow spectra.moreover, we show that the effect of photo-ionization on the gas surroundingthe grb, combined with a low n(hi) along a short segment of the line of sightwithin the host galaxy, can explain the lack of spectral features in grb070125.finally, the non-detection of an underlying galaxy is consistent with a faintgrb host galaxy, well within the grb host brightness distribution. thus, thepossibility that grb070125 is simply located in the outskirts of a gas-rich,massive star-forming region inside its small and faint host galaxy seems morelikely than a gas-poor, halo environment origin.

1110.6510	a young massive stellar population around the intermediate mass black  hole eso 243-49 hlx-1	we present hubble space telescope and simultaneous swift x-ray telescopeobservations of the strongest candidate intermediate mass black hole eso 243-49hlx-1. fitting the spectral energy distribution from x-ray to near-infraredwavelengths showed that the broadband spectrum is not consistent with simpleand irradiated disc models, but is well described by a model comprised of anirradiated accretion disc plus a stellar population with a mass ~1e6 msun. theage of the population cannot be uniquely constrained, with both very young andvery old stellar populations allowed. however, the very old solution requiresexcessively high levels of disc reprocessing and an extremely small disc,leading us to favour the young solution with an age of ~13 myr. in addition,the presence of dust lanes and the lack of any nuclear activity from x-rayobservations of the host galaxy lead us to propose that a gas-rich minor mergermay have taken place less than ~200 myr ago. such a merger event would explainthe presence of the intermediate mass black hole and support a young stellarpopulation.

1112.3042	polarimetry of the transient relativistic jet of grb 110328 / swift  j164449.3+573451	we present deep infrared (ks band) imaging polarimetry and radio (1.4 and 4.8ghz) polarimetry of the enigmatic transient swift j164449.3+573451. this sourceappears to be a short lived jet phenomenon in a galaxy at redshift z = 0.354,activated by a sudden mass accretion onto the central massive black hole,possibly caused by the tidal disruption of a star. we aim to find evidence forthis scenario through linear polarimetry, as linear polarisation is a sensitiveprobe of jet physics, source geometry and the various mechanisms giving rise tothe observed radiation. we find a formal ks band polarisation measurement ofp_lin = 7.4 +/- 3.5 % (including systematic errors). our radio observationsshow continuing brightening of the source, which allows sensitive searches forlinear polarisation as a function of time. we find no evidence of linearpolarisation at radio wavelengths of 1.4 ghz and 4.8 ghz at any epoch, with themost sensitive 3 sigma limits as deep as 2.1%. these upper limits are inagreement with expectations from scenarios in which the radio emission isproduced by the interaction of a relativistic jet with a dense circumsourcemedium. we further demonstrate how the polarisation properties can be used toderive properties of the jet in swift j164449.3+573451, exploiting thesimilarities between this source and the afterglows of gamma-ray bursts.

1201.6074	star formation in the early universe: beyond the tip of the iceberg	we present late-time hubble space telescope imaging of the fields of sixswift grbs lying at 5.0&lt;z&lt;9.5. our data includes very deep observations of thefield of the most distant spectroscopically confirmed burst, grb 090423, atz=8.2. using the precise positions afforded by their afterglows we can placestringent limits on the luminosities of their host galaxies. in one case, thatof grb 060522 at z=5.11, there is a marginal excess of flux close to the grbposition which may be a detection of a host at a magnitude j(ab)=28.5. none ofthe others are significantly detected meaning that all the hosts lie belowl\star at their respective redshifts, with star formation rates sfr&lt;4mo/yr inall cases. indeed, stacking the five fields with wfc3-ir data we conclude amean sfr&lt;0.17mo/yr per galaxy. these results support the proposition that thebulk of star formation, and hence integrated uv luminosity, at high redshiftsarises in galaxies below the detection limits of deep-field observations.making the reasonable assumption that grb rate is proportional to uv luminosityat early times allows us to compare our limits with expectations based ongalaxy luminosity functions derived from the hubble ultra-deep field (hudf) andother deep fields. we infer that a luminosity function which is evolvingrapidly towards steeper faint-end slope (alpha) and decreasing characteristicluminosity (l\star), as suggested by some other studies, is consistent with ourobservations, whereas a non-evolving lf shape is ruled out at &gt;90% confidence.although it is not yet possible to make stronger statements, in the future,with larger samples and a fuller understanding of the conditions required forgrb production, studies like this hold great potential for probing the natureof star formation, the shape of the galaxy luminosity function, and the supplyof ionizing photons in the early universe.

1203.4265	detailed optical and near-infrared polarimetry, spectroscopy and  broadband photometry of the afterglow of grb 091018: polarisation evolution	[abridged] a number of phenomena have been observed in grb afterglows thatdefy explanation by simple versions of the standard fireball model, leading toa variety of new models. polarimetry can be a major independent diagnostic ofafterglow physics, probing the magnetic field properties and internal structureof the grb jets. in this paper we present the first high quality multi-nightpolarimetric light curve of a swift grb afterglow, aimed at providing a wellcalibrated dataset of a typical afterglow to serve as a benchmark system formodelling afterglow polarisation behaviour. in particular, our dataset of theafterglow of grb 091018 (at redshift z=0.971) comprises optical linearpolarimetry (r band, 0.13 - 2.3 days after burst); circular polarimetry (rband) and near-infrared linear polarimetry (ks band). we add to that highquality optical and near-infrared broadband light curves and spectral energydistributions as well as afterglow spectroscopy. the linear polarisation variesbetween 0 and 3%, with both long and short time scale variability visible. wefind an achromatic break in the afterglow light curve, which corresponds tofeatures in the polarimetric curve. we find that the data can be reproduced byjet break models only if an additional polarised component of unknown nature ispresent in the polarimetric curve. we probe the ordered magnetic fieldcomponent in the afterglow through our deep circular polarimetry, findingp_circ &lt; 0.15% (2 sigma), the deepest limit yet for a grb afterglow, suggestingordered fields are weak, if at all present. our simultaneous r and ks bandpolarimetry shows that dust induced polarisation in the host galaxy is likelynegligible.

1205.4239	the optically unbiased grb host (tough) survey. vi. radio observations  at z&lt;1 and consistency with typical star-forming galaxies	the objective of this paper is to determine the level of obscured starformation activity and dust attenuation in a sample of gamma-ray burst (grb)hosts; and to test the hypothesis that grb hosts have properties consistentwith those of the general star-forming galaxy populations. we present a radiocontinuum survey of all z&lt;1 grb hosts in the optically unbiased grb host(tough) sample supplemented with radio data for all (mostly pre-swift) grb-snhosts discovered before october 2006. we present new radio data for 22 objectsand have obtained a detection for three of them (grb 980425, 021211, 031203;none in the tough sample), increasing the number of radio-detected grb hostsfrom two to five. the star formation rate (sfr) for the grb 021211 host of ~825mo yr^-1, the highest ever reported for a grb host, places it in the categoryof ultraluminous infrared galaxies. we found that at least 63% of grb hostshave sfr &lt; 100 mo yr^-1 and at most 8% can have sfr &gt; 500 mo yr^-1. for theundetected hosts the mean radio flux (&lt;35 ujy 3sigma) corresponds to an averagesfr &lt; 15 mo yr^-1. moreover, ~88% of the z&lt;1 grb hosts have ultraviolet dustattenuation a_uv &lt; 6.7 mag (visual attenuation a_v &lt; 3 mag). hence we did notfind evidence for large dust obscuration in a majority of grb hosts. finally,we found that the distributions of sfrs and a_uv of grb hosts are consistentwith those of lyman break galaxies, halpha emitters at similar redshifts and ofgalaxies from cosmological simulations. the similarity of the grb populationwith other star-forming galaxies is consistent with the hypothesis that grbs, aleast at z&lt;1, trace a large fraction of all star formation, and are thereforeless biased indicators than once thought.

1209.0891	the distribution of equivalent widths in long grb afterglow spectra	the extreme brightness of gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows and their simplespectral shape make them ideal beacons to study the interstellar medium oftheir host galaxies through absorption line spectroscopy. using 69low-resolution grb afterglow spectra, we conduct a study of the rest-frameequivalent width (ew) distribution of features with an average rest-frame ewlarger than 0.5 a. to compare an individual grb with the sample, we develop ewdiagrams as a graphical tool, and we give a catalogue with diagrams for the 69spectra. we introduce a line strength parameter (lsp) that allows us toquantify the strength of the absorption features as compared to the sample by asingle number. using the distributions of ews of single-species features, wederive the distribution of column densities by a curve of growth (cog) fit. wefind correlations between the lsp and the extinction of the grb, the uvbrightness of the host galaxies and the neutral hydrogen column density.however, we see no significant evolution of the lsp with the redshift. there isa weak correlation between the ionisation of the absorbers and the energy ofthe grb, indicating that, either the grb event is responsible for part of theionisation, or that galaxies with high-ionisation media produce more energeticgrbs. spectral features in grb spectra are, on average, 2.5 times stronger thanthose seen in qso intervening damped lyman-alpha (dla) systems and slightlymore ionised. in particular we find larger excess in the ew of civ1549 relativeto qso dlas, which could be related to an excess of wolf-rayet stars in theenvironments of grbs. from the cog fitting we obtain an average number ofcomponents in the absorption features of grbs of 6.00(-1.25,+1.00). the mostextreme ionisation ratios in our sample are found for grbs with low neutralhydrogen column density, which could be related to ionisation by the grbemission.

1302.2352	a new population of ultra-long duration gamma-ray bursts	we present comprehensive multiwavelength observations of three gamma-raybursts (grbs) with durations of several thousand seconds. we demonstrate thatthese events are extragalactic transients; in particular we resolve thelong-standing conundrum of the distance of grb 101225a (the "christmas-dayburst"), finding it to have a redshift z=0.847, and showing that two apparentlysimilar events (grb 111209a and grb 121027a) lie at z=0.677 and z=1.773respectively. the systems show extremely unusual x-ray and optical lightcurves,very different from classical grbs, with long lasting highly variable x-rayemission and optical light curves that exhibit little correlation with thebehaviour seen in the x-ray. their host galaxies are faint, compact, and highlystar forming dwarf galaxies, typical of "blue compact galaxies". we proposethat these bursts are the prototypes of a hitherto largely unrecognizedpopulation of ultra-long grbs, that while observationally difficult to detectmay be astrophysically relatively common. the long durations may naturally beexplained by the engine driven explosions of stars of much larger radii thannormally considered for grb progenitors which are thought to have compactwolf-rayet progenitor stars. however, we cannot unambiguously identifysupernova signatures within their light curves or spectra. we also consider thealternative possibility that they arise from the tidal disruption of stars bysupermassive black holes.

1303.0844	x-ray absorption evolution in gamma-ray bursts: intergalactic medium or  evolutionary signature of their host galaxies?	the intrinsic x-ray emission of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) is often found to beabsorbed over and above the column density through our own galaxy. the extracomponent is usually assumed to be due to absorbing gas lying within the hostgalaxy of the grb itself. there is an apparent correlation between theequivalent column density of hydrogen, n(h,intrinsic) (assuming it to be at thegrb redshift), and redshift, z, with the few z&gt;6 grbs showing the greatestintrinsic column densities. we investigate the n(h,intrinsic) - z relationusing a large sample of swift grbs, as well as active galactic nuclei (agn) andquasar samples, paying particular attention to the spectral energydistributions of the two highest redshift grbs. various possible sample biasesand systematics that might produce such a correlation are considered, and weconclude that the correlation is very likely to be real. this may indicateeither an evolutionary effect in the host galaxy properties, or a contributionfrom gas along the line-of-sight, in the diffuse intergalactic medium (igm) orintervening absorbing clouds. employing a more realistic model for igmabsorption than in previous works, we find that this may explain much of theobserved opacity at z&gt;~3 providing it is not too hot, likely between 10^5 k and10^6.5 k, and moderately metal enriched, z~0.2 z_sun. this material couldtherefore constitute the warm hot intergalactic medium. however, a comparablelevel of absorption is also expected from the cumulative effect of interveningcold gas clouds, and given current uncertainties it is not possible to saywhich, if either, dominates. at lower redshifts, we conclude that gas in thehost galaxies must be the dominant contributor to the observed x-rayabsorption.

1306.0892	the low-extinction afterglow in the solar-metallicity host galaxy of  gamma-ray burst 110918a	metallicity is theoretically thought to be a fundamental driver in gamma-rayburst (grb) explosions and energetics, but is still, even after more than adecade of extensive studies, not fully understood. this is largely related totwo phenomena: a dust-extinction bias, that prevented high-mass and thus likelyhigh-metallicity grb hosts to be detected in the first place, and a lack ofefficient instrumentation, that limited spectroscopic studies includingmetallicity measurements to the low-redshift end of the grb host population.the subject of this work is the very energetic grb 110918a, for which wemeasure a redshift of z=0.984. grb 110918a gave rise to a luminous afterglowwith an intrinsic spectral slope of b=0.70, which probed a sight-line withlittle extinction (a_v=0.16 mag) typical of the established distributions ofafterglow properties. photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations ofthe galaxy hosting grb 110918a, including optical/nir photometry with grond andspectroscopy with vlt/x-shooter, however, reveal an all but average grb host incomparison to the z~1 galaxies selected through similar afterglows to date. ithas a large spatial extent with a half-light radius of ~10 kpc, the higheststellar mass for z&lt;1.9 (log(m_*/m_sol) = 10.68+-0.16), and an halpha-based starformation rate of 41 m_sol/yr. we measure a gas-phase extinction of ~1.8 magthrough the balmer decrement and one of the largest host-integratedmetallicities ever of around solar (12 + log(o/h) = 8.93+/-0.13). this presentsone of the very few robust metallicity measurements of grb hosts at z~1, andestablishes that grb hosts at z~1 can also be very metal rich. it conclusivelyrules out a metallicity cut-off in grb host galaxies and argues against ananti-correlation between metallicity and energy release in grbs.

1306.4971	a "kilonova" associated with short-duration gamma-ray burst 130603b	short-duration gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are intense flashes of cosmicgamma-rays, lasting less than ~2 s, whose origin is one of the great unsolvedquestions of astrophysics today. while the favoured hypothesis for theirproduction, a relativistic jet created by the merger of two compact stellarobjects (specifically, two neutron stars, ns-ns, or a neutron star and a blackhole, ns-bh), is supported by indirect evidence such as their host galaxyproperties, unambiguous confirmation of the model is still lacking. mergers ofthis kind are also expected to create significant quantities of neutron-richradioactive species, whose decay should result in a faint transient in the daysfollowing the burst, a so-called "kilonova". indeed, it is speculated that thismechanism may be the predominant source of stable r-process elements in theuniverse. recent calculations suggest much of the kilonova energy should appearin the near-infrared (nir) due to the high optical opacity created by theseheavy r-process elements. here we report strong evidence for such an eventaccompanying sgrb 130603b. if this simplest interpretation of the data iscorrect, it provides (i) support for the compact object merger hypothesis ofsgrbs, (ii) confirmation that such mergers are likely sites of significantr-process production and (iii) quite possibly an alternative, un-beamedelectromagnetic signature of the most promising sources for direct detection ofgravitational waves.

1307.6586	grb 120521c at z~6 and the properties of high-redshift grbs	we present optical, near-infrared, and radio observations of the afterglow ofgrb 120521c. by modeling the multi-wavelength dataset, we derive a photometricredshift of z~6.0, which we confirm with a low signal-to-noise ratio spectrumof the afterglow. we find that a model with a constant-density environmentprovides a good fit to the afterglow data, with an inferred density of0.05/cm^3. the radio observations reveal the presence of a jet break at 7 d,corresponding to a jet opening angle of ~ 3 deg. the beaming-correctedgamma-ray and kinetic energies are both ~ 3e50 erg. we quantify theuncertainties in our results using a detailed markov chain monte carloanalysis, which allows us to uncover degeneracies between the physicalparameters of the explosion. to compare grb 120521c to other high-redshiftbursts in a uniform manner we re-fit all available afterglow data for the twoother bursts at z&gt;6 with radio detections (grbs 050904 and 090423). we find ajet break at ~ 15 d for grb 090423, in contrast to previous work. based onthese three events, we find that grbs at z&gt;6 appear to explode inconstant-density environments, and exhibit a wide range of energies anddensities that span the range inferred for lower redshift bursts. on the otherhand, we find a hint for narrower jets in the z&gt;6 bursts, potentiallyindicating a larger true event rate at these redshifts. overall, our resultsindicate that long grbs share a common progenitor population at least to z~8.

1308.2984	spectroscopy of the short-hard grb 130603b: the host galaxy and  environment of a compact object merger	short duration gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are thought to be related to theviolent merger of compact objects, such as neutron stars or black holes, whichmakes them promising sources of gravitational waves. the detection of a'kilonova'-like signature associated to the swift-detected grb 130603b hassuggested that this event is the result of a compact object merger. ourknowledge on sgrb has been, until now, mostly based on the absence of supernovasignatures and the analysis of the host galaxies to which they cannot always besecurely associated. further progress has been significantly hampered by thefaintness and rapid fading of their optical counterparts (afterglows), whichhas so far precluded spectroscopy of such events. afterglow spectroscopy is thekey tool to firmly determine the distance at which the burst was produced,crucial to understand its physics, and study its local environment. here wepresent the first spectra of a prototypical sgrb afterglow in which bothabsorption and emission features are clearly detected. together withmultiwavelength photometry we study the host and environment of grb 130603b.from these spectra we determine the redshift of the burst to be z =0.3565+/-0.0002, measure rich dynamics both in absorption and emission, and asubstantial line of sight extinction of a_v = 0.86+/-0.15 mag. the grb waslocated at the edge of a disrupted arm of a moderately star forming galaxy withnear-solar metallicity. unlike for most long grbs (lgrbs), n_hx / a_v isconsistent with the galactic ratio, indicating that the explosion site differsfrom those found in lgrbs. the merger is not associated with the moststar-forming region of the galaxy; however, it did occur in a dense region,implying a rapid merger or a low natal kick velocity for the compact objectbinary.

1308.5520	the low-extinction afterglow in the solar-metallicity host galaxy of grb  110918a	galaxies selected through long gamma-ray bursts (grbs) could be offundamental importance when mapping the star formation history out to thehighest redshifts. before using them as efficient tools in the early universe,however, the environmental factors that govern the formation of grbs need to beunderstood. metallicity is theoretically thought to be a fundamental driver ingrb explosions and energetics, but is still, even after more than a decade ofextensive studies, not fully understood. this is largely related to twophenomena: a dust-extinction bias, that prevented high-mass and thus likelyhigh-metallicity grb hosts to be detected in the first place, and a lack ofefficient instrumentation, that limited spectroscopic studies includingmetallicity measurements to the low-redshift end of the grb host population.the subject of this work is the very energetic grb 110918a, for which wemeasure one of the largest host-integrated metallicities, ever, and the higheststellar mass for z&lt;1.9. this presents one of the very few robust metallicitymeasurements of grb hosts at z~1, and establishes that grb hosts at z~1 canalso be very metal rich. it conclusively rules out a metallicity cut-off in grbhost galaxies and argues against an anti-correlation between metallicity andenergy release in grbs.

1311.6912	optical variability of the accretion disk around the intermediate mass  black hole eso 243-49 hlx-1 during the 2012 outburst	we present dedicated quasi-simultaneous x-ray (swift) and optical (very largetelescope (vlt), v- and r-band) observations of the intermediate mass blackhole candidate eso 243-49 hlx-1 before and during the 2012 outburst. we showthat the v-band magnitudes vary with time, thus proving that a portion of theobserved emission originates in the accretion disk. using the first quiescentoptical observations of hlx-1, we show that the stellar population surroundinghlx-1 is fainter than v~25.1 and r~24.2. we show that the optical emission mayincrease before the x-ray emission consistent with the scenario proposed bylasota et al. (2011) in which the regular outbursts could be related to thepassage at periastron of a star circling the intermediate mass black hole in aneccentric orbit, which triggers mass transfer into a quasi-permanent accretiondisk around the black hole. further, if there is indeed a delay in the x-rayemission we estimate the mass-transfer delivery radius to be ~1e11 cm.

1401.3774	grb 120422a/sn 2012bz: bridging the gap between low- and high-luminosity  grbs	at low redshift, a handful of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been discoveredwith peak luminosities ($l_{\rm iso} &lt; 10^{48.5}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$)substantially lower than the average of the more distant ones ($l_{\rm iso} &gt;10^{49.5}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$). the properties of several low-luminosity(low-$l$) grbs indicate that they can be due to shock break-out, as opposed tothe emission from ultrarelativistic jets. owing to this, it is highly debatedhow both populations are connected, and whether there is a continuum betweenthem. the burst at redshift $z=0.283$ from 2012 april 22 is one of the very fewexamples of intermediate-$l$ grbs with a $\gamma$-ray luminosity of$l\sim10^{48.9}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$ that have been detected up to now. togetherwith the robust detection of its accompanying supernova sn 2012bz, it has thepotential to answer important questions on the origin of low- and high-$l$ grbsand the grb-sn connection. we carried out a spectroscopy campaign using medium-and low-resolution spectrographs at 6--10-m class telescopes, covering the timespan of 37.3 days, and a multi-wavelength imaging campaign from radio to x-rayenergies over a duration of $\sim270$ days. furthermore, we used a tuneablefilter centred at h$\alpha$ to map star formation in the host galaxy and thesurrounding galaxies. we used these data to extract and model the properties ofdifferent radiation components and incorporate spectral-energy-distributionfitting techniques to extract the properties of the host galaxy. modelling thelight curve and spectral energy distribution from the radio to the x-raysrevealed the blast-wave to expand with an initial lorentz factor of$\gamma_0\sim60$, low for a high-$l$ grb, and that the afterglow had anexceptional low peak luminosity-density of$\lesssim2\times10^{30}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}\,\rm{hz}^{-1}$ in the sub-mm.[abridged]

1402.0766	on the nature of the 'hostless' short grbs	a significant proportion ($\sim30\%$) of the short-duration gamma-ray bursts(sgrbs) localised by swift have no detected host galaxy coincident with theburst location to deep limits, and also no high-likelihood association withproximate galaxies on the sky. these sgrbs may represent a population atmoderately high redshifts ($z\gtrsim1$), for which the hosts are faint, or apopulation where the progenitor has been kicked far from its host or is sitedin an outlying globular cluster. we consider the afterglow and hostobservations of three 'hostless' bursts (grbs 090305a, 091109b and 111020a),coupled with a new observational diagnostic to aid the association of sgrbswith putative host galaxies to investigate this issue. considering the welllocalised sgrb sample, 7/25 sgrbs can be classified as 'hostless' by ourdiagnostic. statistically, however, the proximity of these seven sgrbs tonearby galaxies is higher than is seen for random positions on the sky. thissuggests that the majority of 'hostless' sgrbs have likely been kicked fromproximate galaxies at moderate redshift. though this result still suggests onlya small proportion of sgrbs will be within the adligo horizon for ns-ns orns-bh inspiral detection ($z\sim0.1$), in the particular case of grb 111020a aplausible host candidate is at $z=0.02$.

1403.4079	grb 130925a: an ultra-long gamma ray burst with a dust-echo afterglow,  and implications for the origin of the ultra-long grbs	grb 130925a was an unusual grb, consisting of 3 distinct episodes ofhigh-energy emission spanning $\sim$20 ks, making it a member of the proposedcategory of `ultra-long' bursts. it was also unusual in that its late-timex-ray emission observed by swift was very soft, and showed a stronghard-to-soft spectral evolution with time. this evolution, rarely seen in grbafterglows, can be well modelled as the dust-scattered echo of the promptemission, with stringent limits on the contribution from the normal afterglow(i.e. external shock) emission. we consider and reject the possibility that grb130925a was some form of tidal disruption event, and instead show that if thecircumburst density around grb 130925a is low, the long duration of the burstand faint external shock emission are naturally explained. indeed, we suggestthat the ultra-long grbs as a class can be explained as those with lowcircumburst densities, such that the deceleration time (at which point thematerial ejected from the nascent black hole is decelerated by the circumburstmedium) is $\sim$20 ks, as opposed to a few hundred seconds for the normal longgrbs. the increased deceleration radius means that more of the ejected shellscan interact before reaching the external shock, naturally explaining both theincreased duration of grb 130925a, the duration of its prompt pulses, and thefainter-than-normal afterglow.

1410.0489	circular polarization in the optical afterglow of grb 121024a	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are most probably powered by collimated relativisticoutflows (jets) from accreting black holes at cosmological distances. brightafterglows are produced when the outflow collides with the ambient medium.afterglow polarization directly probes the magnetic properties of the jet, whenmeasured minutes after the burst, and the geometric properties of the jet andthe ambient medium when measured hours to days after the burst. high values ofoptical polarization detected minutes after burst in grb 120308a indicate thepresence of large-scale ordered magnetic fields originating from the centralengine (the power source of the grb). theoretical models predict low degrees oflinear polarization and negligable circular polarization at late times, whenthe energy in the original ejecta is quickly transferred to the ambient mediumand propagates farther into the medium as a blastwave. here we report thedetection of circularly polarized optical light in the afterglow of grb121024a, measured 0.15 days after the burst. we show that the circularpolarization is intrinsic to the afterglow and unlikely to be produced by dustscattering or plasma propagation effects. a possible explanation is to invokeanisotropic (rather than the commonly assumed isotropic) electron pitch angledistributions, and we suggest that new models are required to produce thecomplex microphysics of realistic shocks in relativistic jets.

1411.5477	broadband modelling of short gamma-ray bursts with energy injection from  magnetar spin-down and its implications for radio detectability	the magnetar model has been proposed to explain the apparent energy injectionin the x-ray light curves of short gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs), but itsimplications across the full broadband spectrum are not well explored. weinvestigate the broadband modelling of four sgrbs with evidence for energyinjection in their x-ray light curves, applying a physically motivated model inwhich a newly formed magnetar injects energy into a forward shock as it losesangular momentum along open field lines. by performing an order of magnitudesearch for the underlying physical parameters in the blast wave, we constrainthe characteristic break frequencies of the synchrotron spectrum against theirmanifestations in the available multi-wavelength observations for each burst.the application of the magnetar energy injection profile restricts thesuccessful matches to a limited family of models that are self-consistentwithin the magnetic dipole spin-down framework.we produce synthetic lightcurves that describe how the radio signatures of these sgrbs ought to havelooked given the restrictions imposed by the available data, and discuss thedetectability of these signatures with present-day and near-future radiotelescopes. our results show that both the atacama large millimetre array andthe upgraded very large array are now sensitive enough to detect the radiosignature within two weeks of trigger in most sgrbs, assuming our sample isrepresentative of the population as a whole. we also find that the upcomingsquare kilometre array will be sensitive to depths greater than those of ourlower limit predictions.

0804.1727	multiwavelength analysis of the intriguing grb 061126: the reverse shock  scenario and magnetization	we present a detailed study of the prompt and afterglow emission from swiftgrb 061126 using bat, xrt, uvot data and multi-color optical imaging from tenground-based telescopes. grb 061126 was a long burst (t_90=191 s) with fouroverlapping peaks in its gamma-ray light curve. the x-ray afterglow, observedfrom 26 min to 20 days after the burst, shows a simple power-law decay withalpha_x=1.290 \pm 0.008. optical observations presented here cover the timerange from 258 s (faulkes telescope north) to 15 days (gemini north) after theburst; the decay rate of the optical afterglow shows a steep-to-shallowtransition (from alpha_1=1.48 \pm 0.06 to alpha_2=0.88 \pm 0.03) approximately13 min after the burst. we suggest the early, steep component is due to areverse shock and show that the magnetic energy density in the ejecta,expressed as a fraction of the equipartion value, is a few ten times largerthan in the forward shock in the early afterglow phase. the ejecta might beendowed with primordial magnetic fields at the central engine. the opticallight curve implies a late-time break at about 1.5 days after the burst, whilethere is no evidence of the simultaneous break in the x-ray light curve. wemodel the broad band emission and show that some afterglow characteristics (thesteeper decay in x-ray and the shallow spectral index from optical to x-ray)are difficult to explain in the framework of the standard fireball model. thismight imply that the x-ray afterglow is due to an additional emission process,such as late time central engine activity rather than blast-wave shockemission. the possible chromatic break at 1.5 days after the burst would givesupport to the additional emission scenario.

0804.1959	the afterglows of swift-era gamma-ray bursts ii.: type i grb versus type  ii grb optical afterglows	we use a large sample of grb afterglow and prompt-emission data (addingfurther grb afterglow observations in this work) to compare the opticalafterglows (or the lack thereof) of type i grbs with those of type ii grbs. incomparison to the afterglows of type ii grbs, we find that those of type i grbshave a lower average luminosity and show an intrinsic spread of luminosities atleast as wide. from late and deep upper limits on the optical transients, weestablish limits on the maximum optical luminosity of any associated supernova,confirming older works and adding new results. we use deep upper limits on typei grb optical afterglows to constrain the parameter space of possible mini-snemission associated with a compact-object merger. using the prompt emissiondata, we search for correlations between the parameters of the prompt emissionand the late optical afterglow luminosities. we find tentative correlationsbetween the bolometric isotropic energy release and the optical afterglowluminosity at a fixed time after trigger (positive), and between the hostoffset and the luminosity (negative), but no significant correlation betweenthe isotropic energy release and the duration of the grbs. we also discussthree anomalous grbs, grb 060505, grb 060614, and grb 060121, in the light oftheir optical afterglow luminosities.

0805.1557	grb 080319b: a naked-eye stellar blast from the distant universe	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) release copious amounts of energyacross the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and so provide a window into theprocess of black hole formation from the collapse of a massive star. over thelast forty years, our understanding of the grb phenomenon has progresseddramatically; nevertheless, fortuitous circumstances occasionally arise thatprovide access to a regime not yet probed. grb 080319b presented such anopportunity, with extraordinarily bright prompt optical emission that peaked ata visual magnitude of 5.3, making it briefly visible with the naked eye. it wascaptured in exquisite detail by wide-field telescopes, imaging the burstlocation from before the time of the explosion. the combination of these uniqueoptical data with simultaneous gamma-ray observations provides powerfuldiagnostics of the detailed physics of this explosion within seconds of itsformation. here we show that the prompt optical and gamma-ray emissions fromthis event likely arise from different spectral components within the samephysical region located at a large distance from the source, implying anextremely relativistic outflow. the chromatic behaviour of the broadbandafterglow is consistent with viewing the grb down the very narrow inner core ofa two-component jet that is expanding into a wind-like environment consistentwith the massive star origin of long grbs. these circumstances can explain theextreme properties of this grb.

1505.06743	grb hosts through cosmic time - vlt/x-shooter emission-line spectroscopy  of 96 grb-selected galaxies at 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 3.6	[abridged] we present data and initial results from vlt/x-shooteremission-line spectroscopy of 96 grb-selected galaxies at 0.1&lt;z&lt;3.6, thelargest sample of grb host spectroscopy available to date. most of our grbswere detected by swift and 76% are at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 with a median z~1.6. based onbalmer and/or forbidden lines of oxygen, nitrogen, and neon, we measuresystemic redshifts, star formation rates (sfrs), visual attenuations, oxygenabundances (12+log(o/h)), and emission-line widths. we find a strong change ofthe typical physical properties of grb hosts with redshift. the median sfr, forexample, increases from ~0.6 m_sun/yr at z~0.6 up to ~15 m_sun/yr at z~2. ahigher ratio of [oiii]/[oii] at higher redshifts leads to an increasingdistance of grb-selected galaxies to the locus of local galaxies in the bptdiagram. oxygen abundances of the galaxies are distributed between12+log(o/h)=7.9 and 12+log(o/h)=9.0 with a median of 12+log(o/h)~8.5. thefraction of grb-selected galaxies with super-solar metallicities is around 20%at z&lt;1 in the adopted metallicity scale. this is significantly less than thefraction of star formation in similar galaxies, illustrating that grbs arescarce in high-metallicity environments. at z~3, sensitivity limits us toprobing only the most luminous grb hosts for which we derive metallicities of z~&lt; 0.5 z_sun. together with a high incidence of galaxies with similarmetallicity in our sample at z~1.5, this indicates that the metallicitydependence observed at low redshift will not be dominant at z~3.

1509.08945	late time multi wavelength observations of swift j1644+5734: a luminous  optical/ir bump and quiescent x-ray emission	we present late-time multi-wavelength observations of swift j1644+57,suggested to be a relativistic tidal disruption flare (tdf). our observationsextend to &gt;4 years from discovery, and show that 1.4 years after outburst therelativistic jet switched-off on a timescale less than tens of days,corresponding to a power-law decay faster than $t^{-70}$. beyond this pointweak x-rays continue to be detected at an approximately constant luminosity of$l_x \sim 5 \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and are marginally inconsistent witha continuing decay of $t^{-5/3}$, similar to that seen prior to the switch-off.host photometry enables us to infer a black hole mass of $m_{bh}=3 \times 10^6$m$_{\odot}$, consistent with the late time x-ray luminosity arising fromsub-eddington accretion onto the black hole in the form of either an unusuallyoptically faint agn or a slowly varying phase of the transient. optical/irobservations show a clear bump in the light curve at timescales of 30-50 days,with a peak magnitude (corrected for host galaxy extinction) of $m_r \sim-22-23$. the luminosity of the bump is significantly higher than seen in other,non-relativistic tdfs and does not match any re-brightening seen at x-ray orradio wavelengths. its luminosity, light curve shape and spectrum are broadlysimilar to those seen in superluminous sne, although subject to largeuncertainties in the correction of the significant host extinction. we discussthese observations in the context of both tdf and massive star origins forswift j1644+5734 and other candidate relativistic tidal flares.

0807.3554	ifu observations of the grb 980425/sn 1998bw host galaxy: emission line  ratios in grb regions	the collapsar model predicts that the progenitors of gamma-ray bursts (grbs)are metal poor in fe group elements. the existence of low metallicity stellarpopulations could manifest itself through special characteristics of theimmediate environment of the grb site in the host galaxy. we analyse the strongemission lines from the sub-luminous host galaxy of grb 980425, which showedthe first connection with a supernova explosion (sn 1998bw). the host has asufficient size to allow detailed resolved spectroscopy of individual hiiregions and to look for regions with special properties close to the the grbsite. using integral field spectroscopy with vimos we cover most of the highsurface brightness part of the host including the hii region where thesupernova and grb occurred. the star formation rate, reddening, equivalentwidth and stellar mass in the grb region is similar to other hii regions in thehost. extreme values arise in the only region that shows emission lines fromwolf-rayet stars; a region that lies 800 pc in projection from the grb site.strong emission line diagnostics of all hii regions imply oxygen abundancesbetween 0.3 and 0.8 solar with the lowest values arising in the wr and grbregions. comparing the measured emission line ratios for a sample of lowredshift grb hosts to theoretical models and to observations of field galaxies,we find that grbs arise in a range of metallicity environments while theregions are consistently very young. the similar line ratios of grb hostscompared to the wr region can arise in spatially unresolved galaxies withbright hii regions near the grb location.

0808.2610	grb 070714b - discovery of the highest spectroscopically confirmed short  burst redshift	we detect the optical afterglow and host galaxy of grb 070714b. ourobservations of the afterglow show an initial plateau in the lightcurve forapproximately the first 5 to 25 minutes, then steepening to a powerlaw decaywith index alpha= 0.86 +/- 0.10 for the period between 1 to 24 hours postburst. this is consistent with the x-ray light-curve which shows an initialplateau followed by a similar subsequent decay. at late time, we detect a hostgalaxy at the location of the optical transient. gemini nod &amp; shufflespectroscopic observations of the host show a single emission line at 7167angstroms which, based on a grizjhk photometric redshift, we conclude is the3727 angstrom [o ii] line. we therefore find a redshift of z=0.923. thisredshift, as well as a subsequent probable spectroscopic redshift determinationof grb 070429b at z=0.904 by two other groups, significantly exceeds theprevious highest spectroscopically confirmed short burst redshift of z=0.546for grb 051221. this dramatically moves back the time at which we know shortbursts were being formed, and suggests that the present evidence for an oldprogenitor population may be observationally biased.

astro-ph;0510368	a log n(hi) = 22.6 dla in a dark gamma-ray burst: the environment of grb  050401	the optical afterglow spectrum of grb050401 (at z=2.8992+/-0.0004) shows thepresence of a dla, with log(nhi)=22.6+/-0.3. this is the highest column densityever observed in a dla, and is about five times larger than the strongest dladetected so far in any qso spectrum. from the optical spectrum, we also find avery large zn column density, allowing us to infer an abundance of[zn/h]=-1.0+/-0.4. these large columns are supported by the x-ray spectrum fromswift-xrt which shows a column density (in excess of galactic) oflog(nh)=22.21^{+0.06}_{-0.08} assuming solar abundances (at z=2.9). thecomparison of this x-ray column density, which is dominated by absorption dueto alpha-chain elements, and the hi column density derived from the ly-alphaabsorption line, allows us to derive a metallicity for the absorbing matter of[alpha/h]=-0.4+/-0.3. the optical spectrum is reddened and can be wellreproduced with a power-law with smc extinction, where a_v=0.62+/-0.06. but thetotal optical extinction can also be constrained in a way which is independentof the shape of the extinction curve: from the optical-to-x-ray spectral energydistribution we find, 0.5&lt;~a_v&lt;~4.5. however, even this upper limit,independent of the shape of the extinction curve, is still well below the dustcolumn that is inferred from the x-ray column density, i.e.a_v=9.1^{+1.4}_{-1.5}. this discrepancy might be explained by a small dustcontent with high metallicity (low dust-to-metals ratio). `grey' extinctioncannot explain the discrepancy since we are comparing the metallicity to ameasurement of the total extinction (without reference to the reddening).little dust with high metallicity may be produced by sublimation of dust grainsor may naturally exist in systems younger than a few hundred myr.

0809.1559	robust photometric redshift determinations of gamma-ray burst afterglows  at z &gt; 2	theory suggests that about 10% of swift-detected gamma-ray bursts (grbs) willoriginate at redshifts greater than 5 yet a number of high redshift candidatesmay be left unconfirmed due to the lack of measured redshifts. here weintroduce our code, grbz, a method of simultaneous multi-parameter fitting ofgrb afterglow optical and near infrared, spectral energy distributions. itallows for early determinations of the photometric redshift, spectral index andhost extinction to be made. we assume that grb afterglow spectra are wellrepresented by a power-law decay and model the effects of absorption due to thelyman forest and host extinction. we use a genetic algorithm-based routine tosimultaneously fit the parameters of interest, and a monte carlo erroranalysis. we use grbs of previously determined spectroscopic redshifts to proveour method, while also introducing new near infrared data of grb 990510 whichfurther constrains the value of the host extinction. our method is effective inestimating the photometric redshift of grbs, relatively unbiased by assumptionsof the afterglow spectral index or the host galaxy extinction. monte carloerror analysis is required as the method of error estimate based on the optimumpopulation of the genetic algorithm underestimates errors significantly.

astro-ph;0609450	hi column densities of z &gt; 2 swift gamma-ray bursts	context: before the launch of the swift satellite, the majority of thegamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows for which ly-alpha was redshifted into theobservable spectrum showed evidence for a damped ly-alpha absorber. this smallsample indicated that grbs explode either in galaxies, or regions within them,having high neutral hydrogen column densities.  aims: to increase the spectroscopic sample of grbs with z &gt; 2 and henceestablish the n(hi) distribution along grb lines-of-sight.  methods: we have obtained six z &gt; 2 grb afterglow spectra and fitted thely-alpha absorption line in each case to determine n(hi). this has beencomplemented with 12 other swift n(hi) values from the literature.  results: we show that the peak of the grb n(hi) distribution is qualitativelyconsistent with a model where grbs originate in galactic-like molecular clouds.however, a systematic difference, in particular an excess of low column-densitysystems compared to the predictions, indicates that selection effects andconditions within the cloud (e.g. strong ionization) influence the observedn(hi) range. we also report the discovery of ly-alpha emission from the grb060714 host, corresponding to a star-formation rate of approximately 0.8m_sun/year. finally, we present accurate redshifts of the six bursts: z = 3.240+/- 0.001 (grb 050319), z = 2.198 +/- 0.002 (grb 050922c), z = 3.221 +/- 0.001(grb 060526), z = 3.425 +/- 0.002 (grb 060707), z = 2.711 +/- 0.001 (grb060714) and z = 3.686 +/- 0.002 (grb 060906).

astro-ph;0610899	gamma-ray burst afterglows as probes of environment and blastwave  physics i: absorption by host galaxy gas and dust	we use a new approach to obtain limits on the absorbing columns towards aninitial sample of 10 long gamma-ray bursts observed with bepposax and selectedon the basis of their good optical and nir coverage, from simultaneous fits tonir, optical and x-ray afterglow data, in count space and including the effectsof metallicity. in no cases is a mw-like extinction preferred, when testing mw,lmc and smc extinction laws. the 2175a bump would in principle be detectable inall these afterglows, but is not present in the data. an smc-like gas-to-dustratio or lower value can be ruled out for 4 of the hosts analysed here(assuming smc metallicity and extinction law) whilst the remainder of thesample have too large an error to discriminate. we provide a more accurateestimate of the line-of-sight extinction and improve upon the uncertainties forthe majority of the extinction measurements made in previous studies of thissample. we discuss this method to determine extinction values in comparisonwith the most commonly employed existing methods.

0706.1188	grb 060206 and the quandary of achromatic breaks in afterglow light  curves	gamma-ray burst afterglow observations in the swift era have a perceived lackof achromatic jet breaks compared to the bepposax era. we present ourmulti-wavelength analysis of grb 060206 as an illustrative example of howinferences of jet breaks from optical and x-ray data might differ. the resultsof temporal and spectral analyses are compared, and attempts are made to fitthe data within the context of the standard blast wave model. we find thatwhile the break appears more pronounced in the optical and evidence for it fromthe x-ray alone is weak, the data are actually consistent with an achromaticbreak at about 16 hours. this break and the light curves fit standard blastwave models, either as a jet break or as an injection break. as the pre-swiftsample of afterglows are dominated by optical observations, and in the swiftera most well sampled light curves are in the x-ray, caution is needed whenmaking a direct comparison between the two samples, and when making definitestatements on the absence of achromatic breaks.
