0901.1436	precision astrometry with the very long baseline array: parallaxes and  proper motions for 14 pulsars	astrometry can bring powerful constraints to bear on a variety of scientificquestions about neutron stars, including their origins, astrophysics,evolution, and environments. using phase-referenced observations at the vlba,in conjunction with pulsar gating and in-beam calibration, we have measured theparallaxes and proper motions for 14 pulsars. the smallest measured parallax inour sample is 0.13+-0.02 mas for psr b1541+09, which has a most probabledistance of 7.2+1.3-1.1 kpc. we detail our methods, including initial vlasurveys to select candidates and find in-beam calibrators, vlbaphase-referencing, pulsar gating, calibration, and data reduction. the use ofthe bootstrap method to estimate astrometric uncertainties in the presence ofunmodeled systematic errors is also described. based on our newmodel-independent estimates for distance and transverse velocity, weinvestigate the kinematics and birth sites of the pulsars and revisit models ofthe galactic electron density distribution. we find that young pulsars aremoving away from the galactic plane, as expected, and that age estimates fromkinematics and pulsar spindown are generally in agreement, with certain notableexceptions. given its present trajectory, the pulsar b2045-16 was plausiblyborn in the open cluster ngc 6604. for several high-latitude pulsars, thene2001 electron density model underestimates the parallax distances by a factorof two, while in others the estimates agree with or are larger than theparallax distances, suggesting that the interstellar medium is irregular onrelevant length scales. the vlba astrometric results for the recycled pulsarj1713+0747 are consistent with two independent estimates from pulse timing,enabling a consistency check between the different reference frames.

0906.1394	discovery of extended x-ray emission around the highly magnetic rrat  j1819-1458	we report on the discovery of extended x-ray emission around the highmagnetic field rotating radio transient j1819-1458. using a 30ks chandra acis-sobservation, we found significant evidence for extended x-ray emission with apeculiar shape: a compact region out to 5.5", and more diffuse emissionextending out to ~13" from the source. the most plausible interpretation is anebula somehow powered by the pulsar, although the small number of countsprevents a conclusive answer on the nature of this emission. rrat j1819-1458'sspin-down energy loss rate (edot~3x10^{32} erg/s) is much lower than that ofother pulsars with observed spin-down powered pulsar wind nebulae (pwne), andimplies a rather high x-ray efficiency of eta_{x} = l_(pwn; 0.5-8kev)/edot~0.2at converting spin-down power into the pwn x-ray emission. this suggests theneed of an additional source of energy rather than the spin-down power alone,such as the high magnetic energy of this source. furthermore, this chandraobservation allowed us to refine the positional accuracy of rrat j1819-1458 toa radius of ~0.3", and confirms the presence of x-ray pulsations and the ~1kevabsorption line, previously observed in the x-ray emission of this source.

0906.1543	alfven wave in higher dimensional space time	following the wellknown spacetime decomposition technique as applied to (d+1)dimensions we write down the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (mhd) in aspatially at generalised frw universe. assuming an equation of state for thebackground cosmic fluid we find solutions in turn for acous- tic waves and alsofor alfven waves in a warm (cold) magnetised plasma. interestingly thedifferent plasma modes closely resemble the at space coun- terparts except thathere the field variables all redshift with their time due to the expansion ofthe background. it is observed that in the ultrarelativistic limit the fieldparameters all scale as the free photon. the situation changes in theprerelativistic limit where the frequencies change in a bizarre fashiondepending on initial conditions. it is observed that for a fixed magnetic fieldin a particular medium the alfven wave velocity decreases with the number ofdimensions, being the maximum in the usual 4d. further for a fixed dimensionthe velocity attenuation is more significant in dust compared to the radiationera. we also find that in an expanding background the alfven wave propaga- tionis possible only in the high frequency range, determined by the strength of theexternal magnetic field, the mass density of the medium and also the dimensionsof the spacetime. further it is found that with expansion the cosmic magneticfield decays more sharply in higher dimensional cosmology, which is in linewith observational demand.

0908.3819	upper limits on x-ray emission from two rotating radio transients	x-ray emission from the enigmatic rotating radio transients (rrats) offers avital clue to understanding these objects and how they relate to the greaterneutron star population. an x-ray counterpart to j1819-1458 is known, and itsproperties are similar to those of other middle-aged (0.1 myr) neutron stars.we have searched for x-ray emission with chandra/acis at the positions of tworrats with arcsecond (or better) localisation, j0847-4316 and j1846-0257.despite deep searches (especially for j1847-0257) we did not detect anyemission with 0.3-8 kev count-rate limits of 1 counts/ks and 0.068 counts/ks,respectively, at 3sigma confidence. assuming thermal emission similar to thatseen from j1819-1458 (a blackbody with radius of approximately 20 km), wederive effective temperature limits of 77 ev and 91 ev for the nominal valuesof the distances and column densities to both sources, although both of thosequantities are highly uncertain and correlated. if we instead fix thetemperature of the emission (a blackbody with kt=0.14 kev), we deriveunabsorbed luminosity limits in the 0.3-8 kev range of 1e32 erg/s and 3e32erg/s. these limits are considerably below the luminosity of j1819-1458 (4e33erg/s), suggesting that rrats j0847-4316 and j1846-0257 have cooled beyond thepoint of visibility (plausible given the differences in characteristic age).however, as we have not detected x-ray emission, it may also be that theemission from rrats j0847-4316 and j1846-0257 has a different character fromthat of j1819-1458. the two non-detections may prove a counterpoint toj1819-1458, but more detections are certainly needed before we can begin toderive general x-ray emission properties for the rrat populations.

1006.0476	quintessential phenomena in higher dimensional space time	the higher dimensional cosmology provides a natural setting to treat, at aclassical level, the cosmological effects of vacuum energy. here we discuss twosituations where starting with an ordinary matter field without any equation ofstate we end up with a chaplygin type of gas apparently as a consequence ofextra dimensions. in the second case we study the quintessential phenomena inhigher dimensional spacetime with the help of a chaplygin type of matter field.the first case suffers from the disqualification that no dimensional reductionoccurs, which is, however, rectified in the second case. both the models showthe sought after feature of occurrence of \emph{flip} in the rate of expansion.it is observed that with the increase of dimensions the occurrence of\emph{flip} is delayed for both the models, more in line with currentobservational demands. interestingly we see that depending on some initialconditions our model admits qcdm, $\lambda$cdm and also phantom like evolutionwithin a unified framework. our solutions are general in nature in the sensethat when the extra dimensions are switched off the known 4d model isrecovered.

1012.1706	inhomogeneities in dusty universe - a possible alternative to dark  energy?	there have been of late renewed debates on the role of inhomogeneities toexplain the observed late acceleration of the universe. we have looked into theproblem analytically with the help of the well known spherically symmetric butinhomogeneous lemaitre-tolman-bondi(ltb) model generalised to higherdimensions. it is observed that in contrast to the claim made by kolb et al thepresence of inhomogeneities as well as extra dimensions can not reverse thesignature of the deceleration parameter if the matter field obeys the energyconditions. the well known raychaudhuri equation also points to the sameresult. without solving the field equations explicitly it can, however, beshown that although the total deceleration is positive everywhere neverthelessit does not exclude the possibility of having radial acceleration, even in thepure dust universe, if the angular scale factor is decelerating fast enough andvice versa. moreover it is found that introduction of extra dimensions can notreverse the scenario. to the contrary it actually helps the deceleratingprocess.

1111.4216	multiwavelength constraints on pulsar populations in the galactic center	the detection of radio pulsars within the central few parsecs of the galaxywould provide a unique probe of the gravitational and magneto-ionicenvironments in the galactic center (gc) and, if close enough to sgr a*,precise tests of general relativity in the strong-field regime. while it isdifficult to find pulsars at radio wavelengths because of interstellarscattering, the payoff from detailed timing of pulsars in the gc warrants aconcerted effort. to motivate pulsar surveys and help define search parametersfor them, we constrain the pulsar number and spatial distribution using a widerange of multiwavelength measurements. these include the five known radiopulsars within 15 arcmin of sgr a*, radio and gamma-ray measurements of diffuseemission, non-detections in high frequency pulsar surveys of the centralparsec, a catalog of radio point sources from an imaging survey, infraredobservations of massive star populations in the central few parsecs, candidatepulsar wind nebulae in the inner 20 pc and estimates of the core-collapsesupernova rate based on x-ray measurements. we find that under currentobservational constraints, the inner parsec of the galaxy could harbor as manyas ~10^3 active radio pulsars that are beamed towards earth. such a largepopulation would distort the low-frequency measurements of both the intrinsicspectrum of sgr a* and the free-free absorption along the line of sight of sgra*.

1210.2469	the benefits of vlbi astrometry to pulsar timing array searches for  gravitational radiation	precision astrometry is an integral component of successful pulsar timingcampaigns. astrometric parameters are commonly derived by fitting them asparameters of a timing model to a series of pulse times of arrival (toas). toasmeasured to microsecond precision over several-year spans can yield positionmeasurements with sub-milliarcsecond precision. however, timing-basedastrometry can become biased if a pulsar displays any red spin noise, which canbe compared to the red noise signal produced by the stochastic gravitationalwave background. we investigate how noise of different spectral types isabsorbed by timing models, leading to significant estimation errors in theastrometric parameters. we find that commonly used techniques for fittingtiming models in the presence of red noise (cholesky whitening) prevent theabsorption of noise into the timing model remarkably well if the time baselineof observations exceeds several years, but are inadequate for dealing withshorter pulsar data sets. independent of timing, pulsar-optimized very longbaseline interferometry (vlbi) is capable of providing position estimatesprecise to the sub-milliarcsecond levels needed for high-precision timing. wecompute a necessary transformation between the international celestialreference frame and pulsar timing frames and quantitatively discuss how thetransformation will improve in coming years. we find that incorporating vlbiastrometry into the timing models of pulsars for which only a couple of yearsof timing data exist will lead to more realistic assessments of red spin noiseand could enhance the amplitude of gravitational wave signatures in post-fittiming residuals by factors of 20 or more.

1305.0447	peace: pulsar evaluation algorithm for candidate extraction -- a  software package for post-analysis processing of pulsar survey candidates	modern radio pulsar surveys produce a large volume of prospective candidates,the majority of which are polluted by human-created radio frequencyinterference or other forms of noise. typically, large numbers of candidatesneed to be visually inspected in order to determine if they are real pulsars.this process can be labor intensive. in this paper, we introduce an algorithmcalled peace (pulsar evaluation algorithm for candidate extraction) whichimproves the efficiency of identifying pulsar signals. the algorithm ranks thecandidates based on a score function. unlike popular machine-learning basedalgorithms, no prior training data sets are required. this algorithm has beenapplied to data from several large-scale radio pulsar surveys. using thehuman-based ranking results generated by students in the arecibo remote commandenter programme, the statistical performance of peace was evaluated. it wasfound that peace ranked 68% of the student-identified pulsars within the top0.17% of sorted candidates, 95% within the top 0.34%, and 100% within the top3.7%. this clearly demonstrates that peace significantly increases the pulsaridentification rate by a factor of about 50 to 1000. to date, peace has beendirectly responsible for the discovery of 47 new pulsars, 5 of which aremillisecond pulsars that may be useful for pulsar timing basedgravitational-wave detection projects.

0801.1142	a precise proper motion for the crab pulsar, and the difficulty of  testing spin-kick alignment for young neutron stars	we present a detailed measurement of the proper motion of the crab pulsar,with the primary goal of comparing the direction of its proper motion with theprojected axis of its pulsar wind nebula (the projected spin axis of thepulsar). we demonstrate that our measurement is robust and has an uncertaintyof only +/-0.4 mas/yr on each component of the proper motion. we find mu_alpha= -11.7+/-0.4+/-0.5 mas/yr and mu_delta = +4.2+/-0.4+/-0.5 mas/yr relative tothe pulsar's standard of rest, where the two uncertainties are from themeasurement and the ncertainties in correcting the proper motion referenceframe, respectively. comparing this proper motion to the symmetry axis of thepulsar wind nebula, we must also consider the unknown velocity of the pulsar'sprogenitor (assumed to be ~10 km/s), and hence add an additional uncertainty of+/-2 mas/yr to each component of the proper motion, although this could besignificantly larger. this implies a projected misalignment with the nebularaxis of 14+/-2+/-9 degrees. we conclude that the precision of individualmeasurements which compare the direction of motion of a neutron star to a fixedaxis will often be limited by fundamental uncertainties regarding referenceframes and progenitor properties. the question of spin-kick (mis)alignment, andits implications for asymmetries and other processes during supernovacore-collapse, is best approached by considering a statistical ensemble of suchmeasurements, rather than detailed studies of individual sources.

1305.7204	constraining modified chaplygin gas parameters	we investigate the evolution of a frw model fuelled by a modified chaplygingas with an equation of state $p = a\rho -\frac{b}{\rho^\alpha}$. an attempt ismade here to constrain the free parameters of mcg model through the wellknowncontour plot technique using observational data. the permissible range ofvalues of the pair of free parameters are determined to study the viability ofcosmological models \emph{vis-a-vis} observational results. aside from allowingthe desirable feature of \emph{flip} of the sign of deceleration parameter wealso find that the transition from the decelerating to the accelerating phaseoccurs at relatively low value of redshift in accordance with the observationalprediction that the acceleration is a recent phenomenon. it is found that theeffective acoustic speed may become imaginary depending upon the initialconditions signalling that perturbations associated with instability sets inresulting in structure formation. as one considers more negative values of $a$the \emph{flip} in sign is delayed resulting the density parameter to changefast. again it is found from the contour plot that compatibility withobservational results is admitted with a value of $a$ which is very near tozero or a small negative number.

1309.0776	searching for pulsars using image pattern recognition	in this paper, we present a novel artificial intelligence (ai) program thatidentifies pulsars from recent surveys using image pattern recognition withdeep neural nets---the pics (pulsar image-based classification system) ai. theai mimics human experts and distinguishes pulsars from noise and interferencesby looking for patterns from candidate. the information from each pulsarcandidate is synthesized in four diagnostic plots, which consist of up tothousands pixel of image data. the ai takes these data from each candidate asits input and uses thousands of such candidates to train its ~9000 neurons.different from other pulsar selection programs which use pre-designed patterns,the pics ai teaches itself the salient features of different pulsars from a setof human-labeled candidates through machine learning. the deep neural networksin this ai system grant it superior ability in recognizing various types ofpulsars as well as their harmonic signals. the trained ai's performance hasbeen validated with a large set of candidates different from the training set.in this completely independent test, pics ranked 264 out of 277 pulsar-relatedcandidates, including all 56 previously known pulsars, to the top 961 (1%) of90008 test candidates, missing only 13 harmonics. the first non-pulsarcandidate appears at rank 187, following 45 pulsars and 141 harmonics. in otherwords, 100% of the pulsars were ranked in the top 1% of all candidates, while80% were ranked higher than any noise or interference. the performance of thissystem can be improved over time as more training data are accumulated. this aisystem has been integrated into the palfa survey pipeline and has discoveredsix new pulsars to date.

1310.5857	timing of a young mildly recycled pulsar with a massive white dwarf  companion	we report on timing observations of the recently discovered binary pulsar psrj1952+2630 using the arecibo observatory. the mildly recycled 20.7-ms pulsar isin a 9.4-hr orbit with a massive, m_wd &gt; 0.93 m_sun, white dwarf (wd)companion. we present, for the first time, a phase-coherent timing solution,with precise spin, astrometric, and keplerian orbital parameters. this showsthat the characteristic age of psr j1952+2630 is 77 myr, younger by one orderof magnitude than any other recycled pulsar-massive wd system. we derive anupper limit on the true age of the system of 50 myr. we investigate theformation of psr j1952+2630 using detailed modelling of the mass-transferprocess from a naked helium star on to the neutron star following acommon-envelope phase (case bb roche-lobe overflow). from our modelling of theprogenitor system, we constrain the accretion efficiency of the neutron star,which suggests a value between 100 and 300% of the eddington accretion limit.we present numerical models of the chemical structure of a possibleoxygen-neon-magnesium wd companion. furthermore, we calculate the past and thefuture spin evolution of psr j1952+2630, until the system merges in about 3.4gyr due to gravitational wave emission. although we detect no relativisticeffects in our timing analysis we show that several such effects will becomemeasurable with continued observations over the next 10 years; thus psrj1952+2630 has potential as a testbed for gravitational theories.

1401.0535	a millisecond pulsar in a stellar triple system	gravitationally bound three-body systems have been studied for hundreds ofyears and are common in our galaxy. they show complex orbital interactions,which can constrain the compositions, masses, and interior structures of thebodies and test theories of gravity, if sufficiently precise measurements areavailable. a triple system containing a radio pulsar could provide suchmeasurements, but the only previously known such system, b1620-26 (with amillisecond pulsar, a white dwarf, and a planetary-mass object in an orbit ofseveral decades), shows only weak interactions. here we report precision timingand multi-wavelength observations of psr j0337+1715, a millisecond pulsar in ahierarchical triple system with two other stars. strong gravitationalinteractions are apparent and provide the masses of the pulsar (1.4378(13)msun, where msun is the solar mass and the parentheses contain the uncertaintyin the final decimal places) and the two white dwarf companions (0.19751(15)msun and 0.4101(3) msun), as well as the inclinations of the orbits (bothapproximately 39.2 degrees). the unexpectedly coplanar and nearly circularorbits indicate a complex and exotic evolutionary past that differs from thoseof known stellar systems. the gravitational field of the outer white dwarfstrongly accelerates the inner binary containing the neutron star, and thesystem will thus provide an ideal laboratory in which to test the strongequivalence principle of general relativity.

1401.0716	radio astronomy in lsst era	a community meeting on the topic of "radio astronomy in the lsst era" washosted by the national radio astronomy observatory in charlottesville, va (2013may 6--8). the focus of the workshop was on time domain radio astronomy and skysurveys. for the time domain, the extent to which radio and visible wavelengthobservations are required to understand several classes of transients wasstressed, but there are also classes of radio transients for which no visiblewavelength counterpart is yet known, providing an opportunity for discovery.from the lsst perspective, the lsst is expected to generate as many as 1million alerts nightly, which will require even more selective specificationand identification of the classes and characteristics of transients that canwarrant follow up, at radio or any wavelength. the lsst will also conduct adeep survey of the sky, producing a catalog expected to contain over 38 billionobjects in it. deep radio wavelength sky surveys will also be conducted on acomparable time scale, and radio and visible wavelength observations are partof the multi-wavelength approach needed to classify and understand theseobjects. radio wavelengths are valuable because they are unaffected by dustobscuration and, for galaxies, contain contributions both from star formationand from active galactic nuclei. the workshop touched on several other topics,on which there was consensus including the placement of other lsst "deepdrilling fields," inter-operability of software tools, and the challenge offiltering and exploiting the lsst data stream. there were also topics for whichthere was insufficient time for full discussion or for which no consensus wasreached, which included the procedures for following up on lsst observationsand the nature for future support of researchers desiring to use lsst dataproducts.

1404.1267	nanograv limits on gravitational waves from individual supermassive  black hole binaries in circular orbits	the north american nanohertz observatory for gravitational waves (nanograv)project currently observes 43 pulsars using the green bank and arecibo radiotelescopes. in this work we use a subset of 17 pulsars timed for a span ofroughly five years (2005--2010). we analyze these data using standard pulsartiming models, with the addition of time-variable dispersion measure andfrequency-variable pulse shape terms. within the timing data, we perform asearch for continuous gravitational waves from individual supermassive blackhole binaries in circular orbits using robust frequentist and bayesiantechniques. we find that there is no evidence for the presence of a detectablecontinuous gravitational wave; however, we can use these data to place the mostconstraining upper limits to date on the strength of such gravitational waves.using the full 17 pulsar dataset we place a 95% upper limit on the sky-averagedstrain amplitude of $h_0\lesssim 3.8\times 10^{-14}$ at a frequency of 10 nhz.furthermore, we place 95% \emph{all sky} lower limits on the luminositydistance to such gravitational wave sources finding that the $d_l \gtrsim 425$mpc for sources at a frequency of 10 nhz and chirp mass $10^{10}{\rmm}_{\odot}$. we find that for gravitational wave sources near our best timedpulsars in the sky, the sensitivity of the pulsar timing array is increased bya factor of $\sim$4 over the sky-averaged sensitivity. finally we place limitson the coalescence rate of the most massive supermassive black hole binaries.

1404.2934	fast radio burst discovered in the arecibo pulsar alfa survey	recent work has exploited pulsar survey data to identify temporally isolated,millisecond-duration radio bursts with large dispersion measures (dms). thesebursts have been interpreted as arising from a population of extragalacticsources, in which case they would provide unprecedented opportunities forprobing the intergalactic medium; they may also be linked to new sourceclasses. until now, however, all so-called fast radio bursts (frbs) have beendetected with the parkes radio telescope and its 13-beam receiver, casting someconcern about the astrophysical nature of these signals. here we present frb121102, the first frb discovery from a geographic location other than parkes.frb 121102 was found in the galactic anti-center region in the 1.4-ghz pulsaralfa survey with the arecibo observatory with a dm = 557.4 $\pm$ 3 pccm$^{-3}$, pulse width of $3\; \pm 0.5$ ms, and no evidence of interstellarscattering. the observed delay of the signal arrival time with frequency agreesprecisely with the expectation of dispersion through an ionized medium. despiteits low galactic latitude ($b = -0.2^{\circ}$), the burst has three times themaximum galactic dm expected along this particular line-of-sight, suggesting anextragalactic origin. a peculiar aspect of the signal is an inverted spectrum;we interpret this as a consequence of being detected in a sidelobe of the alfareceiver. frb 121102's brightness, duration, and the inferred event rate areall consistent with the properties of the previously detected parkes bursts.

1404.5682	assessing pulsar timing array sensitivity to gravitational wave bursts  with memory	highly energetic astrophysical phenomena like supermassive black hole binary(smbhb) mergers are predicted to emit prodigious amounts of gravitational waves(gws). an anticipated component of the gravitational waveform known as "memory"is permanent and non-oscillatory. for smbhb mergers, the memory is createdprimarily during the most violent moments of the inspiral immediately precedingthe final plunge and ring-down when the strongest gravitational fields are atwork and the non-linearities of general relativity are most pronounced. theessentially time-domain nature of memory makes it forbiddingly difficult todetect with ground based gw detectors, leaving pulsar timing array (pta)experiments as the most promising means by which it may be detected andstudied. in this paper, we discuss how gw bursts with memory (bwms) influencepulsar timing experiments and develop methods to assess how sensitive moderntiming efforts are to such gw events. we discuss how pta searches for bwms canbe used to constrain the rate of bwms and how these constraints relate toinformation regarding the population of smbhbs.

1405.7953	arecibo pulsar survey using alfa. iii. precursor survey and population  synthesis	the pulsar arecibo l-band feed array (palfa) survey uses the alfa 7-beamreceiver to search both inner and outer galactic sectors visible from arecibo($32^{\circ}\lesssim \ell \lesssim 77^{\circ}$ and $168^{\circ}\lesssim \ell  \lesssim 214^{\circ}$) close to the galactic plane ($|b|\lesssim5^{\circ}$)for pulsars. in this paper we detail a precursor survey of this region withpalfa, which observed a subset of the full region (slightly more restrictive in$\ell$ and $|b|\lesssim1^{\circ}$) and detected 45 pulsars. for both galacticmillisecond and normal pulsar populations, we compare the survey's detectionswith simulations to model these populations and, in particular, to estimate thenumber of observable pulsars in the galaxy. we place 95\% confidence intervalsof 82,000 to 143,000 on the number of detectable normal pulsars and 9,000 to100,000 on the number of detectable millisecond pulsars in the galactic disk.these are consistent with previous estimates. given the most likely populationsize in each case (107,000 and 15,000 for normal and millisecond pulsars,respectively) we extend survey detection simulations to predict that, whencomplete, the full palfa survey should have detected $1,000\substack{+330 \\-230}$ normal pulsars and $30\substack{+200 \\ -20}$ millisecond pulsars.identical estimation techniques predict that $490\substack{+160 \\ -115}$normal pulsars and $12\substack{+70 \\ -5}$ millisecond pulsars would bedetected by the beginning of 2014; at the time, the palfa survey had detected283 normal pulsars and 31 millisecond pulsars, respectively.

1408.1694	a 24-hour global campaign to assess precision timing of the millisecond  pulsar j1713+0747	the radio millisecond pulsar j1713+0747 is regarded as one of thehighest-precision clocks in the sky, and is regularly timed for the purpose ofdetecting gravitational waves. the international pulsar timing arraycollaboration undertook a 24-hour global observation of psr j1713+0747 in aneffort to better quantify sources of timing noise in this pulsar, particularlyon intermediate (1 - 24 hr) timescales. we observed the pulsar continuouslyover 24 hr with the arecibo, effelsberg, gmrt, green bank, lofar, lovell,nancay, parkes, and wsrt radio telescopes. the combined pulse times-of-arrivalpresented here provide an estimate of what sources of timing noise, excludingdm variations, would be present as compared to an idealized root-n improvementin timing precision, where n is the number of pulses analyzed. in the case ofthis particular pulsar, we find that intrinsic pulse phase jitter dominatesarrival time precision when the s/n of single pulses exceeds unity, as measuredusing the eight telescopes that observed at l-band/1.4 ghz. we present firstresults of specific phenomena probed on the unusually long timescale (for asingle continuous observing session) of tens of hours, in particularinterstellar scintillation, and discuss the degree to which scintillation andprofile evolution affect precision timing. this paper presents the data set asa basis for future, deeper studies.

1409.7221	spin glass like ground state and observation of exchange bias in  mn_{0.8}fe_{0.2}nige alloy	the ground-state magnetic properties of hexagonal equiatomic alloy of nominalcomposition mn_{0.8}fe_{0.2}nige were investigated through dc magnetization andheat capacity measurements. the alloy undergoes first order martensitictransition below 140 k with simultaneous development of long rangeferromagnetic ordering from the high temperature paramagnetic phase. theundoped compound mnnige has an antiferromagnetic ground state and it showsmartensitic like structural instability well above room temperature. fe dopingat the mn site not only brings down the martensitic transition temperature, italso induces ferromagnetism in the sample. our study brings out two importantaspects regarding the sample, namley (i) the observation of exchange bias atlow temperature, and (ii) spin glass like ground state which prevails below themartensitic and magnetic transition points. in addition to the observed usualrelaxation behavior the spin glass state is confirmed by zero field cooledmemory experiment, thereby indicating cooperative freezing of spin and/or spinclusters rather than uncorrelated dynamics of superparamagnetic like spinclusters. we believe that doping disorder can give rise to some islands ofantiferromagnetic clusters in the otherwise ferromagnetic background which canproduce interfacial frustration and exchange pinning responsible for spin glassand exchange bias effect. a comparison is made with doped rare-earth manganiteswhere similar phase separation can lead to glassy ground state.

0803.4449	general relativistic plasma in higher dimensional space time	the well known (3+1) decomposition of thorne and macdonald is invoked towrite down the einstein-maxwell equations generalised to (d+1) dimensions andalso to formulate the plasma equations in a flat frw like spacetime in higherdimensions (hd). assuming an equation of state for the background metric wefind solutions as also dispersion relations in different regimes of theuniverse in a unified manner both for magnetised(un) cold plasma. we find thatfor a free photon in expanding background we get maximum redshift in 4dspacetime, while for a particular dimension it is so in pre recombination era.further wave propagation in magnetised plasma is possible for a restrictedfrequency range only, depending on the number of dimensions. relevant to pointout that unlike the special relativistic result this allowed range evolves withtime. interestingly the dielectric constant of the plasma media remainsconstant, not sharing the expansion of the background, which generalises asimilar 4d result of holcomb-tajima in radiation background to the case ofhigher dimensions with cosmic matter obeying an equation of state . further,analogous to the flat space static case we observe the phenomenon of faradayrotation in higher dimensional case also.

1411.1764	pulsar timing errors from asynchronous multi-frequency sampling of  dispersion measure variations	free electrons in the interstellar medium cause frequency-dependent delays inpulse arrival times due to both scattering and dispersion. multi-frequencymeasurements are used to estimate and remove dispersion delays. in this paper,we focus on the effect of any non-simultaneity of multi-frequency observationson dispersive delay estimation and removal. interstellar density variationscombined with changes in the line-of-sight from pulsar and observer motionscause dispersion measure variations with an approximately power-law powerspectrum, augmented in some cases by linear trends. we simulate time series,estimate the magnitude and statistical properties of timing errors that resultfrom non-simultaneous observations, and derive prescriptions for dataacquisition that are needed in order to achieve a specified timing precision.for nearby, highly stable pulsars, measurements need to be simultaneous towithin about one day in order that the timing error from asynchronous dmcorrection is less than about 10 ns. we discuss how timing precision improveswhen increasing the number of dual-frequency observations used in dispersionmeasure estimation for a given epoch. for a kolmogorov wavenumber spectrum, wefind about a factor of two improvement in precision timing when increasing fromtwo to three observations but diminishing returns thereafter.

1501.00056	a cosmic census of radio pulsars with the ska	the square kilometre array (ska) will make ground breaking discoveries inpulsar science. in this chapter we outline the ska surveys for new pulsars, aswell as how we will perform the necessary follow-up timing observations. theska's wide field-of-view, high sensitivity, multi-beaming and sub-arrayingcapabilities, coupled with advanced pulsar search backends, will result in thediscovery of a large population of pulsars. these will enable the ska's pulsarscience goals (tests of general relativity with pulsar binary systems,investigating black hole theorems with pulsar-black hole binaries, and directdetection of gravitational waves in a pulsar timing array). using ska1-mid andska1-low we will survey the milky way to unprecedented depth, increasing thenumber of known pulsars by more than an order of magnitude. ska2 willpotentially find all the galactic radio-emitting pulsars in the ska sky whichare beamed in our direction. this will give a clear picture of the birthproperties of pulsars and of the gravitational potential, magnetic fieldstructure and interstellar matter content of the galaxy. targeted searches willenable detection of exotic systems, such as the ~1000 pulsars we infer to beclosely orbiting sgr a*, the supermassive black hole in the galactic centre. inaddition, the ska's sensitivity will be sufficient to detect pulsars in localgroup galaxies. to derive the spin characteristics of the discoveries we willperform live searches, and use sub-arraying and dynamic scheduling to timepulsars as soon as they are discovered, while simultaneously continuing surveyobservations. the large projected number of discoveries suggests that we willuncover currently unknown rare systems that can be exploited to push theboundaries of our understanding of astrophysics and provide tools for testingphysics, as has been done by the pulsar community in the past.

1501.00281	observing radio pulsars in the galactic centre with the square kilometre  array	the discovery and timing of radio pulsars within the galactic centre is afundamental aspect of the ska science case, responding to the topic of "strongfield tests of gravity with pulsars and black holes" (kramer et al. 2004;cordes et al. 2004). pulsars have in many ways proven to be excellent tools fortesting the general theory of relativity and alternative gravity theories (seewex (2014) for a recent review). timing a pulsar in orbit around a companion,provides a unique way of probing the relativistic dynamics and spacetime ofsuch a system. the strictest tests of gravity, in strong field conditions, areexpected to come from a pulsar orbiting a black hole. in this sense, a pulsarin a close orbit ($p_{\rm orb}$ &lt; 1 yr) around our nearest supermassive blackhole candidate, sagittarius a* - at a distance of ~8.3 kpc in the galacticcentre (gillessen et al. 2009a) - would be the ideal tool. given the size ofthe orbit and the relativistic effects associated with it, even a slowlyspinning pulsar would allow the black hole spacetime to be explored in greatdetail (liu et al. 2012). for example, measurement of the frame dragging causedby the rotation of the supermassive black hole, would allow a test of the"cosmic censorship conjecture." the "no-hair theorem" can be tested bymeasuring the quadrupole moment of the black hole. these are two of the primeexamples for the fundamental studies of gravity one could do with a pulsararound sagittarius a*. as will be shown here, ska1-mid and ultimately the skawill provide the opportunity to begin to find and time the pulsars in thisextreme environment.

1501.07535	fast transients at cosmological distances with the ska	impulsive radio bursts that are detectable across cosmological distancesconstitute extremely powerful probes of the ionized inter-galactic medium(igm), intergalactic magnetic fields, and the properties of space-time itself.their dispersion measures (dms) will enable us to detect the "missing" baryonsin the low-redshift universe and make the first measurements of the mean galaxyhalo profile, a key parameter in models of galaxy formation and feedback.impulsive bursts can be used as cosmic rulers at redshifts exceeding 2, andconstrain the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, $w(z)$ at redshiftsbeyond those readily accessible by type ia sne. both of these goals arerealisable with a sample of $\sim 10^4$ fast radio bursts (frbs) whosepositions are localized to within one arcsecond, sufficient to obtain hostgalaxy redshifts via optical follow-up. it is also hypothesised thatgravitational wave events may emit coherent emission at frequencies probed byska1-low, and the localization of such events at cosmological distances wouldenable their use as cosmological standard sirens.  to perform this science, such bursts must be localized to their specific hostgalaxies so that their redshifts may be obtained and compared against theirdispersion measures, rotation measures, and scattering properties. the ska canachieve this with a design that has a wide field-of-view, a substantialfraction of its collecting area in a compact configuration (80\% within a 3\,kmradius), and a capacity to attach high-time-resolution instrumentation to itssignal path.

1502.04424	membrane based deformable mirror: intrinsic aberrations and alignment  issues	a deformable mirror (dm) is an important component of an adaptive opticssystem. it is known that an on-axis spherical/parabolic optical component,placed at an angle to the incident beam introduces defocus as well asastigmatism in the image plane. although the former can be compensated bychanging the focal plane position, the latter cannot be removed by mere opticalre-alignment. since the dm is to be used to compensate a turbulence-inducedcurvature term in addition to other aberrations, it is necessary to determinethe aberrations induced by such (curved dm surface) an optical element whenplaced at an angle (other than 0 degree) of incidence in the optical path. tothis effect, we estimate to a first order, the aberrations introduced by a dmas a function of the incidence angle and deformation of the dm surface. werecord images using a simple setup in which the incident beam is reflected by a37 channel micro-machined membrane deformable mirror for various angles ofincidence. it is observed that astigmatism is a dominant aberration which wasdetermined by measuring the difference between the tangential and sagital focalplanes. we justify our results on the basis of theoretical simulations anddiscuss the feasibility of using such a system for adaptive optics consideringa trade-off between wavefront correction and astigmatism due to deformation.

1512.08326	the nanograv nine-year data set: noise budget for pulsar arrival times  on intraday timescales	the use of pulsars as astrophysical clocks for gravitational wave experimentsdemands the highest possible timing precision. pulse times of arrival (toas)are limited by stochastic processes that occur in the pulsar itself, along theline of sight through the interstellar medium, and in the measurement process.on timescales of seconds to hours, the toa variance exceeds that fromtemplate-fitting errors due to additive noise. we assess contributions to thetotal variance from two additional effects: amplitude and phase jitterintrinsic to single pulses and changes in the interstellar impulse responsefrom scattering. the three effects have different dependencies on time,frequency, and pulse signal-to-noise ratio. we use data on 37 pulsars from thenorth american nanohertz observatory for gravitational waves to assess theindividual contributions to the overall intraday noise budget for each pulsar.we detect jitter in 22 pulsars and estimate the average value of rms jitter inour pulsars to be $\sim 1\%$ of pulse phase. we examine how jitter evolves as afunction of frequency and find evidence for evolution. finally, we compare ourmeasurements with previous noise parameter estimates and discuss methods toimprove gravitational wave detection pipelines.

astro-ph;0004273	limits on radio emission from pulsar wind nebulae	we report on a sensitive survey for radio pulsar wind nebulae (pwn) towards27 energetic and/or high velocity pulsars. observations were carried out at 1.4ghz using the very large array and the australia telescope compact array, andutilised pulsar-gating to search for off-pulse emission. these observingparameters resulted in a considerably more sensitive search than previoussurveys, and could detect pwn over a much wider range of spatial scales (andhence ambient densities and pulsar velocities). however, no emission clearlycorresponding to a pwn was discovered. based on these non-detections we arguethat the young and energetic pulsars in our sample have winds typical of youngpulsars, but produce unobservable pwn because they reside in low density (napprox 0.003 cm^-3) regions of the ism. however, non-detections of pwn aroundolder and less energetic pulsars can only be explained if the radio luminosityof their winds is less than 1e-5 of their spin-down luminosity, implying anefficiency at least an order of magnitude smaller than that seen for youngpulsars.

astro-ph;0201062	bow shocks from neutron stars: scaling laws and hst observations of the  guitar nebula	the interaction of high-velocity neutron stars with the interstellar mediumproduces bow shock nebulae, where the relativistic neutron star wind isconfined by ram pressure. we present multi-wavelength observations of theguitar nebula, including narrow-band h-alpha imaging with hst/wfpc2, whichresolves the head of the bow shock. the hst observations are used to fit forthe inclination of the pulsar velocity vector to the line of sight, and todetermine the combination of spindown energy loss, velocity, and ambientdensity that sets the scale of the bow shock. we find that the velocity vectoris most likely in the plane of the sky. we use the guitar nebula and otherobserved neutron star bow shocks to test scaling laws for their size andh-alpha emission, discuss their prevalence, and present criteria for theirdetectability in targeted searches. the set of h-alpha bow shocks showsremarkable consistency, in spite of the expected variation in ambient densitiesand orientations. together, they support the assumption that a pulsar'sspindown energy losses are carried away by a relativistic wind that isindistinguishable from being isotropic. comparison of h-alpha bow shocks withx-ray and nonthermal, radio-synchrotron bow shocks produced by neutron starsindicates that the overall shape and scaling is consistent with the samephysics. it also appears that nonthermal radio emission and h-alpha emissionare mutually exclusive in the known objects and perhaps in all objects.

astro-ph;0207451	a clean-based method for deconvolving interstellar pulse broadening from  radio pulses	multipath propagation in the interstellar medium distorts radio pulses, aneffect predominant for distant pulsars observed at low frequencies. typically,broadened pulses are analyzed to determine the amount of propagation-inducedpulse broadening, but with little interest in determining the undistorted pulseshapes. in this paper we develop and apply a method that recovers both theintrinsic pulse shape and the pulse broadening function that describes thescattering of an impulse. the method resembles the clean algorithm used insynthesis imaging applications, although we search for the best pulsebroadening function, and perform a true deconvolution to recover intrinsicpulse structre. as figures of merit to optimize the deconvolution, we use thepositivity and symmetry of the deconvolved result along with the mean squareresidual and the number of points below a given threshold. our method makes noprior assumptions about the intrinsic pulse shape and can be used for a rangeof scattering functions for the interstellar medium. it can therefore beapplied to a wider variety of measured pulse shapes and degrees of scatteringthan the previous approaches. we apply the technique to both simulated data anddata from arecibo observations.

0808.2550	the vertical structure of warm ionised gas in the milky way	we present a new joint analysis of pulsar dispersion measures and diffuseh-alpha emission in the milky way, which we use to derive the density, pressureand filling factor of the thick disk component of the warm ionised medium (wim)as a function of height above the galactic disk. by excluding sightlines at lowgalactic latitude that are contaminated by hii regions and spiral arms, we findthat the exponential scale-height of free electrons in the diffuse wim is 1830(+120, -250) pc, a factor of two larger than has been derived in previousstudies. the corresponding inconsistent scale heights for dispersion measureand emission measure imply that the vertical profiles of mass and pressure inthe wim are decoupled, and that the filling factor of wim clouds is a geometricresponse to the competing environmental influences of thermal and non-thermalprocesses. extrapolating the properties of the thick-disk wim to mid-plane, weinfer a volume-averaged electron density 0.014 +- 0.001 cm^-3, produced byclouds of typical electron density 0.34 +- 0.06 cm^-3 with a volume fillingfactor 0.04 +- 0.01. as one moves off the plane, the filling factor increasesto a maximum of ~30% at a height of approximately 1-1.5 kpc, before thendeclining to accommodate the increasing presence of hot, coronal gas. sincemodels for the wim with a ~1 kpc scale-height have been widely used to estimatedistances to radio pulsars, our revised parameters suggest that the distancesto many high-latitude pulsars have been substantially underestimated.

astro-ph;0311340	smashing the guitar: an evolving neutron star bow shock	the guitar nebula is a spectacular example of an h-alpha bow shock nebulaproduced by the interaction of a neutron star with its environment. the radiopulsar b2224+65 is traveling at ~800--1600 km/s (for a distance of 1--2 kpc),placing it on the high-velocity tail of the pulsar velocity distribution. herewe report time evolution in the shape of the guitar nebula, the first suchobservations for a bow shock nebula, as seen in h-alpha imaging with the hubblespace telescope. the morphology of the nebula provides no evidence foranisotropy in the pulsar wind, nor for fluctuations in the pulsar windluminosity. the nebula shows morphological changes over two epochs spaced byseven years that imply the existence of significant gradients andinhomogeneities in the ambient interstellar medium. these observations offerastrophysically unique, in situ probes of length scales between 5e-4 pc and0.012 pc. model fitting suggests that the nebula axis -- and thus thethree-dimensional velocity vector -- lies within 20 degrees of the plane of thesky, and also jointly constrains the distance to the neutron star and theambient density.

astro-ph;0312044	pulsar parallaxes at 5 ghz with the very long baseline array	we present the first pulsar parallaxes measured with phase-referenced pulsarvlbi observations at 5 ghz. due to the steep spectra of pulsars, previousastrometric measurements have been at lower frequencies. however, the strongestpulsars can be observed at 5 ghz, offering the benefit of lower combinedionospheric and tropospheric phase errors, which usually limit vlbi astrometricaccuracy. the pulsars b0329+54, b0355+54 and b1929+10 were observed for 7epochs spread evenly over 2 years. for b0329+54, large systematic errors leadto only an upper limit on the parallax (pi &lt; 1.5 mas). a new proper motion andparallax were measured for b0355+54 (pi = 0.91 +- 0.16 mas), implying adistance of 1.04+0.21-0.16 kpc and a transverse velocity of 61+12-9 km/s. theparallax and proper motion for b1929+10 were significantly improved (pi = 2.77+- 0.07 mas), yielding a distance of 361+10-8 pc and a transverse velocity of177+4-5 km/s. we demonstrate that the astrometric errors are correlated withthe angular separation between the phase reference calibrator and the targetsource, with significantly lower errors at 5 ghz compared to 1.6 ghz. finally,based on our new distance determinations for b1929+10 and b0355+54, we deriveor constrain the luminosities of each pulsar at high energies. we show that,for thermal emission models, the emitting area for x-rays from psr b1929+10 isroughly consistent with the canonical size for a heated polar cap, and that theconversion of spin-down power to gamma-ray luminosity in b0355+54 must be low.the new proper motion for b1929+10 also implies that its progenitor is unlikelyto have been the binary companion of the runaway o-star zeta-ophiuchi.
