0904.1260	first observation of spin-helical dirac fermions and topological phases  in undoped and doped bi2te3 demonstrated by spin-arpes spectroscopy	electron systems that possess light-like dispersion relations or the conicaldirac spectrum, such as graphene and bismuth, have recently been shown toharbor unusual collective states in high magnetic fields. such states arepossible because their light-like electrons come in spin pairs that arechiral,which means that their direction of propagation is tied to a quantitycalled pseudospin that describes their location in the crystal lattice. anemerging direction in quantum materials research is the manipulation of atomicspin-orbit coupling to simulate the effect of a spin dependent magneticfield,in attempt to realize novel spin phases of matter. this effect has beenproposed to realize systems consisting of unpaired dirac cones that arehelical, meaning their direction of propagation is tied to the electron spinitself, which are forbidden to exist in graphene or bismuth. the experimentalexistence of topological order can not be determined without spin-resolvedmeasurements. here we report a spin-and angle-resolved photoemission study ofthe hexagonal surface of the bi2te3 and bi{2-x}mnxte3 series, which is found toexhibit a single helical dirac cone that is fully spin-polarized. ourobservations of a gap in the bulk spin-degenerate band and a spin-resolvedsurface dirac node close to the chemical potential show that the low energydynamics of bi2te3 is dominated by the unpaired spin-helical dirac modes. ourspin-texture measurements prove the existence of a rare topological phase inthis materials class for the first time, and suggest its suitability for novel2d dirac spin device applications beyond the chiral variety or traditionalgraphene.

0707.0066	first detection of galaxy-galaxy-galaxy lensing in rcs. a new tool for  studying the matter environment of galaxy pairs	the weak gravitational lensing effect, small coherent distortions of galaxyimages by means of a gravitational tidal field, can be used to study therelation between the matter and galaxy distribution. in this context, weaklensing has so far only been used for considering a second-order correlationfunction that relates the matter density and galaxy number density as afunction of separation. we implement two new, third-order correlation functionsthat have recently been suggested in the literature, and apply them to thered-sequence cluster survey. we demonstrate that it is possible, even withalready existing data, to make significant measurements of third-order lensingcorrelations. we develop an optimised computer code for the correlationfunctions. to test its reliability a set of tests are performed. thecorrelation functions are transformed to aperture statistics, which allow easytests for remaining systematics in the data. in order to further verify therobustness of our measurement, the signal is shown to vanish when randomisingthe source ellipticities. finally, the lensing signal is compared to crudepredictions based on the halo-model. on angular scales between roughly 1 arcminand 11 arcmin a significant third-order correlation between two lens positionsand one source ellipticity is found. we discuss this correlation function as anovel tool to study the average matter environment of pairs of galaxies.correlating two source ellipticities and one lens position yields a lesssignificant but nevertheless detectable signal on a scale of 4 arcmin. bothsignals lie roughly within the range expected by theory which supports theircosmological origin.[abridged]

0907.3089	topological control: systematic control of topological insulator dirac  fermion density on the surface of bi2te3	three dimensional (3d) topological insulators are quantum materials with aspin-orbit induced bulk insulating gap that exhibit quantum-hall-like phenomenain the absence of applied magnetic fields. the proposed applications oftopological insulators in device geometries rely on the ability to tune thechemical potential on their surfaces in the vicinity of the dirac node. here,we demonstrate a suite of surface control methods based on a combination ofphoto-doping and molecular-doping to systematically tune the dirac fermiondensity on the topological (111) surface of bi2te3. their efficacy isdemonstrated via direct electronic structure topology measurements using highresolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (arpes). these resultsopen up new opportunities for probing topological behavior of dirac electronson the bi2te3 surface. at least one of the methods demonstrated here can besuccessfully applied to other topological insulators such as the bi{1-x}sb{x},sb2te3 and bi2se3 which will be shown elsewhere. more importantly, our methodsof topological surface state manipulation demonstrated here are highly suitablefor future spectroscopic studies of topological phenomena which will complementthe transport results gained from the traditional electrical gating techniques.

0908.3513	discovery (theoretical prediction and experimental observation) of a  large-gap topological-insulator class with spin-polarized single-dirac-cone  on the surface	recent theories and experiments have suggested that strong spin-orbitcoupling effects in certain band insulators can give rise to a new phase ofquantum matter, the so-called topological insulator, which can show macroscopicentanglement effects. such systems feature two-dimensional surface states whoseelectrodynamic properties are described not by the conventional maxwellequations but rather by an attached axion field, originally proposed todescribe strongly interacting particles. it has been proposed that atopological insulator with a single spin-textured dirac cone interfaced with asuperconductor can form the most elementary unit for performing fault-tolerantquantum computation. here we present an angle-resolved photoemissionspectroscopy study and first-principle theoretical calculation-predictions thatreveal the first observation of such a topological state of matter featuring asingle-surface-dirac-cone realized in the naturally occurring bi$_2$se$_3$class of materials. our results, supported by our theoretical predictions andcalculations, demonstrate that undoped compound of this class of materials canserve as the parent matrix compound for the long-sought topological devicewhere in-plane surface carrier transport would have a purely quantumtopological origin. our study further suggests that the undoped compoundreached via n-to-p doping should show topological transport phenomena even atroom temperature.

0912.3341	observation of unconventional band topology in a superconducting doped  topological insulator, cux-bi2se3: topological superconductor or non-abelian  superconductor?	the cu-doped topological insulator bi$_2$se$_3$ has recently been found toundergo a superconducting transition upon cooling, raising the possibilitiesthat it is the first known "topological superconductor" or realizes a novelnon-abelian superconducting state. its true nature depends critically on thebulk and surface state band topology. we present the first photoemissionspectroscopy results where by examining the band topology at many differentcopper doping values we discover that the topologically protected spin-helicalsurface states remain well protected and separate from bulk dirac bands at thefermi level where copper pairing occurs in the optimally doped topologicalinsulator. the addition of copper is found to result in nonlinear electrondoping and strong renormalization of the topological surface states. thesehighly unusual observations strongly suggest that superconductivity on thetopological surface of cu$_x$bi$_2$se$_3$ cannot be of any conventional type inaccount of the general topological theory. characteristics of the threedimensional bulk dirac band structure are reported for the first time withrespect to the superconducting doping state and topological invariantproperties which should help formulate a specific theory for this novelsuperconductor.

1101.3985	realization of an isolated dirac node and strongly modulated spin  texture in the topological insulator bi2te3	the development of spin-based applications of topological insulators requiresthe knowledge and understanding of spin texture configuration maps as theychange via gating in the vicinity of an isolated dirac node. an isolated(graphene-like) dirac node, however, does not exist in bi2te3. while theisolation of surface states via transport channels has been promisinglyachieved in bi2te3, it is not known how spin textures modulate while gating thesurface. another drawback of bi2te3 is that it features multiple band crossingswhile chemical potential is placed near the dirac node (at least 3 not one asin bi2se3 and many other topological insulators) and its buried dirac point isnot experimentally accessible for the next generation of experiments whichrequire tuning the chemical potential near an isolated (graphene-like) diracnode. here, we image the spin texture of bi2te3 and suggest a simplemodification to realize a much sought out isolated dirac node regime criticalfor almost all potential applications (of topological nature) of bi2te3.finally, we demonstrate carrier control in magnetically and nonmagneticallydoped bi2te3 essential for realizing giant magneto-optical effects anddissipationless spin current devices involving a bi2te3-based platform.

1108.3405	hybrid 3-d formation control for unmanned helicopters	teams of unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs) form typical networkedcyber-physical systems that involve the interaction of discrete logic andcontinuous dynamics. this paper presents a hybrid supervisory control frameworkfor the three-dimensional leader follower formation control of unmannedhelicopters. the proposed hybrid control framework captures internalinteractions between the decision making unit and the path planner continuousdynamics of the system, and hence improves the system's overall reliability. todesign such a hybrid controller, a spherical abstraction of the state space isproposed as a new method of abstraction. utilizing the properties ofmulti-affine functions over the partitioned space leads to a finite statediscrete event system (des) model, which is shown to be bisimilar to theoriginal continuous-variable dynamical system. then, in the discrete domain, alogic supervisor is modularly designed for the abstracted model. due to thebisimilarity between the abstracted des model and the original uav dynamics,the designed logic supervisor can be implemented as a hybrid controller throughan interface layer. this supervisor drives the uav dynamics to satisfy thedesign requirements. in other words, the hybrid controller is able to bring theuavs to the desired formation starting from any initial state inside thecontrol horizon and then, maintain the formation. moreover, a collisionavoidance mechanism is embedded in the designed supervisor. finally, thealgorithm has been verified by a hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform,which is developed for unmanned helicopters. the presented results show theeffectiveness of the algorithm.

1210.2917	a topological crystalline insulator (tci) phase via topological phase  transition and crystalline mirror symmetry	a z2 topological insulator protected by time-reversal symmetry is realizedvia spin-orbit interaction driven band inversion. for example, the topologicalphase in the bi-sb system is due to an odd number of band inversions. a relatedspin-orbit system, the (pb/sn)te class, has been known to contain an evennumber of inversions based on band theory. here we experimentally investigatethe possibility of a mirror symmetry protected topological crystallineinsulator phase in the (pb/sn)te class of materials which has beentheoretically predicted to exist in its non-alloyed version. our experimentalresults show that at a finite-pb composition above the topological inversionphase transition, the surface exhibits even number of spin-polarized dirac conestates (as opposed to odd as observed in bi-sb alloy or bi2se3) revealingmirror protected topological order distinct from that observed in bi-sb orbi2se3. our observation of the spin-polarized dirac surface states in theinverted (pb/sn)te and their absence in the non-inverted compounds related viaa topological phase transition (spin-orbit induced band inversion type) providethe experimental groundwork for opening the research on novel topological orderin future quantum devices.

0712.3096	photocatalytic activity of pulsed laser deposited tio2 thin films	nanostructured tio2 thin films were prepared by pulsed laser deposition (pld)on indium doped tin oxide (ito) substrates. results from x-ray photoelectronspectroscopy (xps) show that ti 2p core level peaks shift toward the lowerbinding energy with decrease in the buffer gas pressure (o2:ar = 1:1). thissuggests that oxygen vacancies are created under insufficient oxygenconditions. anatase to rutile ratio is also found to be system pressuredependent. under deposition pressure of 750 mtorr only anatase phase wasobserved even at 1073 k substrate temperature which is much higher that thebulk anatase to rutile phase transformation temperature. the deposited tio2thin films were fabricated as photoanodes for photoelectrochemical (pec)studies. pec measurements on tio2 photoanodes show that the flatband potential(vfb) increases by 0.088 ev on absolute vacuum energy scale (avs) with decreasein the deposition pressure, from 750 to 250 mtorr at 873k. the highest incidentphoton to current conversion efficiency [ipce(lambda)] of 2.5 to 6 % wasobtained from the thin films prepared at substrate temperature of 873k.combining the results from xps and pec studies, we conclude that the depositionpressure affects the concentration of the oxygen vacancies which changes theelectronic structure of the tio2. with reference to photoelectrochemicalcatalytic performance, our results suggest that it is possible to adjust thefermi energy level and structure of tio2 thin films by controlling the buffergas pressure and temperature to align the energy of the flatband potential(vfb) with respect to specific redox species in the electrolyte.

1306.4634	surface electronic structure of a topological kondo insulator candidate  smb6: insights from high-resolution arpes	the kondo insulator smb6 has long been known to exhibit low temperature (t &lt;10k) transport anomaly and has recently attracted attention as a newtopological insulator candidate. by combining low-temperature and highenergy-momentum resolution of the laser-based arpes technique, for the firsttime, we probe the surface electronic structure of the anomalous conductivityregime. we observe that the bulk bands exhibit a kondo gap of 14 mev andidentify in-gap low-lying states within a 4 mev window of the fermi level onthe (001)-surface of this material. the low-lying states are found to formelectron-like fermi surface pockets that enclose the x and the gamma points ofthe surface brillouin zone. these states disappear as temperature is raisedabove 15k in correspondence with the complete disappearance of the 2dconductivity channels in smb6. while the topological nature of the in-gapmetallic states cannot be ascertained without spin (spin-texture) measurementsour bulk and surface measurements carried out in thetransport-anomaly-temperature regime (t &lt; 10k) are consistent with thefirst-principle predicted fermi surface behavior of a topological kondoinsulator phase in this material.

1306.5236	star/galaxy separation at faint magnitudes: application to a simulated  dark energy survey	we address the problem of separating stars from galaxies in future largephotometric surveys. we focus our analysis on simulations of the dark energysurvey (des). in the first part of the paper, we derive the sciencerequirements on star/galaxy separation, for measurement of the cosmologicalparameters with the gravitational weak lensing and large scale structureprobes. these requirements are dictated by the need to control both thestatistical and systematic errors on the cosmological parameters, and by pointspread function calibration. we formulate the requirements in terms of thecompleteness and purity provided by a given star/galaxy classifier. in order toachieve these requirements at faint magnitudes, we propose a new method forstar/galaxy separation in the second part of the paper. we first use principalcomponent analysis to outline the correlations between the objects parametersand extract from it the most relevant information. we then use the reduced setof parameters as input to an artificial neural network. this multi-parameterapproach improves upon purely morphometric classifiers (such as the classifierimplemented in sextractor), especially at faint magnitudes: it increases thepurity by up to 20% for stars and by up to 12% for galaxies, at i-magnitudefainter than 23.

1311.7111	an experimental algorithm for identifying the topological nature of  kondo and mixed valence insulators	possible topological nature of kondo and mixed valence insulators has been arecent topic of interest in condensed matter physics. attention has focused onsmb6, which has long been known to exhibit low temperature transport anomaly,whose origin is of independent interest. we argue that it is possible toresolve the topological nature of surface states by uniquely accessing thesurface electronic structure of the low temperature anomalous transport regimethrough combining state-of-the-art laser- and synchrotron-based angle-resolvedphotoemission spectroscopy (arpes) with or without spin resolution. acombination of low temperature and ultra-high resolution (laser) which islacking in previous arpes studies of this compound is the key to resolve thepossible existence of topological surface state in smb6. here we outline anexperimental algorithm to systematically explore the topological versus trivialor mixed (topological and trivial surface state admixture as in the first 3d tibi$_{1-x}$sb$_x$) nature of the surface states in kondo and mixed valenceinsulators. we conclude based on this methodology that the observed topology ofthe surface fermi surface in our low temperature data considered within thelevel of current resolution is consistent with the theoretically predictedtopological picture, suggesting a topological origin of the dominant in-gaparpes signal in smb6.}

1507.05552	cosmology from cosmic shear with des science verification data	we present the first constraints on cosmology from the dark energy survey(des), using weak lensing measurements from the preliminary scienceverification (sv) data. we use 139 square degrees of sv data, which is lessthan 3\% of the full des survey area. using cosmic shear 2-point measurementsover three redshift bins we find $\sigma_8 (\omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.81\pm 0.06$ (68\% confidence), after marginalising over 7 systematics parametersand 3 other cosmological parameters. we examine the robustness of our resultsto the choice of data vector and systematics assumed, and find them to bestable. about $20$\% of our error bar comes from marginalising over shear andphotometric redshift calibration uncertainties. the current state-of-the-artcosmic shear measurements from cfhtlens are mildly discrepant with thecosmological constraints from planck cmb data; our results are consistent withboth datasets. our uncertainties are $\sim$30\% larger than those from cfhtlenswhen we carry out a comparable analysis of the two datasets, which we attributelargely to the lower number density of our shear catalogue. we investigateconstraints on dark energy and find that, with this small fraction of the fullsurvey, the des sv constraints make negligible impact on the planckconstraints. the moderate disagreement between the cfhtlens and planck valuesof $\sigma_8 (\omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5}$ is present regardless of the value of$w$.

1507.05909	redshift distributions of galaxies in the des science verification shear  catalogue and implications for weak lensing	we present photometric redshift estimates for galaxies used in the weaklensing analysis of the dark energy survey science verification (des sv) data.four model- or machine learning-based photometric redshift methods -- annz2,bpz calibrated against bcc-ufig simulations, skynet, and tpz -- are analysed.for training, calibration, and testing of these methods, we construct acatalogue of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies matched against des sv data.the performance of the methods is evaluated against the matched spectroscopiccatalogue, focusing on metrics relevant for weak lensing analyses, withadditional validation against cosmos photo-zs. from the galaxies in the des svshear catalogue, which have mean redshift $0.72\pm0.01$ over the range$0.3&lt;z&lt;1.3$, we construct three tomographic bins with means of $z=\{0.45, 0.67,1.00\}$. these bins each have systematic uncertainties $\delta z \lesssim 0.05$in the mean of the fiducial skynet photo-z $n(z)$. we propagate the errors inthe redshift distributions through to their impact on cosmological parametersestimated with cosmic shear, and find that they cause shifts in the value of$\sigma_8$ of approx. 3%. this shift is within the one sigma statistical errorson $\sigma_8$ for the des sv shear catalog. we further study the potentialimpact of systematic differences on the critical surface density,$\sigma_{\mathrm{crit}}$, finding levels of bias safely less than thestatistical power of des sv data. we recommend a final gaussian prior for thephoto-z bias in the mean of $n(z)$ of width $0.05$ for each of the threetomographic bins, and show that this is a sufficient bias model for thecorresponding cosmology analysis.

astro-ph;0002036	the merger rate to redshift one from kinematic pairs: caltech faint  galaxy redshift survey xi	the rate of mass accumulation due to galaxy merging depends on the mass,density, and velocity distribution of galaxies in the near neighborhood of ahost galaxy. the fractional luminosity in kinematic pairs combines all of theseeffects in a single estimator which is relatively insensitive to populationevolution. here we use a k-corrected and evolution compensated volume-limitedsample drawing about 300 redshifts from cfgrs and 3000 from cnoc2 to measurethe rate and redshift evolution of merging. we identify kinematic pairs withprojected separations less than either 50 or 100 \hkpc and rest-frame velocitydifferences of less than 1000\kms. the fractional luminosity in pairs ismodeled as f_l(delta v,r_p,m_r^{ke})(1+z)^{m_l} where [f_l,m_l] are[0.14+/-0.07,0+/-1.4] and [0.37+/-0.7,0.1+/-0.5] for r_p&lt;= 50 and 100\hkpc,respectively (omega_m=0.2, omega_lambda=0.8). the value of m_l is about 0.6larger if lambda=0. to convert these redshift space statistics to a merger ratewe use the data to derive a conversion factor to physical space pair density, amerger probability and a mean in-spiral time. the resulting mass accretion rateper galaxy (m_1,m_2&gt;= 0.2 m*) is 0.02+/-0.01(1+z)^{0.1+/-0.5} m*~gyr^{-1}.present day high-luminosity galaxies therefore have accreted approximately0.15m* of their mass over the approximately 7 gyr to redshift one.

astro-ph;0008201	galaxy groups at intermediate redshift	galaxy groups likely to be virialized are identified within the cnoc2intermediate redshift galaxy survey using an iterative method. thenumber-velocity dispersion relation is in agreement with the low-massextrapolation of the cluster normalized press-schechter function. the two-pointgroup-group correlation function has r_0=6.8+/- 0.3 mpc, which is larger thanthe correlations of individual galaxies at the level predicted from n-bodycalibrated halo clustering.  the groups are stacked in velocity and position to create a sample largeenough for measurement of a density and velocity dispersion profile. thestacked mean galaxy density profile falls nearly as a power law with r^{-2.5}and has no well-defined core. the projected velocity dispersion is examined fora variety of samples with different methods and found to be either flat orslowly rising outwards. the combination of a steeper-than-isothermal densityprofile and the outward rising velocity dispersion implies that themass-to-light ratio of groups rises with radius. the m/l can be kept nearlyconstant if the galaxy orbits are nearly circular, although such strongtangential anisotropy is not supported by other evidence. the segregation ofmass and light is not dependent on galaxy luminosity but is far more prominentin the red galaxies than the blue. the m/l gradient could arise from orbital``sloshing'' of the galaxies in the group halos, dynamical friction acting onthe galaxies in a background of ``classical'' collisionless dark matter, or,more speculatively, the dark matter may have a true core.

astro-ph;0010141	the evolution of population gradients in galaxy clusters: the  butcher-oemler effect and cluster infall	we present photometric and spectroscopic measurements of the galaxypopulations in clusters from the cnoc1 sample of rich, x-ray luminous clustersat $0.18 &lt; z &lt; 0.55$. a classical measure of the galaxy blue fraction forspectroscopically confirmed cluster members shows a significant butcher-oemlereffect for the sample, but only when radii larger than 0.5$r_{200}$ areconsidered. we perform a principal component analysis of galaxy spectra todivide the total cluster light into contributions from stellar populations ofdifferent ages. composite radial distributions of different stellar populationsshow strong gradients as a function of cluster-centric radius. the compositepopulation is dominated by evolved populations in the core, and graduallychanges at radii greater than the virial radius to one which is similar tocoeval field galaxies. we do not see evidence at any radius within the clustersfor an excess of star formation over that seen in the coeval field. within thisredshift range, significant evolution in the fractional population gradient isseen. both low and high redshift clusters have similar populations in thecluster cores, but higher redshift clusters have steeper gradients and morestar forming galaxies at radii outside of the core region~-- in effect, arestatement of the butcher-oemler effect. luminosity density profiles areconsistent with a scenario where this phenomenon is due to a decline over timein the infall rate of field galaxies into clusters. depending on how longgalaxies reside in clusters before their star formation rates are diminished,this suggests a decrease in the infall into clusters of a factor of $\sim 3$between $z &gt; 0.8$ and $z \sim 0.5$. we also discuss alternative scenarios forthe evolution of cluster populations.

astro-ph;0012169	weak lensing study of low mass galaxy groups: implications for omega_m	we report on the first measurement of the average mass and mass-to-lightratio of galaxy groups by analysing the weak lensing signal induced by thesesystems. the groups, which have velocity dispersions of 50-400 km/s, have beenselected from the canadian network for observational cosmology field galaxyredshift survey (cnoc2). this survey allows the identification of a largenumber of groups with redshifts ranging from z=0.12-0.55, ideal for a weaklensing analysis of their mass distribution. for our analysis we use a sampleof 50 groups which are selected on the basis of a careful dynamical analysis ofgroup candidates. we detect a signal at the 99% confidence limit. the best fitsingular isothermal sphere model yields an einstein radius of 0.72+-0.29". thiscorresponds to a velocity dispersion of 274^{+48}_{-59} km/s (using photometricredshift distributions for the source galaxies), which is in good agreementwith the dynamical estimate. under the assumption that the light traces themass, we find an average mass-to-light ratio of 191+-83 h msun/lsun in therestframe b band. unlike dynamical estimates, this result is insensitive toproblems associated with determining group membership. after correction of theobserved mass-to-light ratio for luminosity evolution to z=0, we find 254+-110h msun/lsun, lower than what is found for rich clusters. we use the observedmass-to-light ratio to estimate the matter density of the universe, for whichwe find omega_m=0.19+-0.10 (omega_lambda=0), in good agreement with otherrecent estimates. for a closed universe, we obtain omega_m=0.13+-0.07.

astro-ph;0106506	environment and galaxy evolution at intermediate redshift in the cnoc2  survey	(abridged) the systematic variation of galaxy colors and types withclustering environment could either be the result of local conditions atformation or subsequent environmental effects as larger scale structures drawtogether galaxies whose stellar mass is largely in place. at z~0.4 theco-moving galaxy correlation length, r_0, measured in the cnoc2 sample isstrongly color dependent, rising from 2/h mpc to nearly 10/h mpc as thevolume-limited subsamples range from blue to red. the luminosity dependence ofr_0 at z~0.4 is weak below l_ast although there is an upturn at high luminositywhere its interpretation depends on separating it from the r_0-color relation.the dominant effect of the group environment on star formation is seen in theradial gradient of the mean galaxy colors which on the average become redderthan the field toward the group centers. the redder-than-field trend applies togroups with a line-of-sight velocity dispersion, sigma_1&gt;150 kms. there is anindication, somewhat statistically insecure, that the high luminosity galaxiesin groups with sigma_1&lt;125 kms become bluer toward the group center. weconclude that the higher velocity dispersion groups largely act to suppressstar formation relative to the less clustered field, leading to ``embalmed''galaxies. the tidal fields within the groups appear to be a strong candidatefor the physical source of the reduction of star formation in group galaxiesrelative to field. tides operate effectively at all velocity dispersions toremove gas rich companions and low density gas in galactic halos. given thatmuch of the field population is in groups we suggest that this suppression maybe the dominant galaxy evolution force at low redshift.

astro-ph;0510097	virial masses and the baryon fraction in galaxies	we have measured the weak lensing signal as a function of restframeluminosity for a sample of `isolated' galaxies. these results are based onfour-band photometry from the red-sequence cluster survey, enabling us todetermine photometric redshifts for a large number of galaxies. we select asecure sample of lenses with photometric redshifts 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.4 and study therelation between the virial mass and baryonic contents. in addition, we discussthe implications of the derived photometric redshift distribution for publishedcosmic shear studies. the virial masses are derived from a fit to the observedlensing signal. for a galaxy with a fiducial luminosity of 10^10 h^-2 l_bsun weobtain a mass m_vir=9.9^{+1.5}_{-1.3}\times 10^11 h^-1 m_sun. the virial massas a function of luminosity is consistent with a power-law ~l^1.5, with similarslopes for the three filters considered here. these findings are in excellentagreement with results from the sloan digital sky survey and semi-analyticmodels of galaxy formation. we measure the fraction of mass in stars and thebaryon fraction in galaxies by comparing the virial mass-to-light ratio topredicted stellar mass-to-light ratios. we find that star formation isinefficient in converting baryons into stars, with late-type galaxiesconverting ~33% and early-type galaxies converting only ~14% of baryons intostars. our results imply that the progenitors of early-type galaxies must havelow stellar mass fractions, suggestive of a high formation redshift.

astro-ph;0608575	the sloan digital sky survey monitor telescope pipeline	the photometric calibration of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) is amulti-step process which involves data from three different telescopes: the1.0-m telescope at the us naval observatory (usno), flagstaff station, arizona(which was used to establish the sdss standard star network); the sdss 0.5-mphotometric telescope (pt) at the apache point observatory (apo), new mexico(which calculates nightly extinctions and calibrates secondary patch transferfields); and the sdss 2.5-m telescope at apo (which obtains the imaging datafor the sdss proper).  in this paper, we describe the monitor telescope pipeline, mtpipe, thesoftware pipeline used in processing the data from the single-ccd telescopesused in the photometric calibration of the sdss (i.e., the usno 1.0-m and thept). we also describe transformation equations that convert photometry on theusno-1.0m u'g'r'i'z' system to photometry the sdss 2.5m ugriz system and theresults of various validation tests of the mtpipe software. further, we discussthe semi-automated pt factory, which runs mtpipe in the day-to-day standardsdss operations at fermilab. finally, we discuss the use of mtpipe in currentsdss-related projects, including the southern u'g'r'i'z' standard star project,the u'g'r'i'z' open star clusters project, and the sdss extension (sdss-ii).

astro-ph;0612202	near-infrared properties of moderate-redshift galaxy clusters:  luminosity functions and density profiles	we present k-band imaging for 15 of the canadian network for observationalcosmology (cnoc1) clusters. the cluster luminosity density and number densityprofiles can be described by nfw models with concentration parameters of c_{l}= 4.28 \pm 0.70 and c_{g} = 4.13 \pm 0.57 respectively. comparing these to thedynamical mass analysis of the same clusters shows that the galaxy luminosityand number density profiles are similar to the dark matter profile, and are notless concentrated like in local clusters. the luminosity functions show thatthe evolution of k^{*} over the redshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.5 is consistent witha scenario where the majority of stars in cluster galaxies form athigh-redshift (z_{f} &gt; 1.5) and evolve passively thereafter. the best-fit forthe faint-end slope of the luminosity function is alpha = -0.84 pm 0.08, whichindicates that it does not evolve between z = 0 and z = 0.3. using principalcomponent analysis of the spectra we classify cluster galaxies as eitherstar-forming/recently-star-forming (em+bal) or non-starforming (ell) andcompute their respective luminosity functions. the faint-end slope of the ellluminosity function is much shallower than for the em+bal galaxies at z = 0.3,and suggests the number of faint ell galaxies in clusters decreases by a factorof ~3 from z = 0 to z = 0.3. the redshift evolution of k^{*} for both em+baland ell types is consistent with a passively evolving stellar population formedat high-redshift. passive evolution in both classes, as well as the totalcluster luminosity function, demonstrates that the bulk of the stellarpopulation in all bright cluster galaxies is formed at high-redshift andsubsequent transformations in morphology/color/spectral-type have little effecton the total stellar mass.

astro-ph;0701508	a comparison of sdss standard star catalog for stripe 82 with stetson's  photometric standards	we compare stetson's photometric standards with measurements listed in astandard star catalog constructed using repeated sdss imaging observations. thesdss catalog includes over 700,000 candidate standard stars from the equatorialstripe 82 (|dec|&lt;1.266 deg) in the ra range 20h 34' to 4h 00', and with the $r$band magnitudes in the range 14--21. the distributions of measurements forindividual sources demonstrate that the sdss photometric pipeline correctlyestimates random photometric errors, which are below 0.01 mag for starsbrighter than (19.5, 20.5, 20.5, 20, 18.5) in ugriz, respectively (about twiceas good as for individual sdss runs). we derive mean photometrictransformations between the sdss gri and the bvri system using 1165 stetsonstars found in the equatorial stripe 82, and then study the spatial variationof the difference in zeropoints between the two catalogs. using third orderpolynomials to describe the color terms, we find that photometric measurementsfor main-sequence stars can be transformed between the two systems withsystematic errors smaller than a few millimagnitudes. the spatial variation ofphotometric zeropoints in the two catalogs typically does not exceed 0.01magnitude. consequently, the sdss standard star catalog for stripe 82 can beused to calibrate new data in both the sdss ugriz and the bvri systems with asimilar accuracy.

astro-ph;0703369	near-infrared properties of moderate-redshift galaxy clusters: halo  occupation number, mass-to-light ratios and omega_m	using k-band imaging for 15 of the canadian network for observationalcosmology (cnoc1) clusters we examine the near-infrared properties ofmoderate-redshift (0.19 &lt; z &lt; 0.55) galaxy clusters. we find that the number ofk-band selected cluster galaxies within r_{500} (the halo occupation number,hon) is well-correlated with the the cluster dynamical mass (m_{500}) and x-raytemperature (t_{x}); however, the intrinsic scatter in these scaling relationsis 37% and 46% respectively. comparison with clusters in the local universeshows that the hon-m_{500} relation does not evolve significantly between z = 0and z ~ 0.3. this suggests that if dark matter halos are disrupted or undergosignificant tidal-stripping in high-density regions as seen in numericalsimulations, the stellar mass within the halos is tightly bound, and notremoved during the process. the total k-band cluster light (l_{200,k}) andk-band selected richness (parameterized by b_{gc,k}) are also correlated withboth the cluster t_{x} and m_{200}. the total (intrinsic) scatter in thel_{200,k}-m_{200} and b_{gc,k}-m_{200} relations are 43%(31%) and 35%(18%)respectively and indicates that for massive clusters both l_{200,k} andb_{gc,k} can predict m_{200} with similar accuracy as t_{x}, l_{x} or opticalrichness (b_{gc}). examination of the mass-to-light ratios of the clustersshows that similar to local clusters, the k-band mass-to-light ratio is anincreasing function of halo mass. using the k-band mass-to-light ratios of theclusters, we apply the oort technique and find omega_{m,0} = 0.22 pm 0.02,which agrees well with recent combined concordance cosmology parameters, but,similar to previous cluster studies, is on the low-density end of preferredvalues.

astro-ph;9512058	the environment of ``e+a'' galaxies	the violent star formation history of ``e+a'' galaxies and their detectionalmost exclusively in distant clusters is frequently used to link them to the``butcher-oemler effect'' and to argue that cluster environment influencesgalaxy evolution. from 11113 spectra in the las campanas redshift survey, wehave obtained a unique sample of 21 nearby ``e+a" galaxies. surprisingly, alarge fraction (about 75%) of these ``e+a''s lie in the field. therefore,interactions with the cluster environment, in the form of the icm or clusterpotential, are not essential for ``e+a'' formation. if one mechanism isresponsible for ``e+a''s, their existence in the field and the tidal featuresin at least 5 of the 21 argue that galaxy-galaxy interactions and mergers arethat mechanism. the most likely environments for such interactions are poorgroups, which have lower velocity dispersions than clusters and higher galaxydensities than the field. in hierarchical models, groups fall into clusters ingreater numbers at intermediate redshifts than they do today. thus, thebutcher-oemler effect may reflect the typical evolution of galaxies in groupsand in the field rather than the influence of clusters on star formation ingalaxies. this abstract is abridged.

astro-ph;9608056	the luminosity function of field galaxies in the cnoc1 redshift survey	we have computed the luminosity function for 389 field galaxies from thecanadian network for observational cosmology cluster redshift survey (cnoc1),over redshifts z = 0.2-0.6. we find schechter parameters m^* - 5 log h = -19.6\pm 0.3 and \alpha = -0.9 \pm 0.2 in rest-frame b_{ab}. we have also split oursample at the color of a redshifted but nonevolving sbc galaxy, and finddistinctly different luminosity functions for red and blue galaxies. redgalaxies have a shallow slope \alpha \approx -0.4 and dominate the bright endof the luminosity function, while blue galaxies have a steep \alpha \approx-1.4 and prevail at the faint end. comparisons of the cnoc1 results to thosefrom the canada-france (cfrs) and autofib redshift surveys show broad agreementamong these independent samples, but there are also significant differenceswhich will require larger samples to resolve. also, in cnoc1 the red galaxyluminosity density stays about the same over the range z = 0.2-0.6, while theblue galaxy luminosity density increases steadily with redshift. these resultsare consistent with the trend of the luminosity density vs. redshift relationsseen in the cfrs, though the normalizations of the luminosity densities appearto differ for blue galaxies. comparison to the local luminosity function fromthe las campanas redshift survey (lcrs) shows that the luminosity density at z\approx 0.1 is only about half that seen at z \approx 0.4. a change in theluminosity function shape, particularly at the faint end, appears to berequired to match the cnoc1 and lcrs luminosity functions, if galaxy evolutionis the sole cause of the differences seen. however, it should be noted that thespecific details of the construction of different surveys may complicate thecomparison of results and so may need to be considered carefully.

astro-ph;9706115	omega baryon via oort's method	the baryon density of the universe is equal to the product of thebaryon-to-light ratio, m_b/l, and the luminosity density, j. we estimate m_b/las the sum of the masses of the x-ray gas and the visible stars in a richcluster of galaxies divided by the luminosity of the cluster galaxies inprecisely the same sky aperture. we evaluate the gas-to-light ratio derivedfrom the emss detect cell flux and the cnoc cluster redshift survey galaxies.after making an aperture correction to an effective overdensity of 500rho_c, wefind that omega_gas=0.012-0.016 h^-3/2, depending on the galaxy fadingcorrection. adding in the galaxy baryons at a mass-to-light ratio of 5msun/lsun, equivalent to omega_stars=0.003h^-1, we find thatomega_b=0.015-0.019 for h_0=100 (or 0.040-0.051 for h_0=50). expressed as thebaryon to photon ratio, eta, this corresponds to eta=4.0-5.2x10^{-10} (h_0=100)and is in the mid-range of values from other methods. the individual clustershave a dispersion about the mean omega_{gas} of 40%, and the chi^2 of the 14clusters is consistent with the hypothesis that the gas-to-light ratio is auniversal constant. if we ignore the light of the cd, the variance increases bya factor of three. after the radial segregation of gas and light within acluster is taken into account, these statistics indicate that there is littlevariation of the gas-to-light ratio from cluster to cluster over the 0.2 to0.55 range in redshift.

astro-ph;9805131	the cnoc2 field galaxy redshift survey	the cnoc2 field galaxy redshift survey is designed to provide measurements ofthe evolution of galaxies and their clustering over the redshift range 0 to0.7. the sample is spread over four sky patches with a total area of about 1.5square degrees. here we report preliminary results based on two of the skypatches, and the redshift range of 0.15 to 0.55. we find that galaxy evolutioncan be statistically described as nearly pure luminosity evolution of early andintermediate sed types, and nearly pure density evolution of the late sedtypes. the correlation of blue galaxies relative to red galaxies is similar onlarge scales but drops by a factor of three on scales less than about 0.3/hmpc, approximately the mean scale of virialization. there is a clear, butsmall, 60%, change in clustering with 1.4 mag of luminosity. to minimize thesepopulation effects in our measurement of clustering evolution, we choosegalaxies with m_r^{k,e}&lt;= -20 mag as a population whose members are most likelyto be conserved with redshift. remarkably, the evolution of the clustereddensity in proper co-ordinates at r &lt; 10/h mpc, proportional to r_0^gamma(1+z)^3, is best described as a ``de-clustering'', (1+z)^{0.6+/-0.4}. orequivalently, there is a weak growth of clustering in co-moving co-ordinates,x_0~ (1+z)^{-0.3 +/- 0.2}. this conclusion is supported by the pairwisepeculiar velocities which rise slightly, but not significantly, into the past.the cosmic virial theorem applied to the cnoc2 data gives q omega_m/b=0.11 +/-0.04$, where q is the three point correlation parameter and b the bias.similarly, galaxy groups have a virial mass-to-light ratio (evolutioncorrected) of m_{virial}/l_r^{k,e} = 215h lsun/msun, or omega_m=0.15 +/- 0.05.
