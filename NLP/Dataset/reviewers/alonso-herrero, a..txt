0904.3324	near-ir integral field spectroscopy study of the star formation and agn  of the lirg ngc 5135	we present a study of the central 2.3 kpc of ngc 5135, a nearby luminousinfrared galaxy (lirg) with an agn and circumnuclear starburst. our mainresults are based on intermediate spectral resolution (~ 3000-4000) nearinfrared data taken with the sinfoni integral field spectrograph at the esovlt. the ionization of the different phases of the interstellar gas and thecomplex structures of the star formation have been mapped. individual regionsof interest have been identified and studied in detail.  for the first time in this galaxy, we have detected the presence of a highexcitation ionization cone centered on the agn by using the [sivi] (1.96micron) line. so far, this structure is the largest reported in the literaturefor this coronal line, extending (in projection) as far as ~ 600 pc from thegalaxy nucleus. in a complex spatial distribution, a variety of mechanisms aredriving the gas ionization, including sne remnant shocks, young stars and agnphotoionization. the excitation of the molecular gas, however, is mainlyproduced by x-rays and sne remnant shocks. uv-mechanisms like fluorescencerepresent a marginal overall contribution to this process, contrary to theexpectations we might have for a galaxy with a recent and strong starformation. our sne rate estimations from [feii] (1.64 micron) are in excellentagreement with 6 cm radio emission predictions. typical sne rates between0.01-0.04 yr^-1 were found for individual ~ 200 pc-scale regions, with anoverall sne rate of 0.4-0.5 yr^-1. even though ngc 5135 has suffered a recentstarburst (6-7 myr ago), the data strongly suggest the presence of a second,older stellar population dominated by red giant/supergiant stars.

0908.2307	spectral energy distributions of type 2 qsos: obscured star formation at  high redshifts	we present new mid-infrared and submillimetre observations for a sample ofeight high redshift type-2 qsos located in the chandra deep field south. thesources are x-ray absorbed with luminosities in excess of 10^44 erg/s. two ofthe targets have robust detections, s/n &gt; 4, while a further three targets aremarginally detected with s/n &gt; =2.5. all sources are detected in multiplemid-infrared bands with the spitzer space telescope. the multiwavelengthspectral energy distributions (seds) of the type-2 qsos are compared to thoseof two local ultraluminous galaxies (arp220 and ir22491) in order to assesscontributions from a star-forming component in various parts of the sed. wesuggest that their submillimetre emission is possibly due to a starburst whilea large fraction of the mid-infrared energy is likely to originate in theobscured central quasar. using the mid-infrared and submm observations wederive infrared luminosities which are found to be in excess of l&gt;10^12lsun.the submillimetre (850micron) to x-ray (2 kev) spectral indices (alpha_sx) spana wide range. about half of the type-2 qsos have values typical for acompton-thick agn with only 1 per cent of the nuclear emission seen throughscattering and, the remaining with values typical of submm-bright galaxies.combining the available observational evidence we outline a possible scenariofor the early stages of evolution of these sources.

1001.1871	a high spatial resolution mid-infrared spectroscopic study of the nuclei  and star-forming regions in luminous infrared galaxies	we present a high spatial (diffraction-limited) resolution (~0.3")mid-infrared (mir) spectroscopic study of the nuclei and star-forming regionsof 4 local luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs) using t-recs on the gemini southtelescope. we investigate the spatial variations of the features seen in then-band spectra of lirgs on scales of ~100 pc, which allow us to separate theagn emission from that of the star formation (sf). we compare our gemini t-recsnuclear and integrated spectra of lirgs with those obtained with spitzer irs.the 9.7um silicate absorption feature is weaker in the nuclei of the lirgs thanin the surrounding regions. this is probably due to the either clumpy orcompact environment of the central agn or young, nuclear starburst. we findthat the [neii] luminosity surface density is tightly and directly correlatedwith that of pa-alpha for the lirg star-forming regions (slope of 1.00+-0.02).although the 11.3um pah feature shows also a trend with pa-alpha, this is notcommon for all the regions. we also find that the [neii]\pa-alpha ratio doesnot depend on the pa-alpha equivalent width (ew), i.e., on the age of theionizing stellar populations, suggesting that, on the scales probed here, the[neii] emission line is a good tracer of the sf activity in lirgs. on the otherhand, the 11.3um pah\pa-alpha ratio increases for smaller values of thepa-alpha ew (increasing ages), indicating that the 11.3um pah feature can alsobe excited by older stars than those responsible for the pa-alpha emission.additional high spatial resolution observations are essential to investigate,in a statistical way, the star formation in local lirgs at the smallest scalesand to probe ultimately whether they share the same physical properties ashigh-z lirgs, ulirgs and submillimiter galaxies.

1005.0629	the antennae galaxies (ngc 4038/4039) revisited: acs and nicmos  observations of a prototypical merger	the acs and nicmos have been used to obtain new hst images of ngc 4038/4039("the antennae"). these new observations allow us to better differentiatecompact star clusters from individual stars, based on both size and color. weuse this ability to extend the cluster luminosity function by approximately twomagnitudes over our previous wfpc2 results, and find that it continues as asingle power law, dn/dl propto l^alpha with alpha=-2.13+/-0.07, down to theobservational limit of mv~-7. similarly, the mass function is a single powerlaw dn/dm propto m^beta with beta=-2.10+/-0.20 for clusters with ages t&lt;3x10^8yr, corresponding to lower mass limits that range from 10^4 to 10^5 msun,depending on the age range of the subsample. hence the power law indices forthe luminosity and mass functions are essentially the same. the luminosityfunction for intermediate-age clusters (i.e., ~100-300 myr old objects found inthe loops, tails, and outer areas) shows no bend or turnover down to mv~-6,consistent with relaxation-driven cluster disruption models which predict theturnover should not be observed until mv~-4. an analysis of individual ~0.5-kpcsized areas over diverse environments shows good agreement between values ofalpha and beta, similar to the results for the total population of clusters inthe system. several of the areas studied show evidence for age gradients, withsomewhat older clusters appearing to have triggered the formation of youngerclusters. the area around knot b is a particularly interesting example, with an~10-50 myr old cluster of estimated mass ~10^6 msun having apparently triggeredthe formation of several younger, more massive (up to 5x10^6 msun) clustersalong a dust lane.

1101.3335	testing the unification model for agn in the infrared: are the obscuring  tori of type 1 and 2 seyferts different?	we present new mid-infrared (mir) imaging data for three type-1 seyfertgalaxies obtained with t-recs on the gemini-south telescope at subarcsecondresolution. our aim is to enlarge the sample studied in a previous work tocompare the properties of type-1 and type-2 seyfert tori using clumpy torusmodels and a bayesian approach to fit the infrared nuclear spectral energydistributions (seds). thus, the sample considered here comprises 7 type-1, 11type-2, and 3 intermediate-type seyferts. the unresolved ir emission of theseyfert 1 galaxies can be reproduced by a combination of dust heated by thecentral engine and direct agn emission, while for the seyfert 2 nuclei onlydust emission is considered. these dusty tori have physical sizes smaller than6 pc radius, as derived from our fits. unification schemes of agn account for avariety of observational differences in terms of viewing geometry. however, wefind evidence that strong unification may not hold, and that the immediatedusty surroundings of type-1 and type-2 seyfert nuclei are intrinsicallydifferent. the type-2 tori studied here are broader, have more clumps, andthese clumps have lower optical depths than those of type-1 tori. the largerthe covering factor of the torus, the smaller the probability of having directview of the agn, and vice-versa. in our sample, seyfert 2 tori have largercovering factors and smaller escape probabilities than those of seyfert 1. allthe previous differences are significant according to the kullback-leiblerdivergence. thus, on the basis of the results presented here, theclassification of a seyfert galaxy as a type-1 or type-2 depends more on theintrinsic properties of the torus rather than on its mere inclination towardsus, in contradiction with the simplest unification model.

1111.6773	star formation laws in luminous infrared galaxies. new observational  constraints on models	the observational study of star formation relations in galaxies is central tounraveling the physical processes at work on local and global scales. we wishto expand the sample of extreme starbursts, represented by local lirgs andulirgs, with high quality observations in the 1-0 line of hcn. we study if auniversal law can account for the star formation relations observed for thedense molecular gas in normal star forming galaxies and extreme starbursts. wehave used the iram 30m telescope to observe a sample of 19 lirgs in the 1-0lines of co, hcn and hco+. the analysis of the new data proves that theefficiency of star formation in the dense molecular gas (sfe-dense) of extremestarbursts is a factor 3-4 higher compared to normal galaxies. we find aduality in kennicutt-schmidt (ks) laws that is reinforced if we account for thedifferent conversion factor for hcn (alpha-hcn) in extreme starbursts and forthe unobscured star formation rate in normal galaxies. this result extends tothe higher molecular densities probed by hcn lines the more extreme bimodalbehavior of star formation laws, derived from co molecular lines by two recentsurveys. we have confronted our observations with the predictions oftheoretical models in which the efficiency of star formation is determined bythe ratio of a constant star formation rate per free-fall time (sfr-ff) to thelocal free-fall time. we find that it is possible to fit the observeddifferences in the sfe-dense between normal galaxies and lirgs/ulirgs using acommon constant sfr-ff and a set of physically acceptable hcn densities, butonly if sfr-ff~0.005-0.01 and/or if alpha-hcn is a factor of a few lower thanour favored values. star formation recipes that explicitly depend on the galaxyglobal dynamical time scales do not significantly improve the fit to the newhcn data presented in this work.

1201.4240	testing the agn unification model in the infrared	we present near-to-mid-infrared spectral energy distributions (seds) for 21seyfert galaxies, using subarcsecond resolution imaging data. our aim is tocompare the properties seyfert 1 (sy1) and seyfert 2 (sy2) tori using clumpytorus models and a bayesian approach to fit the infrared (ir) nuclear seds.these dusty tori have physical sizes smaller than 6 pc radius, as derived fromour fits. active galactic nuclei (agn) unification schemes account for avariety of observational differences in terms of viewing geometry. however, wefind evidence that strong unification may not hold, and that the immediatedusty surroundings of sy1 and sy2 nuclei are intrinsically different. the type2 tori studied here are broader, have more clumps, and these clumps have loweroptical depths than those of type 1 tori. the larger the covering factor of thetorus, the smaller the probability of having direct view of the agn, andvice-versa. in our sample, sy2 tori have larger covering factors(c_t=0.95+/-0.02) and smaller escape probabilities than those of sy1(c_t=0.5+/-0.1). thus, on the basis of the results presented here, theclassification of a seyfert galaxy may depend more on the intrinsic propertiesof the torus rather than on its mere inclination, in contradiction with thesimplest unification model.

1202.2254	spatially resolved [feii] 1.64 \mu m emission in ngc 5135. clues for  understanding the origin of the hard x-rays in luminous infrared galaxies	spatially resolved near-ir and x-ray imaging of the central region of theluminous infrared galaxy ngc 5135 is presented. the kinematical signatures ofstrong outflows are detected in the [feii]1.64 \mu m emission line in a compactregion at 0.9 kpc from the nucleus. the derived mechanical energy release isconsistent with a supernova rate of 0.05-0.1 yr$^{-1}$. the apex of theoutflowing gas spatially coincides with the strongest [feii] emission peak andwith the dominant component of the extranuclear hard x-ray emission. all thesefeatures provide evidence for a plausible direct physical link betweensupernova-driven outflows and the hard x-ray emitting gas in a lirg. thisresult is consistent with model predictions of starbursts concentrated in smallvolumes and with high thermalization efficiencies. a single high-mass x-raybinary (hmxb) as the major source of the hard x-ray emission although notfavoured, cannot be ruled out. outside the agn, the hard x-ray emission in ngc5135 appears to be dominated by the hot ism produced by supernova explosions ina compact star-forming region, and not by the emission due to hmxb. if thisscenario is common to u/lirgs, the hard x-rays would only trace the mostcompact (&lt; 100 pc) regions with high supernova and star formation densities,therefore a lower limit to their integrated star formation. the sfr derived inngc 5135 based on its hard x-ray luminosity is a factor of two and four lowerthan the values obtained from the 24 \mu m and soft x-ray luminosities,respectively.

1202.4577	the starburst-agn connection in the merger galaxy mrk 938: an infrared  and x-ray view	mrk938 is a luminous infrared galaxy in the local universe believed to be theremnant of a galaxy merger. it shows a seyfert 2 nucleus and intense starformation according to optical spectroscopic observations. we have studied thisgalaxy using new herschel far-ir imaging data in addition to archival x-ray,uv, optical, near-ir and mid-ir data. mid- and far-ir data are crucial tocharacterise the starburst contribution, allowing us to shed new light on itsnature and to study the coexistence of agn and starburst activity in the localuniverse. the decomposition of the mid-ir spitzer spectrum shows that the agnbolometric contribution to the mid-ir and total infrared luminosity is small(lbol(agn)/lir~0.02), which agrees with previous estimations. we havecharacterised the physical nature of its strong infrared emission andconstrained it to a relatively compact emitting region of &lt;2kpc. it is in thisobscured region where most of the current star formation activity is takingplace as expected for lirgs. we have used herschel imaging data for the firsttime to constrain the cold dust emission with unprecedented accuracy. we havefitted the integrated far-ir spectral energy distribution and derived theproperties of the dust, obtaining a dust mass of 3x10^7msun. the far-ir isdominated by emission at 35k, consistent with dust heated by the on-going starformation activity.

1203.0036	integral field spectroscopy based h\alpha\ sizes of local luminous and  ultraluminous infrared galaxies. a direct comparison with high-z massive star  forming galaxies	aims. we study the analogy between local u/lirgs and high-z massive sfgs bycomparing basic h{\alpha} structural characteristics, such as size, andluminosity (and sfr) surface density, in an homogeneous way (i.e. same tracerand size definition, similar physical scales). methods. we use integral fieldspectroscopy based h{\alpha} emission maps for a representative sample of 54local u/lirgs (66 galaxies). from this initial sample we select 26 objects withh{\alpha} luminosities (l(h{\alpha})) similar to those of massive (i.e. m\ast\sim 10^10 m\odot or larger) sfgs at z \sim 2, and observed on similar physicalscales. results. the sizes of the h{\alpha} emitting region in the sample oflocal u/lirgs span a large range, with r1/2(h{\alpha}) from 0.2 to 7 kpc.however, about 2/3 of local u/lirgs with lir &gt; 10^11.4 l\odot have compacth{\alpha} emission (i.e. r1/2 &lt; 2 kpc). the comparison sample of local u/lirgsalso shows a higher fraction (59%) of objects with compact h{\alpha} emissionthan the high-z sample (25%). this gives further support to the idea that forthis luminosity range the size of the star forming region is a distinctivefactor between local and distant galaxies of similar sf rates. however, whenusing h{\alpha} as a tracer for both local and high-z samples, the differencesare smaller than the ones recently reported using a variety of other tracers.despite of the higher fraction of galaxies with compact h{\alpha} emission, asizable group (\sim 1/3) of local u/lirgs are large (i.e. r1/2 &gt; 2 kpc). theseare systems showing pre-coalescence merger activity and they areindistinguishable from the massive high-z sfgs galaxies in terms of theirh{\alpha} sizes, and luminosity and sfr surface densities.

1205.0029	the nuclear infrared emission of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei	we present high-resolution mid-infrared (mir) imaging, nuclear spectralenergy distributions (seds) and archival spitzer spectra for 22 low-luminosityactive galactic nuclei (llagn; lbol \lesssim 10^42 erg/sec). infrared (ir)observations may advance our understanding of the accretion flows in llagn, thefate of the obscuring torus at low accretion rates, and, perhaps, the starformation histories of these objects. however, while comprehensively studied inhigher-luminosity seyferts and quasars, the nuclear ir properties of llagn havenot yet been well-determined. we separate the present llagn sample into threecategories depending on their eddington ratio and radio emission, findingdifferent ir characteristics for each class. (i) at the low-luminosity,low-eddington ratio (log lbol/ledd &lt; -4.6) end of the sample, we identify"host-dominated" galaxies with strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon bandsthat may indicate active (circum-)nuclear star formation. (ii) some veryradio-loud objects are also present at these low eddington ratios. the iremission in these nuclei is dominated by synchrotron radiation, and some arelikely to be unobscured type 2 agn that genuinely lack a broad line region.(iii) at higher eddington ratios, strong, compact nuclear sources are visiblein the mir images. the nuclear seds of these galaxies are diverse; someresemble typical seyfert nuclei, while others lack a well-defined mir "dustbump". strong silicate emission is present in many of these objects. wespeculate that this, together with high ratios of silicate strength to hydrogencolumn density, could suggest optically thin dust and low dust-to-gas ratios,in accordance with model predictions that llagn do not host a seyfert-likeobscuring torus.

1206.1314	core-collapse supernovae missed by optical surveys	we estimate the fraction of core-collapse supernovae (ccsne) that remainundetected by optical sn searches due to obscuration by large amounts of dustin their host galaxies. this effect is especially important in luminous andultraluminous infrared galaxies, which are locally rare but dominate the starformation at redshifts of z~1-2. we perform a detailed investigation of the snactivity in the nearby luminous infrared galaxy arp 299 and estimate that up to83% of the sne in arp 299 and in similar galaxies in the local universe aremissed by observations at optical wavelengths. for rest-frame optical surveyswe find the fraction of sne missed due to high dust extinction to increase fromthe average local value of ~19% to ~38% at z~1.2 and then stay roughly constantup to z~2. it is therefore crucial to take into account the effects ofobscuration by dust when determining sn rates at high redshift and whenpredicting the number of ccsne detectable by future high-z surveys such aslsst, jwst, and euclid. for a sample of nearby ccsne (distances 6-15 mpc)detected during the last 12 yr, we find a lower limit for the local ccsn rateof 1.5 +0.4/-0.3 x 10^-4 yr^-1 mpc^-3, consistent with that expected from thestar formation rate. even closer, at distances less than ~6 mpc, we find asignificant increase in the ccsn rate, indicating a local overdensity of starformation caused by a small number of galaxies that have each hosted multiplesne.

1209.4305	star-formation laws in extreme starbursts	the observational study of star-formation laws is paramount to disentanglingthe physical processes at work on local and global scales in galaxies. to thisaim we have expanded the sample of extreme starbursts, represented by locallirgs and ulirgs, with high-quality data obtained in the 1-0 line of hcn. theanalysis of the new data shows that the star-formation efficiency of the densemolecular gas, derived from the fir/hcn luminosity ratio, is a factor 3-4higher in extreme starbursts compared to normal galaxies. we find a duality inthe kennicutt-schmidt laws that is enhanced if we account for the differentconversion factor for hcn (alpha_hcn) in extreme starbursts and correct for theunobscured star-formation rate in normal galaxies. we find that it is possibleto fit the observed differences in the fir/hcn ratios between normal galaxiesand lirgs/ulirgs with a common constant star-formation rate per free-fall time(sfr_ff) if we assume that hcn densities are ~1-2 orders of magnitude higher inlirgs/ulirgs, and provided that sfr_ ff~0.005-0.01 and/or if alpha_hcn is afactor of a few lower than our favored values.

1212.3008	probing nuclear activity versus star formation at z~0.8 using  near-infrared multi-object spectroscopy	we present near-infrared (nir) spectroscopic observations of 28 x-ray andmid-infrared selected sources at a median redshift of z~0.8 in the extendedgroth strip (egs). to date this is the largest compilation of nir spectra ofactive galactic nuclei (agn) at this redshift. the data were obtained using themulti-object spectroscopic mode of the long-slit intermediate resolutioninfrared spectrograph (liris) at the 4.2m william herschel telescope (wht).these galaxies are representative of a larger sample studied in a previouswork, consisting of over a hundred x-ray selected sources with mid-infraredcounterparts, which were classified either as agn-dominated or hostgalaxy-dominated, depending on the shape of their spectral energy distributions(seds). here we present new nir spectra of 13 and 15 sources of each classrespectively. we detect the h alpha line at &gt; 1.5 sigma above the continuum forthe majority of the galaxies. using attenuation-corrected h alpha luminositiesand observed spitzer/mips 24 micron fluxes, and after subtracting an agncomponent estimated using an agn empirical correlation and multi-frequency sedfits, we obtain average star formation rates (sfrs) of 7+/-7 and 20+/-50msun/yr respectively (median sfrs = 7 and 5 msun/yr). these values are lowerthan the sfrs reported in the literature for different samples of non-activestar-forming galaxies of similar stellar masses and redshifts (m* ~ 10^11 msunand z~1). in spite of the small size of the sample studied here, as well as theuncertainty affecting the agn-corrected sfrs, we speculate with the possibilityof agn quenching the star formation in galaxies at z~0.8. alternatively, wemight be seeing a delay between the offset of the star formation and agnactivity, as observed in the local universe.

1212.5368	dust in active galactic nuclei. mid-infrared t-recs/gemini spectra using  the new redcan pipeline	the unified model of active galactic nuclei (agn) claims that the propertiesof agn depend on the viewing angle of the observer with respect to a toroidaldistribution of dust surrounding the nucleus. both the mid-infrared (mir)attenuation and continuum luminosity are expected to be related to dustassociated with the torus. therefore, isolating the nuclear component isessential to study the mir emission of agn. we have compiled all the t-recsspectra (gemini observatory) available in the n-band for 22 agn: 5 type-1 and17 type-2 agn. the high angular resolution of the t-recs spectra allows us toprobe physical regions of 57 pc (median). we have used a novel pipeline calledredcan capable of producing flux- and wavelength-calibrated spectra for thecanaricam (gtc) and t-recs (gemini) instruments. we have measured thefine-structure [siv] at 10.5 microns and the pah at 11.3 microns line strengthstogether with the silicate absorption/emission features. we have also compiledspitzer/irs spectra to understand how spatial resolution influences theresults. the 11.3 microns pah feature is only clearly detected in the nuclearspectra of two agn, while it is more common in the spitzer data. for those twoobjects the agn emission in ngc7130 accounts for more than 80% of the mircontinuum at 12 microns while in the case of ngc1808 the agn is not dominatingthe mir emission. this is confirmed by the correlation between the mir andx-ray continuum luminosities. the [siv] emission line at 10.5 microns, which isbelieved to originate in the narrow line region, is detected in most agn. wehave found an enhancement of the optical depth at 9.7 microns in thehigh-angular resolution data for higher values of nh. clumpy torus modelsreproduce the observed values only if the host-galaxy properties are taken intoaccount.

0712.3121	the host galaxies and black holes of typical z~0.5-1.4 agn	we study the stellar and star formation (sf) properties of the host galaxiesof 58 x-ray selected agn in the goods portion of the chandra deep field south(cdf-s) region at z~0.5-1.4. the agn are selected such that their rest-frame uvto near-ir seds are dominated by stellar emission, i.e., they show a prominent1.6micron bump, thus minimizing the agn emission 'contamination'. this agnpopulation comprises approximately 50% of the x-ray selected agn at theseredshifts. using models of stellar and dust emission we model their seds toderive stellar masses (m*) and total (uv+ir) star formation rates (sfr). agnreside in the most massive galaxies at the redshifts probed here. theircharacteristic stellar masses (m*~7.8x10^10 msun and m*~1.2x10^11 msun atmedian z of 0.67 and 1.07, respectively) appear to be representative of thex-ray selected agn population at these redshifts, and are intermediate betweenthose of local type 2 agn and high redshift (z~2) agn. the inferred black holemasses (mbh~ 2x10^8 msun) of typical agn are similar to those of opticallyidentified quasars at similar redshifts. since the agn in our sample are muchless luminous (l(2-10kev)&lt;10^44 erg/s) than quasars, typical agn have loweddington ratios (eta~0.01-0.001). this suggests that, at least at intermediatez, the cosmic agn 'downsizing' is due to both a decrease in the characteristicstellar mass of typical host galaxies, and less efficient accretion. finallythere is no strong evidence in agn host galaxies for either highly suppressedsf (expected if agn played a role in quenching sf) or elevated sf when comparedto mass selected (i.e., irac-selected) galaxies of similar stellar masses andredshifts. this may be explained by the fact that galaxies with m*~5x 10^10 -5x10^11 msun are still being assembled at the redshifts probed here.

1302.6858	estimations of the magnetic field strength in the torus of agn using  near-infrared polarimetry	an optically and geometrically thick torus obscures the central engine ofactive galactic nuclei (agn) from some lines of sight. from amagnetohydrodynamical framework, the torus can be considered to be a particularregion of clouds surrounding the central engine where the clouds are dusty andoptically thick. in this framework, the magnetic field plays an important rolein the creation, morphology and evolution of the torus. if the dust grainswithin the clouds are assumed to be aligned by paramagnetic alignment, then theratio of the intrinsic polarisation and visual extinction, p(%)/av, is afunction of the magnetic field strength.  to estimate the visual extinction through the torus and constrain thepolarisation mechanisms in the nucleus of agn, we developed a polarisationmodel to fit both the total and polarised flux in a 1.2" (~263pc) aperture ofthe type 2 agn, ic5063. the polarisation model is consistent with the nuclearpolarisation observed at k being produced by dichroic absorption from aligneddust grains with a visual extinction through the torus of 48$\pm$2 mag. weestimated the intrinsic polarisation arising from dichroic absorption to bep$_{k}^{dic}$=12.5$\pm$2.7%.  we consider the physical conditions and environment of the gas and dust forthe torus of ic5063. then, through paramagnetic alignment, we estimate amagnetic field strength in the range of 12-128mg in the nir emitting regions ofthe torus of ic5063. alternatively, we estimate the magnetic field strength inthe plane of the sky using the chandrasekhar-fermi method. the minimum magneticfield strength in the plane of the sky is estimated to be 13 and 41 mgdepending of the conditions within the torus of ic5063. these techniques affordthe chance to make a survey of agn, to investigate the effects of magneticfield strength on the torus, accretion, and interaction to the host galaxy.

1304.0894	vlt-sinfoni integral field spectroscopy of low-z luminous and  ultraluminous infrared galaxies ii. 2d extinction structure and distance  effects	we present a 2d study of the internal extinction on (sub)kiloparsec scales ofa sample of local (z&lt;0.1) (u)lirgs, based on near-infrared pa_a, br_d, and br_gline ratios, obtained with vlt-sinfoni integral-field spectroscopy. the 2dextinction (av) distributions of the objects, map regions of ~3x3 kpc (lirgs)and ~12x12 kpc (ulirgs), with average angular resolutions (fwhm) of ~0.2 kpcand ~0.9 kpc, respectively. the individual av galaxy distributions indicate avery clumpy dust structure already on sub-kiloparsec scales, with values (perspaxel) ranging from av ~ 1 to 20 mag in lirgs, and from av ~ 2 to 15 mag inulirgs. as a class, the median values of the distributions are av=5.3 mag andav=6.5 mag for the lirg and ulirg subsamples, respectively.  we evaluated the effects of the galaxy distance in the measurements of theextinction as a function of the linear scale (in kpc) of the spaxel (i.e. dueto the limited angular resolution of the observations). if the distribution ofthe gas/dust and star-forming regions in local lirgs (63 mpc, 40 pc/spaxel onaverage) is the same for galaxies at greater distances, the observed median avvalues based on emission line ratios would be a factor ~0.8 lower at theaverage distance of our ulirg sample (328 mpc, 0.2 kpc/spaxel), and a factor~0.67 for galaxies located at distances of more than 800 mpc (0.4 kpc/spaxel).this distance effect would have implications for deriving the intrinsicextinction in high-z star-forming galaxies and for subsequent properties suchas star formation rate, star formation surface density, and ks- law, based onh_alpha line fluxes. if local lirgs are analogues of the main-sequencestar-forming galaxies at cosmological distances, the extinction values (av)derived from the observed emission lines in these high-z sources would need tobe increased by a factor 1.4 on average.

1305.7237	uncovering obscured luminous agn with wise	mateos et al. (2012) presented a highly reliable and efficient mid-infrared(mir) colour-based selection technique for luminous active galactic nuclei(agn) using the wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise) survey. here weevaluate the effectiveness of this technique to identify obscured agn missed inx-ray surveys. to do so we study the wise properties of agn independentlyselected in hard x-ray and optical surveys. we use the largest catalogue of 887[o iii]{\lambda}5007-selected type 2 quasars (qso2s) at z&lt;0.83 in theliterature from the sloan digital sky survey, and the 258 hard (&gt;4.5 kev)x-ray-selected agn from the bright ultrahard xmm-newton survey (buxs). thefraction of sdss qso2s in our infrared agn selection region (wedge) increaseswith the agn luminosity, reaching 66.1+4.5_4.7% at the highest [o iii]luminosities in the sample. this fraction is substantially lower than for thebuxs type 1 agn (96.1+3.0_6.3%), but consistent, within the uncertainties, withthat for the buxs type 2 agn (75.0+14.1_19.1%) with the same luminosity. thesdss qso2s appear to reside in more luminous (massive) hosts than the buxs agn,due to the tight magnitude limits applied in the sdss spectroscopic targetselection. since host galaxy dilution can reduce substantially theeffectiveness of mir-based techniques, this may explain the lower fraction ofsdss qso2s in the wise agn wedge. the fraction of sdss qso2s identified ascompton-thick candidates that fall in the wedge is consistent with the fractionof all sdss qso2s in that zone. at the agn luminosities involved in thecomparison, compton-thick and compton-thin sdss qso2s have similar wise colourdistributions. we conclude that at high luminosities and z&lt;1 our mir techniqueis very effective at identifying both compton-thin and compton-thick agn.

1306.2328	the hot and energetic universe: understanding the build-up of  supermassive black holes and galaxies at the heyday of the universe	observations in the last decade have provided strong evidence that the growthof supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies is among the mostinfluential processes in galaxy evolution. open questions that relate to ourcurrent understanding of black hole growth and its relation to the build-up ofgalaxies at redshifts z=1-4, when most black holes and stars we see inpresent-day galaxies were put in place, include: what is the nature of agnfeedback and whether it plays a significant role in the evolution of galaxies?what is the dominant population of accreting agn at that critical epoch? is itdominated by obscured objects as required by many current observations andmodels? the athena+ mission concept will provide the technological leaprequired for a breakthrough in our understanding of agn and galaxy evolution atthe heyday of the universe. the high throughput of athena+ will allow thesystematic study of the incidence, nature and energetics of agn feedbackprocesses to z~4 via the identification and measurement of blue-shifted x-rayabsorption lines. the excellent survey and spectral capabilities of the athena+wide field imager will complete the census of black hole growth by yieldingsamples of up to 100 times larger than is currently possible of the mostheavily obscured, including compton thick, agn to redshifts z~4. thedemographics of this population relative to their hosts is fundamental forunderstanding how major black hole growth events relate to the build-up ofgalaxies.

1307.1471	the xmm-newton deep survey in the cdf-s vi. obscured agn selected as  infrared power-law galaxies	accretion onto smbh is believed to occur mostly in obscured agn. such objectsare proving rather elusive in surveys of distant galaxies, including those atx-ray energies. our main goal is to determine whether the revised irac criteriaof donley et al. (2012) (objects with an ir power-law spectral shape), areeffective at selecting x-ray type-2 agn. we present the results from the x-rayspectral analysis of 147 agn selected by cross-correlating the highest spectralquality ultra-deep xmm-newton and the spitzer/irac catalogues in the cdf-s.consequently it is biased towards sources with high s/n x-ray spectra. in orderto measure the amount of intrinsic absorption in these sources, we adopt asimple x-ray spectral model that includes a power-law modified by intrinsicabsorption and a possible soft x-ray component. we find 21/147 sources to beheavily absorbed but the uncertainties in their obscuring column densities donot allow us to confirm their compton-thick nature without resorting toadditional criteria. although ir power-law galaxies are less numerous in oursample than ir non-power-law galaxies (60 versus 87 respectively), we find thatthe fraction of absorbed (n_{h} &gt; 10^{22} cm^{-2}) agn is significantly higher(at about 3 sigma level) for ir-power-law sources ($\sim$2/3) than for thosesources that do not meet this ir selection criteria ($\sim$1/2). this behaviouris particularly notable at low luminosities, but it appears to be present,although with a marginal significance, at all luminosities. we thereforeconclude that the ir power-law method is efficient in finding x-ray-absorbedsources. we would then expect that the long-sought dominant population ofabsorbed agn is abundant among ir power-law spectral shape sources not detectedin x-rays.

1309.3922	mid- to far infrared properties of star-forming galaxies and active  galactic nuclei	we study the mid- to far-ir properties of a 24um-selected flux-limited sample(s24 &gt; 5mjy) of 154 intermediate redshift (&lt;z&gt;~0.15), infrared luminousgalaxies, drawn from the 5muses survey. by combining existing mid-irspectroscopy and new herschel spire submm photometry from the hermes program,we derived robust total infrared luminosity (lir) and dust mass (md) estimatesand infered the relative contribution of the agn to the infrared energy budgetof the sources. we found that the total infrared emission of galaxies with weak6.2um pah emission (ew&lt;0.2um) is dominated by agn activity, while for galaxieswith ew&gt;0.2um more than 50% of the lir arises from star formation. we alsofound that for galaxies detected in the 250-500um herschel bands an agn has astatistically insignificant effect on the temperature of the cold dust and thefar-ir colours of the host galaxy, which are primarily shaped by star formationactivity. for star-forming galaxies we reveal an anti-correlation between thelir-to-rest-frame 8um luminosity ratio, ir8 = lir\l8, and the strength of pahfeatures. we found that this anti-correlation is primarily driven by variationsin the pahs emission, and not by variations in the 5-15um mid-ir continuumemission. using the [neiii]/[neii] line ratio as a tracer of the hardness ofthe radiation field, we confirm that galaxies with harder radiation fields tendto exhibit weaker pah features, and found that they have higher ir8 values andhigher dust-mass-weighted luminosities (lir/md), the latter being a proxy forthe dust temperature (td). we argue that these trends originate either fromvariations in the environment of the star-forming regions or are caused byvariations in the age of the starburst. finally, we provide scaling relationsthat will allow estimating lir, based on single-band observations with themid-infrared instrument, on board the upcoming jwst.

1310.1892	the role of the accretion disk, dust, and jets in the ir emission of  low-luminosity agn	we use recent high-resolution infrared (ir; 1 - 20 micron) photometry toexamine the origin of the ir emission in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei(llagn). the data are compared with published model fits that describe thespectral energy distribution of llagn in terms of an advection-dominatedaccretion flow (adaf), truncated thin accretion disk, and jet. the truncateddisk in these models is usually not luminous enough to explain the observed iremission, and in all cases its spectral shape is much narrower than the broadir peaks in the data. synchrotron radiation from the jet appears to beimportant in very radio-loud nuclei, but the detection of strong silicateemission features in many objects indicates that dust must also contribute. weinvestigate this point by fitting the ir sed of ngc 3998 using dusty torus andoptically thin (tau_mir ~ 1) dust shell models. while more detailed modeling isnecessary, these initial results suggest that dust may account for the nuclearmid-ir emission of many llagn.

1311.0703	nuclear star formation activity and black hole accretion in nearby  seyfert galaxies	recent theoretical and observational works indicate the presence of acorrelation between the star formation rate (sfr) and the active galacticnuclei (agn) luminosity (and, therefore, the black hole accretion rate) ofseyfert galaxies. this suggests a physical connection between the gas formingstars on kpc scales and the gas on sub-pc scales that is feeding the blackhole. we compiled the largest sample of seyfert galaxies to date with highangular resolution (0.4-0.8 arcsec) mid-infrared (8-13 micron) spectroscopy.the sample includes 29 seyfert galaxies drawn from the agn revised shapley-amescatalogue. at a median distance of 33 mpc, our data allow us to probe nuclearregions on scales of 65 pc (median value). we found no general evidence ofsuppression of the 11.3 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emissionin the vicinity of these agn, and used this feature as a proxy for the sfr. wedetected the 11.3 micron pah feature in the nuclear spectra of 45% of oursample. the derived nuclear sfrs are, on average, five times lower than thosemeasured in circumnuclear regions of 600 pc in size (median value). however,the projected nuclear sfr densities are a factor of 20 higher than thosemeasured on circumnuclear scales. this indicates that the sf activity per unitarea in the central 65 pc of seyfert galaxies is much higher than at largerdistances from their nuclei. we studied the connection between the nuclear sfrand the black hole accretion rate and showed that numerical simulationsreproduce fairly well our observed relation.

1409.0674	a mid-infrared view of the inner parsecs of the seyfert galaxy mrk 1066  using canaricam/gtc	we present mid-infrared (mir) imaging and spectroscopic data of the seyfert 2galaxy mrk 1066 obtained with canaricam (cc) on the 10.4 m gran telescopiocanarias (gtc). the galaxy was observed in imaging mode with an angularresolution of 0.24 arcsec (54 pc) in the si-2 filter (8.7 micron). the imagereveals a series of star-forming knots within the central ~400 pc, aftersubtracting the dominant active galactic nucleus (agn) component. we alsosubtracted this agn unresolved component from the 8-13 micron spectra of theknots and the nucleus, and measured equivalent widths (ews) of the 11.3 micronpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) feature which are typical of purestarburst galaxies. this ew is larger in the nucleus than in the knots,confirming that, at least in the case of mrk 1066, the agn dilutes, rather thandestroys, the molecules responsible for the 11.3 micron pah emission. bycomparing the nuclear gtc/cc spectrum with the spitzer/irs spectrum of thegalaxy, we find that the agn component that dominates the continuum emission atwavelengths below 15 micron on scales of ~60 pc (90-100%) decreases to 35-50%when the emission of the central ~830 pc is considered. on the other hand, theagn contribution dominates the 15-25 micron emission (75%) on the scales probedby spitzer/irs. we find a good match between the mir morphology of mrk 1066 andthe extended pab, brg and [o iii] emission. this coincidence implies that the8.7 micron emission is probing star formation, dust in the narrow-line region,and the oval structure previously detected in the near-infrared. on the otherhand, the chandra soft x-ray morphology does not match any of the previous,contrary to what it is generally assumed for seyfert galaxies.

1409.5605	a far-infrared spectroscopic survey of intermediate redshift (ultra)  luminous infrared galaxies	we present herschel far-ir photometry and spectroscopy as well as groundbased co observations of an intermediate redshift (0.21 &lt; z &lt; 0.88) sample ofherschel-selected (ultra)-luminous infrared galaxies (l_ir &gt; 10^11.5l_sun).with these measurements we trace the dust continuum, far-ir atomic lineemission, in particular [cii]\,157.7microns, as well as the molecular gas ofz~0.3 (u)lirgs and perform a detailed investigation of the interstellar mediumof the population. we find that the majority of herschel-selected intermediateredshift (u)lirgs have l_cii/l_fir ratios that are a factor of about 10 higherthan that of local ulirgs and comparable to that of local normal and high-$z$star forming galaxies. using our sample to bridge local and high-z [cii]observations, we find that the majority of galaxies at all redshifts and allluminosities follow a l_cii-l_fir relation with a slope of unity, from whichlocal ulirgs and high-z agn dominated sources are clear outliers. we alsoconfirm that the strong anti-correlation between the l_cii/l_fir ratio and thefar-ir color l_60/l_100 observed in the local universe holds over a broad rangeof redshifts and luminosities, in the sense that warmer sources exhibit lowerl_cii/l_fir at any epoch. intermediate redshift ulirgs are also characterisedby large molecular gas reservoirs and by lower star formation efficienciescompared to that of local ulirgs. the high l_cii/l_fir ratios, the moderatestar formation efficiencies (l_lir/l_co or l_ir/m_gas) and the relatively lowdust temperatures of our sample (which are also common characteristics ofhigh-z star forming galaxies with ulirg-like luminosities) indicate that theevolution of the physical properties of (u)lirgs between the present day and z&gt; 1 is already significant by z ~ 0.3.

1501.03826	on the liner nuclear obscuration, compton-thickness and the existence of  the dusty torus; clues from spitzer/irs spectra	most of the optically classified low ionisation narrow emission-line regions(liners) nuclei host an active galactic nuclei (agn). however, how they fitinto the unified model (um) of agn is still an open question. the aims of thiswork are to study at mid-infrared (mid-ir) (1) the compton-thick nature ofliners; and (2) the disappearance of the dusty torus in liners predicted fromtheoretical arguments. we have compiled all the available low spectralresolution mid-ir spectra of liners from the irs/spitzer (40 liners). we havecomplemented this sample with spitzer/irs spectra of pgqsos, s1s, s2s, and sbsnuclei. we have studied the agn versus the starburst content in our sampleusing different indicators: the ew(pah 6.2um), the strength of the silicatefeature at 9.7um, and the steepness of the mid-ir spectra. in 25 out of the 40liners (i.e., 62.5%) the mid-ir spectra are not sb-dominated, similar to thecomparison s2 sample (67.7%). the average spectra of both sb-dominated linersand s2s are very similar to the average spectrum of the sb class. moreover, theaverage spectrum of agn-dominated liners with lx(2-10kev)&gt;10e+41 erg/s issimilar to the average mid-ir spectrum of agn-dominated s2s. however, faintliners show flat spectra different from any of the other optical classes,suggesting the disappearance of the dusty torus. the correlation betweennulnu(12um) and lx(2-10kev) for agn nicely extends toward low luminosities onlyif sb-dominated liners are excluded and lx(2-10kev) is corrected incompton-thick liner candidates. we discuss the nature of faint liners bycomparing it with the spectra of several emission mechanisms like jet, adaf,planetary nebulae, or post-agb stars. we suggest that the material producingthe compton-thick x-ray obscuration is free of dust, to reconcile thecompton-thick nature of a large fraction of liners with the lack of dusty-torussignatures.

1501.04335	revisiting the relationship between 6 {\mu}m and 2-10 kev continuum  luminosities of agn	we have determined the relation between the agn luminosities at rest-frame 6{\mu}m associated to the dusty torus emission and at 2-10 kev energies using acomplete, x-ray flux limited sample of 232 agn drawn from the bright ultra-hardxmm-newton survey. the objects have intrinsic x-ray luminosities between 10^42and 10^46 erg/s and redshifts from 0.05 to 2.8. the rest-frame 6 {\mu}mluminosities were computed using data from the wide-field infrared surveyexplorer and are based on a spectral energy distribution decomposition into agnand galaxy emission. the best-fit relationship for the full sample isconsistent with being linear, l_6 {\mu}m $\propto$ l_2-10 kev^0.99$\pm$0.032,with intrinsic scatter, ~0.35 dex in log l_6 {\mu}m. the l_6 {\mu}m/l_2-10 kevluminosity ratio is largely independent on the line-of-sight x-ray absorption.assuming a constant x-ray bolometric correction, the fraction of agn bolometricluminosity reprocessed in the mid-ir decreases weakly, if at all, with the agnluminosity, a finding at odds with simple receding torus models. type 2 agnhave redder mid-ir continua at rest-frame wavelengths &lt;12 {\mu}m and areoverall ~1.3-2 times fainter at 6 {\mu}m than type 1 agn at a given x-rayluminosity. regardless of whether type 1 and type 2 agn have the same ordifferent nuclear dusty toroidal structures, our results imply that the agnemission at rest-frame 6 {\mu}m is not isotropic due to self-absorption in thedusty torus, as predicted by agn torus models. thus, agn surveys at rest-frame6 {\mu}m are subject to modest dust obscuration biases.

1503.02964	the silicate absorption profile in the ism towards the heavily obscured  nucleus of ngc 4418	the 9.7-micron silicate absorption profile in the interstellar mediumprovides important information on the physical and chemical composition ofinterstellar dust grains. measurements in the milky way have shown that theprofile in the diffuse interstellar medium is very similar to the amorphoussilicate profiles found in circumstellar dust shells around late m stars, andnarrower than the silicate profile in denser star-forming regions. here, weinvestigate the silicate absorption profile towards the very heavily obscurednucleus of ngc 4418, the galaxy with the deepest known silicate absorptionfeature, and compare it to the profiles seen in the milky way. comparisonbetween the 8-13 micron spectrum obtained with trecs on gemini and the largeraperture spectrum obtained from the spitzer archive indicates that the formerisolates the nuclear emission, while spitzer detects low surface brightnesscircumnuclear diffuse emission in addition. the silicate absorption profiletowards the nucleus is very similar to that in the diffuse ism in the milky waywith no evidence of spectral structure from crystalline silicates or siliconcarbide grains.

1505.04705	high-resolution imaging of the molecular outflows in two mergers:  iras17208-0014 and ngc1614	galaxy evolution scenarios predict that the feedback of star formation andnuclear activity (agn) can drive the transformation of gas-rich spiral mergersinto ulirgs, and, eventually, lead to the build-up of qso/elliptical hosts. westudy the role that star formation and agn feedback have in launching andmaintaining the molecular outflows in two starburst-dominated advanced mergers,ngc1614 and iras17208-0014, by analyzing the distribution and kinematics oftheir molecular gas reservoirs. we have used the pdbi array to image with highspatial resolution (0.5"-1.2") the co(1-0) and co(2-1) line emissions inngc1614 and iras17208-0014, respectively. the velocity fields of the gas areanalyzed and modeled to find the evidence of molecular outflows in thesesources and characterize the mass, momentum and energy of these components.while most (&gt;95%) of the co emission stems from spatially-resolved(~2-3kpc-diameter) rotating disks, we also detect in both mergers the emissionfrom high-velocity line wings that extend up to +-500-700km/s, well beyond theestimated virial range associated with rotation and turbulence. the kinematicmajor axis of the line wing emission is tilted by ~90deg in ngc1614 and by~180deg in iras17208-0014 relative to their respective rotating disk majoraxes. these results can be explained by the existence of non-coplanar molecularoutflows in both systems. in stark contrast with ngc1614, where star formationalone can drive its molecular outflow, the mass, energy and momentum budgetrequirements of the molecular outflow in iras17208-0014 can be best accountedfor by the existence of a so far undetected (hidden) agn of l_agn~7x10^11l_sun. the geometry of the molecular outflow in iras17208-0014 suggests thatthe outflow is launched by a non-coplanar disk that may be associated with aburied agn in the western nucleus.

1506.07170	near-infrared polarimetric adaptive optics observations of ngc 1068: a  torus created by a hydromagnetic outflow wind	we present j' and k' imaging linear polarimetric adaptive optics observationsof ngc 1068 using mmt-pol on the 6.5-m mmt. these observations allow us tostudy the torus from a magnetohydrodynamical (mhd) framework. in a 0.5" (30 pc)aperture at k', we find that polarisation arising from the passage of radiationfrom the inner edge of the torus through magnetically aligned dust grains inthe clumps is the dominant polarisation mechanism, with an intrinsicpolarisation of 7.0%$\pm$2.2%. this result yields a torus magnetic fieldstrength in the range of 4$-$82 mg through paramagnetic alignment, and139$^{+11}_{-20}$ mg through the chandrasekhar-fermi method. the measuredposition angle (p.a.) of polarisation at k$'$ is found to be similar to thep.a. of the obscuring dusty component at few parsec scales using infraredinterferometric techniques. we show that the constant component of the magneticfield is responsible for the alignment of the dust grains, and aligned with thetorus axis onto the plane of the sky. adopting this magnetic fieldconfiguration and the physical conditions of the clumps in the mhd outflow windmodel, we estimate a mass outflow rate $\le$0.17 m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ at 0.4pc from the central engine for those clumps showing near-infrared dichroism.the models used were able to create the torus in a timescale of $\geq$10$^{5}$yr with a rotational velocity of $\leq$1228 km s$^{-1}$ at 0.4 pc. we concludethat the evolution, morphology and kinematics of the torus in ngc 1068 can beexplained within a mhd framework.

1511.01926	x-ray long-term variations in the low-luminosity agn ngc835 and its  circumnuclear emission	obscured active galactic nuclei (agns) are thought to be very common in theuniverse. observations and surveys have shown that the number of sourcesincreases for near galaxies and at the low-luminosity regime (the so-calledllagns). furthermore, many agns show changes in their obscuration properties atx-rays that may suggest a configuration of clouds very close to the accretiondisk. however, these variations could also be due to changes in the intrinsiccontinuum of the source. it is therefore important to study nearby agn tobetter understand the locus and distribution of clouds in the neighbourhood ofthe nucleus. we aim to study the nuclear obscuration of llagn ngc835 and itsextended emission using mid-infrared observations. we present mid-infrared 11.5microns imaging of the llagn galaxy ngc835 obtained with the instrumentcanaricam in the gran telescopio canarias (gtc), archival spitzer/irsspectroscopy, and archival chandra data observed in 2000, 2008, and 2013. thegtc/canaricam 11.5 microns image reveals faint extended emission out to ~6arcsec. we obtained a nuclear flux of f(11.5 microns) ~18 mjy, whereas theextended emission accounts for 90% of the total flux within the 6 arcsec. thismeans that the low angular resolution (~4 arcsec) irs spectrum is dominated bythis extended emission and not by the agn, clearly seen in the spitzer/irsspectrum. although the extended soft x-ray emission shows some resemblance withthat of the mid-infrared, the knots seen at x-rays are mostly located in theinner side of this mid-infrared emission. the nuclear x-ray spectrum of thesource has undergone a spectral change between 2000/2008 and 2013. we arguethat this is most probably due to changes in the hydrogen column density from ~8x10e+23 cm-2 to ~ 3x10e+23 cm-2. ngc835 therefore is one of the few llagn,together with ngc1052, in which changes in the absorber can be claimed.

astro-ph;0008317	ngc1614: a laboratory for starburst evolution	the modest extinction and reasonably face-on viewing geometry make theluminous ir galaxy ngc1614 an ideal laboratory for study of a powerfulstarburst. hst/nicmos observations show: 1.) deep co stellar absorption,tracing a starburst nucleus about 45 pc in diameter; 2.) surrounded by a ~600pc diameter ring of supergiant hii regions revealed in pa$\alpha$ lineemission; 3.) lying within a molecular ring indicated by its extinction shadowin h-k; 4.) all at the center of a disturbed spiral galaxy. the luminosities ofthe giant hii regions in the ring are extremely high, an order of magnitudebrighter than 30 doradus. the relation of deep stellar co bands to surroundingionized gas ring to molecular gas indicates that the luminous starburst startedin the nucleus and is propagating outward into the surrounding molecular ring.this hypothesis is supported by evolutionary starburst modeling that shows thatthe properties of ngc1614 can be fitted with two short-lived bursts of starformation separated by 5 myr. the total dynamical mass of the starburst regionof 1.3x10^9 msol is mostly accounted for by the old pre-star burst stellarpopulation. although our starburst models use a modified salpeter imf, thetight mass budget suggests that the imf may contain relatively more 10-30 msolstars and fewer low mass stars than the salpeter function. the dynamical massis nearly 4 times smaller than the mass of molecular gas estimated from thestandard ratio of 12co(1-0) to h2. a number of arguments place the mass of gasin the starburst region at ~25% of the dynamical mass, nominally about 1/15 andwith an upper limit of 1/10 of the amount estimated from 12co and the standardratio.

astro-ph;0009275	interpreting the kinematics of the extended gas in distant radiogalaxies  from 8-10m telescope spectra	the nature of the extreme kinematics in the extended gas of distant radiogalaxies (z&gt;0.7) is still an open question. with the advent of the 8-10 mtelescope generation and the development of nir arrays we are in the positionfor the first time to develop a more detailed study by using lines other thanlya and [oii]3727 depending on redshift. in this paper we review the mainsources of uncertainty in the interpretation of the emission line kinematics:the presence of several kinematic components, lya absorption by neutralgas/dust and the contribution of scattered light to some of the lines. as anexample, several kinematic components can produce apparent, false rotationcurves. we propose methods to solve these uncertainties. we propose to extendthe methods applied to low redshift radio galaxies to investigate the nature ofthe kinematics in distant radio galaxies: by means of the spectraldecomposition of the strong optical emission lines (redshifted into the nir) wecan isolate the different kinematic components and study the emission lineratios for the individual components. if shocks are responsible for the extremekinematics, we should be able to isolate a kinematic component (the shockedgas) with large fwhm (&gt;900 km/s), low ionization level [oiii]5007/hb~2-4 andweak heii4686/hb&lt;0.07, together with a narrow component (~few hundred km/s)with higher ionization level and strong heii emission (heii/hb~0.5)

astro-ph;0012096	the non-stellar infrared continuum of seyfert galaxies	jhkl'm (1-5 micron) imaging of a sample of seyfert (sy) 2 galaxies ispresented. we confirm that the 1-2.2 micron nuclear continuum of some sy 2s isdominated by stellar emission, whereas the continuum emission at longerwavelengths (3-5 micron) is almost entirely non-stellar in origin. the irnon-stellar spectral energy distributions (sed) (up to 15 micron) of sygalaxies show a variety of shapes, and they are well reproduced with thetapered disk models of efstathiou &amp; rowan-robinson (1995). we have used twomodels, one including an optically thin cone component and a coneless model.although our modelling of the seds does not allow us to favor either model toaccount for all the observed seds, we find that the viewing angle towards thecentral source is well constrained by both models. we have also investigatednon-stellar color-color diagrams. the colors of the sy galaxies with viewingangles theta &lt; 30 degree are better reproduced with the cone model. thesediagrams provide a good means to separate sy 2s with moderate obscuration (a_v&lt; 20 mag, from hard x-ray observations) from those with high obscuration. theground-based 4.8 micron and iso 9.6 micron luminosities are well correlatedwith the hard x-ray luminosities of sy 1s and 2s. these continuum emissionsappear as a good indicator of the agn luminosity, at least in the cases of hardx-ray compton-thin sy galaxies. we finally stress the finding that some comptonthick galaxies show bright non-stellar emission at 5 micron. this suggests thatthe near-ir emission in sys is produced in an extended component illuminated bythe central source, that is more visible from all viewing angles. we discusspossible implications of mid-ir surveys for the search of counterparts ofhighly obscured hard x-ray sources.

astro-ph;0109198	chandra observations of the luminous ir galaxy ngc3256	we present a detailed analysis of high-resolution chandra observations of themerger system ngc3256, the most ir luminous galaxy in the nearby universe. thex-ray data show that several discrete sources embedded in complex diffuseemission contribute ~&gt;20 of the total emission (l_x^tot ~8e41 ergs/s in the0.5-10 kev energy range). the compact sources are hard and extremely bright andtheir emission is probably dominated by accretion driven processes. both galaxynuclei are detected with l_x ~3-10e40 ergs/s. no evidence is found for thepresence of an active nucleus in the southern nucleus, contrary to previousspeculation. once the discrete sources are removed, the diffuse component has asoft spectrum which can be modelled by the superposition of 3 thermal plasmacomponents with temperatures kt = 0.6, 0.9 and 3.9 kev. alternatively, thelatter component can be described as a power-law with index gamma ~3. someevidence is found for a radial gradient of the amount of absorption andtemperature of the diffuse component. we compare the x-ray emission withoptical, halpha and nicmos images of ngc3256 and find a good correlationbetween the inferred optical/near-ir and x-ray extinctions. although inversecompton scattering could be important in explaining the hard x-rays seen in thecompact sources associated with the nuclei, the observed diffuse emission isprobably of thermal origin. the observed x-ray characteristics support ascenario in which the powerful x-ray emission is driven solely by the currentepisode of star formation.

astro-ph;0204269	the relation between the mid-infrared emission and black hole mass in  active galactic nuclei: a direct way to probe black hole growth?	we use a large, heterogeneous sample of local active galactic nuclei (agn)that includes seyfert 1s, seyfert 2s and pg quasars to investigate for thefirst time the relation between black hole mass (m_bh) and mid-infrared nuclearemission. we find a clear relation between m_bh and the 10 micron nuclearluminosity for these local agns. there are no significant differences betweentype 1 and type 2 objects, implying that the reprocessing of the 10 micronnuclear emission is not severely affected by geometric and optical deptheffects. we also confirm that m_bh is related to the 2-10kev x-ray luminosity,but only for the compton thin galaxies. we present a theoretical basis forthese empirical relations and discuss possible reasons for the observedscatter. our results show that rest-frame 10 micron and hard x-ray luminosities(especially the former, which is applicable to all agn types) can be powerfultools for conducting a census of black hole masses at high redshift and forprobing their cosmological evolution.

astro-ph;0209396	stellar populations in local star-forming galaxies. i.-data and  modelling procedure	we present an analysis of the integrated properties of the stellarpopulations in the universidad complutense de madrid survey of halpha-selectedgalaxies. in this paper, the first of a series, we describe in detail thetechniques developed to model star-forming galaxies using a mixture of stellarpopulations, and taking into account the observational uncertainties. we assumea recent burst of star formation superimposed on a more evolved population. theeffects of the nebular continuum, line emission and dust attenuation are takeninto account. we also test different model assumptions including the choice ofspecific evolutionary synthesis model, initial mass function, star formationscenario and the treatment of dust extinction. quantitative tests are appliedto determine how well these models fit our multi-wavelength observations forthe ucm sample. our observations span the optical and near infrared, includingboth photometric and spectroscopic data. our results indicate that extinctionplays a key role in this kind of studies, revealing that low- andhigh-extinction objects may require very different extinction laws and must betreated differently. we also demonstrate that the ucm survey galaxies are bestdescribed by a short burst of star formation occurring within a quiescentgalaxy, rather than by continuous star formation. a detailed discussion on theinferred parameters, such as the age, burst strength, metallicity, starformation rate, extinction and total stellar mass for individual objects, ispresented in paper ii of this series.

astro-ph;0209397	stellar populations in local star-forming galaxies. ii.-recent star  formation properties and stellar masses	we present the integrated properties of the stellar populations in theuniversidad complutense de madrid survey galaxies. applying the techniquesdescribed in the first paper of this series, we derive ages, burst masses andmetallicities of the newly-formed stars in our sample galaxies. the populationof young stars is responsible for the halpha emission used to detect theobjects in the ucm survey. we also infer total stellar masses and starformation rates in a consistent way taking into account the evolutionaryhistory of each galaxy. we find that an average ucm galaxy has a total stellarmass of ~1e10 msun, of which about 5% has been formed in an instantaneous burstoccurred about 5 myr ago, and sub-solar metallicity. less than 10% of thesample shows massive starbursts involving more than half of the total mass ofthe galaxy. several correlations are found among the derived properties. theburst strength is correlated with the extinction and with the integratedoptical colours for galaxies with low obscuration. the current star formationrate is correlated with the gas content. a stellar mass-metallicity relation isalso found. our analysis indicates that the ucm survey galaxies span a broadrange in properties between those of galaxies completely dominated bycurrent/recent star formation and those of normal quiescent spirals. we alsofind evidence indicating that star-formation in the local universe is dominatedby galaxies considerably less massive than l*.

astro-ph;0210123	star formation rate estimators: [oii]3727 vs. halpha for local  star-forming galaxies	the [oii]3727 emission line is frequently used as an indicator of the starformation rate (sfr) despite its complex dependence on metallicity andexcitation conditions. we have analysed the properties of the [oii] and halphaemission lines for a complete sample of local halpha-selected galaxies, theuniversidad complutense de madrid (ucm) survey. we find a large scatter in the[oii]/halpha line ratios, although the scatter in the extinction-corrected[oii]^0/halpha^0 ratio is considerably smaller. we also find that the[oii]/halpha ratios are reasonably well correlated with the absolute b- andk-band magnitudes and with ew([oii]). however, the extinction-corrected[oii]^0/halpha^0 ratio is largely independent of these quantities, indicatingthat extinction is the main driver of the correlations. these correlationsallow us to statistically predict--with varying degrees of accuracy--theobserved and extinction-corrected halpha fluxes from the observed [oii] fluxusing the information contained in ew([oii]) and/or the absolute magnitudes,but extreme caution is needed to make sure that the sample selection effectsare correctly taken into account.

astro-ph;0302323	the infrared supernova rate in starburst galaxies	we report the results of our ongoing search for extincted supernovae (sne) atnear-infrared wavelengths. we have monitored at 2.2 micron a sample of 46luminous infrared galaxies and detected 4 sne. the number of detections isstill small but sufficient to provide the first estimate of supernova rate atnear-infrared wavelengths. we measure a sn rate ofv 7.6+/-3.8 snu which is anorder of magnitude larger than observed in quiescent galaxies. on the otherhand, the observed near-infrared rate is still a factor 3-10 smaller than thatestimated from the far-infrared luminosity of the galaxies. among variouspossibilities, the most likely scenario is that dust extinction is so high(av&gt;30) to obscure most sne even in the near-ir.  the role of type ia sne is also discussed within this context. we derive thetype ia sn rate as a function of the stellar mass of the galaxy and find asharp increase toward galaxies with higher activity of star formation. thissuggests that a significant fraction of type ia sne are associated with youngstellar populations.  finally, as a by-product, we give the average k-band light curve ofcore-collapse sne based on all the existing data, and review the relationbetween sn rate and far-infrared luminosity.

astro-ph;0303088	luminosity and stellar mass functions of local star-forming galaxies	we present the optical and near-infrared luminosity and mass functions of thelocal star-forming galaxies in the universidad complutense de madrid survey. abivariate method which explicitly deals with the halpha selection of the surveyis used when estimating these functions. total stellar masses have beencalculated on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis taking into account differences in starformation histories. the main difference between the luminosity distributionsof the ucm sample and the luminosity functions of the local galaxy populationis a lower normalization (phi^*), indicating a lower global volume density ofucm galaxies. the typical near-infrared luminosity (l^*) of local star-forminggalaxies is fainter than that of normal galaxies. this is a direct consequenceof the lower stellar masses of our objects. however, at optical wavelengths (band r) the luminosity enhancement arising from the young stars leads to m^*values that are similar to those of normal galaxies. the fraction of the totaloptical and near infrared luminosity density in the local universe associatedwith star-forming galaxies is 10-20%. fitting the total stellar mass functionusing a schechter parametrization we obtain alpha=-1.15+/-0.15,log({m}^*)=10.82+/-0.17 msun and log(phi^*)=-3.04+/-0.20 mpc^{-3}. this givesan integrated total stellar mass density of 10^{7.83+/-0.07} msun mpc^{-3} inlocal star-forming galaxies (h_0=70 km s^{-1} mpc^{-1}, omega_m=0.3,lambda=0.7). the volume-averaged burst strength of the ucm galaxies isb=0.04+/-0.01, defined as the ratio of the mass density of stars formed inrecent bursts (age&lt;10 myr) to the total stellar mass density in ucm galaxies.finally, we derive that, in the local universe, (13+/-3)% of the total baryonmass density in the form of stars is associated with star-forming galaxies.

astro-ph;0405612	extremely red objects in the lockman hole	we investigate extremely red objects (eros) using near- and mid-infraredobservations in five passbands (3.6 to 24 micron) obtained from the spitzerspace telescope, and deep ground-based r and k imaging. the great sensitivityof the irac camera allows us to detect 64 eros in only 12 minutes of iracexposure time, by means of an r-[3.6] color cut (analogous to the traditionalred r-k cut). a pure infrared k-[3.6] red cut detects a somewhat differentpopulation and may be more effective at selecting z &gt; 1.3 eros. we find 17% ofall galaxies detected by irac at 3.6 or 4.5 micron to be eros. thesepercentages rise to about 40% at 5.8 micron, and about 60% at 8.0 micron. weutilize the spectral bump at 1.6 micron to divide the eros into broad redshiftslices using only near-infrared colors (2.2/3.6/4.5 micron). we conclude thattwo-thirds of all eros lie at redshift z &gt; 1.3. detections at 24 micron implythat at least 11% of 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.3 eros and at least 22% of z &gt; 1.3 eros aredusty star-forming galaxies.

astro-ph;0406016	pahs contribution to the infrared output energy of the universe at z~2	we present an updated phenomenological galaxy evolution model to fit thespitzer 24, 70 and 160 microns number counts as well as all the previous midand far infrared observations. only a minor change of the co-moving luminositydensity distribution in the previous model (lagache, dole, puget 2003),combined with a slight modification of the starburst template spectra mainlybetween 12 and 30 microns, are required to fit all the data available. we showthat the peak in the mips 24 micron counts is dominated by galaxies withredshift between 1 and 2, with a non negligible contribution from the z&gt;2galaxies (~30% at s=0.2 mjy). the very close agreement between the model andnumber counts at 15 and 24 microns strikingly implies that (1) the pahs(policyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) features remain prominent in the redshiftband 0.5 to 2.5 and (2) the ir energy output has to be dominated by ~3 10^11 loto ~3 10^12 lo galaxies from redshift 0.5 to 2.5. combining spitzer with theinfrared space observatory (iso) deep cosmological surveys gives for the firsttime an unbiased view of the infrared universe from z=0 to z=2.5.

astro-ph;0406028	sub-millimeter detections of spitzer space telescope galaxy populations	we present sub-millimeter statistical detections of galaxies discovered inthe 5'x5' spitzer early release observations (to 4-15 microjy 5 sigma at 3.6-8microns, 170 microjy at 24 microns) through a stacking analysis of ourreanalysed scuba 8mjy survey maps, and a spitzer identification of a newsub-millimeter point source in the 8mjy survey region. for sources detected at5.8 or 8 microns (154 and 111 sources respectively), we detect positive skewsin the sub-millimeter flux distributions at 99.2-99.8% confidence usingkolmogorov-smirnov tests, at both 850 microns and 450 microns. we alsomarginally detect the spitzer 24 micron galaxies at 850 microns at 97%confidence, and place limits on the mean sub-millimeter fluxes of the 3.6 and4.5 micron sources. integrating the sub-millimeter fluxes of the spitzerpopulations, we find the 5.8 micron galaxies contribute 0.12 +/- 0.05 nw/m^2/srto the 850 micron background, and 2.4 +/- 0.7 nw/m^2/sr to the 450 micronbackground; similar contributions are made by the 8 micron-selected sample. weinfer that the populations dominating the 5.8 and 8 micron extragalacticbackground light also contribute around a quarter of the 850 micron backgroundand the majority of the 450 micron background.

astro-ph;0406029	24 micron properties of x-ray selected agn	we examine the 24 micron to x-ray color of 157 x-ray--selected agn as afunction of x-ray obscuration and optical classification in the chandra deepfield south. the sample consists of the chandra hard--band detections with hardflux &gt;10^-15 erg/s/cm^2. a deep 24 micron mosaic obtained with spitzer providesmid--infrared fluxes for the sample. since obscured agn locally have higher 24micron / 2-8 kev ratios than unobscured agn, and since x-ray background modelspredict a large population of obscured agn, we expect to find many x-ray--hard,ir--bright agn. instead, we find that the 24 micron to x-ray flux ratio doesnot depend on x-ray hardness in the full sample, nor does it differ betweennarrow--line and broad--line agn. we identify 5 nearly compton--thick agn, andfind they have similar 24 micron to x-ray flux ratios compared to the fullsample. we consider agn in the narrow redshift spikes at z~0.7; for these agn,there is some evidence that the flux ratio increases with x-ray hardness. theredshift slice also shows an odd trend, which is also prominent in the fullsample: a group of x-ray--hard agn with very low 24 micron to x-ray fluxratios.

astro-ph;0406035	the 24 micron source counts in deep spitzer surveys	galaxy source counts in the infrared provide strong constraints on theevolution of the bolometric energy output from distant galaxy populations. wepresent the results from deep 24 micron imaging from spitzer surveys, whichinclude approximately 50,000 sources to an 80% completeness of 60 ujy. the 24micron counts rapidly rise at near-euclidean rates down to 5 mjy, increase witha super-euclidean rate between 0.4 - 4 mjy, and converge below 0.3 mjy. the 24micron counts exceed expectations from non-evolving models by a factor &gt;10 at0.1 mjy. the peak in the differential number counts corresponds to a populationof faint sources that is not expected from predictions based on 15 microncounts from iso. we argue that this implies the existence of a previouslyundetected population of infrared-luminous galaxies at z ~ 1-3. integrating thecounts to 60 ujy, we derive a lower limit on the 24 micron background intensityof 1.9 +/- 0.6 nw m-2 sr-1 of which the majority (~ 60%) stems from sourcesfainter than 0.4 mjy. extrapolating to fainter flux densities, sources below 60ujy contribute 0.8 {+0.9/-0.4} nw m-2 sr-1 to the background, which provides anestimate of the total 24 micron background of 2.7 {+1.1/-0.7} nw m-2 sr-1.

astro-ph;0406064	spatially resolved ultraviolet, h-alpha, infrared, and radio star  formation in m81	we present multiband imaging photometer for spitzer (mips) observations ofm81 at 24, 70, and 160 micron. the grand design nature of m81 is clearly seen,showing two well resolved spiral arms containing numerous bright star formingregions. the mips images reveal a significant amount of cold dust associatedwith the spiral arms. we investigate the variation of the ultraviolet (uv),h-alpha, and infrared (ir) luminosities and star formation rate (sfr)indicators across the face of m81 using the mips images and archival uv andh-alpha images. for regions in m81, we find that uv and h-alpha sfrs(uncorrected for dust attenuation) are always lower than the ir sfr. the causeof this behavior is dust attenuation and/or using sfr calibrations appropriatefor entire galaxies, not regions in galaxies. the characteristics of the dustattenuation for the regions indicate the dust grains and/or geometry aredifferent from those in starburst galaxies. the behavior of the infrared-radiocorrelation in m81 is seen to vary from the global average, with variationscorrelated with the morphology of m81.

astro-ph;0406148	identification of luminous infrared galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;2.5	we present preliminary results on 24micron detections of luminous infraredgalaxies at z&gt;1 with the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer (mips).observations were performed in the lockman hole and the extended groth strip(egs), and were supplemented by data obtained with the infrared array camera(irac) between 3 and 9microns. the positional accuracy of ~2arcsec for mostmips/irac detections provides unambiguous identifications of their opticalcounterparts. using spectroscopic redshifts from the deep extragalacticevolutionary probe survey, we identify 24micron sources at z&gt;1 in the egs,while the combination of the mips/irac observations with $bvrijhk$ ancillarydata in the lockman hole also shows very clear cases of galaxies withphotometric redshifts at 1&lt;z&lt;2.5.  the observed 24micron fluxes indicate infrared luminosities greater than10^11 l_sol, while the data at shorter wavelengths reveal rather red andprobably massive (m&gt;=m*) galaxy counterparts. it is the first time that thispopulation of luminous objects is detected up to z~2.5 in the infrared. ourwork demonstrates the ability of the mips instrument to probe the dustyuniverse at very high redshift, and illustrates how the forthcoming spitzerdeep surveys will offer a unique opportunity to illuminate a dark side ofcosmic history not explored by previous infrared experiments.

astro-ph;0406158	spitzer observations of mambo galaxies: weeding out active nuclei in  starbursting proto-ellipticals	we present spitzer observations in five wavebands between 3.6 and 24um of anunbiased sample of 9 luminous, dusty galaxies selected at 1200um by the mambocamera on the iram 30-m telescope, a population akin to the well-known submm or`scuba' galaxies (hereafter smgs). owing to the coarse resolution of submm/mminstrumentation, smgs have traditionally been difficult to identify at otherwavelengths. we compare our multi-wavelength catalogs to show that the overlapbetween 24 and 1200um must be close to complete at these flux levels. we findthat all (4/4) of the most secure &gt;=4sigma smgs have robust &gt;=4sigmacounterparts at 1.4ghz, while the fraction drops to 7/9 using all &gt;=3sigmasmgs. we show that combining mid-ir and marginal (&gt;=3sigma) radio detectionsprovides plausible identifications in the remaining cases, enabling us toidentify the complete sample. accretion onto an obscured central engine isbetrayed by the shape of the mid-ir continuum emission for several sources,confirming spitzer's potential to weed out active galaxies. we demonstrate thepower of a s(24um)/s(8um) vs s(8um)/s(4.5um) color-color plot as a diagnosticfor this purpose. however, we conclude that the majority (~75%) of smgs haverest-frame mid-/far-ir seds commensurate with obscured starbursts. sensitive24-um observations are clearly a useful route to identify and characterizereliable counterparts to high-redshift far-ir-bright galaxies, complementingwhat is possible via deep radio imaging.

astro-ph;0406192	far infrared imaging of ngc 55	we present images of the galaxy ngc 55 at 24, 70, and 160 micron obtainedwith the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer (mips) instrument aboard thespitzer space telescope. the new images display the far infrared emission inunprecedented detail and demonstrate that the infrared morphology differsdramatically from that at shorter wavelengths. the most luminous emissionregion in the galaxy is marginally resolved at 24 micron and has a projectedseparation of nearly 520 pc from the peak emission in the optical and nearinfrared. this region is responsible for ~9% of the total emission at 24 micronand is likely a young star formation region. we show that this and othercompact sources account for more than 1/3 of the total 24 micron emission. wecompute a total infrared luminosity for ngc 55 of 1.2*10^9 l_sun. the starformation rate implied by our measurements is 0.22 m_sun/yr. we demonstratethat the cold dust is more extended than the warm dust in ngc 55--theminor-axis scale heights are 0.32, 0.43, and 0.49 kpc at 24, 70 and 160 micron,respectively. the dust temperature map shows a range of temperatures that arewell-correlated with the 24 micron surface brightness, from 20 k inlow-surface-brightness regions to 26 k in high-surface-brightness regions.

astro-ph;0408248	the anatomy of star formation in ngc 300	the spitzer space telescope was used to study the mid-infrared tofar-infrared properties of ngc 300, and to compare dust emission to halpha toelucidate the heating of the ism and the star formation cycle at scales &lt; 100pc. the new data allow us to discern clear differences in the spatialdistribution of 8 micron dust emission with respect to 24 micron dust and tohii regions traced by the halpha light. the 8 micron emission highlights therims of hii regions, and the 24 micron emission is more strongly peaked in starforming regions than at 8 microns. we confirm the existence and approximateamplitude of interstellar dust emission at 4.5 microns, detected statisticallyin infrared space observatory (iso) data, and conclude it arises in starforming regions. when averaging over regions larger than ~ 1 kpc, the ratio ofhalpha to aromatic feature emission in ngc 300 is consistent with the valuesobserved in disks of spiral galaxies. the mid-to-far-infrared spectral energydistribution of dust emission is generally consistent with pre-spitzer models.

astro-ph;0408435	nuclear properties of a sample of nearby spirals from stis imaging	we present surface photometry for the central regions of a sample of 48spiral galaxies (mostly unbarred and barred of types sbc or sc) observed withthe space telescope imaging spectrograph on board the hubble space telescope.surface brightness profiles were derived and modeled with a nuker law. we alsoanalyzed archival wide field planetary camera~2 images with a larger field ofview, available for 18 galaxies in our sample. we modeled the extracted bulgesurface brightness profiles with an exponential, a de vaucouleurs or a sersicprofile. in agreement with previous studies, we find that bulges of sbcgalaxies fall into two categories: bulges well described by an exponentialprofile and those well described by an de vaucouleurs profile. only one galaxyrequires the use of a more general sersic profile to properly describe thebulge. nuclear photometrically distinct components are found in ~55% of thegalaxies. for those that we classify as star clusters based on their resolvedextent we find absolute magnitudes that are brighter on average than thosepreviously identified in spiral galaxies. this might be due to a bias in oursample toward star forming galaxies, combined with a trend for star forminggalaxies to host brighter central clusters.

astro-ph;0502079	reduction algorithms for the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer	we describe the data reduction algorithms for the multiband imagingphotometer for spitzer (mips) instrument. these algorithms were based onextensive preflight testing and modeling of the si:as (24 micron) and ge:ga (70and 160 micron) arrays in mips and have been refined based on initial flightdata. the behaviors we describe are typical of state-of-the-art infrared focalplanes operated in the low backgrounds of space. the ge arrays are bulkphotoconductors and therefore show a variety of artifacts that must be removedto calibrate the data. the si array, while better behaved than the ge arrays,does show a handful of artifacts that also must be removed to calibrate thedata. the data reduction to remove these effects is divided into three parts.the first part converts the non-destructively read data ramps into slopes whileremoving artifacts with time constants of the order of the exposure time. thesecond part calibrates the slope measurements while removing artifacts withtime constants longer than the exposure time. the third part uses theredundancy inherit in the mips observing modes to improve the artifact removaliteratively. for each of these steps, we illustrate the relevant laboratoryexperiments or theoretical arguments along with the mathematical approachestaken to calibrate the data. finally, we describe how these preflightalgorithms have performed on actual flight data.

astro-ph;0503693	nuclear properties of nearby spiral galaxies from hubble space telescope  nicmos imaging and stis spectroscopy	we investigate the central regions of 23 spiral galaxies using archivalnicmos imaging and stis spectroscopy. the sample is taken from our program todetermine the masses of central massive black holes (mbh) in 54 nearby spiralgalaxies. stars are likely to contribute significantly to any dynamical centralmass concentration that we find in our mbh program and this paper is part of aseries to investigate the nuclear properties of these galaxies. we use thenuker law to fit surface brightness profiles, derived from the nicmos images,to look for nuclear star clusters and find possible extended sources in 3 ofthe 23 galaxies studied (13 per cent). the fact that this fraction is lowerthan that inferred from optical hubble space telescope studies is probably dueto the greater spatial resolution of those studies. using r-h and j-h colorsand equivalent widths of h-alpha emission (from the stis spectra) weinvestigate the nature of the stellar population with evolutionary models.under the assumption of hot stars ionizing the gas, as opposed to a weak agn,we find that there are young stellar populations (~10-20 myr) however thesedata do not allow us to determine what percentage of the total nuclear stellarpopulation they form. also, in an attempt to find any unknown agn we use [n ii]and [s ii] line flux ratios (relative to h-alpha) and find tentative evidencefor weak agn in ngc 1300 and ngc 4536.

astro-ph;0504622	far infrared observations of radio quasars and fr ii radio galaxies	we report mips photometry of 20 radio-loud quasars and galaxies at 24 and 70um (and of five at 160 um). we combine this sample with additional sourcesdetected in the far infrared by iras and iso for a total of 47 objects,including 23 steep spectrum type i agns: radio-loud quasars and broad lineradio galaxies; and 24 type ii agns: narrow line and weak line fr ii radiogalaxies. of this sample, the far infrared emission of all but 3c 380 appearsto be dominated by emission by dust heated by the agn and by star formation.the agn appears to contribute more than 50% of the far infrared luminosity inmost of sources. it is also expected that the material around the nucleus isoptically thin in the far infrared. thus, the measurements at these wavelengthscan be used to test the orientation-dependent unification model. as predictedby the model, the behavior of the sources is consistent with the presence of anobscuring circumnuclear torus; in fact, we find it may still have significantoptical depth at 24 um.in addition, as expected for the radio-loud quasars,there is a significant correlation between the low frequency radio (178 mhz)and the 70 um emission, two presumably isotropic indicators of nuclearactivity. this result is consistent with the simple unified scheme. however,there is a population of radio galaxies that are underluminous at 70 umcompared with the radio-loud quasars and hence are a challenge to the simpleunified model.

astro-ph;0506462	infrared luminosity functions from the chandra deep field south : the  spitzer view on the history of dusty star formation at 0&lt;z&lt;1	we analyze a sample of ~2600 mips/spitzer 24mic sources brighter than ~80mujyand located in the chandra deep field south to characterize the evolution ofthe comoving infrared (ir) energy density of the universe up to z~1. usingpublished ancillary optical data we first obtain a nearly complete redshiftdetermination for the 24mic objects associated with r&lt;24 counterparts at z&lt;1.we find that the 24mic population at 0.5&lt;z&lt;1 is dominated by ``luminousinfrared galaxies'' (i.e., 10^11 l_sol &lt; l_ir &lt; 10^12 l_sol), the counterpartsof which appear to be also luminous at optical wavelengths and tend to be moremassive than the majority of optically-selected galaxies. we finally derive15mic and total ir luminosity functions (lfs) up to z~1. in agreement with theprevious results from iso and scuba and as expected from the mips source numbercounts, we find very strong evolution of the contribution of the ir-selectedpopulation with lookback time. pure evolution in density is firmly excluded bythe data, but we find considerable degeneracy between strict evolution inluminosity and a combination of increases in both density and luminosity (l*_irprop. to (1+z)^{3.2_{-0.2}^{+0.7}}, phi*_ir prop. to(1+z)^{0.7_{-0.6}^{+0.2}}). our results imply that the comoving ir energydensity of the universe evolves as (1+z)^(3.9+/-0.4) up to z~1 and thatgalaxies luminous in the infrared (i.e., l_ir &gt; 10^11 l_ir) are responsible for70+/-15% of this energy density at z~1. taking into account the contribution ofthe uv luminosity evolving as (1+z)^~2.5, we infer that these ir-luminoussources dominate the star-forming activity beyond z~0.7. the uncertaintiesaffecting these conclusions are largely dominated by the errors in thek-corrections used to convert 24mic fluxes into luminosities.

astro-ph;0511507	infrared power-law galaxies in the chandra deep field south: agn and  ulirgs	we investigate the nature of a sample of 92 spitzer/mips 24 micron selectedgalaxies in the cdfs, showing power law-like emission in the spitzer/irac 3.6-8micron bands. the main goal is to determine whether the galaxies not detectedin x-rays (47% of the sample) are part of the hypothetical population ofobscured agn not detected even in deep x-ray surveys. the majority of the irpower-law galaxies are ulirgs at z&gt;1, and those with lirg-like ir luminositiesare usually detected in x-rays. the optical to ir spectral energy distributions(seds) of the x-ray detected galaxies are almost equally divided between ablagn sed class (similar to an optically selected qso) and a nlagn sed (similarto the blagn sed but with an obscured uv/optical continuum). a small fractionof seds resemble warm ulirg galaxies (e.g., mrk231). most galaxies not detectedin x-rays have seds in the nlagn+ulirg class as they tend to be opticallyfainter, and possibly more obscured. moreover, the ir power-law galaxies haveseds significantly different from those of high-z (z_sp&gt;1) ir (24 micron)selected and optically bright (vvds i_ab&lt;=24) star-forming galaxies whose sedsshow a very prominent stellar bump at 1.6 micron. the galaxies detected inx-rays have 2-8 kev rest-frame luminosities typical of agn. the galaxies notdetected in x-rays have global x-ray to mid-ir sed properties that make themgood candidates to contain ir bright x-ray absorbed agn. if all these sourcesare actually obscured agn, we would observe a ratio of obscured to unobscured24 micron detected agn of 2:1, whereas models predict a ratio of up to 3:1.additional studies using spitzer to detect x-ray-quiet agn are likely to findmore such obscured sources.

astro-ph;0512618	mid-infrared properties of x-ray sources in the extended groth strip	mid-infrared observations of active galactic nuclei (agn) are important forunderstanding of the physical conditions around the central accretion engines.chandra and xmm-newton x-ray observations of a 300 arcmin^2 region in theextended groth strip are used to select a sample of~150 agn. the spitzerinstruments irac and mips detect 68-80% of these sources, which show a widerange of mid-infrared properties. about 40% of the sources have red power-lawspectral energy distributions (f_nu ~ nu^alpha, alpha&lt;0) in the 3.6-8 um iracbands. in these sources the central engine dominates the emission at both x-rayand ir wavelengths. another 40% of the sources have blue mid-ir spectral energydistributions (alpha&gt;0) with their infrared emission dominated by the hostgalaxy; the remaining 20% are not well-fit by a power law. published irac colorcriteria for agn select most of the red sources, but only some of the bluesources. as with all other known methods, selecting agn with mid-ir colors willnot produce a sample that is simultaneously complete and reliable. the irac sedtype does not directly correspond to x-ray spectral type (hard/soft). themid-ir properties of x-ray-detected lyman-break, radio, submillimeter, andoptically-faint sources vary widely and, for the most part, are not distinctfrom those of the general x-ray/infrared source population. x-ray sources emit6-11% of the integrated mid--ir light, making them significant contributors tothe cosmic infrared background.

astro-ph;0603313	why x-ray--selected agn appear optically dull	we investigate why half of x-ray--selected active galactic nuclei (agn) indeep surveys lack signs of accretion in their optical spectra. the majority ofthese ``optically--dull'' agn are no more than 6 times fainter than their hostgalaxies in rest-frame r-band; as such, agn lines are unlikely to beoverwhelmed by stellar continuum in at least half the sample. we find thatoptically--dull agn have the mid--infrared emission and l(x)/l(ir) ratioscharacteristic of local seyferts, suggesting that the cause of optical dullnessis not missing uv--optical continua. we compare the morphologies of 22optically--dull and 9 optically--active agn at 0.5&lt;z&lt;0.8, and find thatoptically--dull agn show a wide range of axis ratio, but optically--active agnhave only very round axis ratios. we conclude that hard x-rays select agn inhost galaxies with a wide range of inclination angle, but only those agn in themost face-on or spheroidal host galaxies show optical emission lines. thus,extranuclear dust in the host galaxy plays an important role in hiding theemission lines of optically--dull agn.

astro-ph;0606186	near-infrared and star-forming properties of local luminous infrared  galaxies	we use hst nicmos continuum and pa-alpha observations to study thenear-infrared and star-formation properties of a representative sample of 30local (d ~ 35-75mpc) luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs, infrared 8-1000umluminosities of l_ir=11-11.9[lsun]). the data provide spatial resolutions of25-50pc and cover the central ~3.3-7.1kpc regions of these galaxies. about halfof the lirgs show compact (~1-2kpc) pa-alpha emission with a high surfacebrightness in the form of nuclear emission, rings, and mini-spirals. the restof the sample show pa-alpha emission along the disk and the spiral armsextending over scales of 3-7kpc and larger. about half of the sample containshii regions with h-alpha luminosities significantly higher than those observedin normal galaxies. there is a linear empirical relationship between the mid-ir24um and hydrogen recombination (extinction-corrected pa-alpha) luminosity forthese lirgs, and the hii regions in the central part of m51. this relationholds over more than four decades in luminosity suggesting that the mid-iremission is a good tracer of the star formation rate (sfr). analogous to thewidely used relation between the sfr and total ir luminosity of kennicutt(1998), we derive an empirical calibration of the sfr in terms of themonochromatic 24um luminosity that can be used for luminous, dusty galaxies.

astro-ph;0610394	high spatial resolution t-recs mid-infrared imaging of luminous infrared  galaxies	we present diffraction-limited (fwhm ~ 0.3arcsec) gemini/t-recs mid-infrared(mir: n-band or narrow-band at 8.7micron) imaging of four luminous infraredgalaxies (lirgs) drawn from a representative local sample. the mir emission inthe central few kpc is strikingly similar to that traced by pa-alpha, andgenerally consists of bright nuclear emission and several compact circumnuclearand/or extranuclear hii regions. the central mir emission is dominated by thesepowerful hii regions, consistent with the majority of agn in this local sampleof lirgs contributing a minor part of the mir emission. the luminouscircumnuclear hii regions detected in lirgs follow the extrapolation of the8micron vs. pa-alpha relation found for m51 hii knots. the integrated central3-7kpc of galaxies, however, present elevated 8micron/pa-alpha ratios withrespect to individual hii regions, similar to the integrated values forstar-forming galaxies. our results show that the diffuse 8micron emission, notdirectly related to the ionizing stellar population, can be as luminous as thatfrom the resolved hii regions. therefore, calibrations of the star formationrate for distant galaxies should be based on the integrated 8micron emission ofnearby galaxies, not that of the hii regions alone.

astro-ph;0612331	detecting obscured agn in the distant universe with spitzer	we present the results of a spitzer search for obscured agn in the chandradeep field-north, using both radio-excess and mid-infrared power-law selection.agn selected via the former technique tend to lie at z ~ 1, have seds dominatedby the 1.6 micron stellar bump, and have seyfert-like x-ray luminosities (whendetected in the x-ray). in contrast, the irac (3.6-8.0 micron) power-lawselected agn lie at higher redshifts of z ~ 2, and comprise a significantfraction of the most x-ray luminous agn in the cdf-n. while there is almost nooverlap in the agn samples selected via these two methods, their x-raydetection fractions are very similar. only 40% and 55% of the radio-excess andpower-law samples are detected in the 2 ms x-ray catalog, respectively. themajority of the agn selected via both methods are consistent with beingobscured (n_h &gt; 10^(22) cm^-2), but not compton-thick (n_h &gt; 10^(24) cm^-2),although compton-thick candidates exist in both samples. we place an upperlimit of &lt;82% (or &lt; 4:1) on the obscured fraction of the power-law sample,consistent with predictions from the cosmic x-ray background. the sourcesselected via the power-law criteria comprise a subset of agn selected via otherirac color-color cuts. while smaller in number than the color-selected samplesin the deep fields, the power-law sample suffers from less contamination bystar-forming galaxies.

astro-ph;0701698	spitzer power-law agn candidates in the chandra deep field-north	we define a sample of 62 galaxies in the chandra deep field-north whosespitzer irac seds exhibit the characteristic power-law emission expected ofluminous agn. we study the multiwavelength properties of this sample, andcompare the agn selected in this way to those selected via other spitzercolor-color criteria. only 55% of the power-law galaxies are detected in thex-ray catalog at exposures of &gt;0.5 ms, although a search for faint emissionresults in the detection of 85% of the power-law galaxies at the &gt; 2.5 sigmadetection level. most of the remaining galaxies are likely to host agn that areheavily obscured in the x-ray. because the power-law selection requires the agnto be energetically dominant in the near- and mid-infrared, the power-lawgalaxies comprise a significant fraction of the spitzer-detected agn populationat high luminosities and redshifts. the high 24 micron detection fraction alsopoints to a luminous population. the power-law galaxies comprise a subset ofcolor-selected agn candidates. a comparison with various mid-infrared colorselection criteria demonstrates that while the color-selected samples contain alarger fraction of the x-ray luminous agn, there is evidence that theseselection techniques also suffer from a higher degree of contamination bystar-forming galaxies in the deepest exposures. considering only thosepower-law galaxies detected in the x-ray catalog, we derive an obscuredfraction of 68% (2:1). including all of the power-law galaxies suggests anobscured fraction of &lt; 81% (4:1).

astro-ph;0703481	optical detection of the radio supernova sn 2000ft in the circumnuclear  region of the luminous infrared galaxy ngc 7469	sn 2000ft is detected in two independent planetary camera images (f547w andf814w) taken may 13, 2000, about two months before the predicted date of theexplosion (july 19, 2000), based on the analysis of its radio light evolutionby alberdi and collaborators. the apparent optical magnitudes and red color ofsn 2000ft indicate that it is observed through an extinction of at least a$_v$=3.0 magnitudes. the extinction corrected lower limit to the absolute visualmagnitude (m$_v$ $\leq -$ 18.0), identifies sn 2000ft as a luminous supernovain the optical, as other luminous radio supernovae before. sn 2000ft explodedin a region located at only 0.1 arcsec (i.e. 34 +/- 3 pc) west of a faintcluster (c24). no parent cluster is identified within the detection limits ofthe hst short exposures. the unambiguous detection of sn 2000ft in the visualshows that multi-epoch sub-arcsecond (fwhm less than 0.1 arcsec) opticalimaging is also a valid tool that should be explored further to detectsupernovae in the dusty (circum)nuclear regions of (u)lirgs.

astro-ph;9907011	nicmos imaging of molecular hydrogen emission in seyfert galaxies	we present nicmos imaging of broad band and molecular hydrogen emission inseyfert galaxies. in 6 of 10 seyferts we detect resolved or extended emissionin the 1-0 s(1) 2.121 or 1-0 s(3) 1.9570 micron molecular hydrogen lines. wedid not detect emission in the most distant galaxy or in the 2 seyfert 1galaxies in our sample because of the luminosity of the nuclear point sources.in ngc 5643, ngc 2110 and mkn 1066, molecular hydrogen emission is detected inthe extended narrow line region on scales of a few hundred pc from the nucleus.emission is coincident with [oiii] and h alpha+[nii] line emission. thisemission is also near dust lanes observed in the visible to near-infrared colormaps suggesting that a multiphase medium exists near the ionization cones andthat the morphology of the line emission is dependent on the density of theambient media. the high 1-0 s(1) or s(3) h2 to h alpha flux ratio suggests thatshock excitation of molecular hydrogen (rather than uv fluorescence) is thedominant excitation process in these extended features. in ngc 2992 and ngc3227 the molecular hydrogen emission is from 800 and 100 pc diameter `disks'(respectively) which are not directly associated with [oiii] emission and arenear high levels of extinction (av &gt; 10). in ngc 4945 the molecular hydrogenemission appears to be from the edge of a 100 pc superbubble. in these 3galaxies the molecular gas could be excited by processes associated with localstar formation. we confirm previous spectroscopic studies finding that nosingle mechanism is likely to be responsible for the molecular hydrogenexcitation in seyfert galaxies.

astro-ph;9907147	searching for x-ray luminous starburst galaxies	the existence or otherwise of x-ray luminous star-forming galaxies has beenan open question since the era of the einstein satellite. various authors haveclaimed the discovery of x-ray luminous star-forming galaxies but in many casesmore careful spectroscopic studies of these objects have shown that many ofthem are in fact obscured agn.  in order to investigate the possibility that such a class of galaxies doexist, we have carried out a cross-correlation between optical and iras samplesof galaxies which are known to contain large numbers of star-forming galaxiesand catalogs of sources detected in x-ray surveys. the selection criteria forthe optical follow-up observations was based on their x-ray and infrared (iras)colors and their x-ray luminosities. we note that this sample is by no meanscomplete or uniformly selected and hence cannot be used for statisticalstudies, but nevertheless confirmation of the existence of such a class ofobjects would be a important step, and would require us to understand thephysical process responsible for such powerful x-ray emission.  we have initiated an optical spectroscopic survey in order to obtain accuratespectroscopic classifications for all the objects which are claimed to bestarburst galaxies. here we present preliminary results from this survey. wehave discovered a number of starburst galaxies with x-ray luminosities above  ~10^(41)erg s^(-1) (for ho=50km s^(-1)mpc^(-1)).  we investigate possible origins for the x-ray emission in individual cases.

astro-ph;9911534	extreme star formation in the interacting galaxy arp299 (ic694 +  ngc3690)	we present a comprehensive study of the star-formation properties of theinfrared luminous galaxy arp299 (ic694 + ngc3690). the observations includehst/nicmos imaging and mmt optical and near-infrared spectroscopy together withhst archival data. we correct the galaxy parameters for extinction and use theresults as boundary conditions for evolutionary starburst models.  these models and other arguments show that arp 299 has been going through abroad variety of interaction-induced star formation for the last ~15 myr. inaddition to nuclear starbursts in the two colliding galaxies, there are nearbyluminous star forming regions that may be the result of molecular cloudsbreaking up and starting to form massive stars as they approach the nuclearpotential. two regions near the interaction region have very recently formedmassive stars (~4 myr old). one of these regions in particular appears to haveundergone a starburst of very short duration, in contrast with the 5-10 myrdurations that are typical of nuclear events. these regions will probably formgravitationally bound new dwarf galaxies, although they are close enough to themore massive original galaxies that they will probably eventually be subsumedinto them. in addition, we find 19 hii regions at least as energetic as 30doradus, and 21 older star clusters that likely are the products of similar hiiregions formed in the past. this population of supergiant hii regions isunprecedented in normal galaxies and emphasizes that the effects of theinteraction propagate through the entire pair of galaxies.

astro-ph;9912452	the multitude of unresolved continuum sources at 1.6 microns in hubble  space telescope images of seyfert galaxies	we examine 112 seyfert galaxies observed by the hubble space telescope (hst)at 1.6 microns. we find that ~50% of the seyfert 2.0 galaxies which are part ofthe revised shapeley-ames (rsa) catalog or the cfa redshift sample containunresolved continuum sources at 1.6 microns. all but a couple of the seyfert1.0-1.9 galaxies display unresolved continuum sources. the unresolved sourceshave fluxes of order a mjy, near-infrared luminosities of order 10^41 erg/s andabsolute magnitudes m_h ~-16. comparison non-seyfert galaxies from the rsacatalog display significantly fewer (~20%), somewhat lower luminosity nuclearsources, which could be due to compact star clusters. we find that theluminosities of the unresolved seyfert 1.0-1.9 sources at 1.6 microns arecorrelated with [oiii] 5007a and hard x-ray luminosities, implying that thesesources are non-stellar. assuming a spectral energy distribution similar tothat of a seyfert 2 galaxy, we estimate that a few percent of local spiralgalaxies contain black holes emitting as seyferts at a moderate fraction, 10^-1to 10^-4, of their eddington luminosities. with increasing seyfert type thefraction of unresolved sources detected at 1.6 microns and the ratio of 1.6microns to [oiii] fluxes tend to decrease. these trends are consistent with theunification model for seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies.

0810.4150	determining star formation rates for infrared galaxies	we show that measures of star formation rates (sfrs) for infrared galaxiesusing either single-band 24 um or extinction-corrected paschen-alphaluminosities are consistent in the total infrared luminosity = l(tir) ~ 10^10l_sun range. mips 24 micron photometry can yield star formation ratesaccurately from this luminosity upward: sfr(m_sun/yr) = 7.8 x 10^-10 l(24 um,l_sun) from l(tir) = 5 x 10^9 l_sun to 10^11 l_sun, and sfr = 7.8 x 10^-10 l(24um, l_sun) x (7.76 x 10^-11 l(24))^0.048 for higher l(tir). for galaxies withl(tir) &gt;= 10^10 l_sun, these new expressions should provide sfrs to within 0.2dex. for l(tir) &gt;= 10^11 l_sun, we find that the sfr of infrared galaxies issignificantly underestimated using extinction-corrected pa-alpha (andpresumably using any other optical or near infrared recombination lines). as apart of this work, we constructed spectral energy distribution (sed) templatesfor eleven luminous and ultraluminous purely star forming infrared galaxies(lirgs and ulirgs) and over the spectral range 0.4 microns to 30 cm. we usethese templates and the sings data to construct average templates from 5microns to 30 cm for infrared galaxies with l(tir) = 5 x 10^9 to 10^13 l_sun.all of these templates are made available on line.
