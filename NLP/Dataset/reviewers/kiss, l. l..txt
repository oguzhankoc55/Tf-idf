0912.3215	the radius and effective temperature of the binary ap star beta crb from  chara/fluor and vlt/naco observations	the prospects for using asteroseismology of rapidly oscillating ap (roap)stars are hampered by the large uncertainty in fundamental stellar parameters.results in the literature for the effective temperature (teff) often span arange of 1000 k. our goal is to reduce systematic errors and improve the teffcalibration of ap stars based on new interferometric measurements. we obtainedlong-baseline interferometric observations of beta crb using the chara/fluorinstrument. to disentangle the flux contributions of the two components of thisbinary star, we obtained vlt/naco adaptive optics images. we determined limbdarkened angular diameters of 0.699+-0.017 mas for beta crb a (frominterferometry) and 0.415+-0.017 mas for beta crb b (from surface brightness-color relations), corresponding to radii of 2.63+-0.09 rsun (3.4 percentuncertainty) and 1.56+-0.07 rsun (4.5 percent). the combined bolometric flux ofthe a and b components was determined from satellite uv data, spectrophotometryin the visible and broadband data in the infrared. the flux from the bcomponent constitutes 16+-4 percent of the total flux and was determined byfitting an atlas9 model atmosphere to the broad-band naco j and k magnitudes.combining the flux of the a component with its measured angular diameter, wedetermine the effective temperature teff(a) = 7980+-180 k (2.3 percent). ournew interferometric and imaging data enable a nearly model-independentdetermination of the effective temperature of beta crb a. including our recentstudy of alpha cir, we now have direct teff measurements of two of thebrightest roap stars, providing a strong benchmark for an improved calibrationof the teff scale for ap stars. this will support the use of potentially strongconstraints imposed by asteroseismic studies of roap stars.

1001.0229	solar-like oscillations in low-luminosity red giants: first results from  kepler	we have measured solar-like oscillations in red giants using time-seriesphotometry from the first 34 days of science operations of the kepler mission.the light curves, obtained with 30-minute sampling, reveal clear oscillationsin a large sample of g and k giants, extending in luminosity from the red clumpdown to the bottom of the giant branch. we confirm a strong correlation betweenthe large separation of the oscillations (delta nu) and the frequency ofmaximum power (nu_max). we focus on a sample of 50 low-luminosity stars (nu_max&gt; 100 muhz, l &lt;~ 30 l_sun) having high signal-to-noise ratios and showing theunambiguous signature of solar-like oscillations. these are h-shell-burningstars, whose oscillations should be valuable for testing models of stellarevolution and for constraining the star-formation rate in the local disk. weuse a new technique to compare stars on a single echelle diagram by scalingtheir frequencies and find well-defined ridges corresponding to radial andnon-radial oscillations, including clear evidence for modes with angular degreel=3. measuring the small separation between l=0 and l=2 allows us to plot theso-called c-d diagram of delta nu_02 versus delta nu. the small separationdelta nu_01 of l=1 from the midpoint of adjacent l=0 modes is negative,contrary to the sun and solar-type stars. the ridge for l=1 is notablybroadened, which we attribute to mixed modes, confirming theoreticalpredictions for low-luminosity giants. overall, the results demonstrate thetremendous potential of kepler data for asteroseismology of red giants.

1002.4402	looking into the heart of a beast: the black hole binary ls 5039	ls 5039 is a relatively close microquasar consisting of a late o-type starand a compact object (very possibly a black hole) on a highly eccentric orbitwith a period of 3.9 days. the high x-ray, gamma-ray and radio luminosityindicate light-matter interaction, which arise from the stellar wind of theprimary star accreting toward the black hole. former examinations suggest thatls 5039 could be a prototype of wind-fed high mass x-ray binaries (wxbs) withdiskless main sequence o primaries. now there is a great chance to betterunderstand the configuration and the physical processes in the exotic system.in july 2009 ls 5039 was followed by the canadian most space telescope to getultraprecise photometric data in a month-long semi-continuous time series.parallel to this, we have taken simultaneous high-resolution optical spectrausing the 2.3m anu telescope of the siding spring observatory, supplementedwith further data obtained in early august 2009 with the same instrument. herewe present the first results from the new echelle spectra, which represent thebest optical spectroscopy ever obtained for this intriguing system. wedetermined fundamental orbital and physical parameters of ls 5039 and examinedthe configuration and the circumstellar environment of the system via radialvelocity measurements and detailed line-profile analysis of h-balmer, he i andhe ii lines.

1003.0052	a multi-site campaign to measure solar-like oscillations in procyon. ii.  mode frequencies	we have analyzed data from a multi-site campaign to observe oscillations inthe f5 star procyon. the data consist of high-precision velocities that weobtained over more than three weeks with eleven telescopes. a new method foradjusting the data weights allows us to suppress the sidelobes in the powerspectrum. stacking the power spectrum in a so-called echelle diagram revealstwo clear ridges that we identify with even and odd values of the angulardegree (l=0 and 2, and l=1 and 3, respectively). we interpret a strong, narrowpeak at 446 muhz that lies close to the l=1 ridge as a mode with mixedcharacter. we show that the frequencies of the ridge centroids and theirseparations are useful diagnostics for asteroseismology. in particular,variations in the large separation appear to indicate a glitch in thesound-speed profile at an acoustic depth of about 1000 s. we list frequenciesfor 55 modes extracted from the data spanning 20 radial orders, a rangecomparable to the best solar data, which will provide valuable constraints fortheoretical models. a preliminary comparison with published models shows thatthe offset between observed and calculated frequencies for the radial modes isvery different for procyon than for the sun and other cool stars. we find themean lifetime of the modes in procyon to be 1.29 +0.55/-0.49 days, which issignificantly shorter than the 2-4 days seen in the sun.

1004.1143	methods for exomoon characterisation: combining transit photometry and  the rossiter-mclaughlin effect	it has been suggested that moons around transiting exoplanets may causeobservable signal in transit photometry or in the rossiter-mclaughlin (rm)effect. in this paper a detailed analysis of parameter reconstruction from therm effect is presented for various planet-moon configurations, described with20 parameters. we also demonstrate the benefits of combining photometry withthe rm effect. we simulated 2.7x10^9 configurations of a generic transitingsystem to map the confidence region of the parameters of the moon, find thecorrelated parameters and determine the validity of reconstructions. the mainconclusion is that the strictest constraints from the rm effect are expectedfor the radius of the moon. in some cases there is also meaningful informationon its orbital period. when the transit time of the moon is exactly known, forexample, from transit photometry, the angle parameters of the moon's orbit willalso be constrained from the rm effect. from transit light curves the mass canbe determined, and combining this result with the radius from the rm effect,the experimental determination of the density of the moon is also possible.

1011.5908	kepler photometry of the prototypical blazhko star rr lyr: an old friend  seen in a new light	we present our analysis of the long cadence kepler data for the well-studiedblazhko star rr lyr, gathered during the first two quarters of the satellite'sobservations and covering a total of 127d. besides being of great importancefor our understanding of rr lyrae stars in general, these rr lyr data can beregarded as a case study for observations of bright stars with kepler. keplercan perform high-precision photometry on targets like rr lyr, as the saturatedflux is conserved to a very high degree. the kepler data on rr lyr arerevolutionary in several respects. even with long-cadence sampling (onemeasurement per 29.4 min), the unprecedented precision (&lt; mmag) of the keplerphotometry allows the study of the star's extreme light curve variations indetail. the multiplet structures at the main frequency and its harmonics,typical for blazhko stars, are clearly detected up to the quintuplets. for thefirst time, photometric data of rr lyr reveal the presence of half-integerfrequencies, linked to a period doubling effect. this phenomenon may beconnected to the still unexplained blazhko modulation. moreover, with threeobserved blazhko cycles at our disposal, we observe that there is no exactrepetition in the light curve changes from one modulation cycle to the next forrr lyr. this may be due to additional periodicities in the star, or totransient or quasi-periodic changes.

1012.1560	practical suggestions on detecting exomoons in exoplanet transit light  curves	the number of known transiting exoplanets is rapidly increasing, which hasrecently inspired significant interest as to whether they can host a detectablemoon. although there has been no such example where the presence of a satellitewas proven, several methods have already been investigated for such a detectionin the future. all these methods utilize post-processing of the measured lightcurves, and the presence of the moon is decided by the distribution of a timingparameter. here we propose a method for the detection of the moon directly inthe raw transit light curves. when the moon is in transit, it puts its ownfingerprint on the intensity variation. in realistic cases, this distortion istoo little to be detected in the individual light curves, and must beamplified. averaging the folded light curve of several transits helps decreasethe scatter, but it is not the best approach because it also reduces thesignal. the relative position of the moon varies from transit to transit, themoon's wing will appear in different positions on different sides of theplanet's transit. here we show that a careful analysis of the scatter curve ofthe folded light curves enhances the chance of detecting the exomoons directly.

1012.2035	dust formation in the ejecta of the type ii-p supernova 2004dj	core-collapse supernovae (cc sne), especially type ii-plateau ones, arethought to be important contributors to cosmic dust production. sn 2004dj, oneof the closest and brightest sn since 1987a, offered a good opportunity toexamine dust formation processes. to find signs of newly formed dust, weanalyze all available mid-infrared (mir) archival data from the spitzer spacetelescope. we re-reduce and analyze data from irac, mips and irs instrumentsobtained between +98 and +1381 days after explosion, generating light curvesand spectra for each epoch. observed spectral energy distributions are fittedwith both analytic and numerical models, using the radiative-transfer codemocassin for the latter ones. we also use imaging polarimetric data obtained at+425 days by the hubble space telescope. we present convincing evidence of dustformation in the ejecta of sn 2004dj from mir light curves and spectra.significant mir excess flux is detected in all bands between 3.6 and 24 um. inthe optical, a ~0.8% polarization is also detected at a 2-sigma level, whichexceeds the interstellar polarization in that direction. our analysis showsthat the freshly-formed dust around sn 2004dj can be modeled assuming a nearlyspherical shell containing amorphous carbon grains, cooling from ~700 k to ~400k between +267 and +1246 days. persistent excess flux has been found above 10um, which is explained by a cold (~115 k) dust component. if this cold dust isof circumstellar origin, it is likely to be condensed in a cool, dense shellbetween the forward and reverse shocks. pre-existing circumstellar dust is lesslikely, but cannot be ruled out. an upper limit of ~8x10^{-4} m_sun was derivedfor the dust mass, which is similar to previously published values for otherdust-producing sne.

1101.1820	spectral signatures of disk eccentricity in young binary systems: i.  circumprimary case	star formation occurs via fragmentation of molecular clouds, which means thatthe majority of stars born are a members of binaries. there is growing evidencethat planets might form in circumprimary disks of medium-separation binaries.the tidal forces caused by the secondary generally act to distort theoriginally circular disk to an eccentric one. to infer the disk eccentricityfrom high-res nir spectroscopy, we calculate the fundamental band emissionlines of the co molecule emerging from the atmosphere of the disk. we modelcircumprimary disk evolution under the gravitational perturbation of theorbiting secondary using a 2d grid-based hydrodynamical code, assumingalpha-type viscosity. the hydrodynamical results are combined with our spectralcode based on the double-layer disk model to calculate the co molecular lineprofiles. we find that the orbital velocity distribution of the gas parcelsdiffers significantly from the circular keplerian fashion, thus the lineprofiles are asymmetric in shape. the magnitude of asymmetry is insensitive tothe binary mass ratio, the magnitude of viscosity, and the disk mass. incontrast, the disk eccentricity, thus the level of the line profile asymmetry,is influenced significantly by the binary eccentricity and the disk geometricalthickness. we demonstrate that the disk eccentricity profile in theplanet-forming region can be determined by fitting the high-resolution co lineprofile asymmetry using a simple 2d spectral model that accounts for thevelocity distortions caused by the disk eccentricity. thus, with our novelapproach the disk eccentricity can be inferred with high-resolution near-irspectroscopy prior to the era of high angular resolution optical or radiodirect-imaging. by determining the disk eccentricity in medium-separation youngbinaries, we might be able to constrain the planet formation theories.

1106.6120	fourier analysis of non-blazhko ab-type rr lyrae stars observed with the  kepler space telescope	nineteen of the ~40 rr lyr stars in the kepler field have been identified ascandidate non-blazhko (or unmodulated) stars. in this paper we present theresults of fourier decomposition of the time-series photometry of these starsacquired during the first 417 days of operation (q0-q5) of the keplertelescope. fourier parameters based on ~18400 long-cadence observations perstar (and ~150000 short-cadence observations for fn lyr and for aw dra) arederived. none of the stars shows the recently discovered `period-doubling'effect seen in blazhko variables; however, kic 7021124 has been found topulsate simultaneously in the fundamental and second overtone modes with aperiod ratio p2/p0 ~ 0.59305 and is similar to the double-mode star v350 lyr.period change rates are derived from o-c diagrams spanning, in some cases, over100 years; these are compared with high-precision periods derived from thekepler data alone. extant fourier correlations by kovacs, jurcsik et al. (withminor transformations from the v to the kp passband) have been used to deriveunderlying physical characteristics for all the stars. this procedure seems tobe validated through comparisons of the kepler variables with galactic and lmcrr lyr stars. the most metal-poor star in the sample is nr lyr, with[fe/h]=-2.3 dex; and the four most metal-rich stars have [fe/h] ranging from-0.6 to +0.1 dex. pulsational luminosities and masses are found to besystematically smaller than l and mass values derived from stellar evolutionmodels, and are favoured over the evolutionary values when periods are computedwith the warsaw linear hydrodynamics code. finally, the fourier parameters arecompared with theoretical values derived using the warsaw non-linear convectivepulsation code.

1107.0335	the kepler characterization of the variability among a- and f-type  stars. i. general overview	the kepler spacecraft is providing time series of photometric data withmicromagnitude precision for hundreds of a-f type stars. we present a firstgeneral characterization of the pulsational behaviour of a-f type stars asobserved in the kepler light curves of a sample of 750 candidate a-f typestars. we propose three main groups to describe the observed variety inpulsating a-f type stars: gamma dor, delta sct, and hybrid stars. we assign 63%of our sample to one of the three groups, and identify the remaining part asrotationally modulated/active stars, binaries, stars of different spectraltype, or stars that show no clear periodic variability. 23% of the stars (171stars) are hybrid stars, which is a much larger fraction than what has beenobserved before. we characterize for the first time a large number of a-f typestars (475 stars) in terms of number of detected frequencies, frequency range,and typical pulsation amplitudes. the majority of hybrid stars show frequencieswith all kinds of periodicities within the gamma dor and delta sct range, alsobetween 5 and 10 c/d, which is a challenge for the current models. we findindications for the existence of delta sct and gamma dor stars beyond the edgesof the current observational instability strips. the hybrid stars occupy theentire region within the delta sct and gamma dor instability strips, andbeyond. non-variable stars seem to exist within the instability strips. thelocation of gamma dor and delta sct classes in the (teff,logg)-diagram has beenextended. we investigate two newly constructed variables 'efficiency' and'energy' as a means to explore the relation between gamma dor and delta sctstars. our results suggest a revision of the current observational instabilitystrips, and imply an investigation of other pulsation mechanisms to supplementthe kappa mechanism and convective blocking effect to drive hybrid pulsations.

1108.4557	signals of exomoons in averaged light curves of exoplanets	the increasing number of transiting exoplanets sparked a significant interestin discovering their moons. most of the methods in the literature utilizetiming analysis of the raw light curves. here we propose a new approach for thedirect detection of a moon in the transit light curves via the so calledscatter peak. the essence of the method is the valuation of the local scatterin the folded light curves of many transits. we test the ability of this methodwith different simulations: kepler "short cadence", kepler "long cadence",ground-based millimagnitude photometry with 3-min cadence, and the expecteddata quality of the planned esa mission of plato. the method requires ~100transit observations, therefore applicable for moons of 10-20 day periodplanets, assuming 3-4-5 year long observing campaigns with space observatories.the success rate for finding a 1 r_earth moon around a 1 r_jupiter exoplanetturned out to be quite promising even for the simulated ground-basedobservations, while the detection limit of the expected plato data is around0.4 r_earth. we give practical suggestions for observations and data reductionto improve the chance of such a detection: (i) transit observations mustinclude out-of-transit phases before and after a transit, spanning at least thesame duration as the transit itself; (ii) any trend filtering must be done insuch a way that the preceding and following out-of-transit phases remainunaffected.

0704.3884	multisite campaign on the open cluster m67. iii. delta scuti pulsations  in the blue stragglers	we have made an asteroseismic analysis of the variable blue stragglers in theopen cluster m67. the data set consists of photometric time series from eightsites using nine 0.6-2.1 meter telescopes with a time baseline of 43 days. intwo stars, ew cnc and ex cnc, we detect the highest number of frequencies (41and 26) detected in delta scuti stars belonging to a stellar cluster, and ewcnc has the second highest number of frequencies detected in any delta scutistar. we have computed a grid of pulsation models that take the effects ofrotation into account. the distribution of observed and theoretical frequenciesshow that in a wide frequency range a significant fraction of the radial andnon-radial low-degree modes are excited to detectable amplitudes. despite thelarge number of observed frequencies we cannot constrain the fundamentalparameters of the stars. to make progress we need to identify the degrees ofsome of the modes either from multi-colour photometry or spectroscopy.

1212.1540	argos iii: stellar populations in the galactic bulge of the milky way	we present the metallicity results from the argos spectroscopic survey of thegalactic bulge. our aim is to understand the formation of the galactic bulge:did it form via mergers, as expected from lambda cdm theory, or from diskinstabilities, as suggested by its boxy/peanut shape, or both? we have obtainedspectra for 28,000 stars at a spectral resolution of r = 11,000. from thesespectra, we have determined stellar parameters and distances to an accuracy of&lt; 1.5 kpc. the stars in the inner galaxy span a large range in [fe/h], -2.8 &lt;[fe/h] &lt; +0.6. from the spatial distribution of the red clump stars as afunction of [fe/h] (ness et al. 2012a), we propose that the stars with [fe/h] &gt;-0.5 are part of the boxy/peanut bar/bulge. we associate the lower metallicitystars ([fe/h] &lt; -0.5) with the thick disk, which may be puffed up in the innerregion, and with the inner regions of the metal-weak thick disk and inner halo.for the bulge stars with [fe/h] &gt; -0.5, we find two discrete populations; (i)stars with [fe/h] ~ -0.25 which provide a roughly constant fraction of thestars in the latitude interval b = -5 deg to -10 deg, and (ii) a kinematicallycolder, more metal-rich population with mean [fe/h] ~ +0.15 which is moreprominent closer to the plane. the changing ratio of these components withlatitude appears as a vertical abundance gradient of the bulge. we attributeboth of these bulge components to instability-driven bar/bulge formation fromthe thin disk. we do not exclude a weak underlying classical merger-generatedbulge component, but see no obvious kinematic association of any of our bulgestars with such a classical bulge component.

1301.7615	discovery of the spectroscopic binary nature of six southern cepheids	we present the analysis of photometric and spectroscopic data of six brightgalactic cepheids: gh carinae, v419 centauri, v898 centauri, ad puppis, aysagittarii, and st velorum. based on new radial velocity data (in some casessupplemented with earlier data available in the literature), these cepheidshave been found to be members in spectroscopic binary systems. v898 cen turnedout to have one of the largest orbital radial velocity amplitude (&gt; 40 km/s)among the known binary cepheids. the data are insufficient to determine theorbital periods nor other orbital elements for these new spectroscopicbinaries.  these discoveries corroborate the statement on the high frequency ofoccurrence of binaries among the classical cepheids, a fact to be taken intoaccount when calibrating the period-luminosity relationship for cepheids.  we have also compiled all available photometric data that revealed that thepulsation period of ad pup, the longest period cepheid in this sample, iscontinuously increasing with delta p = 0.004567 d/century, likely to be causedby stellar evolution. the wave-like pattern superimposed on the parabolic o-cgraph of ad pup may well be caused by the light-time effect in the binarysystem. st vel also pulsates with a continuously increasing period. the otherfour cepheids are characterised with stable pulsation periods in the last halfcentury.

1308.1855	discovery of the spectroscopic binary nature of three bright southern  cepheids	we present an analysis of spectroscopic radial velocity and photometric dataof three bright galactic cepheids: lr trianguli australis (lr tra), rz velorum(rz vel), and bg velorum (bg vel). based on new radial velocity data, thesecepheids have been found to be members of spectroscopic binary systems.  the ratio of the peak-to-peak radial velocity amplitude to photometricamplitude indicates the presence of a companion for lr tra and bg vel. iuespectra indicate that the companions of rz vel and bg vel cannot be hot stars.  the analysis of all available photometric data revealed that the pulsationperiod of rz vel and bg vel varies monotonically, due to stellar evolution.moreover, the longest period cepheid in this sample, rz vel, shows periodfluctuations superimposed on the monotonic period increase. the light-timeeffect interpretation of the observed pattern needs long-term photometricmonitoring of this cepheid. the pulsation period of lr tra has remainedconstant since the discovery of its brightness variation.  using statistical data, it is also shown that a large number of spectroscopicbinaries still remain to be discovered among bright classical cepheids.

1309.1012	variability of m giant stars based on kepler photometry: general  characteristics	m giants are among the longest-period pulsating stars which is why theirstudies were traditionally restricted to analyses of low-precision visualobservations, and more recently, accurate ground-based data. here we present anoverview of m giant variability on a wide range of time-scales (hours toyears), based on analysis of thirteen quarters of kepler long-cadenceobservations (one point per every 29.4 minutes), with a total time-span of over1000 days. about two-thirds of the sample stars have been selected from theasas-north survey of the kepler field, with the rest supplemented from arandomly chosen m giant control sample.  we first describe the correction of the light curves from different quarters,which was found to be essential. we use fourier analysis to calculate multiplefrequencies for all stars in the sample. over 50 stars show a relatively strongsignal with a period equal to the kepler-year and a characteristic phasedependence across the whole field-of-view. we interpret this as a so farunidentified systematic effect in the kepler data. we discuss the presence ofregular patterns in the distribution of multiple periodicities and amplitudes.in the period-amplitude plane we find that it is possible to distinguishbetween solar-like oscillations and larger amplitude pulsations which arecharacteristic for mira/sr stars. this may indicate the region of thetransition between two types of oscillations as we move upward along the giantbranch.

1309.1669	unveiling new members in five nearby young moving groups	in the last decade many kinematic groups of young stars (&lt;100 myr) werediscovered in the solar neighbourhood. since the most interesting period ofplanet formation overlaps with the age of these groups, their well datedmembers are attractive targets for exoplanet searches by direct imaging. wecombined astrometric, photometric and x-ray data, and applied strict selectioncriteria to explore the stellar content of five nearby moving groups. weidentified more than 100 potential new candidate members in the {\ss} picmoving group, and in the tucana-horologium, columba, carina, and argusassociations. in order to further assess and confirm their membership status,we analysed radial velocity data and lithium equivalent widths extracted fromhigh-resolution spectra of 54 candidate stars. we identified 35 newprobable/possible young moving group members: 4 in the {\ss} pic moving group,11 in the columba association, 16 in the carina association, and 4 in the argusassociation. we found serendipitiously a new ab dor moving group member aswell. for four columba systems hipparcos based parallaxes have already beenavailable and as they are consistent with the predicted kinematic parallaxes,they can be considered as secure new members.

1401.3532	affordable spectroscopy for 1m-class telescopes	doppler observations of exoplanet systems have been a very expensivetechnique, mainly due to the high costs of high-resolution stablespectrographs. recent advances in instrumentation enable affordable dopplerplanet detections with surprisingly small optical telescopes.  we investigate the possibility of measuring doppler reflex motion of planethosting stars with small-aperture telescopes that have traditionally beenneglected for this kind of studies. after thoroughly testing the recentlydeveloped and commercially available shelyak eshel echelle spectrograph, wedemonstrated that it is routinely possible to achieve velocity precision at the$100 \mathrm{m\,s}^{-1}$ level, reaching down to $\pm 50~\mathrm{m\,s}^{-1}$for the best cases. we describe our off-the-shelf instrumentation, including anew 0.5m rc telescope at the gothard astrophysical observatory of lor\'ande\"otv\"os university equipped with an intermediate resolution fiber-fedechelle spectrograph.  we present some follow-up radial velocity measurements of planet hostingstars and point out that updating the orbital solution of doppler-planets is avery important task that can be fulfilled with sub-meter sized opticaltelescopes without requesting very expensive telescope times on 2--4~m (orlarger) class telescopes.

1403.2539	asymmetric fundamental band co lines as a sign of an embedded giant  planet	we investigate the formation of double-peaked asymmetric line profiles of coin the fundamental band spectra emitted by young (1-5myr) protoplanetary diskshosted by a 0.5-2 solar mass star. distortions of the line profiles can becaused by the gravitational perturbation of an embedded giant planet with q=4.710^-3 stellar-to-planet mass ratio. locally isothermal, 2d hydrodynamicsimulations show that the disk becomes globally eccentric inside the planetaryorbit with stationary ~0.2-0.25 average eccentricity after ~2000 orbitalperiods. for orbital distances 1-10 au, the disk eccentricity is peaked insidethe region where the fundamental band of co is thermal excitated. hence, theselines become a sensitive indicators of the embedded planet via theirasymmetries (both in flux and wavelength). we find that the line shapedistortions (e.g. distance, central dip, asymmetry and positions of peaks) of agiven transition depend on the excitation energy (i.e. on the rotationalquantum number j). the magnitude of line asymmetry is increasing/decreasingwith j if the planet orbits inside/outside the co excitation zone (r_co&lt;=3, 5and 7 au for a 0.5,1 and 2 solar mass star, respectively), thus one canconstrain the orbital distance of a giant planet by determining the slope ofpeak asymmetry-j profile. we conclude that the presented spectroscopicphenomenon can be used to test the predictions of planet formation theories bypushing the age limits for detecting the youngest planetary systems.

1406.0003	non-radial oscillations in m-giant semi-regular variables: stellar  models and kepler observations	the success of asteroseismology relies heavily on our ability to identify thefrequency patterns of stellar oscillation modes. for stars like the sun this isrelatively easy because the mode frequencies follow a regular pattern describedby a well-founded asymptotic relation. when a solar like star evolves off themain sequence and onto the red giant branch its structure changes dramaticallyresulting in changes in the frequency pattern of the modes. we follow theevolution of the adiabatic frequency pattern from the main sequence to near thetip of the red giant branch for a series of models. we find a significantdeparture from the asymptotic relation for the non-radial modes near the redgiant branch tip, resulting in a triplet frequency pattern. to support ourinvestigation we analyze almost four years of kepler data of the most luminousstars in the field (late k and early m type) and find that their frequencyspectra indeed show a triplet pattern dominated by dipole modes even for themost luminous stars in our sample. our identification explains previous resultsfrom ground-based observations reporting fine structure in the petersen diagramand sub ridges in the period-luminosity diagram. finally, we find `new ridges'of non-radial modes with frequencies below the fundamental mode in our modelcalculations, and we speculate they are related to f modes.

1508.00321	cheops performance for exomoons: the detectability of exomoons by using  optimal decision algorithm	many attempts have already been made for detecting exomoons around transitingexoplanets but the first confirmed discovery is still pending. the experiencethat have been gathered so far allow us to better optimize future spacetelescopes for this challenge, already during the development phase. in thispaper we focus on the forthcoming charaterising exoplanet satellite(cheops),describing an optimized decision algorithm with step-by-stepevaluation, and calculating the number of required transits for an exomoondetection for various planet-moon configurations that can be observable bycheops. we explore the most efficient way for such an observation whichminimizes the cost in observing time. our study is based on ptv observations(photocentric transit timing variation, szab\'o et al. 2006) in simulatedcheops data, but the recipe does not depend on the actual detection method, andit can be substituted with e.g. the photodynamical method for laterapplications. using the current state-of-the-art level simulation of cheopsdata we analyzed transit observation sets for different star-planet-moonconfigurations and performed a bootstrap analysis to determine their detectionstatistics. we have found that the detection limit is around an earth-sizedmoon. in the case of favorable spatial configurations, systems with at leastsuch a large moon and with at least neptune-sized planet, 80\% detection chancerequires at least 5-6 transit observations on average. there is also non-zerochance in the case of smaller moons, but the detection statistics deterioratesrapidly, while the necessary transit measurements increase fast.

(2000) onthe strong and continuous period change. the long-term period variation can bedescribed approximately with two linear branches in the o-c diagramcorresponding to a sudden period jump between two constant periods around jd2448500 (1991). additional smooth small-scale changes in the period distort thelinearity. the present data do not support the hypothetical light-time effectof cakirli &amp; devlen (1999). the eclipse depths in v, r, and i do not showcolour dependence, which suggests negligible continuum variations due to thecool secondary component in the far-red region (up to 8800 aa). the magnitudeof the reflection effect was used to estimate the mean effective temperature ofthe illuminated hemisphere of the secondary. the result is 13300\pm200 k or11000\pm200 k, depending on the primary temperature (35000 k or 26000 k). analbedo near unity is implied for the cool component.

astro-ph;0205334	period-doubling events in the light curve of r cygni: evidence for  chaotic behaviour	a detailed analysis of the century long visual light curve of the long-periodmira star r cygni is presented and discussed. the data were collected from thepublicly available databases of the afoev, the baavss and the vsolj. the fulllight curve consists of 26655 individual points obtained between 1901 and 2001.the light curve and its periodicity were analysed with help of the o-c diagram,fourier analysis and time-frequency analysis. the results demonstrate thelimitations of these linear methods. the next step was to investigate thepossible presence of low-dimensional chaos in the light curve. for this, asmoothed and noise-filtered signal was created from the averaged data and withhelp of time delay embedding, we have tried to reconstruct the attractor of thesystem. the main result is that r cygni shows such period-doubling events thatcan be interpreted as caused by a repetitive bifurcation of the chaoticattractor between a period 2t orbit and chaos. the switch between these twostates occurs in a certain compact region of the phase space, where the lightcurve is characterized by ~1500-days long transients. the lyapunov spectrum wascomputed for various embedding parameters confirming the chaotic attractor,although the exponents suffer from quite high uncertainty because of theapplied approximation. finally, the light curve is compared with a simple onezone model generated by a third-order differential equation which exhibitswell-expressed period-doubling bifurcation. the strong resemblance is anotherargument for chaotic behaviour. further studies should address the problem ofglobal flow reconstruction, including the determination of the accuratelyapunov exponents and dimension.

astro-ph;0206253	wind accretion and state transitions in cygnus x-1	we present the results of a spectroscopic monitoring program (from 1998 to2002) of the h-alpha emission strength in hde 226868, the optical counterpartof the black hole binary, cyg x-1. the h-alpha profiles consist of (1) a pcygni component associated with the wind of the supergiant, (2) emissioncomponents that attain high velocity at the conjunctions and that probably formin enhanced outflows both towards and away from the black hole, and (3) anemission component that moves in anti-phase with the supergiant's motion. weargue that the third component forms in accreted gas near the black hole, andthe radial velocity curve of the emission is consistent with a mass ratio ofm_x / m_opt = 0.36 +/- 0.05. we find that there is a general anti-correlationbetween the h-alpha emission strength and x-ray flux in the sense that when theh-alpha emission is strong (w_\lambda &lt; -0.5 angstroms) the x-ray flux isweaker and the spectrum harder. on the other hand, there is no correlationbetween h-alpha emission strength and x-ray flux when h-alpha is weak. duringthe low/hard x-ray state, the strong wind is fast and the accretion rate isrelatively low, while in the high/soft state the weaker, highly ionized windattains only a moderate velocity and the accretion rate increases. we arguethat the x-ray transitions from the normal low/hard to the rare high/soft stateare triggered by episodes of decreased mass loss rate in the supergiant donorstar.

astro-ph;0303018	a photometric monitoring of bright high-amplitude delta scuti stars. ii.  period updates for seven stars	we present new photometric data for seven high-amplitude delta scuti stars.the observations were acquired between 1996 and 2002, mostly in the johnsonphotometric system. for one star (gw uma), our observations are the first sincethe discovery of its pulsational nature from the hipparcos data.the primarygoal of this project was to update our knowledge on the period variations ofthe target stars. for this, we have collected all available photometricobservations from the literature and constructed decades-long o-c diagrams ofthe stars. this traditional method is useful because of the single-periodicnature of the light variations. text-book examples of slow period evolution (xxcyg, dy her, dy peg) and cyclic period changes due to light-time effect (lite)in a binary system (sz lyn) are updated with the new observations. for yz boo,we find a period decrease instead of increase. the previously suggestedlite-solution of be lyn (kiss &amp; szatmary 1995) is not supported with the newo-c diagram. instead of that, we suspect the presence of transient light curveshape variations mimicking small period changes.

astro-ph;0309112	color variability of asteroids in sdss moving object catalog	we report a detection of statistically significant color variations for asample of 7,531 multiply observed asteroids that are listed in the sloandigital sky survey moving object catalog. using 5-band photometric observationsaccurate to ~0.02 mag, we detect color variations in the range 0.06-0.11 mag(rms). these variations appear uncorrelated with asteroids physicalcharacteristics such as diameter (in the probed 1-10 km range), taxonomicclass, and family membership. despite such a lack of correlation, which impliesa random nature for the cause of color variability, a suite of tests suggestthat the detected variations are not instrumental effects. in particular, theobserved color variations are incompatible with photometric errors, and, forobjects observed at least four times, the color change in the first pair ofobservations is correlated with the color change in the second pair. thesefacts strongly suggest that the observed effect is real, and also indicate thatfor some asteroids color variations are larger than for others. the detectedcolor variations can be explained as due to inhomogeneous albedo distributionover an asteroid surface. although relatively small, these variations suggestthat fairly large patches with different color than their surroundings exist ona significant fraction of asteroids. this conclusion is in agreement withspatially resolved color images of several large asteroids obtained by nearspacecraft and hst.

(1995). v1647 ori might belong to a new class of youngeruptive stars, defined by relatively short timescales, recurrent outbursts,modest increase in bolometric luminosity and accretion rate, and anevolutionary state earlier than that of typical exors.

astro-ph;0501498	photometric biases due to stellar blending: implications for measuring  distances, constraining binarity and detecting exoplanetary transits	we investigate blending, binarity and photometric biases in crowded-field ccdimaging. for this, we consider random blend losses, which correspond to thetotal number of stars left undetected in unresolved blends. we present a simpleformula to estimate blend losses, which can be converted to apparent magnitudebiases using the luminosity function of the analyzed sample. because of theused assumptions, our results give lower limits of the total bias and we showthat in some cases even these limits point toward significant limitations inmeasuring apparent brightnesses of ``standard candle'' stars, thus distances tonearby galaxies. a special application is presented for the ogle-ii bvi maps ofthe large magellanic cloud. we find a previously neglected systematic bias upto 0.2-0.3 mag for faint stars (v~18.0-19.0) in the ogle-ii sample, whichaffects lmc distance measurements using rr lyrae and red clump stars. we alsoconsider the effects of intrinsic stellar correlations, i.e. binarity, viacalculating two-point correlation functions for stellar fields around sevenrecently exploded classical novae. in two cases, for v1494 aql and v705 cas,the reported close optical companions seem to be physically correlated with thecataclysmic systems. finally, we find significant blend frequencies up to50-60% in the samples of wide-field exoplanetary surveys, which suggests thatblending calculations are highly advisable to be included into the regularreduction procedure.

astro-ph;0507471	the light curve of the semiregular variable l2 puppis: ii. evidence for  solar-like excitation of the oscillations	we analyse visual observations of the pulsations of the red giant variable l2pup. the data cover 77 years between 1927 and 2005, thus providing an extensiveempirical base for characterizing properties of the oscillations. the powerspectrum of the light curve shows a single mode resolved into multiple peaksunder a narrow envelope. we argue that this results from stochastic excitation,as seen in solar oscillations. the random fluctuations in phase also supportthis idea. a comparison with x cam, a true mira star with the same pulsationperiod, and w cyg, a true semiregular star, illustrates the basic differencesin phase behaviours. the mira shows very stable phase, consistent withexcitation by the kappa-mechanism, whereas w cyg shows large phase fluctuationsthat imply stochastic excitation. we find l2 pup to be intermediate, implyingthat both mechanisms play a role in its pulsation. finally, we also checked thepresence of low-dimensional chaos and could safely exclude it.

(2001), ourcentre-of-mass velocity (v_gamma=72.7+/-3.3 km/s) differs significantly fromthe previously published value (107.4+/-m2.9 km/s). however, we find evidencethat the difference is caused by a systematic error in data reduction in theprevious study, rather than by gravitational effects of an invisible thirdcomponent.

astro-ph;9902091	v2109 cygni, a second overtone field rr lyrae star	we present the first (as of february, 1999) ubv and uvby photometricmeasurements for the short period variable star v2109 cyg discovered by thehipparcos satellite and classified as a field rrc variable. we have obtainednew times of maxima and the period change has been studied. we determined thefundamental physical parameters using the geometric distance of the star andthe most recent synthetic colour grids. the results are:  [fe/h]=-0.9+/-0.2, mbol=0.73+/-0.43 mag, &lt;teff&gt;=6800+/-200 k, logg=2.7+/-0.2, r=4.6+/-0.9 ro.  additionally, we took medium resolution (lambda/delta lambda=11000) spectrain the red spectral region centered at 6600 a. a complete radial velocity curvehas been determined from 60 spectra. we found no systematic difference betweenthe velocities from halpha and metallic lines indicating a smooth pulsation.the mass of the star is found to be m=0.5+/-0.3 mo using the photometric log gvalue and the acceleration curve calculated from the radial velocity data. thefinally adopted set of the physical parameters lies in the typical range of rrlyrae stars, which implies that v2109 cyg is the shortest period rr lyrae-typevariable. the visual amplitude vs. period and the fourier amplitude parameterr21} vs. period diagrams suggest that v2109 cyg probably pulsates in the secondovertone mode.

astro-ph;9904128	multiperiodicity in semiregular variables - i. general properties	we present a detailed period analysis for 93 red semiregular variables bymeans of fourier and wavelet analyses of long-term visual observations carriedout by amateur astronomers. the results of this analysis yield insights intothe mode structure of semiregular variables and help to clarify therelationship between them and mira variables. after collecting all availabledata from various international databases (afoev, vsolj, haa/vss and aavso) wetest the accuracy and reliability of data. we compare the averaged andnoise-filtered visual light curves with simultaneous photoelectricv-measurements, the effect of the length versus the relatively lowsignal-to-noise ratio is illustrated by period analysis of artificial data,while binning effects are tested by comparing results of frequency analyses ofthe unbinned and averaged light curves.  the distribution of periods and period ratios is examined through the use ofthe (log p_0, log p_1) and (log p_1, log p_0/p_1) plots. three significant andtwo less obvious sequences are present which could be explained as the directconsequence of different pulsational modes. this hypothesis is supported by theresults for multiperiodic variables with three periods. finally, these spacemethods are illustrated by several interesting case studies that show the bestexamples of different special phenomena such as long-term amplitude modulation,amplitude decrease and mode switching.

astro-ph;9909159	ccd photometry and new models of 5 minor planets	we present new r filtered ccd observations of 5 faint and moderately faintasteroids carried out between october, 1998 and january, 1999. the achievedaccuracy is between 0.01-0.03 mag, depending mainly on the target brightness.the obtained sinodic periods and amplitudes:  683 lanzia - 4.6+/-0.2 h, 0.13 mag; 725 amanda - &gt;3.0 h, &gt;=0.40 mag; 852wladilena - 4.62+/-0.01 h, 0.32 mag (december, 1998) and 0.27 mag (january,1999); 1627 ivar - 4.80+/-0.01, 0.77 mag (december, 1998) and 0.92 mag(january, 1999). the near earth object 1998 pg unambiguously showeddoubly-periodic lightcurve, suggesting the possibility of a relatively fastprecession (p_1=1.3 h, p_2=5.3 h).  collecting all data from the literature, we determined new models for 3 minorplanets. the resulting spin vectors and triaxial ellipsoids have beencalculated by an amplitude-method. sidereal periods and senses of rotation werecalculated for two asteroids (683 and 1627) by a modified epoch-method. theresults are:  683 - lambda_p=15/195+/-25 deg, beta_p=52+/-15 deg, a/b=1.15+/-0.05,b/c=1.05+/-0.05, p_sid=0.1964156+/-0.0000001 d, retrograde; 852 -lambda_p=30/210+/-20 deg, beta_p=30+/-10 deg, a/b=2.3+/-0.3, b/c=1.2+/-0.2;1627 - lambda_p=145/325+/-8 deg, beta_p=34+/-6 deg, a/b=2.0+/-0.1,b/c=1.09+/-0.05, p_sid=0.1999154+/-0.0000003 d, retrograde. the obtained shapeof 1627 is in good agreement with radar images by ostro et al.

astro-ph;9912438	a photometric and spectroscopic study of the brightest northern  cepheids. iii. a high-resolution view of cepheid atmospheres	we present new high-resolution (r=40000) spectroscopic observations of 18bright northern cepheids carried out at david dunlap observatory, in 1997. themeasurements mainly extend those of presented in paper i adding three morestars (aw per, sv vul, t mon). the spectra were obtained in the interval of5900 a and 6660 a. new radial velocities determined with the cross-correlationtechnique and the bisector technique are presented. we found systematicdifferences between the spectroscopic and coravel-type measurements as large as1-3 km/s in certain phases. we performed baade-wesselink analysis for ck camdiscovered by the hipparcos satellite. the resulting radius is 31+/-1 ro, whichis in very good agreement with recent period-radius relation by gieren et al.(1999). observational pieces of evidence of possible velocity gradientaffecting the individual line profiles are studied. the fwhm of the metalliclines, similarly to the velocity differences, shows a very characteristic phasedependence, illustrating the effect of global compression in the atmosphere.the smallest line widths always occur around the maximal radius, while thelargest fwhm is associated with the velocity reversal before the minimalradius. three first overtone pulsators do not follow the general trend: thelargest fwhm in su cas and sz tau occurs after the smallest radius, during theexpansion, while in v1334 cyg there are only barely visible fwhm-variations.the possibility of a bright yellow companion of v1334 cyg is briefly discussed.the observed line profile asymmetries can be partly associated with thevelocity gradient, which is also supported by the differences betweenindividual line velocities of different excitation potentials.

0812.1589	the young, massive, star cluster sandage-96 after the explosion of sn  2004dj in ngc 2403	the bright type ii-plateau supernova (sn) 2004dj occurred within the young,massive stellar cluster sandage-96 in a spiral arm of ngc 2403. newmulti-wavelength observations obtained with several ground-based andspace-based telescopes are combined to study the radiation from sandage-96after sn 2004dj faded away. sandage-96 started to dominate the flux in theoptical bands starting september 2006 (~800 d after explosion). the opticalfluxes are equal to the pre-explosion ones within the observationaluncertainties. an optical keck spectrum obtained ~900 d after explosion showsthe dominant blue continuum from the cluster stars shortward of 6000 \aa aswell as strong sn nebular emission lines redward. the integrated spectralenergy distribution (sed) of the cluster has been extended into the ultravioletregion by archival xmm-newton and new swift observations, and compared withtheoretical models. the outer parts of the cluster have been resolved by thehubble space telescope, allowing the construction of a color-magnitude diagram.the fitting of the cluster sed with theoretical isochrones results in clusterages between 10--40 myr, depending on metallicity and the model family. theisochrone fitting indicates that the resolved part of the cluster has a bimodalage distribution: a younger population at ~10--16 myr, and an older one at~32--100 myr which is similar to the age distribution of the nearby fieldstars. these stars may have been captured from the field during the clusterformation. the young age of sandage-96 suggest 12 &lt; m_prog &lt; 20 m_\odot as themost probable mass range for the progenitor of sn 2004dj. this is consistentwith, but perhaps slightly higher than, most of the other type ii-plateau snprogenitor masses determined so far.

0812.2139	binarity and multiperiodicity in high-amplitude delta scuti stars	we have carried out a photometric and spectroscopic survey of brighthigh-amplitude delta scuti (hads) stars. the aim was to detect binarity andmultiperiodicity (or both) in order to explore the possibility of combiningbinary star astrophysics with stellar oscillations. here we present the firstresults for ten, predominantly southern, hads variables. we detected theorbital motion of rs gru with a semi-amplitude of ~6.5 km/s and 11.5 daysperiod. the companion is inferred to be a low-mass dwarf star in a close orbitaround rs gru. we found multiperiodicity in ry lep both from photometric andradial velocity data and detected orbital motion in the radial velocities withhints of a possible period of 500--700 days. the data also revealed that theamplitude of the secondary frequency is variable on the time-scale of a fewyears, whereas the dominant mode is stable. radial velocities of ad cmirevealed cycle-to-cycle variations which might be due to non-radial pulsations.we confirmed the multiperiodic nature of bq ind, while we obtained the firstradial velocity curves of zz mic and be lyn. the radial velocity curve and theo-c diagram of cy aqr are consistent with the long-period binary hypothesis. wetook new time series photometry on xx cyg, dy her and dy peg, with which weupdated their o-c diagrams.
