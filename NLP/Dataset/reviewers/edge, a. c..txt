0901.1227	the evolution of the red sequence slope in massive galaxy clusters	we investigate the evolution of the optical and near-infraredcolour-magnitude relation in an homogeneous sample of massive clusters from z =1 to the present epoch. by comparing deep hubble space telescope acs imaging ofx-ray selected macs survey clusters at z = 0.5 to the similarly selected larcssample at z = 0.1 we find that the rest-frame d(u -v)/dv slope of thecolour-magnitude relation evolves with redshift which we attribute to the buildup of the red sequence over time. this rest frame slope evolution is notadequately reproduced by that predicted from semi-analytic models based on themillennium simulation despite a prescription for the build up of the redsequence by in-falling galaxies, 'strangulation'. we observe no strongcorrelation between this slope and the cluster environment at a given redshiftdemonstrating that the observed evolution is not due to a secondarycorrelation. also presented are near-infrared ukirt wfcam observations of thelarcs clusters which confirm and improve on the the result from stott et al.(2007) finding that there has been a two-fold increase in faint mv &gt; -20galaxies on the red sequence since z = 0.5 to a significance of 5sigma.

0901.2144	a spectacular giant arc in the massive cluster lens macsj1206.2-0847	we discuss the x-ray and optical properties of the massive galaxy clustermacsj1206.2-0847 (z=0.4385), discovered in the massive cluster survey (macs).our chandra observation of the system yields a total x-ray luminosity of 2.4 x10^45 erg/s (0.1-2.4 kev) and a global gas temperature of (11.6 +/- 0.7) kev,very high values typical of macs clusters. in both optical and x-ray imagesmacsj1206 appears close to relaxed in projection, with a pronounced x-ray peakat the location of the brightest cluster galaxy (bcg); we interpret thisfeature as the remnant of a cold core. a spectacular giant gravitational arc,15" in length, bright (v~21) and unusually red (r-k=4.3), is seen 20" west ofthe bcg; we measure a redshift of z=1.036 for the lensed galaxy. from our hstimage of the cluster we identify the giant arc and its counter image as aseven-fold imaged system. an excess of x-ray emission in the direction of thearc coincides with a mild galaxy overdensity and could be the remnant of aminor merger with a group of galaxies. we derive estimates of the total clustermass as well as of the mass of the cluster core using x-ray, dynamical, andgravitational-lensing techniques. for the mass enclosed by the giant arc (r&lt;119kpc) our strong-lensing analysis based on hst imaging yields a very high valueof 1.1 x 10^14 m_sun, inconsistent with the much lower x-ray estimate of 0.5 x10^14 m_sun. similarly, the virial estimate of 4 x 10^15 m_sun for the totalcluster mass, derived from multi-object spectroscopy of 38 cluster members, issignificantly higher than the corresponding x-ray estimate of 1.7 x 10^15m_sun. we take the discrepant mass estimates to be indicative of substructurealong the line of sight during an ongoing merger event, an interpretation thatis supported by the system's very high velocity dispersion of 1580 km/s.

0902.4720	integral field spectroscopy of ionized and molecular gas in cool cluster  cores: evidence for cold feedback?	we present vlt-sinfoni k-band ifu spectroscopy of the central galaxies in thecool core clusters a1664, a2204 and pks 0745-191, to probe the pa-alpha andro-vibrational h2 line emission. in a1664 the two emission-line velocitysystems seen in our previous h-alpha data appear in both pa-alpha and h2emission, with notable morphological differences. the recession velocity of thered component of pa-alpha increases linearly with decreasing radius,particularly along an 8 kpc filament aligned with the major axis of theunderlying galaxy and the cluster x-ray emission. these kinematics are modelledas gravitational free-fall as gas cools rapidly out of the hot phase. in a2204the gas shows 3 or 4 filaments reaching 10 kpc, three of which lie towards`ghost bubbles' seen in x-ray imaging. for pks 0745-191, we confirm thetwin-arm morphology of previous narrow-band images; the pa-alpha kinematicssuggest rotational motion about an axis aligned with the kpc-scale radio jet;on nucleus, we find a broad pa-alpha component (fwhm 1700 km/s) and a secondaryh2 system redshifted by +500 km/s.  the h2 v=1-0 s(3)/pa-alpha ratio is highest in isolated and extended regionswhere it matches the levels in the ngc 1275 filaments as modelled by ferland etal. regions with lower ratios highlight active star formation and are oftenkinematically quiescent (fwhm &lt; 200 km/s). our findings suggest that theseclusters may be captured in different stages of the `cold feedback' cycle ofpizzolato &amp; soker, with a1664 in a brief phase of extreme cooling and starformation prior to an agn heating event; pks 0745-191 in outburst with the agnaccreting from a cool gas disk, and a2204 in a later phase where cool gas isdragged out of the galaxy by the buoyant rise of old radio bubbles (abridged).

0907.5457	the reflex galaxy cluster survey. viii. spectroscopic observations and  optical atlas	we present the final data from the spectroscopic survey of the rosat-esoflux-limited x-ray (reflex) catalog of galaxy clusters. the reflex surveycovers 4.24 steradians (34% of the entire sky) below a declination of 2.5 degand at high galactic latitude (|b| &gt; 20 deg). the reflex catalog includes 447entries with a median redshift of 0.08 and is better than 90% complete to alimiting flux fx = 3x10^{-12} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} (0.1 to 2.4 kev), representingthe largest statistically homogeneous sample of clusters drawn from the rosatall-sky survey (rass) to date. here we describe the details of thespectroscopic observations carried out at the eso 1.5 m, 2.2 m, and 3.6 mtelescopes, as well as the data reduction and redshift measurement techniques.the spectra typically cover the wavelength range 3600-7500 a at a fwhmresolution of ~14 a, and the measured redshifts have a total rms error of ~100km s^{-1}. in total we present 1406 new galaxy redshifts in 192 clusters, mostof which previously did not have any redshift measured. finally, theluminosity/redshift distributions of the cluster sample and a comparison to theno-evolution expectations from the cluster x-ray luminosity function arepresented.

0910.1595	an aztec 1.1-mm survey for ulirgs in the field of the galaxy cluster ms  0451.6-0305	we have undertaken a deep (sigma~1.1 mjy) 1.1-mm survey of the z=0.54 clusterms 0451.6-0305 using the aztec camera on the james clerk maxwell telescope. wedetect 36 sources with s/n&gt;3.5 in the central 0.10 deg^2 and present the aztecmap, catalogue and number counts. we identify counterparts to 18 sources (50%)using radio, mid-infrared, spitzer irac and submillimeter array data. optical,near- and mid-infrared spectral energy distributions are compiled for the 14 ofthese galaxies with detectable counterparts, which are expected to contain alllikely cluster members. we then use photometric redshifts and colour selectionto separate background galaxies from potential cluster members and test thereliability of this technique using archival observations of submillimetregalaxies. we find two potential ms 0451-03 members, which, if they are bothcluster galaxies have a total star-formation rate (sfr) of ~100 solar massesper year -- a significant fraction of the combined sfr of all the othergalaxies in ms 0451-03. we also examine the stacked rest-frame mid-infrared,millimetre and radio emission of cluster members below our aztec detectionlimit and find that the sfrs of mid-ir selected galaxies in the cluster andredshift-matched field populations are comparable. in contrast, the average sfrof the morphologically classified late-type cluster population is ~3 times lessthan the corresponding redshift-matched field galaxies. this suggests thatthese galaxies may be in the process of being transformed on the red-sequenceby the cluster environment. our survey demonstrates that although theenvironment of ms 0451-03 appears to suppress star-formation in late-typegalaxies, it can support active, dust-obscured mid-ir galaxies and potentiallymillimetre-detected lirgs.

0912.0511	angular correlation function of 1.5 million lrgs: clustering evolution  and a search for bao	we present the angular correlation function measured from photometric samplescomprising 1,562,800 luminous red galaxies (lrgs). three lrg samples wereextracted from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) imaging data, based oncolour-cut selections at redshifts, z ~ 0.35, 0.55 and 0.7 as calibrated by thespectroscopic surveys, sdss-lrg, 2df-sdss lrg and qso (2slaq), and the aaomegalrg survey. the galaxy samples cover ~7600 s.q.deg of the sky, probing a totalcosmic volume of ~5.5 h^-3} gpc^3.  the small and intermediate scale correlation functions generally showsignificant deviations from a single power-law fit with a well-detected breakat ~1 h^-1 mpc, consistent with the transition scale between the 1- and 2-haloterms in halo occupation models. for galaxy separations 1-20 h^-1 mpc and atfixed luminosity, we see virtually no evolution of the clustering with redshiftand the data is consistent with a simple high peaks biasing model where thecomoving lrg space density is constant with z. at fixed z, the lrg clusteringamplitude increases with luminosity in accordance with the simple high peaksmodel, with a typical lrg dark matter halo mass 10^13-10^14 h^-1 m_sol. for r &lt;1 h^-1 mpc, the evolution is slightly faster and the clustering decreasestowards high redshift consistent with a virialised clustering model. however,assuming the hod and lcdm halo merger frameworks, ~2-3 per cent per gyr of thelrgs is required to merge in order to explain the small scales clusteringevolution, consistent with previous results [abridge].

1004.1559	chandra observation of two shock fronts in the merging galaxy cluster  abell 2146	we present a new chandra observation of the galaxy cluster abell 2146 whichhas revealed a complex merging system with a gas structure that is remarkablysimilar to the bullet cluster (eg. markevitch et al. 2002). the x-ray image andtemperature map show a cool 2-3 kev subcluster with a ram pressure strippedtail of gas just exiting the disrupted 6-7 kev primary cluster. from the sharpjump in the temperature and density of the gas, we determine that thesubcluster is preceded by a bow shock with a mach number m=2.2+/-0.8,corresponding to a velocity v=2200^{+1000}_{-900} km/s relative to the maincluster. we estimate that the subcluster passed through the primary core only0.1-0.3 gyr ago. in addition, we observe a slower upstream shock propagatingthrough the outer region of the primary cluster and calculate a mach numberm=1.7+/-0.3. based on the measured shock mach numbers m~2 and the strength ofthe upstream shock, we argue that the mass ratio between the two mergingclusters is between 3 and 4 to one. by comparing the chandra observation withan archival hst observation, we find that a group of galaxies is located infront of the x-ray subcluster core but the brightest cluster galaxy is locatedimmediately behind the x-ray peak.

1004.4683	the x-ray brightest clusters of galaxies from the massive cluster survey	we present a statistically complete sample of very x-ray luminous galaxyclusters detected in the massive cluster survey (macs). this second macsrelease comprises all 34 macs clusters with nominal x-ray fluxes in excess of2x10^(-12) erg/s/cm^2 (0.1-2.4 kev) in the rosat bright source catalogue; twothirds of them are new discoveries. extending over the redshift range from 0.3to 0.5, this subset complements the complete sample of the 12 most distant macsclusters (z&gt;0.5) published in 2007 and further exemplifies the efficacy ofx-ray selection for the compilation of samples of intrinsically massive galaxyclusters. extensive follow-up observations with chandra/acis led to threeadditional macs cluster candidates being eliminated as (predominantly) x-raypoint sources. for another four clusters --- which, however, remain in oursample of 34 --- the point-source contamination was found to be about 50%. themedian x-ray luminosity of 1.3x10^45 erg/s (0.1-2.4 kev, chandra, within r_500)of the clusters in this subsample demonstrates the power of the macs surveystrategy to find the most extreme and rarest clusters out to significantredshift. a comparison of the optical and x-ray data for all clusters in thisrelease finds a wide range of morphologies with no obvious bias in favour ofeither relaxed or merging systems.

1005.1071	herschel and scuba-2 imaging and spectroscopy of a bright, lensed  submillimetre galaxy at z = 2.3	we present a detailed analysis of the far-ir properties of the bright,lensed, z = 2.3, smg, smm j2135-0102, using new observations with herschel,scuba-2 and the vla. these data allow us to constrain the galaxy's sed and showthat it has an intrinsic rest-frame 8-1000um luminosity, l(bol), of (2.3 +/-0.2) x 10^12 l(sun) and a likely sfr of ~400 m(sun)/yr. the galaxy sits on thefar-ir/radio correlation for far-ir-selected galaxies. at ~&gt;70um, the sed canbe described adequately by dust components with t(d) ~ 30 and 60k. usingspire's fourier transform spectrometer we report a detection of the [cii] 158umcooling line. if the [cii], co and far-ir continuum arise in photo-dissociationregions, we derive a characteristic gas density, n ~ 10^3 cm^-3, and a far-uvradiation field, g_0, 10^3x stronger than the milky way. l([cii])/l(bol) issignificantly higher than in local ulirgs but similar to the values found inlocal star-forming galaxies and starburst nuclei. this is consistent with smmj2135-0102 being powered by starburst clumps distributed across ~2 kpc,evidence that smgs are not simply scaled-up ulirgs. our results show thatspire's fts has the ability to measure the redshifts of distant, obscuredgalaxies via the blind detection of atomic cooling lines, but it will not becompetitive with ground-based co-line searches. it will, however, allowdetailed study of the integrated properties of high-redshift galaxies, as wellas the chemistry of their ism, once more suitably bright candidates have beenfound.

1005.1207	herschel observations of fir emission lines in brightest cluster  galaxies	the question of how much gas cools in the cores of clusters of galaxies hasbeen the focus of many, multiwavelength studies in the past 30 years. in thisletter we present the first detections of the strongest atomic cooling lines,[c ii], [o i] and [n i] in two strong cooling flow clusters, a1068 and a2597,using herschel pacs. these spectra indicate that the substantial mass of coldmolecular gas (&gt;10^9 mo) known to be present in these systems is beingirradiated by intense uv radiation, most probably from young stars. the linewidths of these fir lines indicate that they share dynamics similar but notidentical to other ionised and molecular gas traced by optical, near-infraredand co lines. the relative brightness of the fir lines compared to co and firluminosity is consistent with other star-forming galaxies indicating that theproperties of the molecular gas clouds in cluster cores and the stars they formare not unusual. these results provide additional evidence for a reservoir ofcold gas that is fed by the cooling of gas in the cores of the most compactclusters and provide important diagnostics of the temperature and density ofthe dense clouds this gas resides in.

1005.3816	locuss: probing galaxy transformation physics with herschel	we present an early broad-brush analysis of herschel/pacs observations ofstar-forming galaxies in 8 galaxy clusters drawn from our survey of 30 clustersat z~0.2. we define a complete sample of 192 spectroscopically confirmedcluster members down to l_tir&gt;3x10^10l_sun and l_k&gt;0.25l_sun. the averagek-band and bolometric infrared luminosities of these galaxies both fade by afactor of ~2 from clustercentric radii of 2r_200 to ~0.5r_200, indicating thatas galaxies enter the clusters ongoing star-formation stops first in the mostmassive galaxies, and that the specific star-formation rate (ssfr) isconserved. on smaller scales the average ssfr jumps by 25%, suggesting that incluster cores processes including ram pressure stripping may trigger a finalepisode of star-formation that presumably exhausts the remaining gas. thispicture is consistent with our comparison of the herschel-detected clustermembers with the cluster mass distributions, as measured in our previousweak-lensing study of these clusters. for example, the spatial distribution ofthe herschel sources is positively correlated with the structures in theweak-lensing mass maps at 5sigma significance, with the strongest signal seenat intermediate group-like densities. the strong dependence of the totalcluster ir luminosity on cluster mass l_tir propto m_virial^2 is alsoconsistent with accretion of galaxies and groups of galaxies (i.e. thesubstructure mass function) driving the cluster ir luminosity. the mostsurprising result is that roughly half of the herschel-detected cluster membershave redder s_100/s_24 flux ratios than expected, based on the rieke et al.models. on average cluster members are redder than non-members, and thefraction of red galaxies increases towards the cluster centers, both of whichindicate that these colors are not attributable to systematic photometricerrors.

1007.5154	clustering properties of high redshift red galaxies in sa22 from the  ukidss dxs	deep, wide, near-infrared imaging surveys provide an opportunity to study theclustering of various galaxy populations at high redshift on the largestphysical scales. we have selected $1&lt;z&lt;2$ extremely red objects (eros) and$1&lt;z&lt;3$ distant red galaxies (drgs) in sa22 from the near-infrared photometricdata of the ukidss deep extragalactic survey (dxs) and $gri$ optical data fromctio covering 3.3~deg$^2$. this is the largest contiguous area studied tosufficient depth to select these distant galaxies to date. the angulartwo-point correlation functions and the real space correlation lengths of eachpopulation are measured and show that both populations are strongly clusteredand that the clustering cannot be parameterised with a single power law. thecorrelation function of eros shows a double power law with the inflection at$\sim$ 0.6$'$--1.2$'$ (0.6--1.2~h$^{-1}$~mpc). the bright eros ($k&lt;18.8$) showstronger clustering on small scales but similar clustering on larger scales,whereas redder eros show stronger clustering on all scales. clusteringdifferences between eros that are old passively evolved galaxies (ogs) anddusty star-forming galaxies (dgs), on the basis of their $j-k$ colour, are alsoinvestigated. the clustering of $r-k$ eros are compared with that of $i-k$ erosand the differences are consistent with their expected redshift distributions.the correlation function of drgs is also well described by a double power lawand consistent with previous studies once the effects of the broader redshiftdistribution our selection of drgs returns are taken into account. we alsoperform the same analysis on smaller sub-fields to investigate the impact ofcosmic variance on the derived clustering properties. currently this study isthe most representative measurement of the clustering of massive galaxies at$z&gt;1$ on large scales.

1109.3301	strong lensing by a node of the cosmic web. the core of macs  j0717.5+3745 at z=0.55	we present results of a strong-lensing analysis of macs j0717.5+3745(hereafter macs j0717), an extremely x-ray luminous galaxy cluster at z=0.55.observations at different wavelengths reveal a complex and dynamically veryactive cluster, whose core is connected to a large scale filament extended overseveral mpc. using multi-passband imaging data obtained with the hubble spacetelescope advanced camera for surveys (acs), we identify 15 multiply imagedsystems across the full field of view of acs, five of which we confirmedspectroscopically in groundbased follow-up observations with the kecktelescope. we use these multiply imaged systems to constrain a parametric modelof the mass distribution in the cluster core, employing a new parallelizedversion of the lenstool software. the main result is that the most probabledescription of the mass distribution comprises four cluster-scale dark matterhaloes. the total mass distribution follows the light distribution but stronglydeviates from the distribution of the intra-cluster gas as traced by the x-raysurface brightness. this confirms the complex morphology proposed by previousstudies. we interpret this segregation of collisional and collisionless matteras strong evidence of multiple mergers and ongoing dynamical activity. macsj0717 thus constitutes one of the most disturbed clusters presently known and,featuring a projected mass within the acs field of view (r=150"=960 kpc) of2.11 +- 0.23 x 10^{15} m_{sun}, the system is also one of the most massiveknown.

1112.4848	the relation between line emission and brightest cluster galaxies in  three exceptional clusters: evidence for gas cooling from the icm	there is a strong spatial correlation between brightest cluster galaxies(bcgs) and the peak density and cooling rate of the intra-cluster medium (icm).in this paper we combine integral field spectroscopy, co observations and x-raydata to study three exceptional clusters (abell 1991, abell 3444 and ophiuchus)where there is a physical and dynamical offset between the bcg and the coolingpeak to investigate the connection between the cooling of the intraclustermedium, the cold gas being deposited and the central galaxy. we find themajority of the optical line emission is spatially coincident with the peak inthe soft x-rays. in the case of a1991 we make separate detections of co(2-1)emission on the bcg and on the peak of the soft x-ray emission suggesting thatcooling continues to occur in the core despite being offset from the bcg. weconclude that there is a causal link between the lowest temperature (&lt; 2 kev)icm gas and the molecular gas(~ 30k). this link is only apparent in systemswhere a transitory event has decoupled the bcg from the soft x-ray peak. wediscuss the prospects for identifying more examples of this rare configuration.

1201.1294	the relation between cool cluster cores and herschel-detected star  formation in brightest cluster galaxies	we present far-infrared (fir) analysis of 68 brightest cluster galaxies(bcgs) at 0.08 &lt; z &lt; 1.0. deriving total infrared luminosities directly fromspitzer and herschel photometry spanning the peak of the dust component(24-500um), we calculate the obscured star formation rate (sfr). 22(+6.2,-5.3)%of the bcgs are detected in the far-infrared, with sfr= 1-150 m_sun/yr. theinfrared luminosity is highly correlated with cluster x-ray gas cooling timesfor cool-core clusters (gas cooling time &lt;1 gyr), strongly suggesting that thestar formation in these bcgs is influenced by the cluster-scale coolingprocess. the occurrence of the molecular gas tracing ha emission is alsocorrelated with obscured star formation. for all but the most luminous bcgs(l_tir &gt; 2x10^11 l_sun), only a small (&lt;0.4 mag) reddening correction isrequired for sfr(ha) to agree with sfr_fir. the relatively low ha extinction(dust obscuration), compared to values reported for the general star-formingpopulation, lends further weight to an alternate (external) origin for the coldgas. finally, we use a stacking analysis of non-cool-core clusters to show thatthe majority of the fuel for star formation in the fir-bright bcgs is unlikelyto originate form normal stellar mass loss.

1201.2908	a bright z=5.2 lensed submillimeter galaxy in the field of abell 773:  hlsj091828.6+514223	during our herschel lensing survey (hls) of massive galaxy clusters, we havediscovered an exceptionally bright source behind the z=0.22 cluster abell 773,which appears to be a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy (smg) at z=5.2429.this source is unusual compared to most other lensed sources discovered byherschel so far, because of its higher submm flux (\sim 200mjy at 500\micron)and its high redshift. the dominant lens is a foreground z=0.63 galaxy, not thecluster itself. the source has a far-infrared (fir) luminosity of l_fir= 1.110^{14}/\mu lo, where \mu is the magnification factor, likely \sim 11. wereport here the redshift identification through co lines with the iram-30m, andthe analysis of the gas excitation, based on co(7-6), co(6-5), co(5-4) detectedat iram and the co(2-1) at the evla. all lines decompose into a wide and strongred component, and a narrower and weaker blue component, 540\kms apart.assuming the ultraluminous galaxy (ulirg) co-to-h2 conversion ratio, the h2mass is 5.8 10^{11}/\mu mo, of which one third is in a cool component. from theci line we derive a ci/h2 number abundance of 6 10^{-5} similar to that inother ulirgs. the h2o line is strong only in the red velocity component, withan intensity ratio i(h_2o)/i(co) \sim 0.5, suggesting a strong local firradiation field, possibly from an active nucleus (agn) component. we detect the[nii]205\mics line for the first time at high-z. it shows comparable blue andred components, with a strikingly broad blue one, suggesting strong ionized gasflows.

1202.5320	shock fronts, electron-ion equilibration and icm transport processes in  the merging cluster abell 2146	we present a new 400 ks chandra x-ray observation of the merging galaxycluster abell 2146. this deep observation reveals detailed structure associatedwith the major merger event including the mach m=2.3+/-0.2 bow shock ahead ofthe dense, ram pressure stripped subcluster core and the first known example ofan upstream shock in the icm (m=1.6+/-0.1). by measuring the electrontemperature profile behind each shock front, we determine the timescale for theelectron population to thermally equilibrate with the shock-heated ions. wefind that the temperature profile behind the bow shock is consistent with thetimescale for coulomb collisional equilibration and the postshock temperatureis lower than expected for instant shock-heating of the electrons. althoughlike the bullet cluster the electron temperatures behind the upstream shockfront are hotter than expected, favouring the instant heating model, theuncertainty on the temperature values is greater here and there is significantsubstructure complicating the interpretation. we also measured the width ofeach shock front and the contact discontinuity on the leading edge of thesubcluster core to investigate the suppression of transport processes in theicm. the upstream shock is ~440 kpc in length but appears remarkably narrowover this distance with a best-fit width of only 6^{+5}_{-3} kpc compared withthe mean free path of 23+/-5 kpc. the leading edge of the subcluster core isalso narrow with an upper limit on the width of only 2 kpc separating the cool,multiphase gas at 0.5-2 kev from the shock-heated surrounding icm at ~6 kev.the strong suppression of diffusion and conduction across this edge suggests amagnetic draping layer may have formed around the subcluster core.[abridged]

1204.5759	on the hunt for ultramassive black holes in brightest cluster galaxies	we investigate where brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) sit on the fundamentalplane of black hole (bh) activity, an established relation between the x-rayluminosity, the radio luminosity and the mass of a bh. our sample mostlyconsists of bcgs that lie at the centres of massive, strong cooling flowclusters, therefore requiring extreme mechanical feedback from their centralactive galactic nucleus (agn) to offset cooling of the intracluster plasma(l_mech&gt;10^44-45 erg/s). based on the bh masses derived from the m_bh-sigma andm_bh-m_k correlations, we find that all of our objects are offset from theplane such that they appear to be less massive than predicted from their x-rayand radio luminosities (to more than a 99 per cent confidence level). for theseobjects to be consistent with the fundamental plane, the m_bh-sigma andm_bh-m_k correlations therefore seem to underestimate the bh masses of bcgs, onaverage by a factor of 10. our results suggest that the standard relationshipsbetween bh mass and host galaxy properties no longer hold for these extremegalaxies. furthermore, our results imply that if these bhs follow thefundamental plane, then many of those that lie in massive, strong cool coreclusters must be ultramassive with m_bh&gt;10^10m_sun. this rivals the largest bhmasses known and has important ramifications for our understanding of theformation and evolution of bhs.

1205.2373	residual cooling and persistent star formation amid agn feedback in  abell 2597	new chandra x-ray and herschel fir observations enable a multiwavelengthstudy of active galactic nucleus (agn) heating and intracluster medium (icm)cooling in the brightest cluster galaxy of abell 2597. the new chandraobservations reveal the central &lt; 30 kiloparsec x-ray cavity network to be moreextensive than previously thought, and associated with enough enthalpy totheoretically inhibit the inferred classical cooling flow. nevertheless, wepresent new evidence, consistent with previous results, that a moderatelystrong residual cooling flow is persisting at 4%-8% of the classicallypredicted rates in a spatially structured manner amid the feedback-drivenexcavation of the x-ray cavity network. new herschel observations are used toestimate warm and cold dust masses, a lower-limit gas-to-dust ratio, and a starformation rate consistent with previous measurements. the cooling time profileof the ambient x-ray atmosphere is used to map the locations of theobservational star formation entropy threshold as well as the theoreticalthermal instability threshold. both lie just outside the &lt; 30 kpc centralregion permeated by x-ray cavities, and star formation as well as ionized andmolecular gas lie interior to both. the young stars are distributed in anelongated region that is aligned with the radio lobes, and their estimated agesare both younger and older than the x-ray cavity network, suggesting bothjet-triggered as well as persistent star formation over the current agnfeedback episode. bright x-ray knots that are coincident with extended ly-alphaand fuv continuum filaments motivate a discussion of structured cooling fromthe ambient hot atmosphere along a projected axis that is perpendicular tox-ray cavity and radio axis. we conclude that the cooling icm is the dominantcontributor of the cold gas reservoir fueling star formation and agn activityin the abell 2597 bcg.

1205.2374	multiphase signatures of agn feedback in abell 2597	we present new chandra x-ray observations of the brightest cluster galaxy(bcg) in the cool core cluster abell 2597. the data reveal an extensivekpc-scale x-ray cavity network as well as a 15 kpc filament of soft-excess gasexhibiting strong spatial correlation with archival vla radio data. in additionto several possible scenarios, multiwavelength evidence may suggest that thefilament is associated with multiphase (10^3 - 10^7 k) gas that has beenentrained and dredged-up by the propagating radio source. stemming from a fullspectral analysis, we also present profiles and 2d spectral maps of modeledx-ray temperature, entropy, pressure, and metal abundance. the maps reveal anarc of hot gas which in projection borders the inner edge of a large x-raycavity. although limited by strong caveats, we suggest that the hot arc may be(a) due to a compressed rim of cold gas pushed outward by the radio bubble or(b) morphologically and energetically consistent with cavity-driven activegalactic nucleus (agn) heating models invoked to quench cooling flows, in whichthe enthalpy of a buoyant x-ray cavity is locally thermalized as ambient gasrushes to refill its wake. if confirmed, this would be the first observationalevidence for this model.

1205.6818	locuss: a dynamical analysis of x-ray agn in local clusters	we present a study of the distribution of x-ray agn in a representativesample of 26 massive clusters at 0.15&lt;z&lt;0.30, combining chandra observationswith highly complete spectroscopy of cluster members down to m_k*+2. in totalwe identify 48 x-ray agn among the cluster members, with luminosities2x10^41-1x10^44erg/s. in the stacked caustic diagram, the x-ray agn appear topreferentially lie along the caustics, suggestive of an infalling population.they also appear to avoid the region with lowest cluster-centric radii andrelative velocities (r_proj&lt;0.4 r_500; |v-&lt;v&gt;|/sigma_v&lt;0.8), which is dominatedby the virialized population of galaxies accreted earliest into the clusters.moreover the velocity dispersion of the 48 x-ray agn is 1.51x that of theoverall cluster population, which is consistent with the sqrt(2) ratio expectedby simple energetic arguments when comparing infalling versus virializedpopulations. this kinematic segregation is significant at the 4.66-sigma level.when splitting the x-ray agn sample into two according to x-ray or infrared(ir) luminosity, both x-ray bright and ir-bright sub-samples show highervelocity dispersions than their x-ray dim and ir-dim counterparts at &gt;2sigmasignificance. this is consistent with the nuclear activity responsible for thex-ray and ir emission being slowly shut down as the host galaxies are accretedinto the cluster. overall our results provide the strongest observationalevidence to date that x-ray agn found in massive clusters are an infallingpopulation, and that the cluster environment very effectively suppressesradiatively-efficient nuclear activity in its member galaxies. these resultsare consistent with the view that for galaxies to host an x-ray agn they shouldbe the central galaxy within their dark matter halo and have a ready supply ofcold gas.

1206.2294	diffuse radio emission in macs j1752.0+4440	we report the discovery of large-scale diffuse radio emission in the galaxycluster macs j1752.0+4440 (z=0.366). using westerbork synthesis radio telescope(wsrt) observations we find that the cluster hosts a double radio relic systemas well as a 1.65 mpc radio halo covering the region between the two relics.the relics are diametrically located on opposite sides of the cluster center.the ne and sw relics have sizes of 1.3 and 0.9 mpc, respectively. in case of anisolated binary merger event, the relative sizes of the relics suggest a massratio about 2:1. we measure integrated spectra of -1.16 \pm 0.03 for the ne and-1.10 \pm 0.05 for the sw relic. we conclude that this cluster has undergone aviolent binary merger event and the relics are best explained by particles(re)accelerated in outwards traveling shock waves. the spectral indices suggestthe relics trace shock waves with mach numbers (m) of around 3.5 to 4.5. theserelatively high mach numbers derived from the radio spectral index arecomparable to those derived for a few other recently discovered relics. thisimplies that merger shocks with m &gt; 3 are relatively common in clusteroutskirts if our understanding of diffusive shock acceleration is correct.

1206.6102	discovery of radio halos and double-relics in distant macs galaxy  clusters: clues to the efficiency of particle acceleration	we have performed 323 mhz observations with the giant metrewave radiotelescope of the most promising candidates selected from the macs catalog. theaim of the work is to extend our knowledge of the radio halo and relicpopulations to z&gt;0.3, the epoch in which massive clusters formed. inmacsj1149.5+2223 and macsj1752.1+4440, we discovered two double-relic systemswith a radio halo, and in macsj0553.4-3342 we found a radio halo. archival verylarge array observations and westerbork synthesis radio telescope observationshave been used to study the polarization and spectral index properties. theradio halo in macsj1149.5+2223 has the steepest spectrum ever found so far inthese objects (alpha &gt; 2). the double relics in macsj1149.5+2223 are peculiarin their position that is misaligned with the main merger axis. the relics arepolarized up to 30% and 40% in macsj1149.5+2223 and macsj1752.040+44,respectively. in both cases, the magnetic field is roughly aligned with therelics' main axes. the spectra in the relics in macsj1752.040+44 steepentowards the cluster centre, in agreement with model expectations. x-ray data onmacsj0553.4-3342 suggests that this cluster is undergoing a major merger, withthe merger axis close to the plane of the sky. the cores of the disruptedclusters have just passed each other, but no radio relic is detected in thissystem. if turbulence is responsible for the radio emission, we argue that itmust develop before the core passage. a comparison of double relic plus halosystem with cosmological simulations allows a simultaneous estimate of theacceleration efficiencies at shocks (to produce relics) and of turbulence (toproduce the halo).

1211.5604	radiative efficiency, variability and bondi accretion onto massive black  holes: from mechanical to quasar feedback in brightest cluster galaxies	we examine unresolved nuclear x-ray sources in 57 brightest cluster galaxiesto study the relationship between nuclear x-ray emission and accretion ontosupermassive black holes (smbhs). the majority of the clusters in our samplehave prominent x-ray cavities embedded in the surrounding hot atmospheres,which we use to estimate mean jet power and average accretion rate onto thesmbhs over the past several hundred myr. we find that ~50% of the sample havedetectable nuclear x-ray emission. the nuclear x-ray luminosity is correlatedwith average accretion rate determined using x-ray cavities, which isconsistent with the hypothesis that nuclear x-ray emission traces ongoingaccretion. the results imply that jets in systems that have experienced recentagn outbursts, in the last ~10^7yr, are `on' at least half of the time. nuclearx-ray sources become more luminous with respect to the mechanical jet power asthe mean accretion rate rises. we show that nuclear radiation exceeds the jetpower when the mean accretion rate rises above a few percent of the eddingtonrate, where the agn apparently transitions to a quasar. the nuclear x-rayemission from three objects (a2052, hydra a, m84) varies by factors of 2-10 ontimescales of 6 months to 10 years. if variability at this level is a commonphenomenon, it can account for much of the scatter in the relationship betweenmean accretion rate and nuclear x-ray luminosity. we find no significant changein the spectral energy distribution as a function of luminosity in the variableobjects. the relationship between accretion and nuclear x-ray luminosity isconsistent with emission from either a jet, an adaf, or a combination of thetwo, although other origins are possible. we also consider the longstandingproblem of whether jets are powered by the accretion of cold circumnuclear gasor nearly spherical inflows of hot kev gas.[abridged]

1211.5606	the rapid evolution of agn feedback in brightest cluster galaxies:  switching from quasar-mode to radio-mode feedback	we present an analysis of the 2-10 kev x-ray emission associated with theactive galactic nuclei (agns) in brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). our sampleconsists of 32 bcgs that lie in highly x-ray luminous cluster of galaxies(l_x-ray (0.1-2.4 kev) &gt; 3*10^44 erg/s) in which agn-jetted outflows arecreating and sustaining clear xray cavities. our sample covers the redshiftrange 0 &lt; z &lt; 0.6 and reveals strong evolution in the nuclear x-rayluminosities, such that the black holes in these systems have become on averageat least 10 times fainter over the last 5 gyrs. mindful of potential selectioneffects, we propose two possible scenarios to explain our results: 1) eitherthat the agns in bcgs with x-ray cavities are steadily becoming fainter, ormore likely, 2) that the fraction of these bcgs with radiatively efficientnuclei is decreasing with time from roughly 60 per cent at z=0.6 to 30 per centat z=0.1. based on this strong evolution, we predict that a significantfraction of bcgs in z=1 clusters may host quasars at their centres, potentiallycomplicating the search for such clusters at high redshift. in analogy withblack-hole binaries and based on the observed eddington ratios of our sources,we further propose that the evolving agn population in bcgs with x-ray cavitiesmay be transiting from a canonical low/hard state, analogous to that of x-raybinaries, to a quiescent state over the last 5 gyrs.

1211.6722	the nature of filamentary cold gas in the core of the virgo cluster	we present a multi-wavelength study of the emission-line nebulae locatedsoutheast of the nucleus of m87, the central dominant galaxy of the virgocluster. we report the detection of far-infrared (fir) [cii] line emission fromthe nebulae using observations made with herschel pacs. the infrared lineemission is extended and cospatial with optical h{\alpha}+[nii],far-ultraviolet civ lines, and soft x-ray emission. the filamentary nebulaeevidently contain multi-phase material spanning a temperature range of at least5 orders of magnitude, from ~100 k to ~10^7 k. this material has most likelybeen uplifted by the agn from the center of m87. the thermal pressure of the10^4 k phase appears to be significantly lower than that of the surrounding hotintra-cluster medium (icm) indicating the presence of additional turbulent andmagnetic pressure in the filaments. if the turbulence in the filaments issubsonic then the magnetic field strength required to balance the pressure ofthe surrounding icm is b~30-70 {\mu}g. the spectral properties of the softx-ray emission from the filaments indicate that it is due to thermal plasmawith kt~0.5-1 kev, which is cooling by mixing with the cold gas and/orradiatively. charge exchange can be ruled out as a significant source of softx-rays. both cooling and mixing scenarios predict gas with a range oftemperatures. this is at first glance inconsistent with the apparent lack ofx-ray emitting gas with kt&lt;0.5 kev. however, we show that the missing very softx-ray emission could be absorbed by the cold gas in the filaments with anintegrated hydrogen column density of ~1.6x10^21 cm^-2, providing a naturalexplanation for the apparent temperature floor to the x-ray emission at kt~0.5kev. the fir through ultra-violet line emission is most likely primarilypowered by the icm particles penetrating the cold gas following a shearinginduced mixing process.

1305.3926	cold fronts and metal anisotropies in the x-ray cool core of the galaxy  cluster zw1742+3306	(context) in recent years, our understanding of the cool cores of galaxyclusters has changed. once thought to be relatively simple places where gascools and flows toward the centre, now they are believed to be very dynamicplaces where heating from the central active galactic nucleus (agn) andcooling, as inferred from active star formation, molecular gas, and halphanebulosity, find an uneasy energetic balance. (aims) we want to characterizethe x-ray properties of the nearby cool-core cluster zw1742+3306, selectedbecause it is bright at x-ray (with a flux greater than 1e-11 erg/s/cm2 in the0.1-2.4 kev band) and halpha wavelengths (halpha luminosity &gt; 1e40 erg/s).(methods) we used chandra data to analyze the spatial and spectral propertiesof the cool core of zw1742+3306, a galaxy cluster at z=0.0757 that emits inhalpha and presents the brightest central galaxy located in a diffuse x-rayemission with multiple peaks in surface brightness. (results) we show that thex-ray cool core of the galaxy cluster zw1742+3306 is thermodynamically veryactive with evidence of cold fronts and a weak shock in the surface brightnessmap and of an apparently coherent, elongated structure with metallicity greaterthan the value measured in the surrounding ambient gas by about 50 per cent.this anisotropic structure is 280 x 90 kpc2 and is aligned with the cold frontsand with the x-ray emission on larger scales. we suggest that all thesepeculiarities in the x-ray emission of zw1742+3306 are either a very fine-tunedoutput of a sloshing gas in the cluster core or the product of a metal-richoutflow from the central agn.

1306.2323	the hot and energetic universe: agn feedback in galaxy clusters and  groups	mechanical feedback via active galactic nuclei (agn) jets in the centres ofgalaxy groups and clusters is a crucial ingredient in current models of galaxyformation and cluster evolution. jet feedback is believed to regulate gascooling and thus star formation in the most massive galaxies, but a robustphysical understanding of this feedback mode is currently lacking. the largecollecting area, excellent spectral resolution and high spatial resolution ofathena+ will provide the breakthrough diagnostic ability necessary to developthis understanding, via: (1) the first kinematic measurements on relevantspatial scales of the hot gas in galaxy, group and cluster haloes as it absorbsthe impact of agn jets, and (2) vastly improved ability to map thermodynamicconditions on scales well-matched to the jets, lobes and gas disturbancesproduced by them. athena+ will therefore determine for the first time how jetenergy is dissipated and distributed in group and cluster gas, and how afeedback loop operates in group/cluster cores to regulate gas cooling and agnfuelling. athena+ will also establish firmly the cumulative impact of powerfulradio galaxies on the evolution of baryons from the epoch of group/clusterformation to the present day.

1306.5752	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): witnessing the assembly of the cluster  abell 1882	we present a combined optical and x-ray analysis of the rich cluster abell1882 with the aim of identifying merging substructure and understanding therecent assembly history of this system. our optical data consist of spectradrawn from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey, which lends itself tothis kind of detailed study thanks to its depth and high spectroscopiccompleteness. we use 283 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members to detectand characterize substructure. we complement the optical data with x-ray datataken with both chandra and xmm. our analysis reveals that a1882 harbors twomain components, a1882a and a1882b, which have a projected separation of 2mpcand a line of sight velocity difference of v_{los}=-428km/s. the primarysystem, a1882a, has velocity dispersion sigma_v=500km/s and chandra (xmm)temperature kt=3.57kev (3.31kev) while the secondary, a1882b, hassigma_v=457km/s and chandra (xmm) temperature kt=2.39kev (2.12kev). the opticaland x-ray estimates for the masses of the two systems are consistent within theuncertainties and indicate that there is twice as much mass in a1882a(m_{500}=1.5-1.9x10^{14}msolar) when compared with a1882b(m_{500}=0.8-1.0x10^{14}msolar). we interpret the a1882a/a1882b system as beingobserved prior to a core passage. supporting this interpretation is the largeprojected separation of a1882a and a1882b and the dearth of evidence for arecent (&lt;2gyr) major interaction in the x-ray data. two-body analyses indicatethat a1882a and a1882b form a bound system with bound incoming solutionsstrongly favored. we compute blue fractions of f_b=0.28 and 0.18 for thespectroscopically confirmed member galaxies within r_{500} of the centers ofa1882a and a1882b, respectively. these blue fractions do not differsignificantly from the blue fraction measured from an ensemble of 20 clusterswith similar mass and redshift.

1309.0014	massive molecular gas flows in the abell 1664 brightest cluster galaxy	we report alma early science co(1-0) and co(3-2) observations of thebrightest cluster galaxy (bcg) in abell 1664. the bcg contains 1.1x10^{10}solar masses of molecular gas divided roughly equally between two distinctvelocity systems: one from -250 to +250 km/s centred on the bcg's systemicvelocity and a high velocity system blueshifted by 570 km/s with respect to thesystemic velocity. the bcg's systemic component shows a smooth velocitygradient across the bcg center with velocity proportional to radius suggestiveof solid body rotation about the nucleus. however, the mass and velocitystructure are highly asymmetric and there is little star formation coincidentwith a putative disk. it may be an inflow of gas that will settle into a diskover several 10^8 yr. the high velocity system consists of two gas clumps, each~2 kpc across, located to the north and southeast of the nucleus. each has aline of sight velocity spread of 250-300 km/s. the velocity of the gas in thehigh velocity system tends to increase towards the bcg center and could signifya massive high velocity flow onto the nucleus. however, the velocity gradientis not smooth and these structures are also coincident with low optical-uvsurface brightness regions, which could indicate dust extinction associatedwith each clump. if so, the high velocity gas would be projected in front ofthe bcg and moving toward us along the line of sight in a massive outflow mostlikely driven by the agn. a merger origin is unlikely but cannot be ruled out.

1309.5952	13co and c18o emission from a dense gas disk at z=2.3: abundance  variations, cosmic rays and the initial conditions for star formation	we analyse the sleds of 13co and c18o for the j=1-0 up to j=7-6 transitionsin the gravitationally lensed ultraluminous infrared galaxy smmj2135-0102 atz=2.3. this is the first detection of 13co and c18o in a high-redshiftstar-forming galaxy. these data comprise observations of six transitions takenwith pdbi and we combine these with 33ghz jvla data and our previous 12co andcontinuum emission information to better constrain the properties of the ismwithin this system. we study both the velocity-integrated and kinematicallydecomposed properties of the galaxy and coupled with an lvg model we find thatthe star-forming regions in the system vary in their cold gas properties. wefind strong c18o emission both in the velocity-integrated emission and in thetwo kinematic components at the periphery of the system, where the c18o lineflux is equivalent to or higher than the 13co. we derive an averagevelocity-integrated flux ratio of 13co/c18o~1 suggesting a [13co]/[c18o]abundance ratio at least 7x lower than that in the milky way. this may suggestenhanced c18o abundance, perhaps indicating star formation preferentiallybiased to high-mass stars. we estimate the relative contribution to the ismheating from cosmic rays and uv of (30-3300)x10^(-25)erg/s and 45x10^(-25)erg/sper h2 molecule respectively and both are comparable to the total cooling rateof (0.8-20)x10^(-25)erg/s from the co. however, our lvg models indicate high(&gt;100k) temperatures and densities (&gt;10^(3))cm^(-3) in the ism which maysuggest that cosmic rays play a more important role than uv heating in thissystem. if cosmic rays dominate the heating of the ism, the increasedtemperature in the star forming regions may favour the formation of massivestars and so explain the enhanced c18o abundance. this is a potentiallyimportant result for a system which may evolve into a local elliptical galaxy.

1310.4501	cold gas dynamics in hydra-a: evidence for a rotating disk	we present multi-frequency observations of the radio galaxy hydra-a (3c218)located in the core of a massive, x-ray luminous galaxy cluster. ifuspectroscopy is used to trace the kinematics of the ionised and warm molecularhydrogen which are consistent with a ~ 5 kpc rotating disc. broad,double-peaked lines of co(2-1), [cii]157 $\mu$m and [oi]63 $\mu$m are detected.we estimate the mass of the cold gas within the disc to be m$_{gas}$ = 2.3$\pm$ 0.3 x 10$^9$ m$_{\odot}$. these observations demonstrate that the complexline profiles found in the cold atomic and molecular gas are related to therotating disc or ring of gas. finally, an hst image of the galaxy shows thatthis gas disc contains a substantial mass of dust. the large gas mass, sfr andkinematics are consistent with the levels of gas cooling from the icm. weconclude that the cold gas originates from the continual quiescent accumulationof cooled icm gas. the rotation is in a plane perpendicular to the projectedorientation of the radio jets and icm cavities hinting at a possible connectionbetween the kpc-scale cooling gas and the accretion of material onto the blackhole. we discuss the implications of these observations for models of coldaccretion, agn feedback and cooling flows.

1310.5450	the origin of cold gas in giant elliptical galaxies and its role in  fueling radio-mode agn feedback	we present a multi-wavelength study of the interstellar medium in eightnearby, x-ray and optically bright, giant elliptical galaxies. using herschelpacs, we map the cold gas in the lines of [cii], [oi], and [oib]. additionally,we present ha+[nii] imaging of warm ionized gas with the soar telescope, and astudy of the hot x-ray emitting plasma with chandra. all systems with extendedha emission in our sample (6/8 galaxies) display significant [cii] lineemission indicating the presence of cold gas. this emission is co-spatial withthe ha+[nii] emitting nebulae and the lowest entropy x-ray emitting plasma. theentropy profiles of the hot galactic atmospheres show a clear dichotomy, withthe systems displaying extended emission line nebulae having lower entropiesbeyond r~1 kpc than the cold-gas-poor systems. we show that while the hotatmospheres of the cold-gas-poor galaxies are thermally stable outside of theirinnermost cores, the atmospheres of the cold-gas-rich systems are prone tocooling instabilities. this result indicates that the cold gas is producedchiefly by thermally unstable cooling from the hot phase. we show that coolinginstabilities may develop more easily in rotating systems and discuss analternative condition for thermal instability for this case. the hotatmospheres of cold-gas-rich galaxies display disturbed morphologies indicatingthat the accretion of clumpy multiphase gas in these systems may result invariable power output of the agn jets, potentially triggering sporadic, largeroutbursts. in the two cold-gas-poor, x-ray morphologically relaxed galaxies ofour sample, ngc 1399 and ngc 4472, powerful agn outbursts may have destroyed orremoved most of the cold gas from the cores, allowing the jets to propagate anddeposit most of their energy further out, increasing the entropy of the hotgalactic atmospheres and leaving their cores relatively undisturbed.

1402.4139	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): testing galaxy formation models through  the most massive galaxies in the universe	we have analysed the growth of brightest group galaxies and brightest clustergalaxies (bggs/bcgs) over the last 3 billion years using a large sample of 883galaxies from the galaxy and mass assembly survey. by comparing the stellarmass of bggs and bcgs in groups and clusters of similar dynamical masses, wefind no significant growth between redshift $z=0.27$ and $z=0.09$. we alsoexamine the number of bggs/bcgs that have line emission, finding thatapproximately 65 per cent of bggs/bcgs show h$\alpha$ in emission. from thegalaxies where the necessary spectroscopic lines were accurately recovered (54per cent of the sample), we find that half of this (i.e. 27 per cent of thesample) harbour on-going star formation with rates up to$10\,$m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, and the other half (i.e. 27 per cent of the sample)have an active nucleus (agn) at the centre. bggs are more likely to haveongoing star formation, while bcgs show a higher fraction of agn activity. byexamining the position of the bggs/bcgs with respect to their host dark matterhalo we find that around 13 per cent of them do not lie at the centre of thedark matter halo. this could be an indicator of recent cluster-cluster mergers.we conclude that bggs and bcgs acquired their stellar mass rapidly at higherredshifts as predicted by semi-analytic models, mildly slowing down at lowredshifts.

1405.3647	a non-thermal study of the brightest cluster galaxy ngc 1275 - the  gamma-radio connection over four decades	emission from the active nucleus in the core of the brightest cluster galaxyof the perseus cluster, ngc 1275, has varied dramatically over the past fourdecades. prompted by the fermi detection of flaring in the gamma-ray band, wepresent the recent increased activity of this source in the context of its pastradio and gamma-ray output. the broad correspondence between the high-frequencyradio data and the high-energy (he) emission is striking. however, on shorttimescales this correlation breaks down and the 1.3 mm submillimeter array fluxis apparently unaffected during fermi-detected flaring activity. the fact thatngc 1275 is also detected at tev energies during the periods of he gamma-rayflaring suggests that the short-timescale variation might be primarily relatedto changes in the inverse compton scattering of photons by the electronpopulation in the jet. the longer-timescale changes suggest a 30--40 yearvariation in the fuelling of the black hole, that affects the power of theinner jet. ncg 1275 is a laboratory for the class of brightest clustergalaxies, and its variability on these timescales has implications for ourunderstanding of massive galaxies in cooling-core clusters. the case of ngc1275 highlights the need for wide coverage across the radio band to correctlyaccount for the contribution to emission from a synchrotron self-absorbed core(for example when considering contamination of sunyaev-zel'dovich effectobservations), and the danger of variability biases in radio surveys ofgalaxies.

1411.5025	the scuba-2 cosmology legacy survey: alma resolves the rest-frame  far-infrared emission of sub-millimeter galaxies	we present high-resolution (0.3'') alma 870um imaging of 52 sub-millimetergalaxies (smgs) in the ultra deep survey (uds) field and investigate the sizeand morphology of the sub-millimeter (sub-mm) emission on 2-10kpc scales. wederive a median intrinsic angular size of fwhm=0.30$\pm$0.04'' for the 23 smgsin the sample detected at a signal-to-noise ratio (snr) &gt;10. using thephotometric redshifts of the smgs we show that this corresponds to a medianphysical half-light diameter of 2.4$\pm$0.2kpc. a stacking analysis of the smgsdetected at an snr &lt;10 shows they have sizes consistent with the 870um-brightsmgs in the sample. we compare our results to the sizes of smgs derived fromother multi-wavelength studies, and show that the rest-frame ~250um sizes ofsmgs are consistent with studies of resolved 12co (j=3-2 to 7-6) emissionlines, but that sizes derived from 1.4ghz imaging appear to be approximatelytwo times larger on average, which we attribute to cosmic ray diffusion. therest-frame optical sizes of smgs are around four times larger than thesub-millimeter sizes, indicating that the star formation in these galaxies iscompact relative to the pre-existing stellar distribution. the size of thestarburst region in smgs is consistent with the majority of the star formationoccurring in a central region, a few kpc in extent, with a median starformation rate surface density of 90$\pm$30msol/yr/kpc$^2$, which may suggestthat we are witnessing an intense period of bulge growth in these galaxies.

1412.0668	an alma survey of submillimeter galaxies in the extended chandra deep  field south: near-infrared morphologies and stellar sizes	we analyse hst wfc3/$h_{160}$-band observations of a sample of 48alma-detected submillimeter galaxies (smgs) in the extended chandra deep fieldsouth field, to study their stellar morphologies and sizes. we detect79$\pm$17% of the smgs in the $h_{160}$-band imaging with a median sensitivityof 27.8 mag, and most (80%) of the non-detections are smgs with 870$\mu$mfluxes of $s_{870} &lt; $3 mjy. with a surface brightness limit of $\mu_h \sim $26mag arcsec$^{-2}$, we find that 82$\pm$9% of the $h_{160}$-band detected smgsat $z =$ 1-3 appear to have disturbed morphologies, meaning they are visuallyclassified as either irregulars or interacting systems, or both. by determininga s\'ersic fit to the $h_{160}$ surface-brightness profiles we derive a medians\'ersic index of $n = $1.2$\pm$0.3 and a median half-light radius of $r_e =$4.4$^{+1.1}_{-0.5}$ kpc for our smgs at $z = $1-3. we also find significantdisplacements between the positions of the $h_{160}$-component and 870$\mu$memission in these systems, suggesting that the dusty star-burst regions andless-obscured stellar distribution are not co-located. we find significantdifferences in the sizes and the s\'ersic index between our $z = $2-3 smgs and$z \sim $2 quiescent galaxies, suggesting a major transformation of the stellarlight profile is needed in the quenching processes if smgs are progenitors ofthe red-and-dead $z\sim$2 galaxies. given the short-lived nature of smgs, wepostulate that the majority of the $z = $2-3 smgs with $s_{870} \gtrsim $2 mjyare early/mid-stage major mergers.

0804.2113	cold gas in the perseus cluster core: excitation of molecular gas in  filaments	we have recently detected co lines in the well-known filaments around ngc1275, the galaxy at the centre of the perseus cluster of galaxies. theseprevious observations, with the hera multi-beam array at the iram 30m telescopeenabled us to make a large map of the co(2-1) line and to see hints ofmolecular gas far away from the cluster centre. to confirm the presence of coemission lines in the outer filaments and to study the co(2-1)/co(1-0) lineratio, we observed seven regions of interest again with the 30m telescope inboth co(1-0) and co(2-1). the regions we observed were: the eastern filament,the horseshoe, the northern filament and a southern extension, all selectedfrom halpha emission line mapping. molecular gas is detected in all theobserved regions. this result confirms the large extent of the cold moleculargas filaments. we discuss the co(2-1)/co(1-0) ratios in the filaments. theeastern filament has optically thick gas, whereas further away, the line ratioincreases close to values expected for a warmer optically thin medium. we alsoshow co(1-0) and co(2-1) lines in 9 regions closer to the centre. thekinematics of the co is studied here in more detail and confirms that itfollows the motions of the warm h_2 gas found in the near-infrared. finally, wesearched for dense gas tracers around 3c84 and claim here the first detectionof hcn(3-2).

1503.07873	resolved spectroscopy of gravitationally lensed galaxies: global  dynamics and star-forming clumps on ~100pc scales	we present adaptive optics-assisted integral field spectroscopy around the haor hb lines of 12 gravitationally lensed galaxies obtained with vlt/sinfoni,keck/osiris and gemini/nifs. we combine these data with previous observationsand investigate the dynamics and star formation properties of 17 lensedgalaxies at z = 1-4. thanks to gravitational magnification of 1.4 - 90x byforeground clusters, effective spatial resolutions of 40 - 700 pc are achieved.the magnification also allows us to probe lower star formation rates andstellar masses than unlensed samples; our target galaxies featuredust-corrected sfrs derived from ha or hb emission of 0.8 - 40msol/yr, andstellar masses m* ~ 4e8 - 6e10 msol. all of the galaxies have velocitygradients, with 59% consistent with being rotating discs and a likely mergerfraction of 29%, with the remaining 12% classed as 'undetermined.' we extract50 star-forming clumps with sizes in the range 60pc - 1kpc from the ha (or hb)maps, and find that their surface brightnesses and their characteristicluminosities evolve to higher luminosities with redshift. we show that thisevolution can be described by fragmentation on larger scales in gas-rich discs,and is likely to be driven by evolving gas fractions.

1506.04747	early science with the large millimeter telescope: observations of dust  continuum and co emission lines of cluster-lensed submillimetre galaxies at  z=2.0-4.7	we present early science observations with the large millimeter telescope,aztec 1.1 mm continuum images and wide bandwidth spectra (73-111 ghz) acquiredwith the redshift search receiver, towards four bright lensed submillimetregalaxies identified through the herschel lensing survey-snapshot and thescuba-2 cluster snapshot survey. this pilot project studies the star formationhistory and the physical properties of the molecular gas and dust content ofthe highest redshift galaxies identified through the benefits of gravitationalmagnification. we robustly detect dust continuum emission for the full sampleand co emission lines for three of the targets. we find that one source showsspectroscopic multiplicity and is a blend of three galaxies at differentredshifts (z=2.040, 3.252 and 4.680), reminiscent of previous high-resolutionimaging follow-up of unlensed submillimetre galaxies, but with a completelydifferent search method, that confirm recent theoretical predictions ofphysically unassociated blended galaxies. identifying the detected lines as12co (j_up=2-5) we derive spectroscopic redshifts, molecular gas masses, anddust masses from the continuum emission. the mean h_2 gas mass of the fullsample is (2.0 +- 0.2) x 10^11 m_sun/\mu, and the mean dust mass is (2.0+-0.2)x 10^9 m_sun/\mu, where \mu=2-5 is the expected lens amplification. using theseindependent estimations we infer a gas-to-dust ratio of \delta_gdr=55-75, inagreement with other measurements of submillimetre galaxies. our magnifiedhigh-luminosity galaxies fall on the same locus as other high-redshiftsubmillimetre galaxies, extending the l'_co - l_fir correlation observed forlocal luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies to higher fir and columinosities.

1507.03019	a comprehensive study of the radio properties of brightest cluster  galaxies	we examine the radio properties of the brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) in alarge sample of x-ray selected galaxy clusters comprising the brightest clustersample (bcs), the extended bcs (ebcs) and rosat-eso flux limited x-ray (reflex)cluster catalogues. we have multi-frequency radio observations of the bcg usinga variety of data from the australia telescope compact array (atca), janskyvery large array (vla) and very long baseline array (vlba) telescopes. theradio spectral energy distributions (seds) of these objects are decomposed intoa component attributed to on-going accretion by the active galactic nuclei(agn) that we refer to as the 'core', and a more diffuse, ageing component werefer to as the 'non-core'. these bcgs are matched to previous studies todetermine whether they exhibit emission lines (principally h-alpha), indicativeof the presence of a strong cooling cluster core. we consider how the radioproperties of the bcgs vary with cluster environmental factors. line emittingbcgs are shown to generally host more powerful radio sources, exhibiting thepresence of a strong, distinguishable core component in about 60% of cases.this core component more strongly correlates with the bcg's [oiii]5007a lineemission. for bcgs in line-emitting clusters, the x-ray cavity power correlateswith both the extended and core radio emission, suggestive of steady fuellingof the agn over bubble-rise time-scales in these clusters.

1507.03022	high radio frequency properties and variability of brightest cluster  galaxies	we consider the high radio frequency (15 ghz - 353 ghz) properties andvariability of 35 brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs). these are the mostcore-dominated sources drawn from a parent sample of more than 700 x-rayselected clusters, thus allowing us to relate our results to the generalpopulation. we find that &gt;6.0% of our parent sample (&gt;15.1% if only cool-coreclusters are considered) contain a radio-source at 150 ghz of at least 3mjy(~1x10^23 w/hz at our median redshift of z~0.13). furthermore, &gt;3.4% of thebcgs in our parent sample contain a peaked component (gigahertz peakedspectrum, gps) in their spectra that peaks above 2 ghz, increasing to &gt;8.5% ifonly cool-core clusters are considered. we see little evidence for strongvariability at 15 ghz on short (week-month) time-scales although we seevariations greater than 20% at 150 ghz over 6-month times-frames for 4 of the23 sources with multi-epoch observations. much more prevalent is long-term(year-decade time-scale) variability, with average annual amplitude variationsgreater than 1% at 15 ghz being commonplace. there is a weak trend towardshigher variability as the peak of the gps-like component occurs at higherfrequency. we demonstrate the complexity that is seen in the radio spectra ofbcgs and discuss the potentially significant implications of these high-peakingcomponents for sunyaev-zel'dovich cluster searches.

1508.01505	dynamical analysis of galaxy cluster merger abell 2146	we present a dynamical analysis of the merging galaxy cluster system abell2146 using spectroscopy obtained with the gemini multi-object spectrograph onthe gemini north telescope. as revealed by the chandra x-ray observatory, thesystem is undergoing a major merger and has a gas structure indicative of arecent first core passage. the system presents two large shock fronts, makingit unique amongst these rare systems. the hot gas structure indicates that themerger axis must be close to the plane of the sky and that the two mergingclusters are relatively close in mass, from the observation of two shockfronts. using 63 spectroscopically determined cluster members, we apply variousstatistical tests to establish the presence of two distinct massive structures.with the caveat that the system has recently undergone a major merger, thevirial mass estimate is m_vir = 8.5 +4.3 -4.7 x 10 ^14 m_sol for the wholesystem, consistent with the mass determination in a previous study using thesunyaev-zeldovich signal. the newly calculated redshift for the system is z =0.2323. a two-body dynamical model gives an angle of 13-19 degrees between themerger axis and the plane of the sky, and a timescale after first core passageof 0.24-0.28 gyr.

1508.05941	deep chandra, hst-cos, and megacam observations of the phoenix cluster:  extreme star formation and agn feedback on hundred kiloparsec scales	we present new ultraviolet, optical, and x-ray data on the phoenix galaxycluster (spt-clj2344-4243). deep optical imaging reveals previously-undetectedfilaments of star formation, extending to radii of ~50-100 kpc in multipledirections. combined uv-optical spectroscopy of the central galaxy reveals amassive (2x10^9 msun)), young (~4.5 myr) population of stars, consistent with atime-averaged star formation rate of 610 +/- 50 msun/yr. we report a strongdetection of ovi(1032,1038) which appears to originate primarily inshock-heated gas, but may contain a substantial contribution (&gt;1000 msun/yr)from the cooling intracluster medium. we confirm the presence of deep x-raycavities in the inner ~10 kpc, which are amongst the most extreme examples ofradio-mode feedback detected to date, implying jet powers of 2-7 x10^45 erg/s.we provide evidence that the agn inflating these cavities may have onlyrecently transitioned from "quasar-mode" to "radio-mode", and may currently beinsufficient to completely offset cooling. a model-subtracted residual x-rayimage reveals evidence for prior episodes of strong radio-mode feedback atradii of ~100 kpc, with extended "ghost" cavities indicating a prior epoch offeedback roughly 100 myr ago. this residual image also exhibits significantasymmetry in the inner ~200 kpc (0.15r500), reminiscent of infalling coolclouds, either due to minor mergers or fragmentation of the cooling icm. takentogether, these data reveal a rapidly evolving cool core which is rich withstructure (both spatially and in temperature), is subject to a variety ofhighly energetic processes, and yet is cooling rapidly and forming stars alongthin, narrow filaments.

astro-ph;0003191	the rosat brightest cluster sample (bcs) - iv. the extended sample	we present a low-flux extension of the x-ray selected rosat brightest clustersample (bcs) published in paper i of this series. like the original bcs andemploying an identical selection procedure, the bcs extension is compiled fromrosat all-sky survey (rass) data in the northern hemisphere (dec &gt; 0 deg) andat high galactic latitudes (|b| &gt; 20 deg). it comprises 100 x-ray selectedclusters of galaxies with measured redshifts z &lt; 0.3 (as well as seven more atz &gt; 0.3) and total fluxes between 2.8 x 10-12 erg cm-2 s-1 and 4.4 x 10-12 ergcm-2 s-1 in the 0.1-2.4 kev band (the latter value being the flux limit of theoriginal bcs). the extension can be combined with the main sample published in1998 to form the homogeneously selected extended bcs (ebcs), the largest andstatistically best understood cluster sample to emerge from the rosat all-skysurvey to date.  the nominal completeness of the combined sample (defined with respect to apower law fit to the bright end of the bcs log n-log s distribution) isrelatively low at 75 per cent (compared to 90 per cent for the high-flux sampleof paper i). however, just as for the original bcs, this incompleteness can beaccurately quantified, and thus statistically corrected for, as a function ofx-ray luminosity and redshift.  in addition to its importance for improved statistical studies of theproperties of clusters in the local universe, the low-flux extension of the bcsis also intended to serve as a finding list for x-ray bright clusters in thenorthern hemisphere which we hope will prove useful in the preparation ofcluster observations with the next generation of x-ray telescopes such aschandra or xmm-newton.

astro-ph;0007223	molecular hydrogen emission in cygnus a	we present j, h and k-band spectroscopy of cygnus a, spanning 1.0-2.4 micronin the rest-frame and hence several rovibrational h2, h recombination and[feii] emission lines. the lines are spatially extended by up to 6kpc from thenucleus, but their distinct kinematics indicate that the three groups (h, h2and [feii]) are not wholly produced in the same gas. the broadest line,[feii]1.644, exhibits a non-gaussian profile with a broad base (fwhm=1040km/s), perhaps due to interaction with the radio source. extinctions to theline-emitting regions substantially exceed earlier measurements based onoptical h recombination lines.  hard x-rays from the quasar nucleus are likely to dominate the excitation ofthe h2 emission. the results of maloney, hollenbach and tielens (1996) are thusused to infer the total mass of gas in h2 v=1-0 s(1)-emitting clouds as afunction of radius, for gas densities of 10^3 and 10^5 cm^-3, and stoppingcolumn densities n_h=10^22-10^24 cm^-2. assuming azimuthal symmetry, at least2.3e8 msun of such material is present within 5kpc of the nucleus, if theline-emitting clouds see an unobscured quasar spectrum. alternatively, if thebulk of the x-ray absorption to the nucleus inferred by ueno et al. (1994)arises in a circumnuclear torus, the implied gas mass rises to 10^10 msun. thelatter plausibly accounts for 10^9 yr of mass deposition from the clustercooling flow, for which mdot \simeq 10 msun/yr within this radius.

astro-ph;0007348	a simluated tcdm cosmology cluster catalogue: the nfw profile and the  temperature-mass scaling relations	we have extracted over 400 clusters, covering more than 2 decades in mass,from three simulations of the tcdm cosmology. this represents the largest,uniform catalogue of simulated clusters ever produced. the clusters exhibit awide variety of density-profiles. only a minority are well-fit in their outerregions by the widely used density profile of navarro, frenk &amp; white (1977).others have steeper outer density profiles, show sharp breaks in their densityprofiles, or have significant substructure. if we force a fit to the nfwprofile, then the best-fit concentrations decline with increasing mass, butthis is driven primarily by an increase in substructure as one moves to highermasses. the measured temperature-mass relations for properties measured withina sphere enclosing a fixed overdensity all follow the self-similar form,t\propto m^{2/3}, however the normalisation is lower than in observed clusters.the temperature-mass relations for properties measured within a fixed physicalradius are significantly steeper then this. both can be accurately predictedusing the nfw model.

astro-ph;0009101	macs: a quest for the most massive galaxy clusters in the universe	we describe the design and current status of a new x-ray cluster survey aimedat the compilation of a statistically complete sample of very x-ray luminous(and thus, by inference, massive), distant clusters of galaxies. the primarygoal of the massive cluster survey (macs) is to increase the number of knownmassive clusters at z&gt;0.3 from a handful to hundreds. upon completion of thesurvey, the macs cluster sample will greatly improve our ability to studyquantitatively the physical and cosmological parameters driving clusterevolution at redshifts and luminosities poorly sampled by all existing surveys.  to achieve these goals we apply an x-ray flux and x-ray hardness-ratio cut toselect distant cluster candidates from the rosat bright source catalogue.starting from a list of more than 5,000 x-ray sources within the survey area of22,735 square degrees we use positional cross-correlations with publiccatalogues of galactic and extragalactic objects, reference to apm colours,visual inspection of digitized sky survey images, extensive ccd imaging, andfinally spectroscopic observations with the university of hawaii's 2.2m and thekeck 10m telescopes to compile the final cluster sample.  we discuss in detail the x-ray selection procedure and the resultingselection function, and present model predictions for the number of distantclusters expected to emerge from macs. at the time of this writing the macscluster sample comprises 101 spectroscopically confirmed clusters at 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.6;more than two thirds of these are new discoveries. our preliminary sample isalready 15 times larger than that of the emss in the same redshift and x-rayluminosity range.

astro-ph;0106225	the detection of molecular gas in the central galaxies of cooling-flow  clusters	we present the detections of co line emission in the central galaxy ofsixteen extreme cooling flow clusters using the iram 30m and the jcmt 15m.these detections of co(1-0), co(2-1), co(3-2) and co(4-3) are consistent withthe presence of a substantial mass of warm molecular gas (10^9-11.5mo) within50kpc radius of the central galaxy. we present limits on thirteen othergalaxies in similarly extreme cooling flow clusters. these results areconsistent with the presence of a massive starburst in the central galaxy whichwarms a population of cold gas clouds producing both optical and nir emissionlines and significant co line emission. curiously, our co detections arerestricted to the lower radio power central galaxies. these are the firstdetections of molecular gas in a cooling flow other than ngc1275 in the perseuscluster. as four of our targets have firm limits on their dust mass from scubaand the rest have crude limits from iras, we can calculate gas-to-dust ratios.simple analysis indicates that the best secondary indicatorof molecular gas isoptical line luminosity. we review the implications of these results and theprospects for observations in the near future.

astro-ph;0206382	exciting molecular hydrogen in the central galaxies of cooling flows	the origin of rovibrational h_2 emission in the central galaxies of coolingflow clusters is poorly understood. here we address this issue using data fromour near-infrared spectroscopic survey of 32 of the most line luminous suchsystems, presented in the companion paper by edge et al. (2002).  we consider excitation by x-rays from the surrounding intracluster medium, uvradiation from young stars, and shocks. the v=1-0 k-band lines with upperlevels within 10^4 k of the ground state appear to be mostly thermalised(implying gas densities above ~10^5 cm^-3), with excitation temperaturestypically exceeding 2000k, as found earlier by jaffe, bremer and van der werf(2001). together with the lack of strong v=2-0 lines in the h-band, this rulesout uv fluorescence.  using the cloudy photoionisation code, we deduce that the h_2 lines canoriginate in a population of dense clouds, exposed to the same hot (t~50000k)stellar continuum as the lower density gas which produces the bulk of theforbidden optical line emission in the h-alpha luminous systems. this dense gasmay be in the form of self-gravitating clouds deposited directly by the coolingflow, or may instead be produced in the high-pressure zones behind strongshocks. furthermore, the shocked gas is likely to be gravitationally unstable,so collisions between the larger clouds may lead to the formation of globularclusters.

astro-ph;0208254	the peculiar cooling flow cluster rx j0820.9+0752	(abridged) we present observations of the cluster of galaxies associated withthe x-ray source rx j0820.9+0752 and its dramatic central cluster galaxy (ccg)in the optical and x-ray wavebands.unlike other cooling flow ccgs studied indetail, this system does not contain a powerful radio source at its core, andso provides us with an important example where we expect to see only theprocesses directly due to the cooling flow itself. chandra observations showthat the hot intracluster gas is cooling, dropping below 1.8 kev in the core.optical images (aat and hst) show that the central galaxy is embedded in aluminous line-emitting nebula that coincides spatially with an excess of x-rayemission, and separate, off-nucleus clumps of blue continuum that form part ofa patchy structure arcing away from the main galaxy. the x-ray/h-alpha featureis reminiscent of a filament observed in a 1795 which is suggested to be acooling wake, produced by the motion of the ccg through the icm. we presentoptical spectra of the ccg and its surroundings, and find that the continuumblobs show poperties clearly distinct from those of the surrounding nebula.accounting for the strong intrinsic reddening and its significant variationover the extent of the line emitting region, we have fit the continuum spectraof the blobs and the nucleus using stellar spectra. we found that continuumemission from early main sequence stars can account for the blue excess lightin the blobs. kinematical properties associate the gas in the system with anearby galaxy, suggesting some kind of tidal interaction between the two. wesuggest that the secondary galaxy has moved through the cooling wake producedby the ccg, dragging some of the gas out of the wake and triggering thestarbursts found in the blobs.

astro-ph;0210054	chandra observations of the galaxy cluster a478: the interaction of hot  gas and radio plasma in the core, and an improved determination of the  compton y-parameter	we present the results from a 42 ks \chandra acis observation of the galaxycluster a478. this cluster is generally considered to be highly relaxed. the\chandra image reveals, for the first time, x-ray cavities in the hot gaswithin the central 15 kpc radius of a478. two weak and small ($\sim$ 4 kpc)radio lobes that extend from the central nucleus, are detected in a 1.4 ghz vlaobservation. the radio lobes are roughly along the direction of the x-raycavities, but are much smaller than the x-ray cavities. we propose a ``donut''configuration for the hot gas within the central 15 kpc, created by theinteraction of the gas with the radio plasma that originated from the nucleus.the current radio activity of the central radio source is weak ($\sim$ 0.2% ofhydra a) and the total radio power is at least 10 times smaller than theminimum power needed to create the cavities. we compare a478 with other galaxyclusters where similar x-ray cavities were found. a478 and a4059 host muchweaker central radio sources than do others with similar size x-ray cavities.on larger scales, deprojected temperature and density profiles are obtained fora478. we used these to derive the compton y-parameter, for the first time,through direct integration. the result has a much smaller statisticaluncertainty than previous ones. this serves as an example of how high qualityx-ray data can help constrain h$_{0}$. the corresponding h$_{0}$ also wasderived combining the available sunyaev-zeldovich effect (sze) measurement.

astro-ph;0603350	cold molecular gas in the perseus cluster core - association with x-ray  cavity, halpha filaments and cooling flow -	cold molecular gas has been recently detected in several cooling flowclusters of galaxies where huge optical nebulosities often stand. these opticalfilaments are tightly linked to the cooling flow and to the related phenomena,like the rising bubbles of relativistic plasma, fed by the radio jets. wepresent here a map in the co(2-1) rotational line of the cold molecular gasassociated with some halpha filaments surrounding the central galaxy of theperseus cluster: ngc 1275. the map, extending to about 50 kpc (135 arcsec) fromthe center of the galaxy, has been made with the 18-receiver array hera, at thefocus of the iram 30m telescope. although most of the cold gas is concentratedto the center of the galaxy, the co emission is also clearly associated to theextended filaments conspicuous in ionised gas and could trace a possiblereservoir fueling the star formation there. some of the co emission is alsofound where the x-ray gas could cool down more efficiently: at the rims of thecentral x-ray cavity (where the hot gas is thought to have been pushed out andcompressed by the central agn expanding radio lobes). the co global kinematicsdoes not show any rotation in ngc 1275. the cold gas is probably a mixture ofgas falling down on the central galaxy and of uplifted gas dragged out by arising bubble in the intracluster medium. as recenlty suggested in othercluster cores, the cold gas peculiar morphology and kinematics argue for thepicture of an intermittent cooling flow scenario where the central agn plays animportant role.

astro-ph;0603608	the ukirt infrared deep sky survey early data release	this paper defines the ukirt infrared deep sky survey (ukidss) early datarelease (edr). ukidss is a set of five large near-infra-red surveys defined bylawrence et al. (2006), being undertaken with the uk infra-red telescope(ukirt) wide field camera (wfcam). the programme began in may 2005 and has anexpected duration of seven years. each survey uses some or all of the broadbandfilter complement zyjhk. the edr is the first public release of data to theeuropean southern observatory (eso) community. all worldwide releases occurafter a delay of 18 months from the eso release. the edr provides a smallsample dataset, ~50 sq.deg (about 1% of the whole of ukidss), that is a lowerlimit to the expected quality of future survey data releases. in addition, anedr+ dataset contains all edr data plus extra data of similar quality, but forareas not observed in all of the required filters (amounting to ~220 sq.deg).the first large data release, dr1, will occur in mid-2006. we provide detailsof the observational implementation, the data reduction, the astrometric andphotometric calibration, and the quality control procedures. we summarise thedata coverage and quality (seeing, ellipticity, photometricity, depth) for eachsurvey and give a brief guide to accessing the images and catalogues from thewfcam science archive.

astro-ph;0604426	the ukirt infrared deep sky survey (ukidss)	we describe the goals, design, implementation, and initial progress of theukirt infrared deep sky survey (ukidss), a seven year sky survey which began inmay 2005, using the ukirt wide field camera. it is a portfolio of five surveycomponents covering various combinations of the filter set zyjhk and h_2. thelarge area survey, the galactic clusters survey, and the galactic plane surveycover approximately 7000 square degrees to a depth of k~18; the deepextragalactic survey covers 35 square degrees to k~21, and the ultra deepsurvey covers 0.77 square degrees to k~23. summed together ukidss is 12 timeslarger in effective volume than the 2mass survey. the prime aim of ukidss is toprovide a long term astronomical legacy database; the design is however drivenby a series of specific goals -- for example to find the nearest and faintestsub-stellar objects; to discover population ii brown dwarfs, if they exist; todetermine the substellar mass function; to break the z=7 quasar barrier; todetermine the epoch of re-ionisation; to measure the growth of structure fromz=3 to the present day; to determine the epoch of spheroid formation; and tomap the milky way through the dust, to several kpc. the survey data are beinguniformly processed, and released in stages through the wfcam science archive(wsa : http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/wsa). before the formal survey began, ukirt andthe ukidss consortium collaborated in obtaining and analysing a series of smallscience verification (sv) projects to complete the commissioning of the camera.we show some results from these sv projects in order to demonstrate the likelypower of the eventual complete survey. finally, using the data from the firstdata release we assess how well ukidss is meeting its design targets so far.

astro-ph;0606110	a panoramic mid-infrared survey of two distant clusters	(abridged) we present panoramic spitzer mips 24um observations covering9x9mpc (25'x25') fields around two massive clusters, cl0024+16 and ms0451-03,at z=0.39 and z=0.55. our observations cover a very wide range of environmentswithin these clusters, from high-density regions around the cores out to theturn-around radius. cross-correlating the mid-infrared catalogs with deepoptical and near-infrared imaging of these fields, we investigate theoptical/near-infrared colors of the mid-infrared sources. we find excesses ofmid-infrared sources with optical/near-infrared colors expected of clustermembers in the two clusters and test this selection using spectroscopicallyconfirmed 24um members. the much more significant excess is associated withcl0024+16, whereas ms0451-03 has comparatively few mid-infrared sources. themid-infrared galaxy population in cl0024+16 appears to be associated with dustystar-forming galaxies (typically redder than the general cluster population byup to a_v~1-2 mags) rather than emission from dusty tori around active galacticnuclei (agn) in early-type hosts. the inferred total-infrared star-formationrates in cl0024+16 are typically &gt;5x greater than those found from a similarhalpha survey, indicating significant obscured activity in the clusterpopulation. we find evidence for strong evolution of the level of dust-obscuredstar-formation in dense environments out to z=0.5, analogous to the rise infraction of optically-selected star-forming galaxies seen in clusters and thefield out to similar redshifts. however, there are clearly significantcluster-to-cluster variations in the populations of mid-infrared sources,probably reflecting differences in the intracluster media and recent dynamicalevolution of these systems.

astro-ph;0606305	integral field spectroscopy of h-alpha emission in cooling flow cluster  cores: disturbing the molecular gas reservoir	we present optical integral field spectroscopy of the h-alpha-luminous (&gt;1e42erg/s) central cluster galaxies in the cores of the cooling flows a1664, a1835,a2204 and zw8193. from the [nii]+h-alpha complex we derive 2-d views of thedistribution and kinematics of the emission line gas, and further diagnosticsfrom the [sii] and [oi] lines. the h-alpha emission shows a variety ofdisturbed morphologies with velocity gradients and splittings of severalhundred km/s on scales of 20 kpc or more. despite the small sample size, thereare some generic features. the most disturbed h-alpha emission appears to beassociated with secondary galaxies within 10-20 kpc (projected) of the centralgalaxy and close in velocity to the h-alpha. the global h-alpha kinematicsmatch those of co(1-0) emission in single-dish data. the [nii]/h-alpha,[sii]/h-alpha and [oi]/h-alpha ratios vary little with position, local h-alphasurface brightness or between clusters. we propose that the h-alpha and coemission arise in molecular clouds heated by a starburst which has beentriggered by interaction with a secondary galaxy. such co emission is known totrace massive (&gt;1e10 m_sun) compact (&lt;20 kpc) reservoirs of cool molecular gas,which an infalling galaxy may disturb, distorting the h-alpha morphology andinitiating widespread star formation. we suggest that cloud-cloud collisions inthe undisturbed molecular gas reservoir might be an important excitation sourcefor the emission line gas in the cores of lower h-alpha luminosity clustercores with less intense star formation (abridged).

astro-ph;0607629	the 2df-sdss lrg and qso survey: evolution of the luminosity function of  luminous red galaxies to z=0.6	we present new measurements of the luminosity function (lf) of luminous redgalaxies (lrgs) from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and the 2df-sdss lrgand quasar (2slaq) survey. we have carefully quantified, and corrected for,uncertainties in the k and evolutionary corrections, differences in the colourselection methods, and the effects of photometric errors, thus ensuring we arestudying the same galaxy population in both surveys. using a limited subset of6326 sdss lrgs (with 0.17&lt;z&lt;0.24) and 1725 2slaq lrgs (with 0.5 &lt;z&lt;0.6), forwhich the matching colour selection is most reliable, we find no evidence forany additional evolution in the lrg lf, over this redshift range, beyond thatexpected from a simple passive evolution model. this lack of additionalevolution is quantified using the comoving luminosity density of sdss and 2slaqlrgs, brighter than m_r - 5logh = -22.5, which are 2.51+/-0.03 x 10^-7 l_sunmpc^-3 and 2.44+/-0.15 x 10^-7 l_sun mpc^-3 respectively (&lt;10% uncertainty). wecompare our lfs to the combo-17 data and find excellent agreement over the sameredshift range. together, these surveys show no evidence for additionalevolution (beyond passive) in the lf of lrgs brighter than m_r - 5logh = -21(or brighter than l*). we test our sdss and 2slaq lfs against a simple ``drymerger'' model for the evolution of massive red galaxies and find that at leasthalf of the lrgs at z=0.2 must already have been well-assembled (with more thanhalf their stellar mass) by z=0.6. this limit is barely consistent with recentresults from semi-analytical models of galaxy evolution.

astro-ph;0612400	the 2df-sdss lrg and qso survey: the lrg 2-point correlation function  and redshift-space distortions	we present a clustering analysis of luminous red galaxies (lrgs) using nearly9 000 objects from the final catalogue of the 2df-sdss lrg and qso (2slaq)survey. we measure the redshift-space two-point correlation function, xi(s), atthe mean lrg redshift of z=0.55. a single power-law fits the deprojectedcorrelation function, xi(r), with a correlation length of r_0=7.45+-0.35 mpcand a power-law slope of gamma=1.72+-0.06 in the 0.4&lt;r&lt;50 mpc range. but it isin the lrg angular correlation function that the strongest evidence fornon-power-law features is found where a slope of gamma=-2.17+-0.07 is seen at1&lt;r&lt;10 mpc with a flatter gamma=-1.67+-0.03 slope apparent at r&lt;~1 mpc scales.we use the simple power-law fit to the galaxy xi(r) to model the redshift spacedistortions in the 2-d redshift-space correlation function, xi(sigma,pi). wefit for the lrg velocity dispersion, w_z, omega_m and beta, wherebeta=omega_m^0.6/b and b is the linear bias parameter. we find values ofw_z=330kms^-1, omega_m= 0.10+0.35-0.10 and beta=0.40+-0.05. these high redshiftresults, which incorporate the alcock-paczynski effect and the effects ofdynamical infall, start to break the degeneracy between omega_m and beta foundin low-redshift galaxy surveys. this degeneracy is further broken byintroducing an additional external constraint, the value of beta(z=0.1)=0.45from 2dfgrs, and then considering the evolution of clustering from z~0 toz_lrg~0.55. with these combined methods we find omega_m(z=0)=0.30+-0.15 andbeta(z=0.55)=0.45+-0.05. assuming these values, we find a value forb(z=0.55)=1.66+-0.35. we show that this is consistent with a simple ``highpeaks'' bias prescription which assumes that lrgs have a constant co-movingdensity and their clustering evolves purely under gravity.

astro-ph;0703484	an increase in the faint red galaxy population in massive clusters since  z~0.5	we compare the luminosity functions for red galaxies lying on the restframe(u-v) color-magnitude sequence in a homogeneous sample of ten x-ray luminousclusters from the macs survey at z~0.5 to a similarly selected x-ray clustersample at z~0.1. we exploit deep hubble space telescope acs imaging in thef555w and f814w passbands of the central 1.2mpc diameter regions of the distantclusters to measure precise colors for the galaxies in these regions andstatistically correct for contamination by field galaxies using observations ofblank fields. we apply an identical analysis to ground-based photometry of thez~0.1 sample. this comparison demonstrates that the number of faint, mv~ -19,red galaxies relative to the bright population seen in the central regions ofmassive clusters has roughly doubled over the 4 gyrs between z~0.5 and z~0.1.we quantify this difference by measuring the dwarf to giant ratio on the redsequence which increases by a factor of at least 2.2+/- 0.4 since z~0.5. thisis consistent with the idea that many faint, blue star-forming galaxies in highdensity environments are transforming onto the red sequence in the last half ofthe hubble time.

astro-ph;9805122	a rosat study of the cores of clusters of galaxies - i. cooling flows in  an x-ray flux-limited sample	this is the first part of a study of the detailed x-ray properties of thecores of nearby clusters. we have used the flux-limited sample of 55 clustersof edge et al. (1990) and archival and proprietary data from the {\it rosat}observatory. in this paper an x-ray spatial analysis based on thesurface-brightness-deprojection technique is applied to the clusters in thesample with the aim of studying their cooling flow properties. we determine thefraction of cooling flows in this sample to be 70-90 percent and estimate thecontribution of the flow region to the cluster x-ray luminosity. we show thatthe luminosity within a strong cooling flow can account for up to 70 percent ofa cluster x-ray bolometric luminosity. our analysis indicates that about 40percent of the clusters in the sample have flows depositing more than 100\msunpyr throughout the cooling region and that these possibly have beenundisturbed for many gyr, confirming that cooling flows are the natural stateof cluster cores. new cooling flows in the sample are presented and previouslyambiguous ones are clarified. we have constructed a catalogue of someintracluster medium properties for the clusters in this sample. the profiles ofthe mass deposited from cooling flows are analyzed and evidence presented forthe existence of breaks in some of the profiles. comparison is made to recentoptical and radio data. we cross-correlate our sample with the green bank, nvssand first surveys and to the volume-limited sample of brightest clustergalaxies presented by lauer and postman (1994). although weak trends exist, nostrong correlation between optical magnitude or radio power of the brightestcluster galaxy and the strength of the flow is found.

astro-ph;9902159	x-ray and lensing results on the cluster around the powerful radio  galaxy 4c+55.16	we present results from asca and rosat hri observations of the powerful radiogalaxy 4c+55.16 at redshift 0.24. extended soft x-ray emission is imaged by therosat hri. the x-ray brightness profile is sharply peaked on the radio galaxy,characteristic of a strong cooling flow. the x-ray spectrum obtained from ascais consistent with multi-phase intracluster gas. there is evidence for anabsorbed cool component as well as ambient cluster medium in the asca spectrum.a spectral fit, taking a cooling-flow component into account, gives atemperature of kt=5.4(+1.4/-0.9) kev, metal abundance 0.5(+/-0.1)zsun, excessabsorption on the cool component, nh=4.9(+3.4/-1.3)e+21 cm-2, and anabsorption-corrected bolometric luminosity of 2.2e+45 erg/s (h0=50km/s/mpc,q0=0.5). the mass deposition rate is estimated to be about 1100 msun/yr fromthe spectral analysis, in good agreement with that derived from imaginganalysis of the rosat data when corrected for absorption. we tentativelyidentify a blue feature, seen about 15 arcsec from the centre of the radiogalaxy in a published optical image, as a gravitationally-lensed arc. theinferred lensing mass is consistent with the gravitational mass derived fromthe x-ray data. the best-estimate of the redshift of the lensed object is1.5(&gt;0.7). all the observed properties suggest that the environment of 4c+55.16is similar to known massive cooling flow clusters. this is the first massivecooling flow to be found around a powerful, radio source with a compact,ghz-peaked spectrum core.

astro-ph;9903057	the rosat brightest cluster sample (bcs): -- iii. optical spectra of the  central cluster galaxies	we present new spectra of dominant galaxies in x-ray selected clusters, whichcombine with our previously published spectra to form a sample of 256 dominantgalaxies in 215 clusters; 177 of these are members of the rosat brightestcluster sample. 27% of the central dominant galaxies have emission-linespectra, all but 5 with line intensity ratios typical of cooling flow nebulae.a further 6% show only [nii] with h-alpha in absorption. we find no evidencefor an increase in the frequency of line emission with x-ray luminosity. purelyx-ray selected clusters at low redshift have a higher probability of containingline emission. the more h-alpha luminous galaxies have larger emission-lineregions and show a higher ratio of balmer to forbidden line emission, althoughthere is a continuous trend of ionization behaviour across four decades inh-alpha luminosity. galaxies with the more luminous line emission show asignificantly bluer continuum, whereas lower-luminosity and [nii]-only lineemitters have continua that differ little from those of non-line emittingdominant galaxies. values of the balmer decrement in the more luminous systemscommonly imply intrinsic reddening of e(b-v)~0.3, and when this is correctedfor, the excess blue light can be characterized by a population of massiveyoung stars, which can also provide sufficient photoionization to produce theobserved h-alpha luminosity. the lower h-alpha luminosity systems show a higherionization state and few massive stars, requiring instead the introduction of aharder source of photoionization.

astro-ph;9908062	the effect of radiative cooling on the x-ray properties of galaxy  clusters	in this paper, we investigate the effect of cooling on the x-ray propertiesof galaxy clusters. we have performed n-body, hydrodynamical simulations bothwith and without the effects of radiative cooling, but neglecting the effectsof star formation and feedback. we show that radiative cooling produces aninflow of high-entropy gas from the outer parts of the cluster, thus\emph{raising} the cluster temperature and \emph{decreasing} the x-rayluminosity. with radiative cooling clusters are on average three to five timesless luminous in x-rays than the same cluster simulated without cooling.however, we do not produce a large constant-density core in either the gas orthe dark matter distributions. our results contradict previous work in whichcooling raises the x-ray luminosity and deposits an unreasonably large amountof mass in the central cluster galaxy. we achieve this by selecting ournumerical resolution in such a way that a reasonable fraction of the baryonicmaterial cools and by decoupling the hot and cold gas in our simulations, afirst step towards modelling multiphase gas. we emphasise that globally coolinga sensible amount of material is vital and the presence or absence of massivecentral concentrations of cold baryonic material has a dramatic effect upon theresultant x-ray properties of the clusters.

astro-ph;9911521	zw 1718.1-0108: a highly disturbed galaxy cluster at low galactic  latitude	we report the discovery of highly distorted x-ray emission associated withthe nearby cluster zw1718.1-0108, one of whose dominant members is the powerfulradio galaxy 3c353. this cluster has been missed by previous x-ray clustersurveys because of its low galactic latitude (b = 19.5deg), despite itsbrightness in the hard x-ray band (2-10 kev flux of 1.2e-11 erg/s/cm2). ouroptical ccd image of the central part of the cluster reveals many membergalaxies which are dimmed substantially by heavy galactic extinction. we havemeasured redshifts of three bright galaxies near the x-ray emission peak andthey are all found to be around z=0.028. the asca gis and rosat hri images showthree aligned x-ray clumps embedded in low surface-brightness x-ray emissionextended by about 30 arcmin. the averaged temperature measured with asca iskt=4.3+/-0.2 kev, which appears to be hot for the bolometric luminosity 1.1e+44erg/s, when compared to the temperature-luminosity correlation of galaxyclusters. the irregular x-ray morphology and evidence for a non-uniformtemperature distribution suggest that the system is undergoing a merger ofsubstructures. since the sizes and luminosities of the individual clumps areconsistent with those of galaxy groups, zw1718.1-0108 is interpreted as anon-going merger of galaxy groups in a dark matter halo forming a cluster ofgalaxies and thus is in a transition phase of cluster formation.
