0901.1609	the statistics of voids as a tool to constrain cosmological parameters:  sigma_8 and omega_m h	we present a general analytical formalism to calculate accurately severalstatistics related to underdense regions in the universe. the statistics arecomputed for dark matter halo and galaxy distributions both in real space andredshift space at any redshift. using this formalism, we found that voidstatistics for galaxy distributions can be obtained, to a very goodapproximation, assuming galaxies to have the same clustering properties ashalos above a certain mass. we deducted a relationship between this mass andthat of halos with the same accumulated number density as the galaxies. we alsofound that the dependence of void statistics on redshift is small. forinstance, the number of voids larger than 13 mpc/h (defined to not containgalaxies brighter than m_r=-20.4 +5logh change less than 20% between z=1 andz=0. however, the dependence of void statistics on sigma_8 and omega_m h isconsiderably larger, making them appropriate to develop tests to measure theseparameters. we have shown how to efficiently construct several of these testsand discussed in detail the treatment of several observational effects. theformalism presented here along with the observed statistics extracted fromcurrent and future large galaxy redshift surveys will provide an independentmeasurement of the relevant cosmological parameters. combining thesemeasurements with those found using other methods will contribute to reducetheir uncertainties.

0903.3404	understanding the astrophysics of galaxy evolution: the role of  spectroscopic surveys in the next decade	over the last decade optical spectroscopic surveys have characterized the lowredshift galaxy population and uncovered populations of star-forming galaxiesback to z ~ 7. this work has shown that the primary epoch of galaxy buildingand black hole growth occurs at redshifts of 2 to 3. the establishment of theconcordance lcdm cosmology shifted the focus of galaxy population studies fromconstraining cosmological parameters to characterizing the processes whichregulate the formation and evolution of galaxies.in the next decade, highredshift observers will attempt to formulate a coherent evolutionary pictureconnecting galaxies in the high redshift universe to galaxies today. in orderto link galaxy populations at different redshifts, we must not onlycharacterize their evolution in a systematic way, we must establish whichphysical processes are responsible for it. considerable progress has alreadybeen made in understanding how galaxies evolved from z ~ 1 to the present day.large spectroscopic surveys in the near infrared are required to push thesestudies back towards the main epoch of galaxy building. only then will weunderstand the full story of the formation of l* galaxies like our own milkyway. a large near-ir spectroscopic survey will also provide the calibrationneeded to avoid systematics in the large photometric programs proposed to studythe nature of dark matter and dark energy. we provide an outline design for amulti-object 0.4 to 1.8 micron spectrograph, which could be placed on anexisting telescope, and which would allow a full characterization of the galaxypopulation out to z ~ 2. we strongly recommend a serious further study todesign a real instrument, which will be required for galaxy formation studiesto advance to the next frontier.

0908.2830	modeling gamma-ray burst observations by fermi and magic including  attenuation due to diffuse background light	gamma rays from extragalactic sources are attenuated by pair-productioninteractions with diffuse photons of the extragalactic background light (ebl).gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are a source of high-redshift photons above 10 gev, andcould be therefore useful as a probe of the evolving uv background radiation.in this paper, we develop a simple phenomenological model for the number andredshift distribution of gamma-ray bursts that can be seen at gev energies withthe fermi satellite and magic atmospheric cherenkov telescope. we estimate theobserved number of gamma rays per year, and show how this result is modified byconsidering interactions with different realizations of the evolving ebl. wealso discuss the bright fermi grb 080916c in the context of this model. we findthat the lat on fermi can be expected to see a small number of photons above 10gev each year from distant grbs. annual results for ground-based instrumentslike magic are highly variable due to the low duty cycle and sky coverage ofthe telescope. however, successfully viewing a bright or intermediate grb fromthe ground could provide hundreds of photons from high redshift, which wouldalmost certainly be extremely useful in constraining both grb physics and thehigh-redshift ebl.

0908.4022	the orientation and kinematics of inner tidal tails around dwarf  galaxies orbiting the milky way	using high-resolution collisionless n-body simulations we study theproperties of tidal tails formed in the immediate vicinity of a two-componentdwarf galaxy evolving in a static potential of the milky way (mw). the stellarcomponent of the dwarf is initially in the form of a disk and the galaxy isplaced on an eccentric orbit motivated by cdm-based cosmological simulations.we measure the orientation, density and velocity distribution of the stars inthe tails. due to the geometry of the orbit, in the vicinity of the dwarf,where the tails are densest and therefore most likely to be detectable, theyare typically oriented towards the mw and not along the orbit. we report on aninteresting phenomenon of `tidal tail flipping': on the way from the pericentreto the apocentre the old tails following the orbit are dissolved and new onespointing towards the mw are formed over a short timescale. we also find a tightlinear relation between the velocity of stars in the tidal tails and theirdistance from the dwarf. using mock data sets we demonstrate that if dwarfspheroidal (dsph) galaxies in the vicinity of the mw are tidally affected theirkinematic samples are very likely contaminated by tidally stripped stars whichtend to artificially inflate the measured velocity dispersion. the effect isstronger for dwarfs on their way from the peri- to the apocentre due to theformation of new tidal tails after pericentre. realistic mass estimates of dsphgalaxies thus require removal of these stars from kinematic samples.

0910.2702	the correlation of uhecrs with nearby galaxies in the local volume	we explore the possibility of a local origin for ultra high energy cosmicrays (uhecrs). using the catalogue of karachentsev et al. including nearbygalaxies with distances less than 10mpc (local volume), we search for acorrelation with the sample of uhecr events released so far by the pierre augercollaboration. the counterpart sample selection is performed with variabledistance and luminosity cuts which extract the most likely sources in thecatalogue. the probability of chance correlation after penalizing for scans is0.96%, which corresponds to a correlation signal of 2.6\sigma. we find that theparameters that maximize the signal are \psi=3.0deg, d_{max}=4mpc and m_b=-15for the maximum angular separation between cosmic rays and galaxy sources,maximum distance to the source, and sources brighter than b-band absolutemagnitude respectively. this implies a preference for the uhecrs arrivaldirections to be correlated with the nearest and most luminous galaxies in thelocal volume. we note that nearby galaxies with d&lt;10mpc show a similarcorrelation with uhecrs as compared to that found by the pierre augercollaboration using active galactic nuclei (agns) within 70-100mpc instead oflocal galaxies, although less than 20% of cosmic ray events are correlated to asource in our study. however, the observational evidence for mixed compositionin the high-energy end of the cosmic ray spectrum supports the possibility of alocal origin for uhecrs, as cno nuclei can travel only few mpc without strongattenuation by the gzk effect, whereas the observed suppression in the energyspectrum would require more distant sources in the case of pure protoncomposition interacting with the cmb.

1004.4626	the kinematic connection between galaxies and dark matter haloes	using estimates of dark halo masses from satellite kinematics, weakgravitational lensing, and halo abundance matching, combined with thetully-fisher and faber-jackson relations, we derive the mean relation betweenthe optical, v_opt, and virial, v_200, circular velocities of early- andlate-type galaxies at redshift z~0. for late-type galaxies v_opt ~ v_200 overthe velocity range v_opt=90-260 km/s, and is consistent with v_opt = v_maxh(the maximum circular velocity of nfw dark matter haloes in the concordancelcdm cosmology). however, for early-type galaxies v_opt \ne v_200, with theexception of early-type galaxies with v_opt simeq 350 km/s. this isinconsistent with early-type galaxies being, in general, globally isothermal.for low mass (v_opt &lt; 250 km/s) early-types v_opt &gt; v_maxh, indicating thatbaryons have modified the potential well, while high mass (v_opt &gt; 400 km/s)early-types have v_opt &lt; v_maxh. folding in measurements of the black hole mass- velocity dispersion relation, our results imply that the supermassive blackhole - halo mass relation has a logarithmic slope which varies from ~1.4 athalo masses of ~10^{12} msun/h to ~0.65 at halo masses of 10^{13.5} msun/h. thevalues of v_opt/v_200 we infer for the milky way and m31 are lower than thevalues currently favored by direct observations and dynamical models. thisoffset is due to the fact that the milky way and m31 have higher v_opt andlower v_200 compared to typical late-type galaxies of the same stellar masses.we show that current high resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulationsare unable to form galaxies which simultaneously reproduce both the v_opt/v_200ratio and the v_opt-m_star (tully-fisher/faber-jackson) relation.

1006.0713	a fiber positioner robot for the gran telescopio canarias	fiber-fed spectrographs dedicated to observing massive portions of the skyare increasingly being more demanded within the astronomical community. for allthe fiber-fed instruments, the primordial and common problem is the positioningof the fiber ends, which must match the position of the objects of a targetfield on the sky. amongst the different approaches found in the state of theart, actuator arrays are one of the best. indeed, an actuator array is able toposition all the fiber heads simultaneously, thus making the reconfigurationtime extremely short and the instrument efficiency high. the side group (seehttp://side.iaa.es) at the instituto de astrof\'isica de andaluc\'ia, togetherwith the industrial company avs and the university of barcelona, has beendeveloping an actuator suitable for a large and scalable array. a real-scaleprototype has been built and tested in order to validate its innovative designconcept, as well as to verify the fulfillment of the mechanical requirements.the present article describes both the concept design and the test proceduresand conditions. the main results are shown and a full justification of thevalidity of the proposed concept is provided.

1012.5859	dark halo response and the stellar initial mass function in early-type  and late-type galaxies	we investigate the origin of the relations between stellar mass and opticalcircular velocity for early-type (etg) and late-type (ltg) galaxies --- thefaber-jackson (fj) and tully-fisher (tf) relations. we combine measurements ofdark halo masses (from satellite kinematics and weak lensing), and thedistribution of baryons in galaxies (from a new compilation of galaxy scalingrelations), with constraints on dark halo structure from cosmologicalsimulations. the principle unknowns are the halo response to galaxy formationand the stellar initial mass function (imf). the slopes of the tf and fjrelations are naturally reproduced for a wide range of halo response and imfs.however, models with a universal imf and universal halo response cannotsimultaneously reproduce the zero points of both the tf and fj relations. for amodel with a universal chabrier imf, ltgs require halo expansion, while etgsrequire halo contraction. a salpeter imf is permitted for high mass (sigma &gt;180 km/s) etgs, but is inconsistent for intermediate masses, unlessv_circ(r_e)/sigma_e &gt; 1.6. if the imf is universal and close to chabrier, wespeculate that the presence of a major merger may be responsible for thecontraction in etgs while clumpy accreting streams and/or feedback leads toexpansion in ltgs. alternatively, a recently proposed variation in the imfdisfavors halo contraction in both types of galaxies. finally we show that ourmodels naturally reproduce flat and featureless circular velocity profileswithin the optical regions of galaxies without fine-tuning.

1103.0988	fiber assignment in next-generation wide-field spectrographs	we present an optimized algorithm for assigning fibers to targets innext-generation fiber-fed multi-object spectrographs. the method, that we nameddraining algorithm, ensures that the maximum number of targets in a giventarget field is observed in the first few tiles. using randomly distributedtargets and mock galaxy catalogs we have estimated that the gain provided bythe draining algorithm as compared to a random assignment can be as much as 2%for the first tiles. this would imply for a survey like bigboss saving forobservation several hundred thousand objects or, alternatively, reducing thecovered area in ~350 sq. deg. an important advantage of this method is that thefiber collision problem can be solved easily and in an optimal way. we alsodiscuss additional optimizations of the fiber positioning process. inparticular, we show that allowing for rotation of the focal plane can improvethe efficiency of the process in ~3.5-4.5% even if only small adjustments arepermitted (up to 2 deg). for instruments that allow large rotations of thefocal plane the expected gain increases to ~5-6%. these results, therefore,strongly support focal plane rotation in future spectrographs, as far as theefficiency of the fiber positioning process is concerned. finally, we discusson the implications of our optimizations and provide some basic hints for anoptimal survey strategy based on the number of targets per positioner.

1104.5130	halo concentrations in the standard lcdm cosmology	we study the concentration of dark matter halos and its evolution in n-bodysimulations of the standard lcdm cosmology. the results presented in this paperare based on 4 large n-body simulations with about 10 billion particles each:the millennium-i and ii, bolshoi, and multidark simulations. the multidark (orbigbolshoi) simulation is introduced in this paper. this suite of simulationswith high mass resolution over a large volume allows us to compute withunprecedented accuracy the concentration over a large range of scales (aboutsix orders of magnitude in mass), which constitutes the state-of-the-art of ourcurrent knowledge on this basic property of dark matter halos in the lcdmcosmology. we find that there is consistency among the different simulationdata sets. we confirm a novel feature for halo concentrations at highredshifts: a flattening and upturn with increasing mass. the concentrationc(m,z) as a function of mass and the redshift and for different cosmologicalparameters shows a remarkably complex pattern. however, when expressed in termsof the linear rms fluctuation of the density field sigma(m,z), the haloconcentration c(sigma) shows a nearly-universal simple u-shaped behaviour witha minimum at a well defined scale at sigma=0.71. yet, some small dependenceswith redshift and cosmology still remain. at the high-mass end (sigma &lt; 1) themedian halo kinematic profiles show large signatures of infall and highlyradial orbits. this c-sigma(m,z) relation can be accurately parametrized andprovides an analytical model for the dependence of concentration on halo mass.when applied to galaxy clusters, our estimates of concentrations aresubstantially larger -- by a factor up to 1.5 -- than previous results fromsmaller simulations, and are in much better agreement with results ofobservations.

1105.2320	ameliorating systematic uncertainties in the angular clustering of  galaxies: a study using sdss-iii	we investigate the effects of potential sources of systematic error on theangular and photometric redshift, z_phot, distributions of a sample of redshift0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.7 massive galaxies whose selection matches that of the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) constant mass sample. utilizing over112,778 boss spectra as a training sample, we produce a photometric redshiftcatalog for the galaxies in the sdss dr8 imaging area that, after masking,covers nearly one quarter of the sky (9,913 square degrees). we investigatefluctuations in the number density of objects in this sample as a function ofgalactic extinction, seeing, stellar density, sky background, airmass,photometric offset, and north/south galactic hemisphere. we find that thepresence of stars of comparable magnitudes to our galaxies (which are nottraditionally masked) effectively remove area. failing to correct for suchstars can produce systematic errors on the measured angular auto-correlationfunction, w, that are larger than its statistical uncertainty. we describe howone can effectively mask for the presence of the stars, without removing anygalaxies from the sample, and minimize the systematic error. additionally, weapply two separate methods that can be used to correct the systematic errorsimparted by any parameter that can be turned into a map on the sky. we findthat failing to properly account for varying sky background introduces asystematic error on w. we measure w, in four z_phot slices of width 0.05between 0.45 &lt; z_phot &lt; 0.65 and find that the measurements, after correctingfor the systematic effects of stars and sky background, are generallyconsistent with a generic lambdacdm model, at scales up to 60 degrees. atscales greater than 3 degrees and z_phot &gt; 0.5, the magnitude of thecorrections we apply are greater than the statistical uncertainty in w.

(2011). this data-set spans 11,000 square degrees andprobes a volume of $3h^{-3} \rm{gpc}^3$, making it the largest volume ever usedfor galaxy clustering measurements. we present a novel treatment of theobservational systematics and its applications to the clustering signals fromthe data set. in this paper, we measure the angular clustering using an optimalquadratic estimator at 4 redshift slices with an accuracy of ~15% with bin sizeof delta_l = 10 on scales of the baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) (atl~40-400). we derive cosmological constraints using the full-shape of thepower-spectra. for a flat lambda cdm model, when combined with cosmic microwavebackground wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe 7 (wmap7) and h_0 constraintsfrom 600 cepheids observed by hst, we find \omega_\lambda = 0.73 +/- 0.019 andh_0 to be 70.5 +/- 1.6 km/s/mpc. for an open lambda cdm model, when combinedwith wmap7 + hst, we find $\omega_k = 0.0035 +/- 0.0054, improved overwmap7+hst alone by 40%. for a wcdm model, when combined with wmap7+hst+sn, wefind w = -1.071 +/- 0.078, and h_0 to be 71.3 +/- 1.7 km/s/mpc, which iscompetitive with the latest large scale structure constraints from largespectroscopic surveys such as sdss data release 7 (dr7) (reid et al. 2010,percival et al. 2010, montesano et al. 2011) and wigglez (blake et al. 2011).the sdss-iii data release 8 (sdss-iii dr8) angular clustering data allows awide range of investigations into the cosmological model, cosmic expansion (viabao), gaussianity of initial conditions and neutrino masses.

1203.6407	quantifying the coherent outflows of galaxies around voids in the sdss  dr7	we report the detection, with a high level of confidence, of coherentoutflows around voids found in the seventh data release of the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss dr7). in particular, we developed a robust &lt;|cos theta|&gt;statistical test to quantify the strength of redshift-space distortions (rsd)associated with extended coherent velocity fields. we consistently find thatthe vector that joins void centers with galaxies that lie in shells around themis more likely to be perpendicular to the line-of-sight than parallel to it.this effect is clear evidence for the existence of outflows in the vicinity ofvoids. we show that the rsd exist for a wide range of void radius and shellthickness, but they are more evident in the largest voids in our sample. forinstance, we find that the &lt;|cos theta|&gt; for galaxies located in shells within2 h^-1 mpc from the edge of voids larger than 15 h^-1 mpc deviates 3.81sigmafrom uniformity. the measurements presented in this work provide usefulinformation to constrain cosmological parameters, in particular omega_m andsigma_8.

1203.6594	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: baryon acoustic oscillations in the data release 9  spectroscopic galaxy sample	we present measurements of galaxy clustering from the baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (boss), which is part of the sloan digital sky survey iii(sdss-iii). these use the data release 9 (dr9) cmass sample, which contains264,283 massive galaxies covering 3275 square degrees with an effectiveredshift z=0.57 and redshift range 0.43 &lt; z &lt; 0.7. assuming a concordancelambda-cdm cosmological model, this sample covers an effective volume of 2.2gpc^3, and represents the largest sample of the universe ever surveyed at thisdensity, n = 3 x 10^-4 h^-3 mpc^3. we measure the angle-averaged galaxycorrelation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstructionof the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) feature. the acoustic features aredetected at a significance of 5\sigma in both the correlation function andpower spectrum. combining with the sdss-ii luminous red galaxy sample, thedetection significance increases to 6.7\sigma. fitting for the position of theacoustic features measures the distance to z=0.57 relative to the sound horizondv /rs = 13.67 +/- 0.22 at z=0.57. assuming a fiducial sound horizon of 153.19mpc, which matches cosmic microwave background constraints, this corresponds toa distance dv(z=0.57) = 2094 +/- 34 mpc. at 1.7 per cent, this is the mostprecise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. we place thisresult alongside previous bao measurements in a cosmological distance ladderand find excellent agreement with the current supernova measurements. we usethese distance measurements to constrain various cosmological models, findingcontinuing support for a flat universe with a cosmological constant.

1207.0502	characterization of dark-matter-induced anisotropies in the diffuse  gamma-ray background	the fermi-lat collaboration has recently reported the detection of angularpower above the photon noise level in the diffuse gamma-ray background between1 and 50 gev. such signal can be used to constrain a possible contribution fromdark-matter-induced photons. we estimate the intensity and features of theangular power spectrum (aps) of this potential dark matter (dm) signal, forboth decaying and annihilating dm candidates, by constructing template all-skygamma-ray maps for the emission produced in the galactic halo and itssubstructures, as well as in extragalactic (sub)halos. the dm distribution isgiven by state-of-the-art n-body simulations of cosmic structure formation,namely millennium-ii for extragalactic (sub)halos, and aquarius for thegalactic halo and its subhalos. we use a hybrid method of extrapolation toaccount for (sub)structures that are below the resolution limit of thesimulations, allowing us to estimate the total emission all the way down to theminimal self-bound halo mass. we describe in detail the features appearing inthe aps of our template maps and we estimate the effect of variousuncertainties such as the value of the minimal halo mass, the fraction ofsubstructures hosted in a halo and the shape of the dm density profile. ourresults indicate that the fluctuation aps of the dm-induced emission is of thesame order as the fermi-lat aps, suggesting that one can constrain thishypothetical emission from the comparison with the measured anisotropy. we alsoquantify the uncertainties affecting our results, finding "theoretical errorbands" spanning more than two orders of magnitude and dominated (for a givenparticle physics model) by our lack of knowledge of the abundance of low-mass(sub)halos.

1207.6410	on the physics of radio halos in galaxy clusters: scaling relations and  luminosity functions	the underlying physics of giant radio halos and mini halos in galaxy clustersis still an open question, which becomes more pressing with the growing numberof detections. in this paper, we explore the possibility that radio-emittingelectrons are generated in hadronic cosmic ray (cr) proton interactions withambient thermal protons of the intra-cluster medium. our cr model derives fromcosmological hydrodynamical simulations of cluster formation and additionallyaccounts for cr transport in the form of cr streaming and diffusion. this opensthe possibility of changing the radio halo luminosity by more than an order ofmagnitude on a dynamical time scale. we build a mock galaxy cluster catalogfrom the large multidark n-body lcdm simulation by adopting a phenomenologicalgas density model for each cluster based on x-ray measurements that matchessunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) and x-ray scaling relations and luminosity function.using magnetic field strength estimates from faraday rotation measure studies,our model successfully reproduces the observed surface brightness profiles ofgiant radio halos (coma, a2163) as well as radio mini-halos (perseus,ophiuchus), while obeying upper limits on the gamma-ray emission in theseclusters. our model is also able to simultaneously reproduce the observedbimodality of radio-loud and radio-quiet clusters at the same l_x as well asthe unimodal distribution of radio-halo luminosity versus the sz flux y;thereby suggesting a physical solution to this apparent contradiction. for aplausible fraction of 10% radio-loud clusters, our model matches the nvssradio-halo luminosity function. constructing an analytical radio-haloluminosity function, we demonstrate the unique prospects for low-frequencyradio surveys (such as the lofar tier 1 survey) to detect ~3500 radio halosback to redshift two and to probe the underlying physics of radio halos.[abridged]

1208.0022	the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey of sdss-iii	the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) is designed to measure thescale of baryon acoustic oscillations (bao) in the clustering of matter over alarger volume than the combined efforts of all previous spectroscopic surveysof large scale structure. boss uses 1.5 million luminous galaxies as faint asi=19.9 over 10,000 square degrees to measure bao to redshifts z&lt;0.7.observations of neutral hydrogen in the lyman alpha forest in more than 150,000quasar spectra (g&lt;22) will constrain bao over the redshift range 2.15&lt;z&lt;3.5.early results from boss include the first detection of the large-scalethree-dimensional clustering of the lyman alpha forest and a strong detectionfrom the data release 9 data set of the bao in the clustering of massivegalaxies at an effective redshift z = 0.57. we project that boss will yieldmeasurements of the angular diameter distance d_a to an accuracy of 1.0% atredshifts z=0.3 and z=0.57 and measurements of h(z) to 1.8% and 1.7% at thesame redshifts. forecasts for lyman alpha forest constraints predict ameasurement of an overall dilation factor that scales the highly degenerated_a(z) and h^{-1}(z) parameters to an accuracy of 1.9% at z~2.5 when the surveyis complete. here, we provide an overview of the selection of spectroscopictargets, planning of observations, and analysis of data and data quality ofboss.

1208.1491	the clustering of galaxies in sdss-iii dr9 baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: constraints on primordial non-gaussianity	we analyze the density field of 264,283 galaxies observed by the sloandigital sky survey (sdss)-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss)and included in the sdss data release nine (dr9). in total, the sdss dr9 bossdata includes spectroscopic redshifts for over 400,000 galaxies spread over afootprint of more than 3,000 deg^2. we measure the power spectrum of thesegalaxies with redshifts 0.43 &lt; z &lt; 0.7 in order to constrain the amount oflocal non-gaussianity, f_nl,local, in the primordial density field, payingparticular attention to the impact of systematic uncertainties. the boss galaxydensity field is systematically affected by the local stellar density and thisinfluences the ability to accurately measure f_nl,local. in the absence of anycorrection, we find (erroneously) that the probability that f_nl,local isgreater than zero, p(f_nl,local &gt;0), is 99.5%. after quantifying and correctingfor the systematic bias and including the added uncertainty, we find -45 &lt;f_nl,local &lt; 195 at 95% confidence, and p(f_nl,local &gt;0) = 91.0%. a moreconservative approach assumes that we have only learned the k-dependence of thesystematic bias and allows any amplitude for the systematic correction; we findthat the systematic effect is not fully degenerate with that of f_nl,local, andwe determine that -82 &lt; f_nl,local &lt; 178 (at 95% confidence) and p(f_nl,local&gt;0) = 68%. this analysis demonstrates the importance of accounting for theimpact of galactic foregrounds on f_nl,local measurements. we outline themethods that account for these systematic biases and uncertainties. we expectour methods to yield robust constraints on f_nl,local for both our own andfuture large-scale-structure investigations.

1302.5655	stochastic bias of colour-selected bao tracers by joint clustering-weak  lensing analysis	the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) feature in the two-point correlationfunction of galaxies supplies a standard ruler to probe the expansion historyof the universe. we study here several galaxy selection schemes, aiming atbuilding an emission-line galaxy (elg) sample in the redshift range$0.6&lt;z&lt;1.7$, that would be suitable for future bao studies, providing a highlybiased galaxy sample. we analyse the angular galaxy clustering of galaxyselections at the redshifts 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, 1 and 1.2 and we combine thisanalysis with a halo occupation distribution (hod) model to derive theproperties of the haloes these galaxies inhabit, in particular the galaxy biason large scales. we also perform a weak lensing analysis (aperture statistics)to extract the galaxy bias and the cross-correlation coefficient and compare tothe hod prediction.  we apply this analysis on a data set composed of the photometry of the deepco-addition on sloan digital sky survey (sdss) stripe 82 (225 deg$^2$), ofcanda-france-hawai telescope/stripe 82 deep \emph{i}-band weak lensing surveyand of the {\it wide-field infrared survey explorer}infrared photometric bandw1.  the analysis on the sdss-iii/constant mass galaxies selection at $z=0.5$ isin agreement with previous studies on the tracer, moreover we measure itscross-correlation coefficient $r=1.16\pm0.35$. for the higher redshift bins, weconfirm the trends that the brightest galaxy populations selected are stronglybiased ($b&gt;1.5$), but we are limited by current data sets depth to deriveprecise values of the galaxy bias. a survey using such tracers of the massfield will guarantee a high significance detection of the bao.

1303.4302	the sdss-iii baryonic oscillation spectroscopic survey: constraints on  the integrated sachs wolfe effect	in the context of the study of the integrated sachs wolfe effect (isw), weconstruct a template of the projected density distribution up to $z\simeq 0.7$by using the luminous galaxies (lgs) from the sloan digital sky survey dr8. weuse a photo-z catalogue trained with more than a hundred thousand galaxies fromboss in the sdss dr8 imaging area. we consider two different lg samples whoseselection matches that of sdss-iii/boss: the lowz sample ($z\in [0.15,0.5]$)and the cmass sample ($z\in[0.4,0.7]$). when building the lg density maps weuse the information from star density, survey footprint, seeing conditions, skyemission, dust extinction and airmass to explore the impact of these artifactson the two lg samples. in agreement with previous studies, we find that thecmass sample is particularly sensitive to galactic stars, which dominate thecontribution to the auto-angular power spectrum below $\ell=7$. other potentialsystematics affect mostly the low multipole range ($\ell\in[2,7]$), but leavefluctuations on smaller scales practically unchanged. the resulting powerspectra in the multipole range $\ell\in[2,100]$ for the lowz, cmass andlowz+cmass samples are compatible with linear $\lambda$cdm expectations andconstant bias values of $b=1.98 \pm 0.11$, $2.08\pm0.14$ and $1.88\pm 0.11$,respectively, with no traces of non-gaussianity: $f_{\rm nl}^{\rm local}=59\pm75$ at 95% confidence level for the full lowz+cmass sample in the range$\ell\in[4,100]$. after cross-correlating wmap-9yr data with the lowz+cmass lgdensity field, the isw signal is detected at the level of 1.62--1.69$\,\sigma$.while this result is in close agreement with predictions from monte carlosimulations in the concordance $\lambda$cdm model, it cannot rule out by itselfan einstein-de sitter scenario, and has a moderately low signal compared toprevious studies conducted on subsets of this lg sample.

1303.4391	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: measuring h(z) and d_a(z) at z = 0.57 with clustering  wedges	we analyze the 2d correlation function of the sdss-iii baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (boss) cmass sample of massive galaxies of the ninth datarelease to measure cosmic expansion h and the angular diameter distance d_a ata mean redshift of &lt;z&gt; = 0.57. we apply, for the first time, a new correlationfunction technique called clustering wedges. using a physically motivatedmodel, the anisotropic baryonic acoustic feature in the galaxy sample isdetected at a significance level of 4.7 sigma compared to a featureless model.the baryonic acoustic feature is used to obtain model independent constraintscz/h/r_s = 12.28 +- 0.82 (6.7 per-cent accuracy) and d_a/r_s = 9.05 +- 0.27(3.0 per-cent) with a correlation coefficient of -0.5, where r_s is the soundhorizon scale at the end of the baryonic drag era. we conduct thorough tests onthe data and 600 simulated realizations, finding robustness of the resultsregardless of the details of the analysis method. combining with r_sconstraints from the cosmic microwave background we obtain h(0.57) = 90.8 +-6.2 kms-1mpc-1 and d_a(0.57) = 1386 +- 45 mpc. we use simulations to forecastresults of the final boss cmass data set. we apply the reconstruction techniqueon the simulations demonstrating that the sharpening of the anisotropicbaryonic acoustic feature should improve the detection as well as tightenconstraints of h and d_a by 30 per-cent on average.

1303.4396	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: cosmological constraints from the full shape of the  clustering wedges	we explore the cosmological implications of the clustering wedges, xi_perp(s)and xi_para(s), of the cmass data release 9 (dr9) sample of the baryonoscillation spectroscopic survey (boss). these clustering wedges are defined byaveraging the full two-dimensional correlation function, xi(mu,s), over theranges 0&lt;mu&lt;0.5 and 0.5&lt;mu&lt;1, respectively. these measurements allow us toconstrain the parameter combinations d_a(z)/r_s(z_d)=9.03 +- 0.21 andcz/(r_s(z_d)h(z)) = 12.14 +- 0.43 at the mean redsfhit of the sample, z=0.57.we combine the information from the clustering wedges with recent measurementsof cmb, bao and type ia supernovae to obtain constraints on the cosmologicalparameters of the standard lcdm model and a number of potential extensions. theinformation encoded in the clustering wedges is most useful when the darkenergy equation of state is allowed to deviate from its standard lcdm value.the combination of all datasets shows no evidence of a deviation from aconstant dark energy equation of state, in which case we find w_de = -1.013 +-0.064, in complete agreement with a cosmological constant. we explore potentialdeviations from general relativity by constraining the growth rate f(z)=d lnd(a)/ d ln a, in which case the combination of the cmass clustering wedges withcmb data implies f(z=0.57)=0.719 +- 0.094, in accordance with the predictionsof gr. our results clearly illustrate the additional constraining power ofanisotropic clustering measurements with respect to that of angle-averagedquantities.

1303.4486	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: single-probe measurements and the strong power of  normalized growth rate on constraining dark energy	we present measurements of the anisotropic galaxy clustering from the datarelease 9 (dr9) cmass sample of the sdss-iii baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss). we analyze the broad-range shape of the monopole and quadrupolecorrelation functions to obtain constraints, at the effective redshift z=0.57of the sample, on the hubble expansion rate h(z), the angular-diameter distanced_a(z), the normalized growth rate f(z)\sigma_8(z), the physical matter density\omega_m h^2, and the biased amplitude of matter fluctuation b\sigma_8(z). weobtain {h(0.57), d_a(0.57), f(0.57)\sigma_8(0.57), \omega_m h^2,b\sigma_8(0.57)} = {87.6_{-6.8}^{+6.7}, 1396\pm73, 0.126_{-0.010}^{+0.008},1.19\pm0.14, 0.428\pm0.066} and their covariance matrix as well. the parameterswhich are not well constrained by our of galaxy clustering analysis aremarginalized over with wide flat priors. since no priors from other data sets(i.e., cmb) are adopted and no dark energy models are assumed, our results fromboss cmass galaxy clustering alone may be combined with other data sets, i.e.cmb, sne, lensing or other galaxy clustering data to constrain the parametersof a given cosmological model. we show that the major power on constrainingdark energy from the anisotropic galaxy clustering signal, as compared to theangular-averaged one (monopole), arises from including the normalized growthrate f(z)\sigma_8(z). in the case of the wcdm cosmological model oursingle-probe cmass constraints, combined with cmb (wmap9+spt), yield a valuefor the dark energy equation of state parameter of w=-0.90\pm0.11. therefore,it is important to include f(z)\sigma_8(z) while investigating the nature ofdark energy with current and upcoming large-scale galaxy surveys.

1307.3285	modelling baryon acoustic oscillations with perturbation theory and  stochastic halo biasing	in this work we investigate the generation of mock halo catalogues based onperturbation theory and nonlinear stochastic biasing with the novelpatchy-code. in particular, we use augmented lagrangian perturbation theory(alpt) to generate a dark matter density field on a mesh starting from gaussianfluctuations and to compute the peculiar velocity field. alpt is based on acombination of second order lpt (2lpt) on large scales and the sphericalcollapse model on smaller scales. we account for the systematic deviation ofperturbative approaches from n-body simulations together with halo biasingadopting an exponential bias model. we then account for stochastic biasing bydefining three regimes: a low, an intermediate and a high density regime, usinga poisson distribution in the intermediate regime and the negative binomialdistribution to model over-dispersion in the high density regime. since wefocus in this study on massive halos, we suppress the generation of halos inthe low density regime. the various nonlinear and stochastic biasingparameters, and density thresholds (five) are calibrated with the largebigmultidark n-body simulation to match the power spectrum of the correspondinghalo population. our mock catalogues show power spectra, both in real- andredshift-space, which are compatible with n-body simulations within about 2% upto k ~ 1 h mpc^-1 at z = 0.577 for a sample of halos with the typical bosscmass galaxy number density. the corresponding correlation functions arecompatible down to a few mpc. we also find that neglecting over-dispersion inhigh density regions produces power spectra with deviations of 10% at k ~ 0.4 hmpc^-1. these results indicate the need to account for an accurate statisticaldescription of the galaxy clustering for precise studies of large-scalesurveys.

0801.2769	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: the red sequence agn fraction and its  environment and redshift dependence	we measure the dependence of the agn fraction on local environment at z~1,using spectroscopic data taken from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey, andchandra x-ray data from the all-wavelength extended groth strip internationalsurvey (aegis). to provide a clean sample of agn we restrict our analysis tothe red sequence population; this also reduces additional colour-environmentcorrelations. we find evidence that high redshift liners in deep2 tend tofavour higher density environments relative to the red population from whichthey are drawn. in contrast, seyferts and x-ray selected agn at z~1 show little(or no) environmental dependencies within the same underlying population. wecompare these results with a sample of local agn drawn from the sdss. contraryto the high redshift behaviour, we find that both liners and seyferts in thesdss show a slowly declining red sequence agn fraction towards high densityenvironments. interestingly, at z~1 red sequence seyferts and liners areapproximately equally abundant. by z~0, however, the red seyfert population hasdeclined relative to the liner population by over a factor of 7. we speculateon possible interpretations of our results.

1308.3515	constraints on wimp annihilation for contracted dark matter in the inner  galaxy with the fermi-lat	we derive constraints on parameters of generic dark matter candidates bycomparing theoretical predictions with the gamma-ray emission observed by thefermi-lat from the region around the galactic center. our analysis isconservative since it simply requires that the expected dark matter signal doesnot exceed the observed emission. the constraints obtained in the likely casethat the collapse of baryons to the galactic center is accompanied by thecontraction of the dark matter are strong. in particular, we find that for bband \tau+\tau- or w+w- dark matter annihilation channels, the upper limits onthe annihilation cross section imply that the thermal cross section is excludedfor a weakly interacting massive particle (wimp) mass smaller than about 700and 500 gev, respectively. for the \mu+ \mu- channel, where the effect of theinverse compton scattering is important, depending on models of the galacticmagnetic field the exclusion of the thermal cross-section is for a wimp masssmaller than about 150 to 400 gev. the upper limits on the annihilation crosssection of dark matter particles obtained are two orders of magnitude strongerthan without contraction. in the latter case our results are compatible withthe upper limits from the galactic halo analysis reported by the fermi-latcollaboration for the case in which the same conservative approach withoutmodeling of the astrophysical background is employed.

1310.3740	halo abundance matching: accuracy and conditions for numerical  convergence	accurate predictions of the abundance and clustering of dark matter haloesplay a key role in testing the standard cosmological model. here, weinvestigate the accuracy of one of the leading methods of connecting thesimulated dark matter haloes with observed galaxies -- the halo abundancematching (ham) technique. we show how to choose the optimal values of the massand force resolution in large-volume n-body simulations so that they provideaccurate estimates for correlation functions and circular velocities for haloesand their subhaloes -- crucial ingredients of the ham method. at the 10%accuracy, results converge for 50 particles for haloes and 150 particles forprogenitors subhaloes. in order to achieve this level of accuracy a number ofconditions should be satisfied. the force resolution for the smallest resolved(sub)haloes should be in the range (0.1-0.3)rs, where rs is the scale radius of(sub)haloes. the number of particles for progenitors of subhaloes should be150. we also demonstrate that the two-body scattering plays a minor role forthe accuracy of n-body simulations thanks to the relatively small number ofcrossing-times of dark matter in haloes, and the limited force resolution ofcosmological simulations.

1311.4793	a phenomenological model for the intracluster medium that matches x-ray  and sunyaev-zel'dovich observations	cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters are stillchallenged to produce a model for the intracluster medium that matches allaspects of current x-ray and sunyaev-zel'dovich observations. to facilitatesuch comparisons with future simulations and to enable realistic clusterpopulation studies for modeling e.g., non-thermal emission processes, weconstruct a phenomenological model for the intracluster medium that is based ona representative sample of observed x-ray clusters. we create a mock galaxycluster catalog based on the large collisionless n-body simulation multidark,by assigning our gas density model to each dark matter cluster halo. ourclusters are classified as cool-core and non cool-core according to a dynamicaldisturbance parameter. we demonstrate that our gas model matches the variousobserved sunyaev-zel'dovich and x-ray scaling relations as well as the x-rayluminosity function, thus enabling to build a reliable mock catalog for presentsurveys and forecasts for future experiments. in a companion paper, we applyour catalogs to calculate non-thermal radio and gamma-ray emission of galaxyclusters. we make our cosmologically complete multi-frequency mock catalogs forthe (non-)thermal cluster emission at different redshifts publicly and freelyavailable online through the multidark database (www.multidark.org).

1311.4795	on the physics of radio halos in galaxy clusters: scaling relations and  luminosity functions	the underlying physics of giant and mini radio halos in galaxy clusters isstill an open question. we find that mini halos (such as in perseus andophiuchus) can be explained by radio-emitting electrons that are generated inhadronic cosmic ray (cr) interactions with protons of the intracluster medium.by contrast, the hadronic model either fails to explain the extended emissionof giant radio halos (as in coma at low frequencies) or would require a flat crprofile, which can be realized through outward streaming and diffusion of crs(in coma and a2163 at 1.4 ghz). we suggest that a second, leptonic componentcould be responsible for the missing flux in the outer parts of giant haloswithin a new hybrid scenario and we describe its possible observationalconsequences. to study the hadronic emission component of the radio halopopulation statistically, we use a cosmological mock galaxy cluster catalogbuilt from the multidark simulation. because of the properties of cr streamingand the different scalings of the x-ray luminosity (l_x) and thesunyaev-zel'dovich flux (y) with gas density, our model can simultaneouslyreproduce the observed bimodality of radio-loud and radio-quiet clusters at thesame l_x as well as the unimodal distribution of radio-halo luminosity versusy; thereby suggesting a physical solution to this apparent contradiction. wepredict radio halo emission down to the mass scale of galaxy groups, whichhighlights the unique prospects for low-frequency radio surveys (such as thelofar tier 1 survey) to increase the number of detected radio halos by at leastan order of magnitude.

1312.1644	collision avoidance in next-generation fiber positioner robotic system  for large survey spectrograph	some of the next generation massive spectroscopic survey projects, such asdesi and pfs, plan to use thousands of fiber positioner robots packed at afocal plane to quickly move in parallel the fiber-ends from the previous to thenext target points. the most direct trajectories are prone to collision thatcould damage the robots and impact the survey operation. we thus present here amotion planning method based on a novel decentralized navigation function forcollision-free coordination of fiber positioners. the navigation function takesinto account the configuration of positioners as well as the actuatorconstraints. we provide details for the proof of convergence and collisionavoidance. decentralization results in linear complexity for the motionplanning as well as dependency of motion duration with respect to the number ofpositioners. therefore the coordination method is scalable for large-scalespectrograph robots. the short in-motion duration of positioner robots (~2.5seconds using typical actuator constraints), will thus allow the time dedicatedfor observation to be maximized.

1312.1729	the flattening of the concentration-mass relation towards low halo  masses and its implications for the annihilation signal boost	in the standard cold dark matter (cdm) theory for understanding the formationof structure in the universe, there exists a tight connection between theproperties of dark matter (dm) haloes, and their formation epochs. suchrelation can be expressed in terms of a single key parameter, namely the haloconcentration. in this work, we examine the median concentration-mass relation,c(m), at present time, over more than 20 orders of magnitude in halo mass,i.e., from tiny earth-mass microhalos up to galaxy clusters. the c(m) modelproposed by prada et al. (2012), which links the halo concentration with ther.m.s. amplitude of matter linear fluctuations, describes remarkably well allthe available n-body simulation data down to ~10^(-6) msun microhalos. a clearfattening of the halo concentration-mass relation towards smaller masses isobserved, that excludes the commonly adopted power-law c(m) models, and standsas a natural prediction for the cdm paradigm. we provide a parametrization forthe c(m) relation that works accurately for all halo masses. this feature inthe c(m) relation at low masses has decisive consequences e.g. for gamma-ray dmsearches, as it implies more modest boosts of the dm annihilation flux due tosubstructure, i.e., ~35 for galaxy clusters and ~15 for galaxies like our own,as compared to those huge values adopted in the literature that rely on suchpower-law c(m) extrapolations. we provide a parametrization of the boosts thatcan be safely used for dwarfs to galaxy cluster-size halos.

1312.4877	the clustering of galaxies in the sdss-iii baryon oscillation  spectroscopic survey: baryon acoustic oscillations in the data release 10 and  11 galaxy samples	we present a one per cent measurement of the cosmic distance scale from thedetections of the baryon acoustic oscillations in the clustering of galaxiesfrom the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss), which is part of thesloan digital sky survey iii (sdss-iii). our results come from the data release11 (dr11) sample, containing nearly one million galaxies and coveringapproximately $8\,500$ square degrees and the redshift range $0.2&lt;z&lt;0.7$. wealso compare these results with those from the publicly released dr9 and dr10samples. assuming a concordance $\lambda$cdm cosmological model, the dr11sample covers a volume of 13\,gpc${}^3$ and is the largest region of theuniverse ever surveyed at this density. we measure the correlation function andpower spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the baryon acousticoscillation (bao) feature. the acoustic features are detected at a significanceof over $7\,\sigma$ in both the correlation function and power spectrum.fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distancerelative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$, which has a value of$r_{d,{\rm fid}}=149.28\,$mpc in our fiducial cosmology. we find$d_v=(1264\pm25\,{\rm mpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ at $z=0.32$ and$d_v=(2056\pm20\,{\rm mpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ at $z=0.57$. at 1.0 per cent,this latter measure is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained froma galaxy survey. separating the clustering along and transverse to theline-of-sight yields measurements at $z=0.57$ of $d_a=(1421\pm20\,{\rmmpc})(r_d/r_{d,{\rm fid}})$ and $h=(96.8\pm3.4\,{\rm km/s/mpc})(r_{d,{\rmfid}}/r_d)$. our measurements of the distance scale are in good agreement withprevious bao measurements and with the predictions from cosmic microwavebackground data for a spatially flat cold dark matter model with a cosmologicalconstant.

1407.1236	constraining the halo bispectrum in real and redshift space from  perturbation theory and non-linear stochastic bias	we present a method to produce mock galaxy catalogues with efficientperturbation theory schemes, which match the number density, power spectra andbispectra in real and in redshift space from n-body simulations. the essentialcontribution of this work is the way in which we constrain the bias parametersin the patchy-code. in addition of aiming at reproducing the two-pointstatistics, we seek the set of bias parameters, which constrain the univariatehalo probability distribution function (pdf) encoding higher-order correlationfunctions. we demonstrate that halo catalogues based on the same underlyingdark matter field with a fix halo number density, and accurately matching thepower spectrum (within 2%), can lead to very different bispectra depending onthe adopted halo bias model. a model ignoring the shape of the halo pdf canlead to deviations up to factors of 2. the catalogues obtained additionallyconstraining the shape of the halo pdf can significantly lower the discrepancyin the three-point statistics, yielding closely unbiased bispectra both in realand in redshift space; which are in general compatible with those correspondingto an n-body simulation within 10% (deviating at most up to 20%). ourcalculations show that the constant linear bias of ~2 for luminous red galaxy(lrg) like galaxies seen in the power spectrum, mainly comes from samplinghalos in high density peaks, choosing a high density threshold rather than froma factor multiplying the dark matter density field. our method contributestowards an efficient modelling of the halo/galaxy distribution required toestimate uncertainties in the clustering measurements from galaxy redshiftsurveys. we have also demonstrated that it represents a powerful tool to testvarious bias models.

1408.5435	tests of redshift-space distortions models in configuration space for  the analysis of the boss final data release	observations of redshift-space distortions in spectroscopic galaxy surveysoffer an attractive method for observing the build-up of cosmologicalstructure, which depends both on the expansion rate of the universe and ourtheory of gravity. in preparation for analysis of redshift-space distortionsfrom the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) final data release wecompare a number of analytic and phenomenological `streaming' models, specifiedin configuration space, to mock catalogs derived in different ways from severaln-body simulations. the galaxies in each mock catalog have properties similarto those of the higher redshift galaxies measured by boss but differ in thedetails of how small-scale velocities and halo occupancy are determined. wefind that all of the analytic models fit the simulations over a limited rangeof scales while failing at small scales. we discuss which models are mostrobust and on which scales they return reliable estimates of the rate of growthof structure: we find that models based on some form of resummation can fit ourn-body data for boss-like galaxies above $30\,h^{-1}$mpc well enough to returnunbiased parameter estimates.

1410.1181	collision-free motion planning for fiber positioner robots:  discretization of velocity profiles	the next generation of large-scale spectroscopic survey experiments such asdesi, will use thousands of fiber positioner robots packed on a focal plate. inorder to maximize the observing time with this robotic system we need to movein parallel the fiber-ends of all positioners from the previous to the nexttarget coordinates. direct trajectories are not feasible due to collision risksthat could undeniably damage the robots and impact the survey operation andperformance. we have previously developed a motion planning method based on anovel decentralized navigation function for collision-free coordination offiber positioners. the navigation function takes into account the configurationof positioners as well as their envelope constraints. the motion planningscheme has linear complexity and short motion duration (~2.5 seconds with themaximum speed of 30 rpm for the positioner), which is independent of the numberof positioners. these two key advantages of the decentralization designate themethod as a promising solution for the collision-free motion-planning problemin the next-generation of fiber-fed spectrographs. in a framework where acentralized computer communicates with the positioner robots, communicationoverhead can be reduced significantly by using velocity profiles consisting ofa few bits only. we present here the discretization of velocity profiles toensure the feasibility of a real-time coordination for a large number ofpositioners. the modified motion planning method that generates piecewiselinearized position profiles guarantees collision-free trajectories for all therobots. the velocity profiles fit few bits at the expense of highercomputational costs.

1410.4684	hunting down systematics in baryon acoustic oscillations after cosmic  high noon	future dark energy experiments will require better and more accuratetheoretical predictions for the baryonic acoustic oscillations (bao) signaturein the spectrum of cosmological perturbations. here, we use large n-bodysimulations of the \lambdacdm planck cosmology to study any possible systematicshifts and damping in bao due to the impact of nonlinear gravitational growthof structure, scale dependent and non-local bias, and redshift-spacedistortions. the effect of cosmic variance is largely reduced by dividing thetracer power spectrum by that from a bao-free simulation starting with the samephases. this permits us to study with unprecedented accuracy (better than 0.02%for dark matter and 0.07% for low-bias halos) small shifts of the pristine baowavenumbers towards larger k, and non-linear damping of bao wiggles in thepower spectrum of dark matter and halo populations in the redshift range z=0-1.for dark matter, we provide an accurate parametrization of the evolution of\alpha as a function of the linear growth factor d(z). for halo samples, withbias ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, we measure a typical bao shift of ~0.25%,observed in real-space, which does not show an appreciable evolution withredshift within the uncertainties. moreover, we report a constant shift as afunction of halo bias. we find a different evolution of the damping of theacoustic feature in all halo samples as compared to dark matter with haloessuffering less damping, and also find some weak dependence on bias. a largerbao shift and damping is measured in redshift-space which can be well explainedby linear theory due to redshift-space distortions. a clear modulation in phasewith the acoustic scale is observed in the scale-dependent halo bias due to thepresence of the baryonic acoustic oscillations.

1411.1074	cosmological implications of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao)  measurements	we derive constraints on cosmological parameters and tests of dark energymodels from the combination of baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) measurementswith cosmic microwave background (cmb) and type ia supernova (sn) data. we takeadvantage of high-precision bao measurements from galaxy clustering and thely-alpha forest (lyaf) in the boss survey of sdss-iii. bao data alone yield ahigh confidence detection of dark energy, and in combination with the cmbangular acoustic scale they further imply a nearly flat universe. combining baoand sn data into an "inverse distance ladder" yields a 1.7% measurement of$h_0=67.3 \pm1.1$ km/s/mpc. this measurement assumes standard pre-recombinationphysics but is insensitive to assumptions about dark energy or space curvature,so agreement with cmb-based estimates that assume a flat lcdm cosmology is animportant corroboration of this minimal cosmological model. for open lcdm, ourbao+sn+cmb combination yields $\omega_m=0.301 \pm 0.008$ and curvature$\omega_k=-0.003 \pm 0.003$. when we allow more general forms of evolving darkenergy, the bao+sn+cmb parameter constraints remain consistent with flat lcdm.while the overall $\chi^2$ of model fits is satisfactory, the lyaf baomeasurements are in moderate (2-2.5 sigma) tension with model predictions.models with early dark energy that tracks the dominant energy component at highredshifts remain consistent with our constraints. expansion history aloneyields an upper limit of 0.56 ev on the summed mass of neutrino species,improving to 0.26 ev if we include planck cmb lensing. standard dark energymodels constrained by our data predict a level of matter clustering that ishigh compared to most, but not all, observational estimates.

1412.7729	nifty cosmology: galaxy/halo mock catalogue comparison project on  clustering statistics	we present a comparison of major methodologies of fast generating mock haloor galaxy catalogues. the comparison is done for two-point and the three-pointclustering statistics. the reference catalogues are drawn from the bigmultidarkn-body simulation. both friend-of-friends (including distinct halos only) andspherical overdensity (including distinct halos and subhalos) catalogs havebeen used with the typical number density of a large-volume galaxy surveys. wedemonstrate that a proper biasing model is essential for reproducing the powerspectrum at quasilinear and even smaller scales. with respect to variousclustering statistics a methodology based on perturbation theory and arealistic biasing model leads to very good agreement with n-body simulations.however, for the quadrupole of the correlation function or the power spectrum,only the method based on semi-n-body simulation could reach high accuracy (1%level) at small scales, i.e., r&lt;25 mpc/h or k&gt;0.15 h/mpc. full n-body solutionswill remain indispensable to produce reference catalogues. nevertheless, wehave demonstrated that the far more efficient approximate solvers can reach afew percent accuracy in terms of clustering statistics at the scalesinteresting for the large-scale structure analysis after calibration with a fewreference n-body calculations. this makes them useful for massive productionaimed at covariance studies, to scan large parameter spaces, and to estimateuncertainties in data analysis techniques, such as baryon acoustic oscillationreconstruction, redshift distortion measurements, etc.

1501.05520	halo mass distribution reconstruction across the cosmic web	we study the relation between halo mass and its environment from aprobabilistic perspective. we find that halo mass depends not only on localdark matter density, but also on non-local quantities such as the cosmic webenvironment and the halo-exclusion effect. given these accurate relations, wehave developed the hadron-code (halo mass distribution reconstruction), atechnique which permits us to assign halo masses to a distribution of haloes inthree-dimensional space. this can be applied to the fast production of mockgalaxy catalogues, by assigning halo masses, and reproducing accurately thebias for different mass cuts. the resulting clustering of the halo populationsagree well with that drawn from the bigmultidark $n$-body simulation: the powerspectra are within 1-$\sigma$ up to scales of $k=0.2\,h\,{\rm mpc}^{-1}$, whenusing augmented lagrangian perturbation theory based mock catalogues. only themost massive haloes show a larger deviation. for these, we find evidence of thehalo-exclusion effect. a clear improvement is achieved when assigning thehighest masses to haloes with a minimum distance separation. we also computethe 2- and 3-point correlation functions, and find an excellent agreement with$n$-body results. our work represents a quantitative application of the cosmicweb classification. it can have further interesting applications in themulti-tracer analysis of the large-scale structure for future galaxy surveys.

1507.08724	bayesian redshift-space distortions correction from galaxy redshift  surveys	we present a bayesian reconstruction method which maps a galaxy distributionfrom redshift-space to real-space inferring the distances of the individualgalaxies. the method is based on sampling density fields assuming a lognormalprior with a likelihood given by the negative binomial distribution functionmodelling stochastic bias. we assume a deterministic bias given by a power lawrelating the dark matter density field to the expected halo or galaxy field.coherent redshift-space distortions are corrected in a gibbs-sampling procedureby moving the galaxies from redshift-space to real-space according to thepeculiar motions derived from the recovered density field using linear theorywith the option to include tidal field corrections from second order lagrangianperturbation theory. the virialised distortions are corrected by samplingcandidate real-space positions (being in the neighbourhood of the observationsalong the line of sight), which are compatible with the bulk flow correctedredshift-space position adding a random dispersion term in high densitycollapsed regions. the latter are defined according to the eigenvalues of thehessian. this approach presents an alternative method to estimate the distancesto galaxies using the three dimensional spatial information, and assumingisotropy. hence the number of applications is very broad. in this work we showthe potential of this method to constrain the growth rate up to $k$ ~ 0.3 $h$mpc$^{-1}$. furthermore it could be useful to correct for photo-metric redshifterrors, and to obtain improved bao reconstructions.

(2003b).in addition, we have achieved a high redshift completeness in our galaxysamples. firstly, by making use of the survey masks, provided by the nyu-vagcdr6, we have been able to define an area on the sky of high angular redshiftcompleteness. secondly, we guarantee that brightness-dependent redshiftincompleteness is small within the magnitude ranges that define our galaxysamples. with these advances, we have estimated very accurate sdss dr6 lfs inboth the bright and the faint end. in the {0.1}^r-band, our sdss dr6 luminosityfunction is well fitted by a schechter lf with parameters phi_{*}=0.90 +/-0.07$, m_{*}-5log_{10}h=-20.73 +/- 0.04 and alpha=-1.23 +/- 0.02. as comparedwith previous results, we find some notable differences. in the bright end ofthe {0.1}^u-band luminosity function we find a remarkable excess, of ~1.7 dexat m_{{0.1}^u}=-20.5, with respect to the best-fit schechter lf. this excessweakens in the {0.1}^g-band, fading away towards the very red {0.1}^z-band. apreliminary analysis on the nature of this bright-end bump reveals that it ismostly comprised of active galaxies and qsos. it seems, therefore, that animportant fraction of this exceeding luminosity may come from nuclear activity.in the faint end of the sdss dr6 luminosity functions, where we can reach 1-1.5magnitudes deeper than the previous sdss lf estimation, we obtain a steeperslope [abridged].

0807.3027	the dark outside: the density profile of dark matter haloes beyond the  virial radius	we present an approximation for the average density profile of dark matterhaloes in the lambdacdm cosmological model, which is accurate to within 10--15%even for large radial distances from 0.05r_{vir} up to 10r_{vir} for halomasses ranging from 10^{11.5} to 10^{15.0} h^{-1}m_{sun}. we propose a modifiedform of the navarro, frenk &amp; white (nfw) approximation: \rho(r)=\rho_{nfw}(r)+a (r/r_{vir})^{-1}+b (1+r/r_{vir})^{-1}. this generalized expression, which isapplicable to the external regions of dark matter haloes, only very slightlyaffects the density in the inner regions of haloes. the strong correlationamong the different parameters in the model allows us to describe the profilein terms of just one parameter: the virial mass. we integrate our densityprofile to derive the enclosed mass in a sphere of a given radius and compareit with the nfw results. we find that the nfw underestimates the enclosed massby more than 50% at 10r_{vir}, whereas our model reproduces the results fromnumerical simulations to within 2% accuracy even at this distance. we also usethis new approximation to study the weak gravitational lensing and to obtain ananalytic expression for the tangential shear. this allows us to quantify thecontribution to the shear from the outer regions of the density profile. forthe first time we calculate the difference between the tangential shearcalculated via the nfw profile and the corresponding result when the externalregions of haloes in cosmological simulations are taken into account. we find a4% difference for all the mass ranges under study.

astro-ph;0204383	dynamical confirmation of sdss weak lensing scaling laws	galaxy masses can be estimated by a variety of methods; each applicable indifferent circumstances, and each suffering from different systematicuncertainties. confirmation of results obtained by one technique with analysisby another is particularly important. recent sdss weak lensing measurements ofthe projected-mass correlation function reveal a linear relation between galaxyluminosities and the depth of their dark matter halos (measured on 260 \hinvkpc scales). in this work we use an entirely independent dynamical method toconfirm these results. we begin by assembling a sample of 618 relativelyisolated host galaxies, surrounded by a total of 1225 substantially faintersatellites. we observe the mean dynamical effect of these hosts on the motionsof their satellites by assembling velocity difference histograms. dividing thesample by host properties, we find significant variations in satellite velocitydispersion with host luminosity. we quantify these variations using a simpledynamical model, measuring \mtsd a dynamical mass within 260 \hinv kpc. theappropriateness of this mass reconstruction is checked by conducting a similaranalysis within an n-body simulation. comparison between the dynamical andlensing mass-to-light scalings shows reasonable agreement, providing somequantitative confirmation for the lensing results.

astro-ph;0210487	a survey for large separation lensed first quasars, ii. magnification  bias and redshift distribution	the statistics of large-separation gravitational lensing are a powerful toolto probe mass distributions on the scale of galaxy clusters. in this paper werefine the analysis of our survey for large-separation (&gt;5'') lensed firstquasars (ofek et al. 2001) by estimating the magnification bias and the sourceredshift distribution. finding no large separation lens among 8000 likelyquasars in that sample, implies an upper bound on the lensed fraction of 3.7 x10^-4 at 95% cl. from a published deep 1.4 ghz radio survey of the hubble deepfield, and corresponding optical searches for faint quasars, we calculate alower limit to the `double flux magnification bias' affecting ourradio-optically selected sample, of b&gt;1.1. from the four-colour information inthe sdss early data release, we calculate the photometric redshift distributionof a sample of first quasar candidates and compare it with the redshiftdistribution from the first bright quasar survey. we find that the medianredshift of the quasars in our sample is about 1.4. with these new results, wefind that for all plausible cosmologies, the absence of lensed quasars in oursurvey is consistent with a model based on an empirical, non-evolving, clustermass function, where clusters are represented by singular isothermal spheres.on the other hand, comparison of our results to the lensing predictions ofpublished n-body-ray-tracing simulations (wambsganss et al. 1995, 1998) rejectsthe cobe normalised \omega_{0}=1 cdm model at 99.9% confidence.

astro-ph;0301360	observing the dark matter density profile of isolated galaxies	using the sloan digital sky survey (sdss), we probe the halo massdistribution by studying the velocities of satellites orbiting isolatedgalaxies. in a subsample that covers 2500 sq. degrees on the sky, we detectabout 3000 satellites with absolute blue magnitudes going down to m_b = -14;most of the satellites have m_b=-16 to -18, comparable to the magnitudes of m32and the magellanic clouds. after a careful, model-independent removal ofinterlopers, we find that the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of satellitesdeclines with distance to the primary. for an l* galaxy the r.m.s.line-of-sight velocity changes from ~120 km/s at 20 kpc to ~60 km/s at 350 kpc.this decline agrees remarkably well with theoretical expectations, as allmodern cosmological models predict that the density of dark matter in theperipheral parts of galaxies declines as rho_dm propto r^{-3}. thus, for thefirst time we find direct observational evidence of the density declinepredicted by cosmological models; we also note that this result contradictsalternative theories of gravity such as mond. we also find that the velocitydispersion of satellites within 100 kpc scales with the absolute magnitude ofthe central galaxy as sigma propto l^{0.3}; this is very close to thetully-fisher relation for normal spiral galaxies.

astro-ph;0308178	the near-ir properties and continuum shapes of high redshift quasars  from the sloan digital sky survey	we present j-h-k' photometry for a sample of 45 high redshift quasars foundby the sloan digital sky survey. the sample was originally selected on thebasis of optical colors and spans a redshift range from 3.6 to 5.03. ourphotometry reflects the rest-frame  sed longward of ly alpha for all redshifts. the results show that the near-ircolors of high redshift quasars are quite uniform. we have modelled thecontinuum shape of the quasars (from just beyond ly alpha to ~4000 a) with apower law of the form f_nu \propto nu^alpha, and find &lt;alpha &gt; =-0.57 with ascatter of 0.33. this value is similar to what is found for lower redshiftquasars over the same restframe wavelength range, and we conclude that there ishardly any evolution in the continuum properties of optically selected quasarsup to redshift 5. the spectral indices found by combining near-ir with opticalphotometry are in general consistent but slightly flatter than what is foundfor the same quasars using the optical spectra and photometry alone, showingthat the continuum region used to determine the spectral indices can somewhatinfluence the results.

astro-ph;0310644	low-surface-brightness galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey. i.  search method and test sample	in this paper we present results of a pilot study to use imaging data fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) to search for low-surface-brightness (lsb)galaxies. for our pilot study we use a test sample of 92 galaxies from thecatalog of impey et al. (1996) distributed over 93 sdss fields of the earlydata release (edr). many galaxies from the test sample are either lsb or dwarfgalaxies. to deal with the sdss data most effectively a new photometry softwarewas created, which is described in this paper. we present the results of theselection algorithms applied to these 93 edr fields. two galaxies from theimpey et al. test sample are very likely artifacts, as confirmed by follow-upimaging. with our algorithms, we were able to recover 87 of the 90 remainingtest sample galaxies, implying a detection rate of $\sim$96.5%. the threemissed galaxies fall too close to very bright stars or galaxies. in addition,42 new galaxies with parameters similar to the test sample objects were foundin these edr fields (i.e., $\sim$47% additional galaxies). we present the mainphotometric parameters of all identified galaxies and carry out firststatistical comparisons. we tested the quality of our photometry by comparingthe magnitudes for our test sample galaxies and other bright galaxies withvalues from the literature. all these tests yielded consistent results. webriefly discuss a few unusual galaxies found in our pilot study, including anlsb galaxy with a two-component disk and ten new giant lsb galaxies.

astro-ph;0407513	on an analytical framework for voids: their abundances, density profiles  and local mass functions	we present a general analytical procedure for computing the number density ofvoids with radius above a given value within the context of gravitationalformation of the large scale structure of the universe out of gaussian initialconditions. to this end we develop an accurate (under generally satisfiedconditions) extension of unconditional mass function to constrainedenvironments, which allowes us both to obtain the number density of collapsedobjects of certain mass at any distance from the center of the void, and toderive the number density of voids defined by those collapsed objects. we havemade detailed calculations for the spherically averaged mass density and halonumber density profiles for individual voids. we also present a formalexpression for the number density of voids defined by galaxies of a given typeand luminosity. this expression contains the probability for a collapsed objectof certain mass to host a galaxy of that type and luminosity as a function ofthe environmental density. we propose a procedure to infer this function, whichmay provide useful clues as to the galaxy formation process, from the observedvoid densities.

astro-ph;0411694	dark matter distribution in the draco dwarf from velocity moments	we study the distribution of dark matter in the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxyby modelling the moments of the line-of-sight velocity distribution of starsobtained from new velocity data of wilkinson et al. the luminosity distributionis approximated by a sersic profile fitted to the data by odenkirchen et al. weassume that the dark matter density profile is given by a formula with an innercusp and an outer exponential cut-off, as recently proposed by kazantzidis etal. as a result of simulations of tidal stripping of dwarfs by the potential ofthe milky way. the dark matter distribution is characterized by the total darkmass and the cut-off radius. the models have arbitrary velocity anisotropyparameter assumed to be constant with radius. we estimate the three parametersby fitting both the line-of-sight velocity dispersion and kurtosis profiles,which allows us to break the degeneracy between the mass distribution andvelocity anisotropy. the results of the fitting procedure turn out to be verydifferent depending on the stellar sample considered, that is on our choice ofstars with discrepant velocities to be discarded as interlopers. for our mostreliable sample, the model parameters remain weakly constrained, but the robustresult is the preference for weakly tangential stellar orbits and highmass-to-light ratios. the best-fitting total mass is then 7 10^7 m_sun, muchlower than recent estimates, while the mass-to-light ratio is m/l_v = 300 andalmost constant with radius. if the binary fraction in the stellar populationof draco turns out to be significant, the kurtosis of the global velocitydistribution will be smaller and the orbits inferred will be more tangential,while the resulting mass estimate lower.

astro-ph;0504581	dark matter and stellar mass in the luminous regions of disk galaxies	we investigate the correlations among stellar mass (m_*), disk scale length(r_d), and rotation velocity at 2.2 disk scale lengths (v_2.2) for a sample of81 disk-dominated galaxies (disk/total &gt;= 0.9) selected from the sdss. wemeasure v_2.2 from long-slit h-alpha rotation curves and infer m_* from galaxyi-band luminosities (l_i) and g-r colors. we find logarithmic slopes of2.60+/-0.13 and 3.05+/-0.12 for the l_i-v_2.2 and m_*-v_2.2 relations, somewhatshallower than most previous studies, with intrinsic scatter of 0.13 dex and0.16 dex. our direct estimates of the total-to-stellar mass ratio within2.2r_d, assuming a kroupa imf, yield a median ratio of 2.4 for m_*&gt;10^10 msunand 4.4 for m_*=10^9-10^10 msun, with large scatter at a given m_* and r_d. thetypical ratio of the rotation speed predicted for the stellar disk alone to theobserved rotation speed at 2.2r_d is ~0.65. the distribution of r_d at fixedm_* is broad, but we find no correlation between disk size and the residualfrom the m_*-v_2.2 relation, implying that this relation is an approximatelyedge-on view of the disk galaxy fundamental plane. independent of the assumedimf, this result implies that stellar disks do not, on average, dominate themass within 2.2r_d. we discuss our results in the context of infall models ofdisk formation in cold dark matter halos. a model with a disk-to-halo massratio m_d=0.05 provides a reasonable match to the r_d-m_* distribution for spinparameters \lambda ranging from ~0.04-0.08, and it yields a reasonable match tothe mean m_*-v_2.2 relation. a model with m_d=0.1 predicts overly strongcorrelations between disk size and m_*-v_2.2 residual. explaining the widerange of halo-to-disk mass ratios within 2.2r_d requires significant scatter inm_d values, with systematically lower m_d for galaxies with lower $m_*$.

astro-ph;0506668	statistics of voids in the 2df galaxy redshift survey	we present a statistical analysis of voids in the 2df galaxy redshift survey(2dfgrs). in order to detect the voids, we have developed two robustalgorithms. we define voids as non-overlapping maximal spheres empty of halosor galaxies with mass or luminosity above a given one. we search for voids incosmological $n$-body simulations to test the performance of our void finders.we obtain and analyze the void statistics for several volume-limited samplesfor the north galactic strip (ngp) and the south galactic strip (sgp)constructed from the 2dfgrs full data release. we find that the resultsobtained from the ngp and the sgp are statistically compatible. from theresults of several statistical tests we conclude that voids are essentiallyuncorrelated, with at most a mild anticorrelation and that there is adependence of the void number density on redshift at least at the 99.5%confidence level. we develop a technique to correct the distortion caused bythe fact that we use the redshift as the radial coordinate. we calibrate thistechnique with mock catalogues and find that the correction might be of somerelevance to carry out accurate inferences from void statistics. we study thestatistics of the galaxies inside nine nearby voids. we find that galaxies invoids are not randomly distributed: they form structures like filaments. wealso obtain the galaxy number density profile in voids. this profile follow asimilar but steeper trend to that follow by halos in voids.

astro-ph;0507508	the complex velocity distribution of galaxies in abell 1689:  implications for mass modelling	the abell 1689 galaxy cluster has recently become a subject of intensivestudy. thanks to its intermediate redshift (z=0.183) its mass distribution canbe reconstructed using numerous methods including gravitational lensing, galaxykinematics and x-ray imaging. the methods used to yield conflicting massestimates in the past and recently the cluster mass distribution has beenclaimed to be in conflict with standard cdm scenarios due to rather largeconcentration and steep mass profile obtained from detailed studies ofbroadhurst et al. using lensing. by studying in detail the kinematics of about200 galaxies with measured redshifts in the vicinity of the cluster we showthat the cluster is probably surrounded by a few structures, quite distant fromeach other, but aligned along the line of sight. we support our arguments byreferring to cosmological n-body simulations and showing explicitly thatdistant, non-interacting haloes can produce entangled multi-peak line-of-sightvelocity distributions similar to that in a1689. we conclude that it isdifficult to estimate the cluster mass reliably from galaxy kinematics, but thevalue we obtain after applying a simple cut-off in velocity agrees roughly withthe mass estimated from lensing. the complicated mass distribution around thecluster may however increase the uncertainty in the determination of thedensity profile shape obtained with weak lensing.

astro-ph;0509897	detailed theoretical predictions of the outskirts of dark matter halos	in the present work we describe the formalism necessary to derive theproperties of dark matter halos beyond two virial radius using the sphericalcollapse model (without shell crossing), and provide the framework for thetheoretical prediction presented in prada et al. (2005). we show in detail howto obtain within this model the probability distribution for thespherically-averaged enclosed density at any radii p(delta,r). using thisprobability distribution, we compute the most probable and mean densityprofiles, which turns out to differ considerably from each other. we also showhow to obtain the typical profile, as well as the probability distribution andmean profile for the spherically averaged radial velocity. two probabilitydistributions are obtained: a first one is derived using a simple assumption,that is, if q is the virial radius in lagrangian coordinates, then the enclosedlinear contrast delta_l(q,q) must satisfy the condition that delta_l(q=q) =delta_vir, where delta_vir is the linear density contrast within the virialradius rvir at the moment of virialization. then we introduce an additionalconstraint to obtain a more accurate p(delta,r) which reproduces to a higherdegree of precision the distribution of the spherically averaged encloseddensity found in the simulations. this new constraint is delta_l(q,q) &lt;delta_vir for all q &gt; q, which means that there are no radii larger than rvirwhere the density contrast is larger than that used to define the virialradius. finally, we compare in detail our theoretical predictions for theprobability distributions with the results found in the simulations.

astro-ph;0511723	mass distribution in nearby abell clusters	we study the mass distribution in six nearby (z&lt;0.06) relaxed abell clustersof galaxies a0262, a0496, a1060, a2199, a3158 and a3558. given the dominance ofdark matter in galaxy clusters we approximate their total density distributionby the nfw formula characterized by virial mass and concentration. we alsoassume that the anisotropy of galactic orbits is reasonably well described by aconstant and that galaxy distribution traces that of the total density. usingthe velocity and position data for 120-420 galaxies per cluster we calculate,after removal of interlopers, the profiles of the lowest-order even velocitymoments, dispersion and kurtosis. we then reproduce the velocity moments byjointly fitting the moments to the solutions of the jeans equations. includingthe kurtosis in the analysis allows us to break the degeneracy between the massdistribution and anisotropy and constrain the anisotropy as well as the virialmass and concentration. the method is tested in detail on mock data extractedfrom n-body simulations of dark matter haloes. we find that the best-fittinggalactic orbits are remarkably close to isotropic in most clusters. using thefitted pairs of mass and concentration parameters for the six clusters weconclude that the trend of decreasing concentration for higher masses found incosmological n-body simulations is consistent with the data. by scaling theindividual cluster data by mass we combine them to create a composite clusterwith 1465 galaxies and perform a similar analysis on such sample. the estimatedconcentration parameter then lies in the range 1.5 &lt; c &lt; 14 and the anisotropyparameter in the range -1.1 &lt; \beta &lt; 0.5 at the 95 percent confidence level.

astro-ph;0512376	constraining the projected radial distribution of galactic satellites  with the sloan digital sky survey	we use the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) spectroscopic sample to constrainthe projected radial distribution of satellites around isolated ~ l* galaxies.we employ mock galaxy catalogs derived from high-resolution cosmologicalsimulations to investigate the effects of interloper contamination and showthat interlopers significantly bias the estimated slope of the projected radialdistribution of satellites. we also show that the distribution of interlopersaround galaxies is expected to be non-uniform in velocity space becausegalaxies are clustered and reside in crowded environments. successful methodsof interloper contamination correction should therefore take into accountenvironments of the host galaxies. two such new methods are presented and themost reliable of them is used to correct for interloper contamination inanalyses of the sdss galaxy sample. the best fit power-law slope of theinterloper-corrected surface density distribution of satellites, sigma(r) ~r^alpha, in the volume-limited sdss sample is alpha ~ -1.7 +/- 0.1, independentof the galaxy and satellite luminosities. comparison with lambda-cdmsimulations shows that the radial distribution of the sdss satellites is moreconcentrated than that of subhalos around galaxy-sized halos, especially at r &lt;100 kpc/h. the predicted dark matter radial distribution is somewhat moreconcentrated than the profile of the sdss satellites, but the difference is notstatistically significant for our sample.

astro-ph;0605703	the properties of galaxies in voids	we present a comparison of the properties of galaxies in the most underdenseregions of the universe, where the galaxy number density is less than 10% ofthe mean density, with galaxies from more typical regions. we have compiled asample of galaxies in 46 large nearby voids that were identified using thesloan digital sky survey dr4, which provides the largest coverage of the sky.we study the u-r color distribution, morphology, specific star formation rate,and radial number density profiles for a total of 495 galaxies fainter thanm_r=-20.4 +5logh located inside the voids and compare these properties with acontrol sample of field galaxies. we show that there is an excess of bluegalaxies inside the voids. however, inspecting the properties of blue and redgalaxies separately, we find that galaxy properties such as color distribution,bulge-to-total ratios, and concentrations are remarkably similar between thevoid and overall sample. the void galaxies also show the same specific starformation rate at fixed color as the control galaxies. we compare our resultswith the predictions of cosmological simulations of galaxy formation using themillennium run semi-analytic galaxy catalog. we show that the properties of thesimulated galaxies in large voids are in reasonably good agreement with thosefound in similar environments in the real universe. to summarize, in spite ofthe fact that galaxies in voids live in the least dense large-scaleenvironment, this environment makes very little impact on properties ofgalaxies.

astro-ph;0606570	is there a fundamental line for disk galaxies?	we show that there are strong local correlations between metallicity, surfacebrightness, and dynamical mass-to-light ratio within m33, analogous to thefundamental line of dwarf galaxies identified by prada &amp; burkert (2002). usingnear-infrared imaging from 2mass, the published rotation curve of m33, andliterature measurements of the metallicities of hii regions and supergiantstars, we demonstrate that these correlations hold for points at radialdistances between 140 pc and 6.2 kpc from the center of the galaxy. at a givenmetallicity or surface brightness, m33 has a mass-to-light ratio approximatelyfour times as large as the local group dwarf galaxies; other than this constantoffset, we see broad agreement between the m33 and dwarf galaxy data. we useanalytical arguments to show that at least two of the three fundamental linecorrelations are basic properties of disk galaxies that can be derived fromvery general assumptions. we investigate the effect of supernova feedback onthe fundamental line with numerical models and conclude that while feedbackclearly controls the scatter in the fundamental line, it is not needed tocreate the fundamental line itself, in agreement with our analyticalcalculations. we also compare the m33 data with measurements of a simulateddisk galaxy, finding that the simulation reproduces the trends in the datacorrectly and matches the fundamental line, although the metallicity of thesimulated galaxy is too high, and the surface brightness is lower than that ofm33.

astro-ph;0606579	interloper treatment in dynamical modelling of galaxy clusters	the aim of this paper is to study the efficiency of different approaches tointerloper treatment in dynamical modelling of galaxy clusters. usingcosmological n-body simulation of standard lcdm model, we select 10 massivedark matter haloes and use their particles to emulate mock kinematic data interms of projected galaxy positions and velocities as they would be measured bya distant observer. taking advantage of the full 3d information available fromthe simulation, we select samples of interlopers defined with differentcriteria. the interlopers thus selected provide means to assess the efficiencyof different interloper removal schemes found in the literature. we studydirect methods of interloper removal based on dynamical or statisticalrestrictions imposed on ranges of positions and velocities available to clustermembers. in determining these ranges, we use either the velocity dispersioncriterion or a maximum velocity profile. we also generalize the commonapproaches taking into account both the position and velocity information.another criterion is based on the dependence of the commonly used virial massand projected mass estimators on the presence of interlopers. we find that thedirect methods exclude on average 60-70 percent of unbound particles producinga sample with contamination as low as 2-4 percent. next, we consider indirectmethods of interloper treatment which are applied to the data stacked from manyobjects. in these approaches, interlopers are treated in a statistical way as auniform background which modifies the distribution of cluster members. using abayesian approach, we reproduce the properties of composite clusters andestimate the probability of finding an interloper as a function of distancefrom the object centre.

astro-ph;0607204	evolution in the halo masses of isolated galaxies between z~1 and z~0:  from deep2 to sdss	we measure the evolution in the virial mass-to-light ratio (m_{200}/l_b) andvirial-to-stellar mass ratio (m_{200}/m_\ast) for isolated ~ l* galaxiesbetween z~1 and z~0 by combining data from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey andthe sloan digital sky survey. utilizing the motions of satellite galaxiesaround isolated galaxies, we measure line-of-sight velocity dispersions andderive dark matter halo virial masses for these host galaxies. at both epochsthe velocity dispersion of satellites correlates with host galaxy stellar mass,\sigma\propto m_\ast^{0.4+/-0.1}, while the relation between satellite velocitydispersion and host galaxy b-band luminosity may grow somewhat shallower from\sigma\propto l_b^{0.6+/-0.1} at z~1 to \sigma\propto l_b^{0.4+/-0.1} at z~0.the evolution in m_200/m_\ast from z~1 to z~0 displays a bimodality insofar ashost galaxies with stellar mass below m_\ast ~10^{11} m_sun/h maintain aconstant ratio (the intrinsic increase is constrained to a factor of 1.1+/-0.7)while host galaxies above m_\ast ~10^{11} m_sun/h experience a factor of 4+/-3increase in their virial-to-stellar mass ratio. this result can be easilyunderstood if galaxies below this stellar mass scale continue to form starswhile star formation in galaxies above this scale is quenched and the darkmatter halos of galaxies both above and below this scale grow in accordancewith lcdm cosmological simulations. host galaxies that are red in u-b colorhave larger satellite dispersions and hence reside on average in more massivehalos than blue galaxies at both z~1 and z~0. the redshift and host galaxystellar mass dependence of m_200/m_\ast agrees qualitatively with themillennium run semi-analytic model of galaxy formation.

astro-ph;0607394	dark matter halos of disk galaxies: constraints from the tully-fisher  relation	we investigate structural properties of dark matter halos of disk galaxies inlcdm cosmology, using a well-defined sample of 81 disk-dominated galaxies fromthe sdss redshift survey. we model the mass-velocity and fundamental planerelations of these galaxies, which are constructed from the galaxy stellarmass, disk scale length, and optical halpha rotation velocity at 2.2 scalelengths. we calculate a sequence of model galaxy populations, defined by thedistribution of the stellar disk-to-total mass fraction, m_d. we include theeffect of adiabatic contraction of dark matter halos in response tocondensation of baryons. we find that models with constant m_d underpredict theintrinsic scatter of the tf and fp relations and predict an (unobserved) strongcorrelation between tf residuals. introducing a scatter of disk mass fractionsand allowing the mean value m_d to scale with the stellar surface densitysignificantly improves observational match of both the slope and intercept ofthe tf relation and reduces the predicted residual correlation enough to beconsistent with the data. our best-fit models with a kroupa stellar imfover-produce the galaxy stellar mass function and predict the virial r-bandmass-to-light ratios, m_vir/l_r, systematically lower than those inferred fromgalaxy-galaxy weak lensing and satellite dynamics. we investigate threepossible solutions to these problems: (1) ignoring the effects of adiabaticcontraction, (2) adopting a ``light'' stellar imf, or (3) considering the lowerhalo concentrations predicted for a low cosmological power spectrumnormalization. any of these solutions yields acceptable residual correlationsand relieves most of the observational tension between the tf relation and thegalaxy stellar mass function (abridged).

astro-ph;0608472	the tully-fisher relation and its residuals for a broadly selected  sample of galaxies	we measure the relation between galaxy luminosity and disk circular velocity(the tully-fisher [tf] relation), in the g, r, i, and z-bands, for a broadlyselected sample of galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey, with the goal ofproviding well defined observational constraints for theoretical models ofgalaxy formation. the input sample of 234 galaxies has a roughly flatdistribution of absolute magnitudes in the range -18.5 &gt; mr &gt; -22, and our onlymorphological selection is an axis-ratio cut b/a &lt; 0.6 to allow accurateinclination corrections. long-slit spectroscopy yields usable h-alpha rotationcurves for 162 galaxies. observational errors, including distance errors due topeculiar velocities, are small compared to the intrinsic scatter of the tfrelation. the slope of the forward tf relation steepens from -5.5 +/- 0.2mag/log(km/s) in the g-band to -6.6 +/- 0.2 mag/log(km/s) in the z-band. theintrinsic scatter is approximately 0.4 mag in all bands. the scatter is notdominated by rare outliers or by any particular class of galaxies, though itdrops slightly, to 0.36 mag, if we restrict the sample to nearly bulgelesssystems. correlations of tf residuals with other galaxy properties are weak:bluer galaxies are significantly brighter than average in the g-band but onlymarginally brighter in the i-band; more concentrated galaxies are slightlyfainter than average; and the tf residual is virtually independent ofhalf-light radius, contrary to the trend expected for gravitationally dominantdisks. the observed residual correlations do not account for most of theintrinsic scatter, implying that this scatter is instead driven largely byvariations in the ratio of dark to luminous matter within the disk galaxypopulation.

astro-ph;0611296	mass modelling of dwarf spheroidal galaxies: the effect of unbound stars  from tidal tails and the milky way	we study the origin and properties of the population of unbound stars in thekinematic samples of dwarf spheroidal galaxies. for this purpose we have run ahigh resolution n-body simulation of a two-component dwarf galaxy orbiting in amilky way potential. the dwarf is placed on a highly eccentric orbit, itsinitial stellar component is in the form of an exponential disk and it has anfw-like dark matter halo. after 10 gyrs of evolution the dwarf produces aspheroidal stellar component and is strongly tidally stripped so that massfollows light and the stars are on almost isotropic orbits. from this finalstate, we create mock kinematic data sets for 200 stars by observing the dwarfin different directions. we find that when the dwarf is observed along thetidal tails the kinematic samples are strongly contaminated by unbound starsfrom the tails. we also study another source of possible contamination byadding stars from the milky way. we demonstrate that most of the unbound starscan be removed by the method of interloper rejection proposed by den hartog &amp;katgert. we model the cleaned-up kinematic samples using solutions of the jeansequation with constant mass-to-light ratio and velocity anisotropy parameter.we show that the jeans analysis, when applied to cleaned samples, allows us toreproduce the mass and mass-to-light ratio of the dwarf with accuracy typicallybetter than 25 percent. the analysis was applied to the new data for the fornaxdsph galaxy. we show that after careful removal of interlopers the velocitydispersion profile of fornax can be reproduced by a model in which mass traceslight with a mass-to-light ratio of 11 solar units and isotropic orbits. wedemonstrate that most of the contamination in the kinematic sample of fornaxprobably originates from the milky way.

astro-ph;9711262	the stellar and gaseous kinematics in ngc 253	this paper presents observations with intermediate spectral and spatialresolution along the major and minor axes of the starburst galaxy ngc 253. thespectral ranges analyzed are in the region of the stellar mgib (5175 a), thenear ir caii triplet (8550 a) absorption features, and the region of the halphaemission line. we have compared the shape of the stellar features with those ofreference stars and determined the line-of-sight velocity distribution (losvd)of the stellar component by using a two-dimensional gaussian decompositionalgorithm, and show for the first time the rotation curve of the stellarcomponent in ngc 253. comparing the recesion velocity curves of the gas andstars, it is seen that the stellar component has a decoupled kinematics respectto the gas, displaying a shollower velocity gradient and larger velocitydispersion that the gas in the inner regions. the minor axis kinematicstogether with the kinematics across the central 40$''$ along the major axis,suggest the presence of a rotating body with a kinematically misaligned axisrespect to the main disk of the galaxy. the asymmetries in the losvd along theminor axis together with the steep velocity gradient of the gaseous componentsuggest a merger scenario to explain the these kinematically signatures. theenclosed mass in the central regions is computed to be (2.4+-0.5) 10^7$ mo fora radius of r=0.7'' (10 pc). a double gaseous component in the central 6arcsecs is detected from the [siii] lambda 9069 a data along the minor axis;this seems to be the signature of a superbubble due to a supernova rate of 0.05yr^{-1}.

astro-ph;9901240	where are the missing galactic satellites?	using published data, we have compiled the circular velocity (vc)distribution function (vdf) of galaxy satellites in the local group. we findthat within the volumes of radius of 570 kpc (400/h kpc for h=0.7) centered onthe milky way and andromeda, the average vdf is roughly approximated as n(&gt;vc)~45(vc/10 km/s)^{-1} h^3 mpc^{-3} for vc in the range ~10-70 km/s. the observedvdf is compared with results of high-resolution cosmological simulations. wefind that the vdf in models is very different from the observed one:n(&gt;vc)~1200(vc/10 km/s)^{-2.75}h^3 mpc^{-3}. cosmological models thus predictthat a halo of the size of our galaxy should have about 50 dark mattersatellites with circular velocity &gt;20 km/s and mass &gt;3x10^8/h msun within a 570kpc radius. this number is significantly higher than the approximate dozensatellites actually observed around our galaxy. the observed and predicted vdfscross at ~50 km/s, indicating that the predicted abundance of satellites withvc&gt; 50 km/s is in reasonably good agreement with observations. we conclude,therefore, that unless a large fraction of the local group satellites has beenmissed in observations, there is a dramatic discrepancy between observationsand hierarchical models, regardless of the model parameters. we discuss severalpossible explanations for this discrepancy including identification of somesatellites with the high velocity clouds observed in the local group, and theexistence of dark satellites that failed to accrete gas and form stars dueeither to the expulsion of gas in the supernovae-driven winds or to gas heatingby the intergalactic ionizing background.

0812.3598	the origin of the diffuse non-thermal x-ray and radio emission in the  ophiuchus cluster of galaxies	we present high resolution 240 and 607 mhz gmrt radio observations,complemented with 74 mhz archival vla radio observations of the ophiuchuscluster of galaxies, whose radio mini-halo has been recently detected at 1400mhz. we also present archival chandra and xmm-newton data of the ophiuchuscluster. our observations do not show significant radio emission from themini-halo, hence we present upper limits to the integrated, diffuse non-thermalradio emission of the core of the ophiuchus cluster. the xmm-newtonobservations can be well explained by a two-temperature thermal model withtemperatures of ~=1.8 kev and ~=9.0 kev, respectively, which confirms previousresults that suggest that the innermost central region of the ophiuchus clusteris a cooling core. we also used the xmm-newton data to set up an upper limit tothe (non-thermal) x-ray emission from the cluster.  the combination of available radio and x-ray data has strong implications forthe currently proposed models of the spectral energy distribution (sed) fromthe ophiuchus cluster. in particular, a synchrotron+ic model is in agreementwith the currently available data, if the average magnetic field is in therange (0.02-0.3) microg. a pure wimp annihilation scenario can in principlereproduce both radio and x-ray emission, but at the expense of postulating verylarge boost factors from dark matter substructures, jointly with extremely lowvalues of the average magnetic field. finally, a scenario where synchrotron andinverse compton emission arise from pev electron-positron pairs (viainteractions with the cmb), can be ruled out, as it predicts a non-thermal softx-ray emission that largely exceeds the thermal bremsstrahlung measured byintegral.
