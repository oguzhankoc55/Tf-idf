hep-ph;9406422	thermal activation rates in the chirally asymmetric gross-neveu model	we address the problem of how to incorporate quantum effects into thecalculation of finite-temperature decay rates for a metastable state of aquantum field theory. to do this, we consider the gross-neveu model with anexplicit chiral symmetry breaking term, which allows for a metastable state.this theory can be shown to have a "critical bubble" which is a solution to the*exact* equations of motions (i.e. to all orders in perturbation theory,including all higher derivative, quantum and thermal corrections). thisconfiguration mediates the thermal activation of the metastable vacuum to thetrue ground state, with a decay rate $\gamma \propto \exp(-f_c/t)$, where $f_c$is the free energy of the critical bubble. we then compare this exactcalculation to various approximations that have been used in previous work. wefind that these approximations all *overestimate* the activation rate.furthermore, we study the effect of finite baryon number upon the bubbleprofile and the activation barriers. we find that beyond a critical baryonnumber the activation barriers disappear altogether.

hep-ph;9408214	dissipation via particle production in scalar field theories	the non-equilibrium dynamics of the first stage of the reheating process,that is dissipation via particle production is studied in scalar field theoriesin the unbroken and in the broken symmetry phase. we begin with a perturbativestudy to one loop and show explicitly that the mechanism of dissipation viaparticle production cannot be explained with a simple derivative term in theequation of motion. the dissipative contribution is non-local and there doesnot exist a local (markovian) limit at zero temperature. furthermore, we showthat both an amplitude as well as a one-loop calculation present instabilities,requiring a non-perturbative resummation. within the same approximations, westudy an o(2) linear sigma model that allows to study dissipation by goldstonebosons.  we find infrared divergences that require non-perturbative resummation inorder to understand the long-time dynamics. we obtain a perturbative  langevin equation that exhibits a generalized fluctuation-dissipationrelation, with non-markovian kernels and colored noise. we then study a  hartree approximation and clearly exhibit dissipative effects related to thethresholds to particle production. the asymptotic dynamics depends on thecoupling and initial conditions but does not seem to lead to exponentialrelaxation. the effect of dissipation by goldstone bosons is studiednon-perturbatively in the large n limit in an o(n) theory. dissipation producedby goldstone bosons dramatically changes the picture of the phase transition.we find the remarkable result that for ``slow-roll'' initial conditions (withthe expectation value of the field initially near the origin) the final valueof the expectation value of the scalar field is very close to its initialvalue. we find that the minima of the effective action depend on the initialconditions. we provide extensive numerical analysis of the dynamics.

hep-ph;9501380	domain walls in a frw universe	we solve the equations of motion for a scalar field with domain wall boundaryconditions in a friedmann-robertson-walker (frw) spacetime. we find (inagreement with basu and vilenkin) that no domain wall solutions exist in desitter spacetime for h = h/m &gt;= 1/2, where h is the hubble parameter and m isthe scalar mass. in the general frw case we develop a systematic perturbativeexpansion in h to arrive at an approximate solution to the field equations. wecalculate the energy momentum tensor of the domain wall configuration, and showthat the energy density can become negative at the core of the defect for somevalues of the non-minimal coupling parameter xi. we develop a translationallyinvariant theory for fluctuations of the wall, obtain the effective lagrangianfor these fluctuations, and quantize them using the bunch-davies vacuum in thede sitter case. unlike previous analyses, we find that the fluctuations act aszero-mass (as opposed to tachyonic) modes. this allows us to calculate thedistortion and the normal-normal correlators for the surface. the normal-normalcorrelator decreases logarithmically with the distance between points for largetimes and distances, indicating that the interface becomes rougher than inminkowski spacetime.

hep-ph;9507414	reheating and thermalization, linear vs. non-linear relaxation	we consider the case of a scalar field, the inflaton, coupled to both lighterscalars and fermions, and the study the relaxation of the inflaton via particleproduction in both the linear and non-linear regimes. this has an immediateapplication to the reheating problem in inflationary universe models. thelinear regime analysis offers a rationale for the standard approach to thereheating problem, but we make a distinction between relaxation andthermalization. we find that particle production when the inflaton starts inthe {\it non-linear} region is typically a far more efficient way oftransfering energy out of the inflaton zero mode and into the quanta of thelighter scalar than single particle decay. for the non-linear regime we takeinto account self-consistently the evolution of the expectation value of theinflaton field coupled to the evolution of the quantum fluctuations. anexhaustive numerical analysis reveals that the distribution of producedparticles is far from thermal, and the effect of open channels. in thefermionic case, pauli blocking begins to hinder the transfer of energy into thefermion modes very early on in the evolution of the inflaton. we examine theimplications of our results to the question of how to calculate the reheatingtemperature of the universe after inflation.

hep-ph;9603217	relaxation and kinetics in scalar field theories	a new approach to the dynamics of relaxation and kinetics of thermalizationin a scalar field theory is presented that incorporates the relevant timescales through the resummation of hard thermal loops. an alternative derivationof the kinetic equations for the ``quasiparticle'' distribution functions isobtained that allows a clear understanding of the different ``coarse graining''approximations usually involved in a kinetic description. this method leads toa systematic perturbative expansion to obtain the kinetic equations includinghard-thermal loop resummation and to an improvement including renormalization,off-shell effects and contributions that change chemical equilibrium on shorttime scales. as a byproduct of these methods we establish the relation betweenthe relaxation time scale in the linearized equation of motion of thequasiparticles and the thermalization time scale of the quasiparticledistribution function in the ``relaxation time approximation''. hard thermalloop resummation dramatically modifies the scattering rate for long wavelengthmodes as compared to the usual (semi) classical estimate. relaxation andkinetics are studied both in the unbroken and broken symmetry phases of thetheory. the broken symmetry phase also provides the setting to obtain thecontribution to the kinetic equations from processes that involve decay of aheavy scalar into light scalar particles in the medium.

hep-ph;9606208	inflaton decay in de sitter spacetime	we study the decay of scalar fields, in particular the inflaton, into lighterscalars in a de sitter spacetime background. after providing a practicaldefinition of the rate, we focus on the case of an inflaton interacting with amassless scalar field either minimally or conformally coupled to the curvature.the evolution equation for the expectation value of the inflaton is obtained toone loop order in perturbation theory and the decay rate is recognized from thesolution. we find the remarkable result that this decay rate displays anequilibrium bose-enhancement factor with an effective temperature given by thehawking temperature $h\slash{2 \pi}$, where $h$ is the hubble constant. thiscontribution is interpreted as the ``stimulated emission'' of bosons in athermal bath at the hawking temperature. in the context of new inflationscenarios, we show that inflaton decay into conformally coupled massless fieldsslows down the rolling of the expectation value. decay into goldstone bosons isalso studied. contact with stochastic inflation is established by deriving thelangevin equation for the coarse-grained expectation value of the inflatonfield to one-loop order in this model. we find that the noise is gaussian andcorrelated (colored) and its correlations are related to the dissipative(``decay'') kernel via a generalized fluctuation-dissipation relation.

hep-ph;9608205	analytic and numerical study of preheating dynamics	we analyze the phenomenon of preheating,i.e. explosive particle productiondue to parametric amplification of quantum fluctuations in the unbroken case,or spinodal instabilities in the broken phase, using the minkowski space $o(n)$vector model in the large $n$ limit to study the non-perturbative issuesinvolved. we give analytic results for weak couplings and times short comparedto the time at which the fluctuations become of the same order as the treelevel,as well as numerical results including the full backreaction.in the casewhere the symmetry is unbroken, the analytic results agree spectacularly wellwith the numerical ones in their common domain of validity. in the brokensymmetry case, slow roll initial conditions from the unstable minimum at theorigin, give rise to a new and unexpected phenomenon: the dynamical relaxationof the vacuum energy.that is, particles are abundantly produced at the expenseof the quantum vacuum energy while the zero mode comes back to almost itsinitial value.in both cases we obtain analytically and numerically the equationof state which turns to be written in terms of an effective polytropic indexthat interpolates between vacuum and radiation-like domination. we find thatsimplified analysis based on harmonic behavior of the zero mode, giving rise toa mathieu equation forthe non-zero modes miss important physics. furthermore,analysis that do not include the full backreaction do not conserve energy,resulting in unbound particle production. our results do not support the recentclaim of symmetry restoration by non-equilibrium fluctuations.finally estimatesof the reheating temperature are given,as well as a discussion of theinconsistency of a kinetic approach to thermalization when a non-perturbativelylarge number of particles is created.

hep-ph;9610396	out of equilibrium dynamics of an inflationary phase transition	we study the non-linear dynamics of an inflationary phase transition in aquartically self coupled inflaton model within the framework of a de sitterbackground. large n and hartree non-perturbative approximations combined withnon-equilibrium field theory methods are used to study the self-consistent timeevolution including backreaction effects. we find that when the system coolsdown from an initial temperature t_i &gt; t_c to below t_c with the initial valueof the zero mode of the inflaton phi(0) &lt;&lt; m lambda^{-1/4}, the dynamics isdetermined by the growth of long-wavelength quantum fluctuations. for phi(0) &gt;&gt;m lambda^{-1/4} the dynamics is determined by the evolution of the classicalzero mode. in the regime where spinodal quantum fluctuations give the mostimportant contribution to the non-equilibrium dynamics, we find that theymodify the equation of state providing a graceful exit from the inflationarystage. inflation ends through this new mechanism at a time scale t_s &gt;=[h/m^2]ln[lambda^{-1}] which for h &gt;= m and very weak coupling allows over onehundred e-folds during the de sitter phase. spatially correlated domains growto be of horizon-size and quantum fluctuations ``freeze-out'' for times t&gt; t_s.

hep-ph;9701360	photoproduction enhancement from non equilibrium disoriented chiral  condensates	we study photoproduction during the non-equilibrium stages of the formationof chiral condensates within the ``quench'' scenario of the chiral phasetransition. the dynamics is modeled with a gauged linear sigma model. a novelquantum kinetic approach to the description of photoproduction far offequilibrium is developed. we find that non-equilibrium spinodal instabilitiesof long wavelength pion fluctuations are responsible for an enhancedphotoproduction rate for energies $\leq 80$ mev at order $\alpha$. thesenon-equilibrium effects lead to a larger contribution than the typicalprocesses in the medium, including that of the anomalous neutral pion decay$\pi^0 \rightarrow 2 \gamma$ (which is of order $\alpha^2$). we follow theevolution of the dynamics throughout the phase transition, which in thisscenario occurs on a time scale of about $2.5-3$ fm/c and integrate the photonyield through its evolution. the spectrum of photons produced throughout thephase transition is a non- equilibrium one. for thermal initial conditions atthe time of the quench it interpolates between a thermal distribution about 6%above the initial temperature (at the time of the quench) for low energy $\leq80$ mev photons, and a high energy tail in thermal equilibrium at the initialtemperature, with a smooth crossover at 100 mev. the rate displays a peak at$\sim 35$ mev which receives a larger enhancement the closer the initialtemperature at the time of the quench is to the critical temperature. it isfound that the enhancement of photoproduction at low energies is not anartifact caused by the initial distribution of the photons, but is due to thepionic instabilities. we suggest that these strong out of equilibrium effectsmay provide experimental signatures for the formation and relaxation of dcc'sin heavy ion collisions.

(i): the effective theory of inflation a laginsburg-landau (gl): the inflaton potential is a polynomial with universalform making explicit the inflation energy scale m, the planck mass and theinflation e-folds number n ~ 60. the slow-roll expansion becomes a systematic1/n expansion and the inflaton couplings are naturally small as powers of(m/m_{pl})^2. the spectral index (n_s - 1) and the ratio of tensor/scalarfluctuations r are o(1/n), the running index is o(1/n^2). m ~ 0.7 10^{16} gevis completely determined by the scalar adiabatic fluctuations amplitude. (ii):a monte carlo markov chains (mcmc) analysis of the cmb+lss data (includingwmap5) with our analytic theoretical results yields: a lower bound for r (newinflation): r &gt; 0.023 (95%cl), r &gt; 0.046 (68%cl); the preferred inflationpotential is a double well, even function of the field yielding as mostprobable values n_s ~ 0.964, r ~ 0.051. this value for r is within reach offorthcoming cmb observations. slow-roll inflation is generically preceded by ashort fast-roll stage which leads to a suppression of the cmb quadrupoles. mcmcanalysis of the wmap+sdss data shows that fast-roll fits the tt, te and eemodes well reproducing the quadrupole suppression and fixes the total number ofefolds of inflation to be n_{total} ~ 64. (iii) quantum loop corrections arevery small and controlled by powers of (h /m_{pl})^2 ~ 10^{-9} which validatesthe effective theory of inflation. we show how powerful is the gl theory ofinflation in predicting observables.

hep-ph;9907337	initial time singularities in non-equilibrium evolution of condensates  and their resolution in the linearized approximation	the real time non-equilibrium evolution of condensates in field theoryrequires an initial value problem specifying an initial quantum state ordensity matrix. arbitrary specifications of the initial quantum state (pure ormixed) results in initial time singularities which are not removed by the usualrenormalization counterterms. we study the initial time singularities in thelinearized equation of motion for the scalar condensate in a renormalizableyukawa theory in 3+1 dimensions. in this renormalizable theory the initial timesingularities are enhanced. we present a consistent method for removing theseinitial time singularities by specifying initial states where the distributionof high energy quanta is determined by the initial conditions and theinteraction effects. this is done through a bogoliubov transformation which isconsistently obtained in a perturbative expansion.the usual renormalizationcounterterms and the proper choice of the bogoliubov coefficients lead to asingularity free evolution equation. we establish the relationship between theevolution equations in the linearized approximation and linear response theory.it is found that only a very specific form of the external source for linearresponse leads to a real time evolution equation which is singularity free. wefocus on the evolution of spatially inhomogeneous scalar condensates byimplementing the initial state preparation via a bogoliubov transformation upto one-loop. as a concrete application, the evolution equation for aninhomogenous condensate is solved analytically and the results are carefullyanalyzed. symmetry breaking by initial quantum states is discussed.

hep-ph;9909369	dynamical renormalization group approach to quantum kinetics in scalar  and gauge theories	we derive quantum kinetic equations from a quantum field theory implementinga diagrammatic perturbative expansion improved by a resummation via thedynamical renormalization group. the method begins by obtaining the equation ofmotion of the distribution function in perturbation theory. the solution ofthis equation of motion reveals secular terms that grow in time, the dynamicalrenormalization group resums these secular terms in real time and leadsdirectly to the quantum kinetic equation. we used this method to study therelaxation in a cool gas of pions and sigma mesons in the o(4) chiral linearsigma model. we obtain in relaxation time approximation the pion and sigmameson relaxation rates. we also find that in large momentum limit emission andabsorption of massless pions result in threshold infrared divergence in sigmameson relaxation rate and lead to a crossover behavior in relaxation. we thenstudy the relaxation of charged quasiparticles in scalar electrodynamics(sqed). while longitudinal, debye screened photons lead to purely exponentialrelaxation, transverse photons, only dynamically screened by landau dampinglead to anomalous relaxation, thus leading to a crossover between two differentrelaxational regimes. we emphasize that infrared divergent damping rates areindicative of non-exponential relaxation and the dynamical renormalizationgroup reveals the correct relaxation directly in real time. finally we alsoshow that this method provides a natural framework to interpret and resolve theissue of pinch singularities out of equilibrium and establish a directcorrespondence between pinch singularities and secular terms. we argue thatthis method is particularly well suited to study quantum kinetics and transportin gauge theories.

hep-ph;9911521	dynamics of symmetry breaking in frw cosmologies: emergence of scaling	the dynamics of a symmetry breaking phase transition is studied in aradiation and matter dominated spatially flat frw cosmology in the large nlimit of a scalar field theory.the quantum density matrix is evolved from aninitial state of quasiparticles in thermal equilibrium at a temperature higherthan the critical. the cosmological expansion decreases the temperature andtriggers the phase transition. we identify three different time scales: anearly regime dominated by linear instabilities and the exponential growth oflong-wavelength fluctuations,an intermediate scale when the field fluctuationsprobe the broken symmetry states and an asymptotic scale wherein a scalingregime emerges for modes of wavelength comparable to or larger than thehorizon.the scaling regime is characterized by a dynamical physical correlationlength xi_{phys} = d_h(t) with d_h(t) the size of the causal horizon, thusthere is one correlated region per causal horizon. inside these correlatedregions the field fluctuations sample the broken symmetry states. the amplitudeof the long-wavelength fluctuations becomes non-perturbatively large due to theearly times instabilities and a semiclassical but stochastic descriptionemerges in the asymptotic regime. in the scaling regime, the power spectrum ispeaked at zero momentum revealing the onset of a bose-einstein condensate.thescaling solution results in that the equation of state of the scalar fields isthe same as that of the background fluid. this implies a harrison-zeldovichspectrum of scalar density perturbations for long-wavelengths. we discuss thecorrections to scaling as well as the universality of the scaling solution andthe differences and similarities with the classical non-linear sigma model.

0706.3167	production of a sterile species via active-sterile mixing: an exactly  solvable model	the production of a sterile species via active-sterile mixing in a thermalmedium is studied in an exactly solvable model. the \emph{exact} time evolutionof the sterile distribution function is determined by the dispersion relationsand damping rates $\gamma_{1,2}$ for the quasiparticle modes. these depend on$\wtg = \gamma_{aa}/2\delta e$, with $\gamma_{aa}$ the interaction rate of theactive species in absence of mixing and $\delta e$ the oscillation frequency inthe medium without damping. $\wtg \ll1,\wtg \gg 1$ describe the weak and strongdamping limits respectively. for $\wtg\ll1$, $\gamma_1 = \gamma_{aa}\cos^2\tm ;\gamma_{2}=\gamma_{aa}\sin^2\tm$ where $\tm$ is the mixing angle in the mediumand the sterile distribution function \emph{does not} obey a simple rateequation. for $\wtg \gg 1$, $\gamma_1= \gamma_{aa}$ and $\gamma_2 = \gamma_{aa}\sin^22\tm/4\wtg^2$, is the sterile production rate. in this regime sterileproduction is suppressed and the oscillation frequency \emph{vanishes} at anmsw resonance, with a breakdown of adiabaticity. these are consequences ofquantum zeno suppression. for active neutrinos with standard model interactionsthe strong damping limit is \emph{only} available near an msw resonance\emph{if} $\sin\theta \lesssim \alpha_w$ with $\theta$ the vacuum mixing angle.the full set of quantum kinetic equations for sterile production for arbitrary$\wtg$ are obtained from the quantum master equation. cosmological resonantsterile neutrino production is quantum zeno suppressed relieving potentialuncertainties associated with the qcd phase transition.

0905.4729	unsterile-active neutrino mixing: consequences on radiative decay and  bounds from the x-ray background	we consider a sterile neutrino to be an unparticle, namely an \emph{unsterileneutrino}, with anomalous dimension $\eta$ and study its mixing with acanonical active neutrino via a see-saw mass matrix. we show that there is\emph{no unitary} transformation that diagonalizes the mixed propagator and afield redefinition is required. the propagating or ``mass'' states correspondto an unsterile-like and active-like mode. the unsterile mode features acomplex pole or resonance for $0 \leq \eta &lt; 1/3$ with an ``invisible width''which is the result of the decay of the unsterile mode into the active mode andthe massless particles of the hidden conformal sector. for $\eta \geq 1/3$, thecomplex pole disappears, merging with the unparticle threshold. the active modeis described by a stable pole, but ``inherits'' a non-vanishing spectraldensity above the unparticle threshold as a consequence of the mixing. we findthat the \emph{radiative} decay width of the unsterile neutrino into the activeneutrino (and a photon) via charged current loops, is \emph{suppressed} by afactor $\sim \big[2 \sin^2(\theta_0)\frac{m^2}{\lambda^2}\big]^\frac{\eta}{1-\eta}$, where $\theta_0$ is the mixingangle for $\eta=0$, $m$ is approximately the mass of the unsterile neutrino and$\lambda \gg m$ is the unparticle-scale. the suppression of the radiative(visible) decay width of the sterile neutrino weakens the bound on the mass andmixing angle from the x-ray or soft gamma-ray background.

0912.2093	oscillation dynamics of active-unsterile neutrino mixing in a  $2+\tilde{1}$ mixing scheme	we consider the possibility that sterile neutrinos exist and admit adescription as unparticles; we call these {\em unsterile} neutrinos. we thenexamine the nature of neutrino oscillations in a model where an unsterile canmix with two active flavors with a very simple mass matrix of the see-saw type.despite these simplifications, we find a number of remarkable features, all ofwhich will occur generically when more realistic cases are considered. theseinclude momentum dependent mixing angles, "invisible" decay widths for theunsterile-like mode, as well as the inheritance of a non-vanishing spectraldensity for the massive active-like modes. we also obtain the disappearance andappearance probabilities for the active-like neutrinos and find remarkableinterference effects between the active and unsterile neutrinos as aconsequence of threshold effects, yielding new oscillatory contributions withdifferent oscillation lengths. these effects are only measurable on shortbaseline experiments because there both probabilities are suppressed ascompared to mixing with a canonical sterile neutrino, thereby providing adiagnostics tool to discriminate unsterile from canonical sterile neutrinos. weconclude with a discussion of whether these new phenomena could aid in thereconciliation of the lsnd and miniboone results.

hep-ph;0306124	the approach to thermalization in the classical phi^4 theory in 1+1  dimensions: energy cascades and universal scaling	we study the dynamics of thermalization and the approach to equilibrium inthe classical phi^4 theory in 1+1 spacetime dimensions. at thermal equilibriumwe exploit the equivalence between the classical canonical averages andtransfer matrix quantum traces of the anharmonic oscillator to obtain exactresults for the temperature dependence of several observables, which provide aset of criteria for thermalization. we find that the hartree approximation isremarkably accurate in equilibrium. the non-equilibrium dynamics is studied bynumerically solving the equations of motion in light-cone coordinates for abroad range of initial conditions and energy densities.the time evolution isdescribed by several stages with a cascade of energy towards the ultraviolet.after a transient stage, the spatio-temporal gradient terms become larger thanthe nonlinear term and a stage of universal cascade emerges.this cascade startsat a time scale t_0 independent of the initial conditions (except for very lowenergy density). here the power spectra feature universal scaling behavior andthe front of the cascade k(t) grows as a power law k(t) sim t^alpha with alphalesssim 0.25. the wake behind the cascade is described as a state of localthermodynamic equilibrium (lte) with all correlations being determined by theequilibrium functional form with an effective time dependent temperatureteff(t)which slowly decreases as sim t^{-alpha}.two well separated time scales emergewhile teff(t) varies slowly, the wavectors in the wake with k &lt; k(t) attain lteon much shorter time scales.this universal scaling stage ends when the front ofthe cascade reaches the cutoff at a time t_1 sim a^{-1/alpha}. virializationstarts to set much earlier than lte. we find that strict thermalization isachieved only for an infinite time scale.

hep-ph;0312185	nonequilibrium pion dynamics near the critical point in a constituent  quark model	we study static and dynamical critical phenomena of chiral symmetry breakingin a two-flavor nambu--jona-lasinio constituent quark model. we obtain thelow-energy effective action for scalar and pseudoscalar degrees of freedom tolowest order in quark loops and to quadratic order in the meson fluctuationsaround the mean field. the \emph{static} limit of critical phenomena is shownto be described by a ginzburg-landau effective action including \emph{spatial}gradients. hence \emph{static} critical phenomena is described by theuniversality class of the o(4) heisenberg ferromagnet. \emph{dynamical}critical phenomena is studied by obtaining the equations of motion for pionfluctuations. we find that for $t&lt;t_c$ the are stable long-wavelength pionexcitations with dispersion relation $\omega_{\pi}(k)=k$ described by isolatedpion poles. the residue of the pion pole vanishes near $t_c$ as $z \propto1/|\ln(1-t/t_c)|$ and long-wavelength fluctuations are damped out by landaudamping on a time scale $t_\mathrm{rel}(k)\propto 1/k$, reflecting\emph{critical slowing down} of pion fluctuations near the critical point. atthe critical point, the pion propagator features mass shell logarithmicdivergences which we conjecture to be the harbinger of a (large) dynamicalanomalous dimension. we find that while the \emph{classical spinodal} linecoincides with that of the ginzburg-landau theory, the growth rate oflong-wavelength spinodal fluctuations has a richer wavelength dependence as aconsequence of landau damping. we argue that landau damping prevents a\emph{local} low energy effective action in terms of a derivative expansion inreal time.

hep-ph;0403216	oscillations and evolution of a hot and dense gas of flavor neutrinos: a  quantum field theory study	we study the time evolution of the distribution functions for hot and ordegenerate gases of two flavors of dirac neutrinos as a result of flavor mixingand dephasing. this is achieved by obtaining the time evolution of the flavordensity matrix directly from quantum field theory at finite temperature anddensity. the time evolution features a rich hierarchy of scales which arewidely separated in the nearly degenerate or relativistic cases and originatein interference phenomena between particle and antiparticle states. in thedegenerate case the flavor asymmetry $\delta n(t)$ relaxes to the asymptoticlimit $\delta n(\infty)=\delta n(0)\cos^2(2\theta)$ via dephasing resultingfrom the oscillations between flavor modes that are not pauli blocked, with apower law $1/t$ for $t&gt;t_s \approx 2 k_f/\delta m^2$. $k_f$ is the largest ofthe fermi momenta. the distribution function for flavor neutrinos andantineutrinos as well as off-diagonal densities are obtained. flavorparticle-antiparticle pairs are produced by mixing and oscillations withtypical momentum $k\sim \bar{m}$ the average mass of the neutrinos. aneffective field theory description emerges on long time scales in which theheisenberg operators obey a bloch-type equation of motion valid in therelativistic and nearly degenerate cases. we find the non-equilibriumpropagators and correlation functions in this effective theory and discuss itsregime of validity as well as the potential corrections.

hep-ph;0604045	space-time propagation of neutrino wave packets at high temperature and  density	we study the space-time evolution of ``flavor'' neutrino wave-packets atfinite temperature and density in the early universe prior to bbn. we implementnon-equilibrium field theory methods and linear response to study thespace-time evolution directly from the effective dirac equation in the medium.there is a rich hierarchy of time scales associated with transverse andlongitudinal dispersion and coherence. a phenomenon of ``freezing ofcoherence'' is a result of a competition between longitudinal dispersion andthe separation of wave-packets of propagating modes in the medium. near aresonance the coherence and oscillation time scales are enhanced by a factor$1/\sin2\theta$ compared to the vacuum. collisional relaxation via charged andneutral currents occurs on time scales much shorter than the coherence timescale and for small vacuum mixing angle, shorter than the oscillation scale.assuming that the momentum spread of the initial wave packet is determined bythe large angle scattering mean free path of charged leptons, we find that thetransverse dispersion time scale is the shortest and is responsible for a largesuppression in both the survival and transition probabilities on time scalesmuch shorter than the hubble time. for small mixing angle the oscillation timescale is \emph{longer} than the collisional relaxation scale. the method alsoyields the evolution of right-handed wave packets. corrections to theoscillation frequencies emerge from wave-packet structure as well as from theenergy dependence of mixing angles in the medium.
