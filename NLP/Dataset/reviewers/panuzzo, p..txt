0902.1202	the energetic environment and the dense interstellar medium in ulirgs	we fit the near-infrared to radio spectral energy distributions of a sampleof 30 luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies with models that includeboth starburst and agn components. the aim of the work was to determineimportant physical parameters for this kind of objects such as the opticaldepth towards the luminosity source, the star formation rate, the starformation efficiency and the agn fraction. we found that although about half ofour sample have best-fit models that include an agn component, only 30 % havean agn which accounts for more than 10 % of the infrared luminosity whereas allhave an energetically dominant starburst. our models also determine the mass ofdense molecular gas. assuming that this mass is that traced by the hcnmolecule, we reproduce the observed linear relation between hcn luminosity andinfrared luminosity found by gao and solomon (2004). however, our derivedconversion factor between hcn luminosity and the mass of dense molecular gas isa factor of 2 smaller than that assumed by these authors. finally, we find thatthe star formation efficiency falls as the starburst ages.

1001.5136	the herschel reference survey	the herschel reference survey is a guaranteed time herschel key project andwill be a benchmark study of dust in the nearby universe. the survey willcomplement a number of other herschel key projects including large cosmologicalsurveys that trace dust in the distant universe. we will use herschel toproduce images of a statistically-complete sample of 323 galaxies at 250, 350and 500 micron. the sample is volume-limited, containing sources with distancesbetween 15 and 25 mpc and flux limits in the k-band to minimize the selectioneffects associated with dust and with young high-mass stars and to introduce aselection in stellar mass. the sample spans the whole range of morphologicaltypes (ellipticals to late-type spirals) and environments (from the field tothe centre of the virgo cluster) and as such will be useful for other purposesthan our own. we plan to use the survey to investigate (i) the dust content ofgalaxies as a function of hubble type, stellar mass and environment, (ii) theconnection between the dust content and composition and the other phases of theinterstellar medium and (iii) the origin and evolution of dust in galaxies. inthis paper, we describe the goals of the survey, the details of the sample andsome of the auxiliary observing programs that we have started to collectcomplementary data. we also use the available multi-frequency data to carry outan analysis of the statistical properties of the sample.

0708.0149	modeling the spectral energy distribution of ulirgs i: the radio spectra	as a constraint for new starburst/agn models of iras bright galaxies wedetermine the radio spectra of 31 luminous and ultraluminous iras galaxies(lirgs/ulirgs). we construct the radio spectra using both new and archivaldata. from our sample of radio spectra we find that very few have a straightpower-law slope. although some sources show a flattening of the radio spectralslope at high frequencies the average spectrum shows a steepening of the radiospectrum from 1.4 to 22.5 ghz. this is unexpected because in sources with highrates of star formation we expect flat spectrum, free-free emission to make asignificant contribution to the radio flux at higher radio frequencies. despitethis trend the radio spectral indices between 8.4 and 22.5 ghz are flatter forsources with higher values of the fir-radio flux density ratio q, when this iscalculated at 8.4 ghz. therefore, sources that are deficient in radio emissionrelative to fir emission (presumably younger sources) have a larger thermalcomponent to their radio emission. however, we find no correlation between theradio spectral index between 1.4 and 4.8 ghz and q at 8.4 ghz. because the lowfrequency spectral index is affected by free-free absorption, and this is afunction of source size for a given mass of ionized gas, this is evidence thatthe ionized gas in ulirgs shows a range of densities. the youngest lirgs andulirgs are characterized by a larger contribution to their high-frequency radiospectra from free-free emission. however, the youngest sources are not thosethat have the greatest free-free absorption at low radio frequencies. thesources in which the effects of free-free absorption are strongest are insteadthe most compact sources. although these have the warmest fir colours, they arenot necessarily the youngest sources.

1004.1647	nearby early-type galaxies with ionized gas.iv. origin and powering  mechanism of the ionized gas	[abridged] with the aim of constraining the source of excitation and theorigin of the ionized gas in early-type galaxies (etgs), we analyzed opticalspectra of a sample of 65 etgs mostly located in low density environments.optical emission lines are detected in 89% of the sample. the incidence andstrength of emission do not correlate either with the e/s0 classification, orwith the fast/slow rotator classification. comparing the nuclear r&lt;r_e/16 lineemission with the classical [oiii]/hb vs [nii]/ha diagnostic diagram, thegalaxy activity is so classified: 72% are liners, 9% are seyferts, 12% arecomposite/transition objects, and 7% are non-classified. seyferts have youngluminosity-weighted ages (&lt;5 gyr), and are significantly younger than linersand composites. seyferts excluded, the spread in the ([oiii], ha or [nii])emission strength increases with the galaxy central velocity dispersion. the[nii]/ha ratio decreases with increasing galacto-centric distance, indicatingeither a decrease of the nebular metallicity, or a progressive "softening" ofthe ionizing spectrum. the average oxygen abundance of the ionized gas isslightly less than solar, and a comparison with the results obtained in paperiii from lick indices reveals that it is ~0.2 dex lower than that of stars.conclusions: the nuclear emission can be explained with photoionization by pagbstars alone only in ~22% of the liners/composite sample. on the other hand, wecan not exclude an important role of pagb star photoionization at larger radii.for the major fraction of the sample, the nuclear emission is consistent withexcitation from a low-accretion rate agn, fast shocks (200 -500 km/s) in arelatively gas-poor environment (n&lt; 100 cm^-3), or coexistence of the two. thederived nebular metallicities suggest either an external origin of the gas, oran overestimate of the oxygen yields by sn models.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.1526	spire imaging of m82: cool dust in the wind and tidal streams	m82 is a unique representative of a whole class of galaxies, starbursts withsuperwinds, in the very nearby galaxy survey with herschel. in addition, itsinteraction with the m81 group has stripped a significant portion of itsinterstellar medium from its disk. spire maps now afford bettercharacterization of the far-infrared emission from cool dust outside the disk,and sketch a far more complete picture of its mass distribution and energeticsthan previously possible. they show emission coincident in projection with thestarburst wind and in a large halo, much more extended than the pah bandemission seen with spitzer. some complex substructures coincide with thebrightest pah filaments, and others with tidal streams seen in atomic hydrogen.we subtract the far-infrared emission of the starburst and underlying disk fromthe maps, and derive spatially-resolved far-infrared colors for the wind andhalo. we interpret the results in terms of dust mass, dust temperature, andglobal physical conditions. in particular, we examine variations in the dustphysical properties as a function of distance from the center and the windpolar axis, and conclude that more than two thirds of the extraplanar dust hasbeen removed by tidal interaction, and not entrained by the starburst wind.

1005.1865	the herschel revolution: unveiling the morphology of the high mass star  formation sites n44 and n63 in the lmc	we study the structure of the medium surrounding sites of high-mass starformation to determine the interrelation between the hii regions and theenvironment from which they were formed. the density distribution of thesurroundings is key in determining how the radiation of the newly formed starsinteracts with the surrounds in a way that allows it to be used as a starformation tracer. we present new herschel/spire 250, 350 and 500 mum data oflha 120-n44 and lha 120-n63 in the lmc. we construct average spectral energydistributions (seds) for annuli centered on the ir bright part of the starformation sites. the annuli cover ~10-~100 pc. we use a phenomenological dustmodel to fit these seds to derive the dust column densities, characterise theincident radiation field and the abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbonmolecules. we see a factor 5 decrease in the radiation field energy density asa function of radial distance around n63. n44 does not show a systematic trend.we construct a simple geometrical model to derive the 3-d density profile ofthe surroundings of these two regions. herschel/spire data have proven veryefficient in deriving the dust mass distribution. we find that the radiationfield in the two sources behaves very differently. n63 is more or lessspherically symmetric and the average radiation field drops with distance. n44shows no systematic decrease of the radiation intensity which is probably dueto the inhomogeneity of the surrounding molecular material and to the complexdistribution of several star forming clusters in the region.

1005.2187	the hermes spire submillimeter local luminosity function	local luminosity functions are fundamental benchmarks for high-redshiftgalaxy formation and evolution studies as well as for models describing theseprocesses. determining the local luminosity function in the submillimeter rangecan help to better constrain in particular the bolometric luminosity density inthe local universe, and herschel offers the first opportunity to do so in anunbiased way by imaging large sky areas at several submillimeter wavelengths.  we present the first herschel measurement of the submillimeter 0&lt;z&lt;0.2 localluminosity function and infrared bolometric (8-1000 $\mu$m) local luminositydensity based on spire data from the hermes herschel key program over 14.7deg^2.  flux measurements in the three spire channels at 250, 350 and 500 \mum arecombined with spitzer photometry and archival data. we fit the observedoptical-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution of spire sources and usethe 1/v_{max} estimator to provide the first constraints on the monochromatic250, 350 and 500 \mum as well as on the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) localluminosity function based on herschel data.  we compare our results with modeling predictions and find a slightly moreabundant local submillimeter population than predicted by a number of models.our measurement of the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local luminosityfunction suggests a flat slope at low luminosity, and the inferred localluminosity density, 1.31_-0.21^+0.24 x 10^8 lsun mpc^-3, is consistent with therange of values reported in recent literature.

1005.2192	hermes: far-infrared properties of known agn in the hermes fields	nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly.herschel-spire provides sampling of the fir seds of type 1 and type 2 agn,allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust(starburst) emission. we study large samples of spectroscopically confirmedtype 1 and type 2 agn lying within the herschel multi-tiered extragalacticsurvey (hermes) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aimingto understand their fir colour distributions and constrain their starburstcontributions. we find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed agn inthe hermes fields have 5-sigma detections at 250um, in agreement with previous(sub)mm agn studies. their combined spitzer-mips and herschel-spire colours -specifically s(250)/s(70) vs. s(70)/s(24) - quite clearly separate them fromthe non-agn, star-forming galaxy population, as their 24-um flux is dominatedby the hot torus emission. however, their spire colours alone do not differfrom those of non-agn galaxies. sed fitting shows that all those agn need astarburst component to fully account for their fir emission. for objects at z &gt;2, we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to thestarburst component, l(sb), and the agn accretion luminosity, l(acc), withl(sb) propto l(acc)^0.35. type 2 agn detected at 250um show on average higherl(sb) than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establishwhether this trend indicates stronger star-formation activity.

1005.2497	determining dust temperatures and masses in the herschel era: the  importance of observations longward of 200 micron	the properties of the dust grains (e.g., temperature and mass) can be derivedfrom fitting far-ir seds (&gt;100 micron). only with spire on herschel has it beenpossible to get high spatial resolution at 200 to 500 micron that is beyond thepeak (~160 micron) of dust emission in most galaxies. we investigate thedifferences in the fitted dust temperatures and masses determined using only&lt;200 micron data and then also including &gt;200 micron data (new spireobservations) to determine how important having &gt;200 micron data is forderiving these dust properties. we fit the 100 to 350 micron observations ofthe large magellanic cloud (lmc) point-by-point with a model that consists of asingle temperature and fixed emissivity law. the data used are existingobservations at 100 and 160 micron (from iras and spitzer) and new spireobservations of 1/4 of the lmc observed for the heritage key project as part ofthe herschel science demonstration phase. the dust temperatures and massescomputed using only 100 and 160 micron data can differ by up to 10% and 36%,respectively, from those that also include the spire 250 &amp; 350 micron data. wefind that an emissivity law proportional to lambda^-1.5 minimizes the 100-350micron fractional residuals. we find that the emission at 500 micron is ~10%higher than expected from extrapolating the fits made at shorter wavelengths.we find the fractional 500 micron excess is weakly anti-correlated with mips 24micron flux and the total gas surface density. this argues against a fluxcalibration error as the origin of the 500 micron excess. our results do notallow us to distinguish between a systematic variation in the wavelengthdependent emissivity law or a population of very cold dust only detectable atlambda &gt; 500 micron for the origin of the 500 micron excess.

1005.2787	dust in the bright supernova remnant n49 in the lmc	we investigate the dust associated with the supernova remnant (snr) n49 inthe large magellanic cloud (lmc) as observed with the herschel spaceobservatory. n49 is unusually bright because of an interaction with a molecularcloud along its eastern edge. we have used pacs and spire to measure the far irflux densities of the entire snr and of a bright region on the eastern edge ofthe snr where the snr shock is encountering the molecular cloud. using thesefluxes supplemented with archival data at shorter wavelengths, we estimate thedust mass associated with n49 to be about 10 msun. the bulk of the dust in oursimple two-component model has a temperature of 20-30 k, similar to that ofnearby molecular clouds. unfortunately, as a result of the limited angularresolution of herschel at the wavelengths sampled with spire, the uncertaintiesare fairly large. assuming this estimate of the dust mass associated with thesnr is approximately correct, it is probable that most of the dust in the snrarises from regions where the shock speed is too low to produce significantx-ray emission. the total amount of warm 50-60 k dust is ~0.1 or 0.4 msun,depending on whether the dust is modeled in terms of carbonaceous or silicategrains. this provides a firm lower limit to the amount of shock heated dust inn49.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.3924	the herschel view of star formation in the rosette molecular cloud under  the influence of ngc 2244	the rosette molecular cloud is promoted as the archetype of a triggeredstar-formation site. this is mainly due to its morphology, because the centralob cluster ngc 2244 has blown a circular-shaped cavity into the cloud and theexpanding hii-region now interacts with the cloud. studying the spatialdistribution of the different evolutionary states of all star-forming sites inrosette and investigating possible gradients of the dust temperature will helpto test the 'triggered star-formation' scenario in rosette. we use continuumdata obtained with the pacs (70 and 160 micron) and spire instruments (250,350, 500 micron) of the herschel telescope during the science demonstrationphase of hobys. three-color images of rosette impressively show how themolecular gas is heated by the radiative impact of the ngc 2244 cluster. aclear negative temperature gradient and a positive density gradient (runningfrom the hii-region/molecular cloud interface into the cloud) are detected.studying the spatial distribution of the most massive dense cores (size scale0.05 to 0.3 pc), we find an age-sequence (from more evolved to younger) withincreasing distance to the cluster ngc 2244. no clear gradient is found for theclump (size-scale up to 1 pc) distribution. the existence of temperature anddensity gradients and the observed age-sequence imply that star formation inrosette may indeed be influenced by the radiative impact of the central ngc2244 cluster. a more complete overview of the prestellar and protostellarpopulation in rosette is required to obtain a firmer result.

1007.5260	herschel-atlas: counterparts from the uv--nir in the science  demonstration phase catalogue	we present a technique to identify optical counterparts of 250 um-selectedsources from the herschel-atlas survey. of the 6621 250 um &gt; 32 mjy sources inour science demonstration catalogue we find that ~60 percent have counterpartsbrighter than r=22.4 mag in the sloan digital sky survey. applying a likelihoodratio technique we are able to identify 2423 of the counterparts with areliability r &gt; 0.8. this is approximately 37 percent of the full 250 microncatalogue. we have estimated photometric redshifts for each of these 2423reliable counterparts, while 1099 also have spectroscopic redshifts collatedfrom several different sources, including the gama survey. we estimate thecompleteness of identifying counterparts as a function of redshift, and presentevidence that 250 um-selected herschel-atlas galaxies have a bimodal redshiftdistribution. those with reliable optical identifications have a redshiftdistribution peaking at z ~ 0.25 +/- 0.05, while sub-mm colours suggest that asignificant fraction with no counterpart above the r-band limit have z &gt; 1. wealso suggest a method for selecting populations of strongly-lensed highredshift galaxies. our identifications are matched to uv--nir photometry fromthe gama survey, and these data are available as part of the herschel-atlaspublic data release.

1008.0009	unusual pah emission in nearby early-type galaxies: a signature of an  intermediate age stellar population?	we present the analysis of spitzer-irs spectra of four early-type galaxies,ngc 1297, ngc 5044, ngc 6868, and ngc 7079, all classified as liners in theoptical bands. their irs spectra present the full series of h2 rotationalemission lines in the range 5--38 microns, atomic lines, and prominent pahfeatures. we investigate the nature and origin of the pah emission,characterized by unusually low 6 -- 9/11.3 microns inter-band ratios. after thesubtraction of a passive early type galaxy template, we find that the 7 -- 9microns spectral region requires dust features not normally present in starforming galaxies. each spectrum is then analyzed with the aim of identifyingtheir components and origin. in contrast to normal star forming galaxies, wherecationic pah emission prevails, our 6--14 microns spectra seem to be dominatedby large and neutral pah emission, responsible for the low 6 -- 9/11.3 micronsratios, plus two broad dust emission features peaking at 8.2 microns and 12microns. theses broad components, observed until now mainly in evolved carbonstars and usually attributed to pristine material, contribute approximately30-50% of the total pah flux in the 6--14 microns region. we propose that thepah molecules in our etgs arise from fresh carbonaceous material which iscontinuously released by a population of carbon stars, formed in a rejuvenationepisode which occurred within the last few gyr. the analysis of the mir spectraallows us to infer that, in order to maintain the peculiar size and chargedistributions biased to large and neutral pahs, this material must be shocked,and excited by the weak uv interstellar radiation field of our etg.

1009.1058	evolution of dust temperature of galaxies through cosmic time as seen by  herschel	we study the dust properties of galaxies in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;2.8observed by the herschel space observatory in the field of the greatobservatories origins deep survey-north as part of pep and hermes keyprogrammes. infrared (ir) luminosity (l_ir) and dust temperature (t_dust) ofgalaxies are derived from the spectral energy distribution (sed) fit of thefar-infrared (fir) flux densities obtained with pacs and spire instrumentsonboard herschel. as a reference sample, we also obtain ir luminosities anddust temperatures of local galaxies at z&lt;0.1 using akari and iras data in thefield of the sloan digital sky survey. we compare the l_ir-t_dust relationbetween the two samples and find that: the median t_dust of herschel-selectedgalaxies at z&gt;0.5 with l_ir&gt;5x10^{10} l_\odot, appears to be 2-5 k colder thanthat of akari-selected local galaxies with similar luminosities; and thedispersion in t_dust for high-z galaxies increases with l_ir due to theexistence of cold galaxies that are not seen among local galaxies. we show thatthis large dispersion of the l_ir-t_dust relation can bridge the gap betweenlocal star-forming galaxies and high-z submillimeter galaxies (smgs). we alsofind that three smgs with very low t_dust (&lt;20 k) covered in this study haveclose neighbouring sources with similar 24-\mum brightness, which could lead toan overestimation of fir/(sub)millimeter fluxes of the smgs.

1009.5675	hermes: deep galaxy number counts from a p(d) fluctuation analysis of  spire science demonstration phase observations	dusty, star forming galaxies contribute to a bright, currently unresolvedcosmic far-infrared background. deep herschel-spire images designed to detectand characterize the galaxies that comprise this background are highlyconfused, such that the bulk lies below the classical confusion limit. weanalyze three fields from the hermes programme in all three spire bands (250,350, and 500 microns); parameterized galaxy number count models are derived toa depth of ~2 mjy/beam, approximately 4 times the depth of previous analyses atthese wavelengths, using a p(d) (probability of deflection) approach forcomparison to theoretical number count models. our fits account for 64, 60, and43 per cent of the far-infrared background in the three bands. the numbercounts are consistent with those based on individually detected spire sources,but generally inconsistent with most galaxy number counts models, whichgenerically overpredict the number of bright galaxies and are not as steep asthe p(d)-derived number counts. clear evidence is found for a break in theslope of the differential number counts at low flux densities. systematiceffects in the p(d) analysis are explored. we find that the effects ofclustering have a small impact on the data, and the largest identifiedsystematic error arises from uncertainties in the spire beam.

1010.4770	on the origin of m81 group extended dust emission	galactic cirrus emission at far-infrared wavelengths affects manyextragalactic observations. separating this emission from that associated withextragalactic objects is both important and difficult. in this paper we discussa particular case, the m81 group, and the identification of diffuse structuresprominent in the infrared, but also detected at optical wavelengths. the originof these structures has previously been controversial, ranging from them beingthe result of a past interaction between m81 and m82 or due to more localgalactic emission. we show that over of order a few arcminute scales thefar-infrared (herschel 250 &amp;\mu&amp;m) emission correlates spatially very well witha particular narrow velocity (2-3 km/s) component of the galactic hi. we findno evidence that any of the far-infrared emission associated with thesefeatures actually originates in the m81 group. thus we infer that theassociated diffuse optical emission must be due to galactic light backscattered off dust in our galaxy. ultra-violet observations pick out youngstellar associations around m81, but no detectable far-infrared emission. weconsider in detail one of the galactic cirrus features, finding that thefar-infrared hi relation breaks down below arc minute scales and that atsmaller scales there can be quite large dust temperature variations.

1010.5782	the first release of data from the herschel atlas: the spire images	we have reduced the data taken with the spectral and photometric imagingreceiver (spire) photometer on board the herschel space observatory in thescience demonstration phase (sdp) of the herschel astrophysical terahertz largearea survey (h-atlas). we describe the data reduction, which poses specificchallenges, both because of the sheer size of the data, and because only twoscans are made for each region. we implement effective solutions to process thebolometric timelines into maps, and show that correlations among detectors arenegligible, and that the photometer is stable on time scales up to 250 s. thisis longer than the time the telescope takes to cross the observed sky region,and it allows us to use naive binning methods for an optimal reconstruction ofthe sky emission. the maps have equal contribution of confusion and whiteinstrumental noise, and the latter is estimated to 5.3, 6.4, and 6.7 mjy/beam(1-{\sigma}), at 250, 350, and 500 \mu{m}, respectively. this pipeline is usedto reduce other h-atlas observations, as they became available, and we discusshow it can be used with the optimal map maker implemented in the herschelinteractive processing environment (hipe), to improve computational efficiencyand stability. the sdp dataset is available from http://www.h-atlas.org/.

1010.5787	herschel-atlas: first data release of the science demonstration phase  source catalogues	the herschel-atlas is a survey of 550 square degrees with the herschel spaceobservatory in five far--infrared and submillimetre bands. the first data forthe survey, observations of a field 4x4 sq. degrees in size, were taken duringthe science demonstration phase, and reach a 5 sigma noise level of 33 mjy/beamat 250 microns. this paper describes the source extraction methods used tocreate the corresponding science demonstration phase catalogue, which contains6876 sources, selected at 250 microns, within ~14 sq. degrees. spire sourcesare extracted using a new method specifically developed for herschel data; pacscounterparts of these sources are identified using circular apertures placed atthe spire positions. aperture flux densities are measured for sourcesidentified as extended after matching to optical wavelengths. the reliabilityof this catalogue is also discussed, using full simulated maps at the threespire bands. these show that a significant number of sources at 350 and 500microns have undergone flux density enhancements of up to a factor of ~2, duemainly to source confusion. correction factors are determined for theseeffects. the sdp dataset and corresponding catalogue will be available fromhttp://www.h-atlas.org/.

1011.5782	mid-infrared colour gradients and the colour-magnitude relation in virgo  early-type galaxies	we make use of spitzer imaging between 4 and 16 micron and near-infrared dataat 2.2 micron to investigate the nature and distribution of the mid-infraredemission in a sample of early-type galaxies in the virgo cluster. these dataallow us to conclude, with some confidence, that the emission at 16 micron inpassive etgs is stellar in origin, consistent with previous work concludingthat the excess mid-infrared emission comes from the dusty envelopes aroundevolved agb stars. there is little evidence for the mid-infrared emission of anunresolved central component, as might arise in the presence of a dusty torusassociated with a low-luminosity agn. we nonetheless find that the 16 micronemission is more centrally peaked than the near-infrared emission, implying aradial stellar population gradient. by comparing with independent evidence fromstudies at optical wavelengths, we conclude that a metallicity that falls withincreasing radius is the principal driver of the observed gradient. we alsoplot the mid-infrared colour-magnitude diagram and combine with similar work onthe coma cluster to define the colour-magnitude relation for absolute k-bandmagnitudes from -26 to -19. because a correlation between mass and age wouldproduce a relation with a gradient in the opposite sense to that observed, weconclude that the relation reflects the fact that passive etgs of lower massalso have a lower average metallicity. the colour-magnitude relation is thusdriven by metallicity effects. in contrast to what is found in coma, we do notfind any objects with anomalously bright 16 micron emission relative to thecolour-magnitude relation. although there is little overlap in the mass rangesprobed in the two clusters, this may suggest that observable ``rejuvenation''episodes are limited to intermediate mass objects.

1101.1080	sub-millimetre galaxies reside in dark matter halos with masses greater  than 3x10^11 solar masses	the extragalactic background light at far-infrared wavelengths originatesfrom optically-faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies in the universe withstar-formation rates at the level of a few hundred solar masses per year. dueto the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes, the faintsub-millimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually. instead, theiraverage properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular powerspectrum of the background intensity variations. a previous attempt atmeasuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clusteringamplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halomodel. here we report a clear detection of the excess clustering over thelinear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum ofbrightness fluctuations at 250, 350, and 500 microns. from this excess, we findthat sub-millimetre galaxies are located in dark matter halos with a minimummass of log[m_min/m_sun ]= 11.5^+0.7_-0.2 at 350 microns. this minimum darkmatter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for starformation in the universe, and is lower than that predicted by semi-analyticalmodels for galaxy formation.

(2008). we present a diagnosticdiagram that will help to identify similar sources based on spitzer/mips andherschel/pacs photometry. the sed of sage1cj053634 is peculiar because it lacksfar-ir emission and a clear stellar counterpart. we find that the sed and their spectrum can be understood as emission originating from the inner ~10 pcaround an accreting black hole. there is no need to invoke emission from thehost galaxy, either from the stars or from the interstellar medium, although apossible early-type host galaxy cannot be excluded based on the sed analysis.the hot dust around the accretion disk gives rise to a continuum, which peaksat 4 um, whereas the strong silicate features may arise from optically thinemission of dusty clouds within ~10 pc around the black hole. the weak pahemission does not appear to be linked to star formation, as star formationtemplates strongly over-predict the measured far-ir flux levels. the sed ofsage1cj053634 is rare in the local universe but may be more common in the moredistant universe. the conspicuous absence of host-galaxy ir emission placeslimits on the far-ir emission arising from the dusty torus alone.

1110.1260	non-standard grain properties, dark gas reservoir, and extended  submillimeter excess, probed by herschel in the large magellanic cloud	aims: in this paper, we perform detailed modelling of the spitzer andherschel observations of the lmc, in order to: (i) systematically study theuncertainties and biases affecting dust mass estimates; and to (ii) explore thepeculiar ism properties of the lmc.  methods: to achieve these goals, we have modelled the spatially resolved sedswith two alternate grain compositions, to study the impact of differentsubmillimetre opacities on the dust mass. we have rigorously propagated theobservational errors (noise and calibration) through the entire fittingprocess, in order to derive consistent parameter uncertainties.  results: first, we show that using the integrated sed leads tounderestimating the dust mass by ~50 % compared to the value obtained withsufficient spatial resolution, for the region we studied. this might be thecase, in general, for unresolved galaxies. second, we show that milky way typegrains produce higher gas-to-dust mass ratios than what seems possibleaccording to the element abundances in the lmc. a spatial analysis shows thatthis dilemma is the result of an exceptional property: the grains of the lmchave on average a larger intrinsic submm opacity (emissivity index beta~1.7 andopacity kappa_abs(160 microns)=1.6 m2/kg) than those of the galaxy. by studyingthe spatial distribution of the gas-to-dust mass ratio, we are able toconstrain the fraction of unseen gas mass between ~10, and ~100 % and show thatit is not sufficient to explain the gas-to-dust mass ratio obtained with milkyway type grains. finally, we confirm the detection of a 500 microns extendedemission excess with an average relative amplitude of ~15 %, varying up to 40%. this excess anticorrelates well with the dust mass surface density. althoughwe do not know the origin of this excess, we show that it is unlikely theresult of very cold dust, or cmb fluctuations.

1112.1408	the herschel reference survey: dust in early-type galaxies and across  the hubble sequence	we present herschel observations of 62 early-type galaxies (etgs), including39 galaxies morphologically classified as s0+s0a and 23 galaxies classified asellipticals using spire at 250, 350 and 500 microns (and pacs 100 and 160microns for 19 sources) as part of the volume-limited herschel referencesurvey. we detect dust emission in 24% of the ellipticals and 62% of the s0s.the mean temperature of the dust is 23.9+/-0.8 k, warmer than that found forlate-type galaxies in the virgo cluster. including the non-detections, the meandust mass is log(mdust) = 5.9+/-0.1 and 5.2+/-0.1 msun for the s0s andelliptical galaxies respectively. the mean dust-to-stellar mass islog(mdust/mstar) = -4.4+/-0.1 (s0s) and -5.8+/-0.1 (ellipticals). virtually allthe galaxies lie close to the red sequence yet the large number of detectionsof cool dust, the gas-to-dust ratios and the ratios of far-infrared to radioemission all suggest that many etgs contain a cool interstellar medium similarto that in late-type galaxies. the mean dust-to-stellar mass ratio for s0s isapproximatly a factor of ten less than for early-type spirals and the sizes ofthe dust sources in the s0s are also much smaller. we show that the differencecannot be explained by either the different bulge-to-disk ratios orenvironmental effects such as ram-pressure stripping. the wide range in thedust-to-stellar mass ratio for etgs and the lack of a correlation between dustmass and optical luminosity suggest that much of the dust in the etgs detectedby herschel has been acquired as the result of gravitational interactions;these interactions are unlikely to have had a major effect on the stellarmasses of the etgs. the herschel observations tentatively suggest that in themost massive etgs, the mass of the interstellar medium is unconnected to theevolution of the stellar populations.

1201.2305	fir colours of nearby late-type galaxies in the herschel reference  survey	we study the far infrared (60-500 $\mu$m) colours of late-type galaxies inthe $herschel$ reference survey, a k-band selected, volume limited sample ofnearby galaxies. the far infrared colours are correlated with each other, withtighter correlations for the indices that are closer in wavelength. we alsocompare the different colour indices to various tracers of the physicalproperties of the target galaxies, such as the surface brightness of theionising and non-ionising stellar radiation, the dust attenuation and themetallicity. the emission properties of the cold dust dominating the farinfrared spectral domain are regulated by the properties of the interstellarradiation field. consistent with that observed in nearby, resolved galaxies,our analysis shows that the ionising and the non-ionising stellar radiation,including that emitted by the most evolved, cold stars, both contribute to theheating of the cold dust component. this work also shows that metallicity isanother key parameter characterising the cold dust emission of normal,late-type galaxies. a single modified black body with a grain emissivity index$\beta$=1.5 better fits the observed spire flux density ratios $s250/s350$ vs.$s350/s500$ than $\beta$=2, although values of $\beta$ $\simeq$ 2 are possiblein metal rich, high surface brightness galaxies. values of $\beta$ $\lesssim$1.5 better represent metal poor, low surface brightness objects. thisobservational evidence provides strong constraints for dust emission models ofnormal, late type galaxies.

1203.2562	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: hermes	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey, hermes, is a legacy programdesigned to map a set of nested fields totalling ~380 deg^2. fields range insize from 0.01 to ~20 deg^2, using herschel-spire (at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m),and herschel-pacs (at 100 and 160 \mu m), with an additional wider component of270 deg^2 with spire alone. these bands cover the peak of the redshiftedthermal spectral energy distribution from interstellar dust and thus capturethe re-processed optical and ultra-violet radiation from star formation thathas been absorbed by dust, and are critical for forming a completemulti-wavelength understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.  the survey will detect of order 100,000 galaxies at 5\sigma in some of thebest studied fields in the sky. additionally, hermes is closely coordinatedwith the pacs evolutionary probe survey. making maximum use of the fullspectrum of ancillary data, from radio to x-ray wavelengths, it is designed to:facilitate redshift determination; rapidly identify unusual objects; andunderstand the relationships between thermal emission from dust and otherprocesses. scientific questions hermes will be used to answer include: thetotal infrared emission of galaxies; the evolution of the luminosity function;the clustering properties of dusty galaxies; and the properties of populationsof galaxies which lie below the confusion limit through lensing and statisticaltechniques.  this paper defines the survey observations and data products, outlines theprimary scientific goals of the hermes team, and reviews some of the earlyresults.

1205.3778	hermes: candidate gravitationally lensed galaxies and lensing statistics  at submillimeter wavelengths	we present a list of 13 candidate gravitationally lensed submillimetergalaxies (smgs) from 95 square degrees of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey, a surface density of 0.14\pm0.04deg^{-2}. the selectedsources have 500um flux densities (s_500) greater than 100mjy. gravitationallensing is confirmed by follow-up observations in 9 of the 13 systems (70%),and the lensing status of the four remaining sources is undetermined. we alsopresent a supplementary sample of 29 (0.31\pm0.06deg^{-2}) gravitationallylensed smg candidates with s_500=80--100mjy, which are expected to contain ahigher fraction of interlopers than the primary candidates. the number countsof the candidate lensed galaxies are consistent with a simple statistical modelof the lensing rate, which uses a foreground matter distribution, the intrinsicsmg number counts, and an assumed smg redshift distribution. the model predictsthat 32--74% of our s_500&gt;100mjy candidates are strongly gravitationally lensed(mu&gt;2), with the brightest sources being the most robust; this is consistentwith the observational data. our statistical model also predicts that, onaverage, lensed galaxies with s_500=100mjy are magnified by factors of ~9, withapparently brighter galaxies having progressively higher average magnification,due to the shape of the intrinsic number counts. 65% of the sources areexpected to have intrinsic 500micron flux densities less than 30mjy. thus,samples of strongly gravitationally lensed smgs, such as those presented here,probe below the nominal herschel detection limit at 500 micron. they are goodtargets for the detailed study of the physical conditions in distant dusty,star-forming galaxies, due to the lensing magnification, which can lead tospatial resolutions of ~0.01" in the source plane.

0712.1202	modelling the spectral energy distribution of ulirgs ii: the energetic  environment and the dense interstellar medium	we fit the near-infrared to radio spectral energy distributions of 30luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies with pure starburst models ormodels that include both starburst and agn components to determine importantphysical parameters for this population of objects. in particular we constrainthe optical depth towards the luminosity source, the star formation rate, thestar formation efficiency and the agn fraction. we find that although abouthalf of our sample have best-fit models that include an agn component, only 30%have an agn which accounts for more than 10% of the infrared luminosity,whereas all have an energetically dominant starburst. our derived agn fractionsare generally in good agreement other measurements based in the mid-infraredline ratios measured by spitzer irs, but lower than those derived from pahequivalent widths or the mid-infrared spectral slope. our models determine themass of dense molecular gas via the extinction required to reproduce the sed.assuming that this mass is that traced by hcn, we reproduce the observed linearrelation between hcn and infrared luminosities found by gao &amp; solomon. we alsofind that the star formation efficiency, defined as the current star formationrate per unit of dense molecular gas mass, is enhanced in the ulirgs phase. ifthe evolution of ulirgs includes a phase in which an agn contributes animportant fraction to the infrared luminosity, this phase should last an orderof magnitude less time than the starburst phase. because the mass of densemolecular gas which we derive is consistent with observations of the hcnmolecule,it should be possible to estimate the mass of dense, star-formingmolecular gas in such objects when molecular line data are not available.

1302.2825	the thermal dust emission in the n158-n159-n160 (lmc) star forming  complex mapped by spitzer, herschel and laboca	we present a study of the infrared/submm emission of the lmc star formingcomplex n158-n159-n160. combining observations from the spitzer space telescope(3.6-70um), the herschel space observatory (100-500um) and laboca (870um)allows us to work at the best angular resolution available now for anextragalactic source. we observe a remarkably good correlation between spireand laboca emission and resolve the low surface brightnesses emission. we usethe spitzer and herschel data to perform a resolved spectral energydistribution (sed) modelling of the complex. using mbb, we derive a globalemissivity index beta_c of 1.47. if beta cold is fixed to 1.5, we find anaverage temperature of 27k. we also apply the galliano et al. (2011) modellingtechnique (and amorphous carbon to model carbon dust) to derive maps of thestar formation rate, the mean starlight intensity, the fraction of pahs or thedust mass surface density of the region. we observe that the pah fractionstrongly decreases in the hii regions. this decrease coincides with peaks inthe mean radiation field intensity map. the dust surface densities follow thefir distribution, with a total dust mass of 2.1x10^4 msolar (2.8 times lessthan when using graphite grains) in the resolved elements we model. we find anon-negligible amount of dust in the molecular cloud n159 south (showing nomassive sf). we also investigate the drivers of the herschel/pacs and spiresubmm colours as well as the variations in the gas-to-dust mass ratio (g/d) andthe xco conversion factor in the region n159. we finally model individualregions to analyse variations in the sed shape across the complex and the 870umemission in more details. no measurable submm excess emission at 870um seems tobe detected in these regions.

1303.4584	a spitzer-irs spectroscopic atlas of early-type galaxies in the revised  shapley-ames catalog	we produce an atlas of homogeneously reduced and calibrated low resolutionirs spectra of the nuclear regions of nearby early-type galaxies (i.e. es ands0s, etgs), in order to build a reference sample in the mid-infrared window.from the spitzer heritage archive we extract etgs in the "revised shapley-amescatalog of bright galaxies" having an irs sl and/or ll spectrum. we recover 91spectra out of 363 galaxies classified as etgs in the catalog: 56 e (e0-e6), 8mixed e/s0+s0/e, 27 s0 (both normal and barred - sb0) plus mixed typessb0/sa+sb0/sba. for each galaxy, we provide the fully reduced and calibratedspectrum, the intensity of nebular and molecular emission lines as well as ofthe polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) after a template spectrum of apassively evolving etg has been subtracted. spectra are classified into fivemid-infrared classes, ranging from agn (class-4) and star forming nuclei(class-3), transition class-2 (with pahs) and class-1 (no-pahs) to passivelyevolving nuclei (class-0). a demographic study of mid-infrared spectra showsthat es are significantly more passive than s0s: 46^{+11}_{-10}% of es and20^{+11}_{-7}% of s0s have a spectrum of class-0. emission lines are revealedin 64^{+12}_{-6}% of etgs. the h_2-s(1) line is found with similar rate in es(34^{+10}_{-8}%) and in s0s (51^{+15}_{-12}%). pahs are detected in47^{+8}_{-7}% of etgs, but only 9^{+4}_{-3}% have pahs ratios typical of starforming galaxies. several indicators, such as peculiar morphologies andkinematics, dust--lane irregular shape, radio and x-ray properties, suggestthat mid-infrared spectral classes are connected to phases ofaccretion/feedback phenomena occurring in the nuclei of etgs.

1305.0449	tnos are cool: a survey of the trans-neptunian region. viii. combined  herschel pacs and spire observations of 9 bright targets at 70--500 micron	transneptunian objects (tnos) are bodies populating the kuiper belt and theyare believed to retain the most pristine and least altered material of thesolar system. the herschel open time key program entitled "tnos are cool: asurvey of the trans-neptunian region" has been awarded 373 h to investigate thealbedo, size distribution and thermal properties of tnos and centaurs. here wefocus on the brightest targets observed by both the pacs and spire multibandphotometers: the dwarf planet haumea, six tnos (huya, orcus, quaoar, salacia,2002 ux25, and 2002 tc302), and two centaurs (chiron and chariklo). fluxdensities are derived from pacs and spire instruments using optimised datareduction methods. the spectral energy distribution obtained with the herschelpacs and spire instruments over 6 bands (centred at 70, 100, 160, 250, 350, and500 $\mu$m), and with spitzer-mips at 23.7 and 71.4 $\mu$m has been modelledwith the neatm thermal model in order to derive the albedo, diameter, andbeaming factor. for the centaurs chiron and chariklo and for the 1000 km sizedorcus and quaoar, a thermophysical model was also run to better constrain theirthermal properties. we derive the size, albedo, and thermal properties,including thermal inertia and surface emissivity, for the 9 tnos and centaurs.several targets show a significant decrease in their spectral emissivitylongwards of $\sim$300 $\mu$m and especially at 500 $\mu$m. using our sizeestimations and the mass values available in the literature, we also derive thebulk densities for the binaries quaoar/weywot (2.18$^{+0.43}_{-0.36}$g/cm$^3$), orcus/vanth (1.53$^{+0.15}_{-0.13}$ g/cm$^3$), and salacia/actea(1.29$^{+0.29}_{-0.23}$ g/cm$^3$). quaoar's density is similar to that of theother dwarf planets pluto and haumea, and its value implies high contents ofrefractory materials mixed with ices.

1309.1371	revealing the cold dust in low-metallicity environments: i - photometry  analysis of the dwarf galaxy survey with herschel	we present new photometric data from our herschel key programme, the dwarfgalaxy survey (dgs), dedicated to the observation of the gas and dust in 48low-metallicity environments. they were observed with pacs and spire onboardherschel at 70,100,160,250,350, and 500 microns. we focus on a systematiccomparison of the derived fir properties (fir luminosity, dust mass, dusttemperature and emissivity index) with more metal-rich galaxies and investigatethe detection of a potential submm excess. the data reduction method is adaptedfor each galaxy to derive the most reliable photometry from the final maps.pacs flux densities are compared with the mips 70 and 160 microns bands. we usecolour-colour diagrams and modified blackbody fitting procedures to determinethe dust properties of the dgs galaxies. we also include galaxies from theherschel kingfish sample, containing more metal-rich environments, totalling109 galaxies. the location of the dgs galaxies on herschel colour-colourdiagrams highlights the differences in global environments of low-metallicitygalaxies. the dust in dgs galaxies is generally warmer than in kingfishgalaxies (t_dgs~32 k, t_kingfish~23 k). the emissivity index, beta, is ~1.7 inthe dgs, but metallicity does not make a strong effect on beta. thedust-to-stellar mass ratio is lower in low-metallicity galaxies:m_dust/m_star~0.02% for the dgs vs 0.1% for kingfish. per unit dust mass, dwarfgalaxies emit ~6 times more in the fir than higher metallicity galaxies. out ofthe 22 dgs galaxies detected at 500 micron, 41% present an excess in the submmnot explained by our dust sed model. the excess mainly appears in lowermetallicity galaxies (12+log(o/h) &lt; 8.3), and the strongest excesses aredetected in the most metal-poor galaxies. we stress the need for observationslongwards of the herschel wavelengths to detect any submm excess appearingbeyond 500 micron.

1310.4147	the suppression of star formation by powerful active galactic nuclei	the old, red stars which constitute the bulges of galaxies, and the massiveblack holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history whengalaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (agn)shone brightly from accretion onto black holes. it is widely suspected, butunproven, that the tight correlation in mass of the black hole and stellarcomponents results from the agn quenching the surrounding star formation as itapproaches its peak luminosity. x-rays trace emission from agn unambiguously,while powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and arebrightest at infrared to submillimetre wavelengths. here we report observationsin the submillimetre and x-ray which show that rapid star formation was commonin the host galaxies of agn when the universe was 2-6 gyrs old, but that themost vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an x-rayluminosity of 10^44 erg/s. this suppression of star formation in the hostgalaxies of powerful agn is a key prediction of models in which the agn drivesa powerful outflow, expelling the interstellar medium of its host galaxy andtransforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.

1403.4082	a spitzer-irs view of early-type galaxies with cuspy/core nuclei and  with fast/slow rotation	the recent literature suggests that an evolutionary dichotomy exists forearly-type galaxies (es and s0s, etgs) whereby their central photometricstructure (cuspy versus core central luminosity profiles), and figure ofrotation (fast (fr) vs. slow (sr) rotators), are determined by whether theyformed by "wet" or "dry" mergers. we consider whether the mid infrared (mir)properties of etgs, with their sensitivity to accretion processes in particularin the last few gyr (on average z &lt; 0.2), can put further constraints on thispicture. we investigate a sample of 49 etgs for which nuclear mir propertiesand detailed photometrical and kinematical classifications are available fromthe recent literature. in the stellar light cuspy/core etgs show a dichotomythat is mainly driven by their luminosity. however in the mir, the brightestcore etgs show evidence that accretions have triggered both agn and starformation activity in the recent past, challenging a "dry" merger scenario. incontrast, we do find, in the virgo and fornax clusters, that cuspy etgs,fainter than m$_{k_s}=-24$, are predominantly passively evolving in the sameepoch, while, in low density environments, they tend to be more active. asignificant and statistically similar fraction of both fr (38$^{+18}_{-11}$\%)and sr (50$^{+34}_{-21}$\%) shows pah features in their mir spectra. ionizedand molecular gas are also frequently detected. recent star formation episodesare then a common phenomenon in both kinematical classes, even in thosedominated by agn activity, suggesting a similar evolutionary path in the lastfew gyr. mir spectra suggest that the photometric segregation between cuspy andcore nuclei and the dynamical segregation between fr and sr must haveoriginated before z~0.2.

0807.3335	extremely massive young clusters in ngc1365	in a previous work, three bright mir/radio sources were discovered in thenuclear region of ngc1365. we here confirm that these sources are young andmassive ``embedded'' clusters, and derive their parameters, such as extinction,age and mass. using isaac and visir at the vlt we obtained nir and mir maps andlr spectra. the dataset is first interpreted by comparing the observations withimages and spectra of the close-by young cluster r136 in the lmc and then byusing model predictions for both the nebular emission lines and the spectralenergy distribution of the sources. we produce maps of the region containingthe three sources in the r, j, ks, l' bands and at 12.8micro. we also providespectra in k, l and n. the spectral energy distribution of the three sourcesrises with wavelength. emission lines from ionised hydrogen and molecularhydrogen are detected, as well as pah emission. conspicuous [neii]12.8 line isalso present, while neither the [ariii] 8.9 nor the [siv] 10.4 lines aredetected. this provides a stringent constraint on the age of the sources: theyare relatively evolved young clusters (6-8 myr). owing to their ionising photonrates and ages, they must be extremely massive clusters (around 10^7 solarmasses). their mir spectral energy distribution suggests the presence of twocomponents: (1) an optically thin component, with a continuum comparable tothat of r136, and (2) an optically thick component which might be related tosubsequent or on-going episodes of star formation. these sources are goodcandidates for evolving according to a bi-modal hydrodynamical regime, in whichmatter is trapped at the centre of a compact and massive cluster.

astro-ph;0102464	theoretical predictions on the clustering of scuba galaxies and  implications for small-scale fluctuations at sub-mm wavelengths	this paper investigates the clustering properties of scuba-selected galaxiesin the framework of a unifying scheme relating the formation of qsos andspheroids (granato et al. 2000). the theoretical angular correlation functionis derived for different bias functions, corresponding to different values ofthe ratio $m_{\rm halo}/m_{\rm sph}$ between the mass of the dark halo and thefinal mass in stars. scuba sources are predicted to be strongly clustered, witha clustering strength increasing with mass. we show that the model accounts forthe clustering of lyman-break galaxies, seen as the optical counterpart of low-to intermediate-mass primeval spheroidal galaxies and is also consistent withthe observed angular correlation function of extremely red objects. bestagreement is obtained for $m_{\rm halo}/m_{\rm sph}=100$. we also consider theimplications for small scale fluctuations observed at sub-mm wavelengths bycurrent or forthcoming experiments aimed at mapping the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb). the predicted amplitude of the clustering signal in the 350ghz channel of the planck mission strongly depends on the halo-to-bulge massratio and may be of comparable amplitude to primary cmb anisotropies formultipole numbers $l\simgt 50$.

0808.2899	the mid-infrared colour-magnitude relation of early-type galaxies in the  coma cluster as measured by spitzer-irs	we use 16 micron, spitzer-irs, blue peakup photometry of 50 early-typegalaxies in the coma cluster to define the mid-infrared colour-magnituderelation. we compare with recent simple stellar population models that includethe mid-infrared emission from the extended, dusty envelopes of evolved stars.the ks-[16] colour in these models is very sensitive to the relative populationof dusty asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars. we find that the passivelyevolving early-type galaxies define a sequence of approximately constant age(~10 gyr) with varying metallicity. several galaxies that lie on theoptical/near-infrared colour-magnitude relation do not lie on the mid-infraredrelation. this illustrates the sensitivity of the ks-[16] colour to age. thefact that a colour-magnitude relation is seen in the mid-infrared underlinesthe extremely passive nature of the majority (68%) of early-type galaxies inthe coma cluster. the corollary of this is that 32% of the early-type galaxiesin our sample are not `passive', insofar as they are either significantlyyounger than 10 gyr or they have had some rejuvenation episode within the lastfew gyr.

astro-ph;0307096	dust and nebular emission. i. models for normal galaxies	we present a model for nebular emission in star forming galaxies, which takesinto account the effects of dust reprocessing. the nebular emissions have beencomputed with cloudy and then included into grasil, our spectrophotometric codespecifically developed for dusty galaxies. the interface between nebularemission and population synthesis is based on a set of pre-computed hii regionemission models covering a wide range of physical quantities. concerning theextinction properties of normal star forming galaxies, we are able to interpretthe observed lack of correlation between the attenuation measured at halpha andin the uv band as a consequence of age selective extinction. we also find that,for these galaxies with modest sfr, the ratio fir/uv provides the bestconstraints on the uv attenuation. our model also allows to deal with differentsfr estimators in a consistent way, from the uv to radio wavelengths, and todiscuss the uncertainties arising from the different physical conditionsencountered in star forming galaxies. we provide our best estimates ofsfr/luminosity calibrations, together with their expected range of variation.it results that sfr derived through halpha, even when corrected for extinctionusing the balmer decrement, is affected by important uncertainties due to ageselective extinction. another remarkable result is that sfr from uv luminositycorrected by means of the ratio fir/uv has a small uncertainty. finally, ourmodel provides a calibration of sfr from radio luminosity; we are also able toreproduce the observed fir/radio ratio.

astro-ph;0510080	the evolution of actively star forming galaxies in the mid infrared	in this paper we analyze the evolution of actively star forming galaxies inthe mid-infrared (mir). this spectral region, characterized by continuumemission by hot dust and by the presence of strong emission features generallyascribed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) molecules, is the moststrongly affected by the heating processes associated with star formationand/or active galactic nuclei (agn). following the detailed observationalcharacterization of galaxies in the mir by iso, we have updated the modellingof this spectral region in our spectro-photometric model grasil (silva et al.1998). in the diffuse component we have updated the treatment of pahs accordingto the model by li &amp; draine (2001). as for the dense phase of the ismassociated with the star forming regions, the molecular clouds, we stronglydecrease the abundance of pahs as compared to that in the cirrus, basing on theobservational evidences of the lack or weakness of pah bands close to the newlyformed stars, possibly due to the destruction of the molecules in strong uvfields. the robustness of the model is checked by fitting near infrared toradio broad band spectra and the corresponding detailed mir spectra of a largesample of galaxies (lu et al. 2003), at once. with this model, we have analyzedthe larger sample of actively star forming galaxies by dale et al. (2000). weshow that the observed trends of galaxies in the iso-iras-radio color-colorplots can be interpreted in terms of different evolutionary phases of starformation activity, and the consequent different dominance in the spectralenergy distribution (sed) of the diffuse or dense phase of the ism.

astro-ph;0612087	uv dust attenuation in spiral galaxies: the role of age-dependent  extinction and of the imf	we analyse the attenuation properties of a sample of uv selected galaxies,with the use of the spectrophotometric model grasil. in particular, we focus onthe relation between dust attenuation and the reddening in the uv spectralregion. we show that a realistic modelling of geometrical distribution of dustand of the different population of stars can explain the uv reddening of normalspiral galaxies also with a standard milky way dust. our results clearlyunderline that it is fundamental to take into account that younger stars suffera higher attenuation than older stars (the age-dependent extinction) becausestars are born in more-than-average dusty environments. in this work we alsofind that the concentration of young stars on the galactic plane of spirals hasa relevant impact on the expected uv colours, impact that has not been exploredbefore this paper. finally, we discuss the role of imf in shaping the relationbetween uv reddening and dust attenuation, and we show that a kroupa imf ismore consistent with observed data than the classical salpeter imf.

astro-ph;9911304	joint formation of qsos and spheroids: qsos as clocks of star formation  in spheroids	direct and indirect observational evidence leads to the conclusion that highredshift qsos did shine in the core of early type proto-galaxies during theirmain episode of star formation. exploting this fact, we derive the rate offormation of this kind of stellar systems at high redshift by using the qsoluminosity function. the elemental proportions in elliptical galaxies, thedescendents of the qso hosts, suggest that the star formation was more rapid inmore massive objects. we show that this is expected to occur in dark matterhaloes, when the processes of cooling and heating is considered. this is alsoconfirmed by comparing the observed sub-mm counts to those derived by couplingthe formation rate and the star formation rate of the spheroidal galaxies witha detailed model for their sed evolution. in this scenario scuba galaxies andlyman break galaxies are early type proto-galaxies forming the bulk of theirstars before the onset of qso activity.
