0901.0934	spectroscopic binaries among hipparcos m giants i. data, orbits, and  intrinsic variations	this paper is a follow-up of the vast effort to collect radial velocity datafor stars belonging to the hipparcos survey. we aim at extending the orbitaldata available for binaries with m giant primaries. the data will be used inthe companion papers of this series to (i) derive the binary frequency among mgiants and compare it to that of k giants (paper ii), and (ii) analyse theeccentricity-period diagram and the mass-function distribution (paper iii).keplerian solutions are fitted to radial-velocity data. however, for severalstars, no satisfactory solution could be found, despite the fact that theradial-velocity standard deviation is larger than the instrumental error,because m giants suffer from intrinsic radial-velocity variations due topulsations. we show that these intrinsic radial-velocity variations can belinked with both the average spectral-line width and the photometricvariability. we present an extensive collection of spectroscopic orbits for mgiants, with 12 new orbits, plus 17 from the literature. moreover, toillustrate the fact that the large radial-velocity jitter present in mira andsemi-regular variables may easily be confused with orbital variations, we alsopresent examples of pseudo-orbital variations (in s uma, x cnc and possibly inhd 115521, a former iau radial-velocity standard). because of this difficulty,m giants involving mira variables were excluded from our monitored sample. wefinally show that the majority of m giants detected as x-ray sources areactually binaries.

0901.0937	spectroscopic binaries among hipparcos m giants ii. binary frequency	this paper is the second one in a series devoted to the study of propertiesof binaries involving m giants. the binary frequency of field m giants isderived and compared with the binary fraction of k giants. diagrams of thecoravel spectroscopic parameter sb (measuring the average line-width) vs.radial-velocity standard deviation for our samples are used to defineappropriate binarity criteria. these then serve to extract the binarityfraction among the m giants. comparison is made to earlier data on k giantsbinarity frequency. the sb parameter is discussed in relation to global stellarparameters and the sb vs. stellar radius relation is used to identify fastrotators. we find that the spectroscopic binary detection rate among field mgiants, in a sample with a low number of velocity measurements (~2), unbiasedtoward earlier known binaries, is 6.3%. this is less than half of the analogousrate for field k giants, likely resulting from a real difference. thisdifference originates in the greater difficulty of finding binaries among mgiants because of their smaller orbital velocity amplitudes and largerintrinsic jitter and in the different distributions of k and m giants in theeccentricity-period diagram. a larger detection rate was obtained in a smallerm giant sample with more radial velocity measurements per object: 11.1%confirmed plus 2.7% possible binaries. the coravel spectroscopic parameter sbwas found to correlate better with the stellar radius than with eitherluminosity or effective temperature separately. two outliers of the sb vs.stellar radius relation, hd 190658 and hd 219654, have been recognized as fastrotators. the rotation is companion-induced, as both objects turn out to bespectroscopic binaries.

0901.0938	spectroscopic binaries among hipparcos m giants iii. the  eccentricity-period diagram and mass-transfer signatures	this paper is the third one in a series devoted to studying the properties ofbinaries involving m giants. we use a new set of orbits to construct the first(e-logp) diagram of an extensive sample of m giant binaries, to obtain theirmass-function distribution, and to derive evolutionary constraints for thisclass of binaries and related systems. the orbital properties of binariesinvolving m giants were analysed and compared with those of related families ofbinaries (k giants, post-agb stars, barium stars, tc-poor s stars). the orbitalelements of post-agb stars and m giants are not different, which may veryindicate that, for the considered sample of post-agb binaries, the post-agbstar left the agb at quite an early stage (m4 or so). neither are the orbitalelements of post-mass-transfer binaries like barium stars very different fromthose of m giants, suggesting that the mass transfer did not alter the orbitalelements much, contrary to current belief. finally, we show that binary systemswith e &lt; 0.4 log p - 1 (with periods expressed in days) are predominantlypost-mass-transfer systems, because (i) the vast majority of barium and ssystems match this condition, and (ii) these systems have companion massespeaking around 0.6 solar mass, as expected for white dwarfs. the latterproperty has been shown to hold as well for open-cluster binaries involving kgiants, for which a lower bound on the companion mass may easily be set.

0901.4737	a holistic approach to carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars	by considering the various cemp subclasses separately, we try to derive, fromthe specific signatures imprinted on the abundances, parameters (such asmetallicity, mass, temperature, and neutron source) characterizing agbnucleosynthesis from the specific signatures imprinted on the abundances, andseparate them from the impact of thermohaline mixing, first dredge-up, anddilution associated with the mass transfer from the companion.to put cemp starsin a broad context, we collect abundances for about 180 stars of variousmetallicities, luminosity classes, and abundance patterns, from our own sampleand from literature. first, we show that there are cemp stars which share theproperties of cemp-s stars and cemp-no stars (which we call cemp-low-s stars).we also show that there is a strong correlation between ba and c abundances inthe s-only cemp stars. this strongly points at the operation of the 13c neutronsource in low-mass agb stars. for the cemp-rs stars (seemingly enriched withelements from both the s- and r-processes), the correlation of the n abundanceswith abundances of heavy elements from the 2nd and 3rd s-process peaks bearsinstead the signature of the 22ne neutron source. adding the fact that cemp-rsstars exhibit o and mg enhancements, we conclude that extremely hot conditionsprevailed during the thermal pulses of the contaminating agb stars. finally, weargue that most cemp-no stars (with no overabundances for the neutron-captureelements) are likely the extremely metal-poor counterparts of cempneutron-capture-rich stars. we also show that the c enhancement in cemp-nostars declines with metallicity at extremely low metallicity ([fe/h]~&lt; -3.2).this trend is not predicted by any of the current agb models.

1003.4399	angular diameter estimation of interferometric calibrators - example of  lambda gruis, calibrator for vlti-amber	context. accurate long-baseline interferometric measurements require carefulcalibration with reference stars. small calibrators with high angular diameteraccuracy ensure the true visibility uncertainty to be dominated by themeasurement errors. aims. we review some indirect methods for estimatingangular diameter, using various types of input data. each diameter estimate,obtained for the test-case calibrator star lambda gru, is compared with thevalue 2.71 mas found in the bord\'e calibrator catalogue published in 2002.methods. angular size estimations from spectral type, spectral index, in-bandmagnitude, broadband photometry, and spectrophotometry give close estimates ofthe angular diameter, with slightly variable uncertainties. fits on photometryand spectrophotometry need physical atmosphere models with "plausible" stellarparameters. angular diameter uncertainties were estimated by means of residualbootstrapping confidence intervals. all numerical results and graphical outputspresented in this paper were obtained using the routines developed underpv-wave, which compose the modular software suite spidast, created to calibrateand interprete spectroscopic and interferometric measurements, particularlythose obtained with vlti-amber. results. the final angular diameter estimate2.70 mas of lambda gru, with 68% confidence interval 2.65-2.81 mas, is obtainedby fit of the marcs model on the iso-sws 2.38-27.5 mum spectrum, with thestellar parameters t_eff = 4 250 k, log(g) = 2.0, z = 0.0 dex, m = 1.0 m_sun,and xi_turb = 2.0 km/s.

1012.5234	radiative hydrodynamics simulations of red supergiant stars. iii.  spectro-photocentric variability, photometric variability, and consequences  on gaia measurements	context. it has been shown that convection in red supergiant stars gives riseto large granules causing surface inhomogeneities together with shock waves inthe photosphere. the resulting motion of the photocenter (on time scalesranging from months to years) could possibly have adverse effects on theparallax determination with gaia. aims. we explore the impact of thegranulation on the photocentric and photometric variability. we quantify theseeffects in order to better characterize the error possibly altering theparallax. methods. we use 3d radiative-hydrodynamics simulations of convectionwith co5bold and the post-processing radiative transfer code optim3d to computeintensity maps and spectra in the gaia g band [325-1030 nm]. results. weprovide astrometric and photometric predictions from 3d simulations of rsgsthat are used to evaluate the degradation of the astrometric parameters ofevolved stars derived by gaia. we show from rhd simulations that a supergiantlike betelgeuse exhibits a photocentric noise characterised by a standarddeviation of the order of 0.1 au. the number of bright giant and supergiantstars whose gaia parallaxes will be altered by the photocentric noise rangesfrom a few tens to several thousandths. the degradation of the astrometric fitdue to the presence of this photocentric noise will be noticeable up to about 5kpc for the brightest supergiants. moreover, parallaxes of supergiants areaffected by a error of the order of a few percents. we show that thephotocentric noise, as predicted by the 3d simulation, does account for asubstantial part of the supplementary 'cosmic noise' that affects hipparcosmeasurements of betelgeuse and antares.

1106.3645	x her and tx psc: two cases of ism interaction with stellar winds  observed by herschel	the asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars x her and tx psc have been imaged at70 and 160 microns with the pacs instrument onboard the herschel satellite, aspart of the large mess (mass loss of evolved stars) guaranteed time keyprogram. the images reveal an axisymmetric extended structure with its axisoriented along the space motion of the stars. this extended structure is verylikely to be shaped by the interaction of the wind ejected by the agb star withthe surrounding interstellar medium (ism). as predicted by numericalsimulations, the detailed structure of the wind-ism interface depends upon therelative velocity between star+wind and the ism, which is large for these twostars (108 and 55 km/s for x her and tx psc, respectively). in both cases,there is a compact blob upstream whose origin is not fully elucidated, but thatcould be the signature of some instability in the wind-ism shock. deconvolvedimages of x her and tx psc reveal several discrete structures along theoutermost filaments, which could be kelvin-helmholtz vortices. finally, tx pscis surrounded by an almost circular ring (the signature of the terminationshock?) that contrasts with the outer, more structured filaments. a similarinner circular structure seems to be present in x her as well, albeit lessclearly.

1110.5486	a far-infrared survey of bow shocks and detached shells around agb stars  and red supergiants	far-infrared herschel/pacs images at 70 and 160 micron of a sample of 78galactic evolved stars are used to study the (dust) emission structures,originating from stellar wind-ism interaction. in addition, two-fluidhydrodynamical simulations of the coupled gas and dust in wind-ism interactionsare used to compare with the observations.  four distinct classes of wind-ism interaction (i.e. "fermata", "eyes","irregular", and "rings") are identified and basic parameters affecting themorphology are discussed. we detect bow shocks for ~40% of the sample anddetached rings for ~20%. de-projected stand-off distances (r_0) -- defined asthe distance between the central star and the nearest point of the interactionregion -- of the detected bow shocks ("fermata" and "eyes") are derived fromthe pacs images and compared to previous results, model predictions and thesimulations. all observed bow shocks have stand-off distances smaller than 1pc. observed and theoretical stand-off distances are used together toindependently derive the local ism density.  both theoretical (analytical) models and hydrodynamical simulations givestand-off distances for adopted stellar properties that are in good agreementwith the measured de-projected stand-off distance of wind-ism bow shocks. thepossible detection of a bow shock -- for the distance limited sample -- appearsto be governed by its physical size as set roughly by the stand-off distance.in particular the star's peculiar space velocity and the density of the ismappear decisive in detecting emission from bow shocks or detached rings.tentatively, the "eyes" class objects are associated to (visual) binaries,while the "rings" generally appear not to occur for m-type stars, only for c ors-type objects that have experienced a thermal pulse.

1112.5994	modeling the asymmetric wind of massive lbv binary mwc 314	spectroscopic monitoring with mercator-hermes over the past two years revealsthat mwc 314 is a massive binary system composed of an early b-type primary lbvstar and a less-luminous supergiant companion. we determine an orbital periodporb of 60.85 d from optical s ii and ne i absorption lines observed in thissingle-lined spectroscopic binary. we find an orbital eccentricity of e=0.26,and a large amplitude of the radial velocity curve of 80.6 km/s. the asas vlight-curve during our spectroscopic monitoring reveals two brightness minima(\delta v~0.1 mag.) over the orbital period due to partial eclipses at anorbital inclination angle of ~70 degrees. we find a clear correlation betweenthe orbital phases and the detailed shapes of optical and near-ir p cygni-typeline profiles of he i, si ii, and double- or triple-peaked stationary cores ofprominent fe ii emission lines. a preliminary 3-d radiative transfer modelcomputed with wind3d shows that the periodic p cygni line profile variabilityresults from an asymmetric common-envelope wind with enhanced density (or lineopacity) in the vicinity of the lbv primary. the variable orientation of theinner lbv wind region due to the orbital motion produces variable p cygni lineprofiles (with wind velocities of ~200 km/s) between orbital phases \phi = 0.65to 0.85, while weak inverse p cygni profiles are observed half an orbitalperiod later around \phi = 0.15 to 0.35. we do not observe optical or near-irhe ii, c iii, and si iii lines, signaling that the lbv's spectral type is laterthan b0. detailed modeling of the asymmetrical wind properties of massivebinary mwc 314 provides important new physical information about the mostluminous hot (binary) stars such as eta carinae.

1202.5553	mass ratio from doppler beaming and r{\o}mer delay versus ellipsoidal  modulation in the kepler data of koi-74	we present a light curve analysis and radial velocity study of koi-74, aneclipsing a star + white dwarf binary with a 5.2 day orbit. aside from newspectroscopy covering the orbit of the system, we used 212 days of publiclyavailable kepler observations and present the first complete light curvefitting to these data, modelling the eclipses and transits, ellipsoidalmodulation, reflection, and doppler beaming. markov chain monte carlosimulations are used to determine the system parameters and uncertaintyestimates. our results are in agreement with earlier studies, except that wefind an inclination of 87.0 \pm 0.4\degree, which is significantly lower thanthe previously published value. we find that the mass ratio derived from theradial velocity amplitude (q=0.104 \pm 0.004) disagrees with that derived fromthe ellipsoidal modulation (q=0.052 \pm 0.004} assuming corotation). this wasfound before, but with our smaller inclination, the discrepancy is even largerthan previously reported. accounting for the rapid rotation of the a-star isfound to increase the discrepancy even further by lowering the mass ratio toq=0.047 \pm 0.004. these results indicate that one has to be extremely carefulin using the amplitude of an ellipsoidal modulation signal in a close binary todetermine the mass ratio, when a proof of corotation is not firmly established.the radial velocities that can be inferred from the detected doppler beaming inthe light curve are found to be in agreement with our spectroscopic radialvelocity determination. we also report the first measurement of r{\o}mer delayin a light curve of a compact binary. this delay amounts to -56 \pm 17 s and isconsistent with the mass ratio derived from the radial velocity amplitude. thefirm establishment of this mass ratio at q=0.104 \pm 0.004 leaves little doubtthat the companion of koi-74 is a low mass white dwarf.

1204.3004	time resolved spectroscopy of bd+46 442: gas streams and jet creation in  a newly discovered evolved binary with a disk	previous studies have shown that many post-agb stars with dusty disks areassociated with single-lined binary stars. to verify the binarity hypothesis ona larger sample, we started a high-resolution spectral monitoring of about 40field giants, whose binarity was suspected based on either a light curve, aninfrared excess, or a peculiar chemical composition. here we report on thediscovery of the periodic rv variations in bd+46 442, a high-latitude f giantwith a disk. we interpret the variations due to the motion around a faintcompanion, and deduce the following orbital parameters: porb = 140.77 d, e =0.083, asini=0.31 au. we find it to be a moderately metal-poor star([m/h]=-0.7) without a strong depletion pattern in the photospheric abundances.interestingly, many lines show periodic changes with the orbital phase: halphaswitches between a double-peak emission and a pcyg-like profiles, while strongmetal lines appear split during the maximum redshift. similar effects arelikely visible in the spectra of other post-agb binaries, but their regularityis not always realized due to sporadic observations. we propose that thesefeatures result from an ongoing mass transfer from the evolved giant to thecompanion. in particular, the blue-shifted absorption in halpha, which occursonly at superior conjunction, may result from a jet originating in theaccretion disk around the companion and seen in absorption towards the luminousprimary.

1306.1348	critically-rotating accretors and non-conservative evolution in algols	during the mass-transfer phase in algol systems, a large amount of mass andangular momentum are accreted by the gainer star which can be accelerated up toits critical keplerian velocity. the fate of the gainer once it reaches thiscritical value is unclear. we investigate the orbital and stellar spinevolution in semi-detached binary systems, specifically for systems withrapidly rotating accretors. our aim is to better distinguish between thedifferent spin-down mechanisms proposed which can consistently explain the slowrotation observed in algols' final states and assess the degree ofnon-conservatism due to the formation of a hotspot. we use our state-of-the-artbinary evolution code, binstar, which incorporates a detailed treatment of theorbital and stellar spin, including all torques due to mass transfer, theinteractions between a star and its accretion disc, tidal effects and magneticbraking. we also present a new prescription for mass loss due to the formationof a hotspot based on energy conservation. the coupling between the star andthe disc via the boundary layer prevents the gainer from exceeding the criticalrotation. magnetic-field effects, although operating, are not the dominantspin-down mechanism for sensible field strengths. spin down owing to tides is2-4 orders of magnitudes too weak to compensate the spinning-up torque due tomass accretion. moreover, we find that the final separation strongly depends onthe spin-down mechanism. the formation of a hotspot leads to a large event ofmass loss during the rapid phase of mass transfer. the degree of conservatismstrongly depends on the opacity of the impacted material. a statistical studyas well as new observational constraints are needed to find the optimal set ofparameters (magnetic-field strength, hotspot geometry,...) to reproduce algolevolutions.

1308.4638	modelling the asymmetric wind of the luminous blue variable binary mwc  314	we present a spectroscopic analysis of mwc 314, a luminous blue variable(lbv) candidate with an extended bipolar nebula. the detailed spectroscopicvariability is investigated to determine if mwc 314 is a massive binary systemwith a supersonically accelerating wind or a low-mass b[e] star. we compare thespectrum and spectral energy distribution to other lbvs (such as p cyg) andfind very similar physical wind properties, indicating strong kinship. wecombined long-term high-resolution optical spectroscopic monitoring and v-bandphotometric observations to determine the orbital elements and stellarparameters and to investigate the spectral variability with the orbital phases.we developed an advanced model of the large-scale wind-velocity andwind-density structure with 3-d radiative transfer calculations that fit theorbitally modulated p cyg profile of he i lam5876, showing outflow velocitiesabove 1000 km/s. we find that mwc 314 is a massive semi-detached binary systemof ~1.22 au, observed at an inclination angle of i=72.8 deg. with an orbitalperiod of 60.8 d and e=0.23. the primary star is a low-vsini lbv candidate ofm1=39.6 msun and r1=86.8 rsun. the detailed radiative transfer fits show thatthe geometry of wind density is asymmetric around the primary star withincreased wind density by a factor of 3.3, which leads the orbit of theprimary. the variable orientation causes the orbital modulation that isobserved in absorption portions of p cyg wind lines. wind accretion in thesystem produces a circumbinary disc. mwc 314 is in a crucial evolutionary phaseof close binary systems, when the massive primary star has its h envelope beingstripped and is losing mass to a circumbinary disc. mwc 314 is a key system forstudying the evolutionary consequences of these effects.

1311.4370	a search for pulsations in the hgmn star hd 45975 with corot photometry  and ground-based spectroscopy	the existence of pulsations in hgmn stars is still being debated. to providethe first unambiguous observational detection of pulsations in this class ofchemically peculiar objects, the bright star hd 45975 was monitored for nearlytwo months by the corot satellite. independent analyses of the light curveprovides evidence of monoperiodic variations with a frequency of 0.7572 c/d anda peak-to-peak amplitude of ~2800 ppm. multisite, ground-based spectroscopicobservations overlapping the corot observations show the star to be along-period, single-lined binary. furthermore, with the notable exception ofmercury, they reveal the same periodicity as in photometry in the line momentsof chemical species exhibiting strong overabundances (e.g., mn and y). incontrast, lines of other elements do not show significant variations. as foundin other hgmn stars, the pattern of variability consists in an absorption bumpmoving redwards across the line profiles. we argue that the photometric andspectroscopic changes are more consistent with an interpretation in terms ofrotational modulation of spots at the stellar surface. in this framework, theexistence of pulsations producing photometric variations above the ~50 ppmlevel is unlikely in hd 45975. this provides strong constraints on theexcitation/damping of pulsation modes in this hgmn star.

1411.4919	are the orbital poles of binary stars in the solar neighbourhood  anisotropically distributed?	we test whether or not the orbital poles of the systems in the solarneighbourhood are isotropically distributed on the celestial sphere. theproblem is plagued by the ambiguity on the position of the ascending node. ofthe 95 systems closer than 18 pc from the sun with an orbit in the 6thcatalogue of orbits of visual binaries, the pole ambiguity could be resolvedfor 51 systems using radial velocity collected in the literature and coraveldatabase or acquired with the hermes-mercator spectrograph. for severalsystems, we can correct the erroneous nodes in the 6th catalogue of orbits andobtain new combined spectroscopic-astrometric orbits for seven systems [wds01083+5455aa,ab; 01418+4237ab; 02278+0426ab (sb2); 09006+4147ab (sb2);16413+3136ab; 17121+4540ab; 18070+3034ab]. we used of spherical statistics totest for possible anisotropy. after ordering the binary systems by increasingdistance from the sun, we computed the false-alarm probability for subsamplesof increasing sizes, from n = 1 up to the full sample of 51 systems.rayleigh-watson and beran tests deliver a false-alarm probability of 0.5% forthe 20 systems closer than 8.1 pc. to evaluate the robustness of thisconclusion, we used a jackknife approach, for which we repeated this procedureafter removing one system at a time from the full sample. the false-alarmprobability was then found to vary between 1.5% and 0.1%, depending on whichsystem is removed. the reality of the deviation from isotropy can thus not beassessed with certainty at this stage, because only so few systems areavailable, despite our efforts to increase the sample. however, whenconsidering the full sample of 51 systems, the concentration of poles towardthe galactic position l = 46.0{\deg}, b = 37{\deg}, as observed in the 8.1 pcsphere, totally vanishes (the rayleigh-watson false-alarm probability thenrises to 18%).

1505.04264	iras 19135+3937: an srd variable as interacting binary surrounded by a  circumbinary disc	semi-regular (sr) variables are not a homogeneous class and their variabilityis often explained due to pulsations and/or binarity. this study focuses oniras 19135+3937, an srd variable with an infra-red excess indicative of a dustydisc. a time-series of high-resolution spectra, ubv photometry as well as avery accurate light curve obtained by the kepler satellite, allowed us to studythe object in unprecedented detail. we discovered it to be a binary with aperiod of 127 days. the primary has a low surface gravity and an atmospheredepleted in refractory elements. this combination of properties unambiguouslyplaces iras 19135+3937 in the subclass of post-asymptotic giant branch starswith dusty discs.  we show that the light variations in this object can not be due topulsations, but are likely caused by the obscuration of the primary by thecircumbinary disc during orbital motion. furthermore, we argue that thedouble-peaked fe emission lines provide evidence for the existence of a gaseouscircumbinary keplerian disc inside the dusty disc. a secondary set ofabsorption lines has been detected near light minimum, which we attribute tothe reflected spectrum of the primary on the disc wall, which segregates due tothe different doppler shift. this corroborates the recent finding thatreflection in the optical by this type of discs is very efficient. the systemalso shows a variable halpha profile indicating a collimated outfloworiginating around the companion. iras 19135+3937 thus encompasses all themajor emergent trends about evolved disc systems, that will eventually help toplace these objects in the evolutionary context.

1510.05840	binary properties of ch and carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars	the hermes spectrograph installed on the 1.2-m mercator telescope has beenused to monitor the radial velocity of 13 low-metallicity carbon stars, amongwhich 7 carbon-enhanced metal-poor (cemp) stars and 6 ch stars. all stars butone show clear evidence for binarity. new orbits are obtained for 8 systems.the sample covers an extended range in orbital periods, extending from 3.4 d(for the dwarf carbon star he 0024-2523) to about 54 yr (for the ch star hd 26,the longest known among barium, ch and extrinsic s stars). three systemsexhibit low-amplitude velocity variations with periods close to 1 yrsuperimposed on a long-term trend. in the absence of an accurate photometricmonitoring of these systems, it is not clear yet whether these variations arethe signature of a very low-mass companion, or of regular envelope pulsations.the period - eccentricity (p - e) diagram for the 40 low-metallicity carbonstars with orbits now available shows no difference between ch and cemp-s stars(the latter corresponding to those cemp stars enriched in s-process elements,as are ch stars). we suggest that they must be considered as one and the samefamily and that their different names only stem from historical reasons.indeed, these two families have as well very similar mass-functiondistributions, corresponding to companions with masses in the range 0.5 - 0.7msun, indicative of white-dwarf companions, adopting 0.8 - 0.9 msun for theprimary component. this result confirms that ch and cemp-s stars obey the samemass-transfer scenario as their higher-metallicity analogs, the barium stars.the p - e diagrams of barium, ch and cemp-s stars are indeed very similar. theyreveal two different groups of systems: one with short orbital periods (p &lt;1000 d) and mostly circular or almost circular orbits, and another withlonger-period and eccentric (e &gt; 0.1) orbits.

1510.05908	to ba or not to ba: enrichment in s-process elements in binary systems  with wd companions of various masses	the enrichment in s-process elements of barium stars is known to be due topollution by mass transfer from a companion formerly on the thermally-pulsingasymptotic giant branch (agb), now a carbon-oxygen white-dwarf (wd). this paperinvestigates the relationship between the s-process enrichment in the bariumstar and the mass of its wd companion. it is expected that helium wds, whichhave masses smaller than about 0.5 msun and never reached the agb phase, shouldnot pollute with s-process elements their giant companion, which should thusnever turn into a barium star. spectra with a resolution of r ~ 86000 wereobtained with the hermes spectrograph on the 1.2-m mercator telescope for asample of 11 binary systems involving wd companions of various masses. we usestandard 1d lte marcs model atmospheres coupled with the turbospectrumradiative-transfer code to derive the atmospheric parameters using equivalentwidths of fei and fe ii lines. the abundances of s-process elements for theentire sample of 11 binary stars were derived homogeneously. the sampleencompasses all levels of overabundances: from solar [s/fe]=0 to 1.5 dex in the2 binary systems with s-star primaries (for which dedicated marcs modelatmospheres were used). the primary components of binary systems with a wd moremassive than 0.5 msun are enriched in s-process elements. we also found a trendof increasing [s/fe] with [c/fe] or [(c+n)/fe]. our results conform to theexpectation that binary systems with wd companions less massive than 0.5 msundo not host barium stars.

1510.06045	he 0017+0055 : a probable pulsating cemp-rs star and long-period binary	a radial-velocity monitoring of the carbon-enhanced metal-poor (cemp) star he0017+0055 over 8 years with the nordic optical telescope and mercatortelescopes reveals variability with a period of 384 d and amplitude of540$\pm27$ m s$^{-1}$, superimposed on a nearly linear long-term decline of$\sim$1 m s$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$. high-resolution hermes/mercator and keck/hiresspectra have been used to derive elemental abundances using 1-d lte marcsmodels. a metallicity of [fe/h] $\sim -2.4$ is found, along with s-processoverabundances on the order of 2 dex (with the exception of [y/fe] $\sim+0.5$),and most notably overabundances of r-process elements like sm, eu, dy, and erin the range 0.9 - 2.0 dex. with [ba/fe] $ &gt; 1.9$ dex and [eu/fe] = 2.3 dex, he0017+0055 is a cemp-rs star. it appears to be a giant star below the tip of thered giant branch (rgb). the s-process pollution must therefore originate frommass transfer from a companion formerly on the agb, now a carbon-oxygen whitedwarf (wd). if the 384 d velocity variations are attributed to the wdcompanion, its orbit must be seen almost face-on, with $i \sim 2.3^\circ$,because the mass function is very small: $f(m_1,m_2) =(6.1\pm1.1)\times10^{-6}$ msun. alternatively, the wd orbital motion could beresponsible for the long-term velocity variations, with a period of severaldecades. the 384 d variations should then be attributed either to a low-massinner companion (perhaps a brown dwarf, depending on the orbital inclination),or to stellar pulsations. the latter possibility is made likely by the factthat similar low-amplitude velocity variations, with periods close to 1 yr,have been reported for other cemp stars in a companion paper (jorissen et al.,2015). a definite conclusion about the origin of the 384 d velocity variationsshould however await the detection of synchronous low-amplitude photometricvariations.

astro-ph;0010132	envelope tomography of long-period variable stars: i. the schwarzschild  mechanism and the balmer emission lines	this paper is the first one in a series devoted to the study of the dynamicsof the atmospheres of long-period variable stars. results from a two-month-longmonitoring of the mira variables rt cyg and x oph around maximum light with theelodie spectrograph at the haute-provence observatory are presented. themonitoring covers phases 0.80 to 1.16 for rt cyg and phases 0.83 to 1.04 for xoph. the cross-correlation profile of the spectrum of rt cyg with a k0 iii maskconfirms that the absorption lines of rt cyg in the optical domain appeardouble around maximum light. no line doubling was found in the optical spectrumof x oph around maximum light, indicating that this feature is not common toall long-period variables. this paper also presents the application to rt cygof a new tomographic technique deriving the velocity field across theatmosphere by cross-correlating the optical spectrum with numerical masksconstructed from synthetic spectra and probing layers of increasing depths.this technique reveals that both the temporal evolution of the line doubling,and its variation with depth in the atmosphere of rt cyg, are consistent withthe ``schwarzschild scenario''. this scenario relates the temporal evolution ofthe red and blue peaks of the double absorption lines to the progression of ashock wave in the atmosphere. the temporal evolution of the balmer halpha, hbeta, hgamma and hdelta emission lines around maximum light is also presentedfor rt cyg and x oph. the velocity variations of halpha and of the absorptionlines are discussed in the framework of two competing models for the formationof balmer emission lines in long-period variable stars.

astro-ph;0103141	reprocessing the hipparcos data for evolved giant stars ii. absolute  magnitudes for the r-type carbon stars	the hipparcos intermediate astrometric data for carbon stars have beenreprocessed using an algorithm which provides an objective criterion forrejecting anomalous data points and constrains the parallax to be positive. newparallax solutions have been derived for 317 cool carbon stars, mostly of typesr and n. in this paper we discuss the results for the r stars. the mostimportant result is that the early r stars (i.e., r0 - r3) have absolutemagnitudes and v-k colors locating them among red clump giants in thehertzsprung-russell diagram. stars with subtypes r4 - r9 tend to be cooler andhave similar luminosity to the n-type carbon stars, as confirmed by theirposition in the (j-h, h-k) color-color diagram. the sample of early r-typestars selected from the hipparcos catalogue appears to be approximatelycomplete to magnitude k_0 ~ 7, translating into a completeness distance of 600pc if all r stars had m_k= -2 (400 pc if m_k= -1). with about 30 early r-typestars in that volume, they comprise about 0.04% (0.14% for m_k= -1) of the redclump stars in the solar neighborhood. identification with the red clumplocates these stars at the helium core burning stage of stellar evolution,while the n stars are on the asymptotic giant branch, where helium shellburning occurs. the present analysis suggests that for a small fraction of thehelium core burning stars (far lower than the fraction of helium shell-burningstars), carbon produced in the interior is mixed to the atmosphere insufficient quantities to form a carbon star.

astro-ph;0105301	the distribution of exoplanet masses	the present study derives the distribution of secondary masses m2 for the 67exoplanets and very low-mass brown dwarf companions of solar-type stars, knownas of april 4, 2001. this distribution is related to the distribution of m2 sini through an integral equation of abel's type. although a formal solutionexists for this equation, it is known to be ill-behaved, and thus verysensitive to the statistical noise present in the input m2 sin i distribution.to overcome that difficulty, we present two robust, independent approaches: (i)the formal solution of the integral equation is numerically computed afterperforming an optimal smoothing of the input distribution, (ii) thelucy-richardson algorithm is used to invert the integral equation. bothapproaches give consistent results. the resulting statistical distribution ofexoplanet true masses reveals that there is no reason to ascribe the transitionbetween giant planets and brown dwarfs to the threshold mass for deuteriumignition (about 13 mj). the m2 distribution shows instead that all the objectshave m2 &lt; 10 mj, except the heavier candidates which cluster around 15 mj.

astro-ph;0209492	the henize sample of s stars: iv. new symbiotic stars	the properties of the few symbiotic stars detected among the 66 binary sstars from the henize sample are discussed. two stars (hen 18 and hen 121)exhibit both a strong blue-violet continuum and strong h_alpha emission (fwhmof 70 km/s), whereas hen 134 and 137 exhibit weak h_alpha emission. the h_alphaprofiles are typical of non-dusty symbiotic stars belonging to class s-3 asdefined by van winckel et al. (1993, a&amp;as 102, 401). in that class as in thehenize symbiotic s stars, he i, [n ii] or [s ii] emission lines are absent,suggesting that the nebular density is high but the excitation rather low. theradial velocity of the centre of the h_alpha emission is identical to that ofthe companion star (at least for hen 121 where this can be checked from theavailable orbital elements), thus suggesting that the h_alpha emissionoriginates from gas moving with the companion star. for hen 121, this isfurther confirmed by the disappearance of the ultraviolet balmer continuum whenthe companion is eclipsed by the s star. hen 121 is thus the second eclipsingbinary star discovered among extrinsic s stars (the first one is hd 35155). acomparison of the available data on orbital periods and h_alpha emission leadsto the conclusion that h_alpha emission in s stars seems to be restricted tobinary systems with periods in the range 600 - 1000 d, in agreement with thesituation prevailing for red symbiotic stars (excluding symbiotic novae).symbiotic s stars are found among the most evolved extrinsic s stars.

astro-ph;0212201	how many hipparcos variability-induced movers are genuine binaries?	hipparcos observations of some variable stars, and especially of long-period(e.g. mira) variables, reveal a motion of the photocenter correlated with thebrightness variation ({variability-induced mover -- vim), suggesting thepresence of a binary companion. a re-analysis of the hipparcos photometric andastrometric data does not confirm the vim solution for 62 among the 288 vimobjects (21%) in the hipparcos catalogue. most of these 288 vims arelong-period (e.g. mira) variables (lpv). the effect of a revised chromaticitycorrection, which accounts for the color variations along the light cycle, wasthen investigated. it is based on `instantaneous' $v-i$ color indices derivedfrom hipparcos and tycho-2 epoch photometry. among the 188 lpvs flagged as vimin the hipparcos catalogue, 89 (47%) are not confirmed as vim after thisimproved chromaticity correction is applied. this dramatic decrease in thenumber of vim solutions is not surprising, since the chromaticity correctionapplied by the hipparcos reduction consortia was based on a fixed $v-i$ color.astrophysical considerations lead us to adopt a more stringent criterion foraccepting a vim solution (first-kind risk of 0.27% instead of 10% as in thehipparcos catalogue). with this more severe criterion, only 27 lpv stars remainvim, thus rejecting 161 of the 188 (86%) of the lpvs defined as vims in thehipparcos catalogue.

(1989). the maximumabsolute k magnitude of the sample is about -8.2 for both miras andsemi-regular stars, only a little fainter than the expected agb limit. we showthat the stars with the longest periods (p&gt;400d) have high mass loss rates andare almost all mira variables.

astro-ph;0409579	local kinematics of k and m giants from coravel/hipparcos/tycho-2 data.  revisiting the concept of superclusters	the availability of the hipparcos catalogue triggered many kinematic anddynamical studies of the solar neighbourhood. nevertheless, those studiesgenerally lacked the third component of the space velocities, i.e., the radialvelocities. this work presents the kinematic analysis of 5952 k and 739 mgiants in the solar neighbourhood which includes for the first time radialvelocity data from a large survey performed with the coravelspectrovelocimeter. it also uses proper motions from the tycho-2 catalogue,which are expected to be more accurate than the hipparcos ones. the uv-planeconstructed from these data for the stars with precise parallaxes reveals arich small-scale structure, with several clumps corresponding to the herculesstream, the sirius moving group, and the hyades and pleiades superclusters. amaximum-likelihood method, based on a bayesian approach, has been applied tothe data, in order to make full use of all the available stars and to derivethe kinematic properties of these subgroups. isochrones in thehertzsprung-russell diagram reveal a very wide range of ages for starsbelonging to these groups. these groups are most probably related to thedynamical perturbation by transient spiral waves rather than to clusterremnants. a possible explanation for the presence of young clusters in the samearea of the uv-plane is that they have been put there by the spiral waveassociated with their formation, while the kinematics of the older stars of oursample has also been disturbed by the same wave. the term "dynamical stream"for the kinematic groups is thus more appropriate than the traditional term"supercluster" since it involves stars of different ages, not born at the sameplace nor at the same time.

astro-ph;0411540	dynamical streams in the solar neighbourhood	the true nature of the hyades and sirius superclusters is still an openquestion. in this contribution, we confront eggen's hypothesis that they arecluster remnants with the results of a kinematic analysis of more than 6000 kand m giants in the solar neighbourhood. this analysis includes new radialvelocity data from a large survey performed with the coravel spectrometer,complemented by hipparcos parallaxes and tycho-2 proper motions (famaey et al.2004). a maximum-likelihood method, based on a bayesian approach, has beenapplied to the data, in order to make full use of all the available data(including less precise parallaxes) and to derive the properties of thedifferent kinematic subgroups. two such subgroups can be identified with thehyades and sirius superclusters. stars belonging to them span a very wide rangeof age, which is difficult to account for in eggen's scenario. these groups arethus most probably "dynamical streams" related to the dynamical perturbation byspiral waves rather than to cluster remnants.  in this scenario, the hyades and ursa major clusters just happen to be in thehyades and sirius streams, which are purely dynamical features that havenothing to do with the remnants of more massive primordial clusters. thismechanism could be the key to understanding the presence of an old metal-richpopulation, and of many exoplanetary systems in our neighbourhood. moreover, astrong spiral pattern seems to be needed in order to yield such prominentstreams. since spiral structure is usually baryonic, this would leave verylittle room for dark matter. this may be an indication that the era of thedark-matter paradigm explaining the dynamics of the galaxy may come to an end,and is being superseded by modified gravity.

astro-ph;0506584	bruslib and netgen: the brussels nuclear reaction rate library and  nuclear network generator for astrophysics	nuclear reaction rates are quantities of fundamental importance inastrophysics. substantial efforts have been devoted in the last decades tomeasure or calculate them. the present paper presents for the first time adetailed description of the brussels nuclear reaction rate library bruslib andof the nuclear network generator netgen so as to make these nuclear datapackages easily accessible to astrophysicists for a large variety ofapplications. bruslib is made of two parts. the first one contains the 1999nacre compilation based on experimental data for 86 reactions with (mainly)stable targets up to si. the second part of bruslib concerns nuclear reactionrate predictions calculated within a statistical hauser-feshbach approximation,which limits the reliability of the rates to reactions producing compoundnuclei with a high enough level density. these calculations make use of globaland coherent microscopic nuclear models for the quantities entering the ratecalculations. the use of such models is utterly important, and makes thebruslib rate library unique.  a description of the nuclear network generator netgen that complements thebruslib package is also presented. netgen is a tool to generate nuclearreaction rates for temperature grids specified by the user. the information itprovides can be used for a large variety of applications, including big bangnucleosynthesis, the energy generation and nucleosynthesis associated with thenon-explosive and explosive hydrogen to silicon burning stages, or thesynthesis of the heavy nuclides through the s-, alpha- and r-, rp- orp-processes.

astro-ph;0506592	on metal-deficient barium stars and their link with yellow symbiotic  stars	this paper addresses the question of why metal-deficient barium stars are notyellow symbiotic stars (ysys). samples of (suspected) metal-deficient barium(mdba) stars and ysys have been collected from the literature, and theirproperties reviewed. it appears in particular that the barium nature of thesuspected mdba stars needs to be ascertained by detailed abundance analyses.abundances are therefore derived for two of them, hd 139409 and hd 148897,which reveal that hd 148897 should not be considered a barium star. hd 139409is a mild barium star, with overabundances observed only for elements belongingto the first s-process peak (y and zr). the evidence for binarity among mdbastars is then reviewed, using three different methods: (i) radial-velocityvariations (from coravel observations), (ii) hipparcos astrometric data, and(iii) a method based on the comparison between the hipparcos and tycho-2 propermotions. a first-time orbit is obtained for hip 55852, whereas evidence for the(so far unknown) binary nature of hip 34795, hip 76605, hip 97874 and hip107478 is presented. two stars with no evidence for binarity whatsoever (hip58596 and bd +3 2688) are candidates low-metallicity thermally-pulsingasymptotic giant branch stars, as inferred from their large luminosities. thereason why mdba stars are not ysys is suggested to lie in their differentorbital period distributions: mdba stars have on average longer orbital periodsthan ysys, and hence their companion accretes matter at a lower rate, for agiven mass loss rate of the giant star. the definite validation of thisexplanation should nevertheless await the determination of the orbital periodsfor the many mdba stars still lacking periods, in order to make the comparisonmore significant.

astro-ph;0507695	astrometric orbits of sb9 stars	hipparcos intermediate astrometric data (iad) have been used to deriveastrometric orbital elements for spectroscopic binaries from the newly releasedninth catalogue of spectroscopic binary orbits (sb9). among the 1374 binariesfrom sb9 which have an hip entry, 282 have detectable orbital astrometricmotion (at the 5% significance level). among those, only 70 have astrometricorbital elements that are reliably determined (according to specificstatistical tests discussed in the paper), and for the first time for 20systems, representing a 10% increase relative to the 235 dmsa/o systems alreadypresent in the hipparcos double and multiple systems annex.  the detection of the astrometric orbital motion when the hipparcos iad aresupplemented by the spectroscopic orbital elements is close to 100% forbinaries with only one visible component, provided that the period is in the 50- 1000 d range and the parallax is larger than 5 mas. this result is aninteresting testbed to guide the choice of algorithms and statistical tests tobe used in the search for astrometric binaries during the forthcoming esa gaiamission.  finally, orbital inclinations provided by the present analysis have been usedto derive several astrophysical quantities. for instance, 29 among the 70systems with reliable astrometric orbital elements involve main sequence starsfor which the companion mass could be derived. some interesting conclusions maybe drawn from this new set of stellar masses, like the enigmatic nature of thecompanion to the hyades f dwarf hip 20935. this system has a mass ratio of 0.98but the companion remains elusive.

astro-ph;0605658	cs 30322-023: an ultra metal-poor tp-agb star?	with [fe/h] = -3.5, cs 30322-023 is the most metal-poor star to exhibit aclear s-process signature and the most metal-poor ``lead star'' known. cs30322-023 is also remarkable in having the lowest surface gravity (log g &lt;=-0.3) among the metal-poor stars studied to date. the available evidenceindicates that this star is presently a thermally-pulsing asymptotic giantbranch (tp-agb) star, with no strong indication of binarity thus far (althougha signal of period 192 d is clearly present in the radial-velocity data, thisis likely due to pulsation of the stellar envelope). we show that low-masstp-agb stars are not expected to be exceedingly rare in a magnitude-limitedsample such as the hk survey, because their high luminosities make it possibleto sample them over a very large volume. the strong n overabundance and the low12c/13c ratio (4) in this star is typical of the operation of the cn cycle.coupled with a na overabundance and the absence of a strong c overabundance,this pattern seems to imply that hot-bottom burning operated in this star,which should then have a mass of at least 2 msun. however, the luminosityassociated with this mass would put the star at a distance of about 50 kpc, inthe outskirts of the galactic halo. we explore alternative scenarios in whichthe observed abundance pattern results from some mixing mechanism yet to beidentified occurring in a single low-metallicity 0.8 msun agb star, or frompollution by matter from an intermediate-mass agb companion which has undergonehot-bottom burning. we stress, however, that our abundances may be subject touncertainties due to nlte or 3d granulation effects which were not taken intoconsideration.

astro-ph;0609785	the hyades stream: evaporated cluster or intrusion from the inner disk?	the nature of the hyades stream, or hyades moving group, is a long-standingquestion of galactic astronomy. is this stream caused by non-axisymmetricperturbations of the galactic potential, such as transient or quasi-stationaryspiral waves, or by the on-going evaporation of the hyades cluster? a simpleobservational test has been designed to answer that question. using thegeneva-copenhagen survey of f and g dwarfs, we compare the mass distributionand metallicity of the stream to those of field disk stars. if the hyadesstream is composed of stars trapped at resonance, its mass distribution shouldobey the present-day mass function (pdmf) of the disk, and its metallicityshould reflect its origin in the inner regions of the galaxy. on the otherhand, if it is an evaporated cluster, we expect a different mass distribution,depending on the inital mass function (imf) of the cluster, and on theproportion of evaporated stars as a function of mass. we find that extremeconditions have to be adopted for the selective evaporation and imf of thecluster to make the observed mass ditribution of the stream only roughlyconsistent (at a one-sigma level) with the coeval evaporated cluster scenario.the observed mass distribution is in much better agreement with the pdmf of thefield. we also note that the peculiar metallicity of the stream is inconsistentwith that of a field population from the solar neighbourhood trapped in theprimordial cluster during its formation process and subsequently evaporated.these observations thus favour a resonant origin for the hyades stream.

astro-ph;0612449	proper-motion binaries in the hipparcos catalogue. comparison with  radial velocity data	the comparison of the proper motions constructed from positions spanning ashort (hipparcos) or long time (tycho-2) makes it possible to uncover binarieswith periods of the order of or somewhat larger than the short time span, sincethe unrecognised orbital motion will then add to the proper motion. a list ofcandidate proper motion binaries is constructed from a chi^2 test evaluatingthe statistical significance of the difference between the tycho-2 andhipparcos proper motions for 103134 stars in common between the two catalogues(excluding components of visual systems). the paper focuses on the evaluationof the detection efficiency of proper-motion binaries, using different kinds ofcontrol data (mostly radial velocities). the detection rate for entries fromthe ninth catalogue of spectroscopic binary orbits (sb9) is evaluated, as wellas for stars like barium stars, which are known to be all binaries. propermotion binaries are efficiently detected for systems with parallaxes in excessof ca. 20 mas, and periods in the range 1000 - 30000 d. the shortest periods inthis range (1000 - 2000 d) may appear only as dmsa/g binaries (acceleratedproper motion in the hipparcos double and multiple system annex). proper motionbinaries detected among sb9 systems having periods shorter than about 400 dhint at triple systems. a list of 19 candidate triple systems is provided.binaries suspected of having low-mass (brown-dwarf-like) companions are listedas well. among the 37 barium stars with parallaxes larger than 5 mas, only 7exhibit no evidence for duplicity whatsoever (be it spectroscopic orastrometric). finally, the fraction of proper-motion binaries shows nosignificant variation among the various (regular) spectral classes, when dueaccount is taken for the detection biases.

astro-ph;9602138	fluorine production in intermediate-mass stars	the 19f production during the first dozen thermal pulses of agb stars with(m=3,z=0.02), (m=6,z=0.02) and (m=3,z=0.001) is investigated on grounds ofdetailed stellar models and of revised rates for 15n(a,g)19f and 18o(a,g)22ne.these calculations confirm an early expectation that 19f {\it is} produced inagb thermal pulses. they also enlarge substantially these previous results byshowing that the variations of the level of 19f production during the evolutionis very sensitive to the maximum temperature reached at the base of the pulse.these variations are analyzed in detail, and are shown to result from a subtlebalance between different nuclear effects (mainly 19f production or destructionin a pulse, and 15n synthesis during the interpulse), possibly super-imposed ondilution effects in more or less extended pulse convective tongues. ourcalculations, as most others, do not predict the third dredge-up self-consistently. when parametrized, it appears that our models ofintermediate-mass agb stars are able to account only for the lowest 19foverabundances observed in solar-metallicity ms, s and c stars. that conclusionis expected to hold true for low-mass stars when f production results fromsecondary 13c only. massive agb stars, on the other hand, are not expected tobuild up large surface f abundanc- es. therefore, the large f overabundancereported for the super li-rich star wz cas (where hbb is supposed to beoperating) remains unexplained so far. our results for the (m=3,z=0.001) starindicate that f surface overabundances can also be expected in low-metallicitystars provided that third dredge-ups occur after the early cool pulses. therelative increase in the surface 19f/12c ratio is, however, lower in thelow-metallicity than in the solar-metallicity star. no observations are

astro-ph;9708006	the hipparcos hertzsprung-russell diagram of s stars: probing  nucleosynthesis and dredge-up	hipparcos trigonometrical parallaxes make it possible to compare the locationof tc-rich and tc-poor s stars in the hertzsprung-russell (hr) diagram: tc-richs stars are found to be cooler and intrinsically brighter than tc-poor s stars.the comparison with the geneva evolutionary tracks reveals that the linemarking the onset of thermal pulses on the asymptotic giant branch (agb)matches well the observed limit between tc-poor and tc-rich s stars. tc-rich sstars are, as expected, identified with thermally-pulsing agb stars of low andintermediate masses, whereas tc-poor s stars comprise mostly low-mass stars(with the exception of 57 peg) located either on the red giant branch or on theearly agb. like barium stars, tc-poor s stars are known to belong exclusivelyto binary systems, and their location in the hr diagram is consistent with theaverage mass of 1.6 +- 0.2 msun derived from their orbital mass-functiondistribution. a comparison with the s stars identified in the magellanic cloudsand in the fornax dwarf elliptical galaxy reveals that they have luminositiessimilar to the galactic tc-rich s stars. however, most of the surveys of sstars in the external systems did not reach the lower luminosities at whichgalactic tc-poor s stars are found. the deep westerlund survey of carbon starsin the smc uncovered a family of faint carbon stars that may be the analoguesof the low-luminosity, galactic tc-poor s stars.

astro-ph;9710155	circumstellar shells and mass loss rates: clues to the evolution of s  stars	it is the purpose of this paper to rediscuss the circumstellar properties ofs stars and to put these properties in perspective with our currentunderstanding of the evolutionary status of s stars, in particular theintrinsic/extrinsic dichotomy. accordingly, an extensive data set probing thecircumstellar environment of s stars (iras flux densities, maser emission, corotational lines) has been collected and critically evaluated. this data setcombines new observations (9 stars have been observed in the co j=2-1 line and3 in the co j=3-2 line, with four new detections) with existing material (allco and maser observations of s stars published in the literature). the irasflux densities of s stars have been re-evaluated by co-adding the individualscans, in order to better handle the intrinsic variability of these stars inthe iras bands, and possible contamination by galactic cirrus.  mass loss rates or upper limits have been derived for all s stars observed inthe co rotational lines, and range from &lt; 2 10^{-8} msun y^{-1} for extrinsic sstars to 10^{-5} msun y^{-1}. these mass-loss rates correlate well with the k -[12] color index, which probes the dust loss rate, provided that the mass lossrate be larger than 10^{-8} msun~y^{-1}. small mass-loss rates are found forextrinsic s stars, consistent with their not being so evolved (rgb orearly-agb) as the tc-rich s stars. this result does not support the claim oftenmade in relation with symbiotic stars that binarity strongly enhances themass-loss rate.

astro-ph;9801272	insights into the formation of barium and tc-poor s stars from an  extended sample of orbital elements	the set of orbital elements available for chemically-peculiar red giant (prg)stars has been considerably enlarged thanks to a decade-long coravelradial-velocity monitoring of about 70 barium stars and 50 s stars. this paperpresents a detailed analysis of the complete set of orbital parametersavailable for prg stars; the individual data are given in three companionpapers. the main results are as follows: (i) the similarity between the orbitalparameters of tc-poor s stars and barium stars confirms that tc-poor s starsare the cooler analogs of barium stars; (ii) the eccentricity -- period diagramof prg stars clearly bears the signature of dissipative processes associatedwith mass transfer; (iii) the mass function distribution is compatible with theunseen companion being a white dwarf (wd); (iv) assuming that the wd companionhas a mass in the range 0.60+-0.04 msun, the masses of mild and strong bariumstars amount to 1.9+-0.2 and 1.5+-0.2 msun, respectively; (v) mild barium starsare not restricted to long-period systems; the difference between mild andstrong barium stars is mainly one of galactic population rather than of orbitalseparation, in agreement with their respective kinematical properties; (vi)binarity is probably not a sufficient condition to produce a prg star, and ametallicity lower than solar seems to be required as well.

astro-ph;9911174	is amino-acid homochirality due to asymmetric photolysis in space?	amino acids occurring in proteins are, with rare exceptions, exclusively ofthe l-configuration. among the many scenarios put forward to explain the originof this chiral homogeneity (i.e., homochirality), one involves the asymmetricphotolysis of amino acids present in space, triggered by circularly polarizeduv radiation. the recent observation of circularly polarized light (cpl) in theorion omc-1 star-forming region (bailey et al. 1998, science 281, 672) has beenpresented as providing a strong validation of this scenario. the present paperreviews the situation. it is stressed for example that one important conditionfor the asymmetric photolysis by cpl to be at the origin of the terrestrialhomochirality of natural amino acids is generally overlooked, namely, theasymmetric photolysis should favour the l-enantiomer for all the primordialamino acids involved in the genesis of life (i.e., biogenic amino acids).although this condition is probably satisfied for aliphatic amino acids, somenon-aliphatic amino acids like tryptophan and proline may violate the conditionand thus invalidate the asymmetric photolysis scenario, assuming they wereamong the primordial amino acids. alternatively, if cpl photolysis in space isindeed the source of homochirality of amino acids, then tryptophan and prolinemay be crossed out from the list of biogenic amino acids.
