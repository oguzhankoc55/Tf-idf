0906.5253	the june 2008 flare of markarian 421 from optical to tev energies	we present optical to very-high energy (vhe) gamma-ray observations of mrk421 between 2008 may 24 and june 23. a high-energy (he) gamma-ray signal wasdetected by agile-grid during june 9-15, brighter than the average fluxobserved by egret in mrk 421 by a factor of approx. 1.5. in 20-60 kev x-rays, alarge-amplitude 5-day flare (june 9-15) was resolved with a maximum flux ofapprox. 55 mcrab. superagile, rxte/asm and swift/bat data show a clearlycorrelated flaring structure between soft and hard x-rays, with a highflux/amplitude variability in hard x-rays. hints of the same flaring behavioris also detected in the simultaneously recorded gasp-webt optical data. atarget of opportunity observation by swift near the flare maximum on june 12-13revealed the highest 2-10 kev flux ever observed (&gt;100 mcrab) and a peaksynchrotron energy of approx. 3 kev, a large shift from typical values of 0.5-1kev. observations at vhe (e&gt;200 gev) gamma-rays during june 6-8 show the sourceflux peaking in a bright state, well correlated with the simultaneous peak inthe x-rays. the gamma-ray flare can be interpreted within the framework of thesynchrotron self compton model in terms of a rapid acceleration of leptons inthe jet.

0909.3267	magic gamma-ray telescope observation of the perseus cluster of  galaxies: implications for cosmic rays, dark matter, and ngc1275	the perseus galaxy cluster was observed by the magic cherenkov telescope fora total effective time of 24.4 hr during 2008 november and december. theresulting upper limits on the gamma-ray emission above 100 gev are in the rangeof 4.6 to 7.5 x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1} for spectral indices from -1.5 to -2.5,thereby constraining the emission produced by cosmic rays, dark matterannihilations, and the central radio galaxy ngc1275. results are compatiblewith cosmological cluster simulations for the cosmic-ray-induced gamma-rayemission, constraining the average cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure to &lt;4% forthe cluster core region (&lt;8% for the entire cluster). using simplifiedassumptions adopted in earlier work (a power-law spectrum with an index of-2.1, constant cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure for the peripheral clusterregions while accounting for the adiabatic contraction during the cooling flowformation), we would limit the ratio of cosmic ray-to-thermal energy toe_cr/e_th&lt;3%. the upper limit also translates into a level of gamma-rayemission from possible annihilations of the cluster dark matter (the dominantmass component) that is consistent with boost factors of ~10^4 for thetypically expected dark matter annihilation-induced emission. finally, theupper limits obtained for the gamma-ray emission of the central radio galaxyngc1275 are consistent with the recent detection by the fermi-lat satellite.due to the extremely large doppler factors required for the jet, a one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model is implausible in this case. we reproduce theobserved spectral energy density by using the structured jet (spine-layer)model which has previously been adopted to explain the high-energy emission ofradio galaxies.

0910.4381	correlated x-ray and very high energy emission in the gamma-ray binary  ls i +61 303	the discovery of very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray emitting x-ray binaries hastriggered an intense effort to better understand the particle acceleration,absorption, and emission mechanisms in compact binary systems, which providevariable conditions along eccentric orbits. despite this, the nature of some ofthese systems, and of the accelerated particles producing the vhe emission, isunclear. to answer some of these open questions, we conducted a multiwavelengthcampaign of the vhe gamma-ray emitting x-ray binary ls i +61 303 including themagic telescope, xmm-newton, and swift during 60% of an orbit in 2007september. we detect a simultaneous outburst at x-ray and vhe bands, with thepeak at phase 0.62 and a similar shape at both wavelengths. a linear fit to thesimultaneous x-ray/vhe pairs obtained during the outburst yields a correlationcoefficient of r=0.97, while a linear fit to all simultaneous pairs providesr=0.81. since a variable absorption of the vhe emission towards the observer isnot expected for the data reported here, the correlation found indicates asimultaneity in the emission processes. assuming that they are dominated by asingle particle population, either hadronic or leptonic, the x-ray/vhe fluxratio favors leptonic models. this fact, together with the detected photonindices, suggests that in ls i +61 303 the x-rays are the result of synchrotronradiation of the same electrons that produce vhe emission as a result ofinverse compton scattering of stellar photons.

1004.1093	search for an extended vhe gamma-ray emission from mrk 421 and mrk 501  with the magic telescope	context: part of the very high energy $\gamma$-ray radiation coming fromextragalactic sources is absorbed through the pair production process on theextragalactic background light photons. extragalactic magnetic fields alter thetrajectories of these cascade pairs and, in turn, convert cosmic backgroundphotons to gamma-ray energies by inverse compton scattering. these secondaryphotons can form an extended halo around bright vhe sources.  aims: we searched for an extended emission around the bright blazars mrk 421and mrk 501 using the magic telescope data.  methods: if extended emission is present, the angular distribution ofreconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions around the source is broader thanfor a point-like source. in the analysis of a few tens of hours ofobservational data taken from mrk 421 and mrk 501 we used a newly developedmethod that provides better angular resolution. this method is based on theusage of multidimensional decision trees. comparing the measured shapes ofangular distributions with those expected from a point-like source one candetect or constrain possible extended emission around the source. we alsostudied the influence of different types of systematic errors on the shape ofthe distribution of reconstructed gamma-ray arrival directions for a pointsource.  results: we present upper limits for an extended emission calculated for bothsources for various source extensions and emission profiles. we discusspossible constraints on the extragalactic magnetic fields strength. we obtainupper limits on the extended emission around the mrk~421 (mrk~501) on the levelof &lt; 5% (&lt; 4%) of the crab nebula flux above the energy threshold of 300 gev.using these results we discuss possible constraints on the extragalacticmagnetic fields strength around a few times $10^{-15}$~g.

1004.3665	magic observation of the grb080430 afterglow	context: gamma-ray bursts are cosmological sources emitting radiation fromthe gamma-rays to the radio band. substantial observational efforts have beendevoted to the study of gamma-ray bursts during the prompt phase, i.e. theinitial burst of high-energy radiation, and during the long-lasting afterglows.in spite of many successes in interpreting these phenomena, there are stillseveral open key questions about the fundamental emission processes, theirenergetics and the environment. aim: independently of specific gamma-ray bursttheoretical recipes, spectra in the gev/tev range are predicted to beremarkably simple, being satisfactorily modeled with power-laws, and thereforeoffer a very valuable tool to probe the extragalactic background lightdistribution. furthermore, the simple detection of a component at very-highenergies, i.e. at $\sim 100$\,gev, would solve the ambiguity about theimportance of various possible emission processes, which provide barelydistinguishable scenarios at lower energies. methods: we used the results ofthe magic telescope observation of the moderate resdhift ($z\sim0.76$)\object{grb\,080430} at energies above about 80\,gev, to evaluate theperspective for late-afterglow observations with ground based gev/tevtelescopes. results: we obtained an upper limit of $f_{\rm 95%\,cl} = 5.5\times 10^{-11}$\,erg\,cm$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$ for the very-high energy emission of\object{grb\,080430}, which cannot set further constraints on the theoreticalscenarios proposed for this object also due to the difficulties in modeling thelow-energy afterglow. nonetheless, our observations show that cherenkovtelescopes have already reached the required sensitivity to detect the gev/tevemission of grbs at moderate redshift ($z \lesssim 0.8$), provided theobservations are carried out at early times, close to the onset of theirafterglow phase.

1005.0740	magic constraints on gamma-ray emission from cygnus x-3	cygnus x-3 is a microquasar consisting of an accreting compact objectorbiting around a wolf-rayet star. it has been detected at radio frequenciesand up to high-energy gamma rays (above 100 mev). however, many models alsopredict a very high energy (vhe) emission (above hundreds of gev) when thesource displays relativistic persistent jets or transient ejections. therefore,detecting such emission would improve the understanding of the jet physics. theimaging atmospheric cherenkov telescope magic observed cygnus x-3 for about 70hours between 2006 march and 2009 august in different x-ray/radio spectralstates and also during a period of enhanced gamma-ray emission. magic found noevidence for a vhe signal from the direction of the microquasar. an upper limitto the integral flux for energies higher than 250 gev has been set to 2.2 x10-12 photons cm-2 s-1 (95% confidence level). this is the best limit so far tothe vhe emission from this source. the non-detection of a vhe signal during theperiod of activity in the high-energy band sheds light on the location of thepossible vhe radiation favoring the emission from the innermost region of thejets, where absorption is significant. the current and future generations ofcherenkov telescopes may detect a signal under precise spectral conditions.

1009.2155	detection of very high energy gamma-ray emission from the perseus  cluster head-tail galaxy ic 310 by the magic telescopes	we report on the detection with the magic telescopes of very high energygamma-rays from ic 310, a head-tail radio galaxy in the perseus galaxy cluster,observed during the interval november 2008 to february 2010. the fermisatellite has also detected this galaxy. the source is detected by magic at ahigh statistical significance of 7.6sigma in 20.6 hr of stereo data. theobserved spectral energy distribution is flat with a differential spectralindex of -2.00 \pm 0.14. the mean flux above 300 gev, between october 2009 andfebruary 2010, (3.1 \pm 0.5)x10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1}, corresponds to (2.5 \pm0.4)% of crab nebula units. only an upper limit, of 1.9% of crab nebula unitsabove 300 gev, was obtained with the 2008 data. this, together with stronghints (&gt;3sigma) of flares in the middle of october and november 2009, impliesthat the emission is variable. the magic results favour a scenario with thevery high energy emission originating from the inner jet close to the centralengine. more complicated models than a simple one-zone ssc scenario, e.g.multi-zone ssc, external compton or hadronic, may be required to explain thevery flat spectrum and its extension over more than three orders of magnitudein energy.

1012.2200	spectral energy distribution of markarian 501: quiescent state vs.  extreme outburst	the very high energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) blazar markarian 501 has awell-studied history of extreme spectral variability and is an excellentlaboratory for studying the physical processes within the jets of activegalactic nuclei. however, there are few detailed multiwavelength studies ofmarkarian 501 during its quiescent state, due to its low luminosity. ashort-term multiwavelength study of markarian 501 was coordinated in march2009, focusing around a multi-day observation with the suzaku x-ray satelliteand including {\gamma}-ray data from veritas, magic, and the fermi gamma-rayspace telescope with the goal of providing a well-sampled multiwavelengthbaseline measurement of markarian 501 in the quiescent state. the results ofthese quiescent-state observations are compared to the historically extremeoutburst of april 16, 1997, with the goal of examining variability of thespectral energy distribution between the two states. the derived broadbandspectral energy distribution shows the characteristic double-peaked profile. wefind that the x-ray peak shifts by over two orders of magnitude in photonenergy between the two flux states while the vhe peak varies little. thelimited shift in the vhe peak can be explained by the transition to theklein-nishina regime. synchrotron self-compton models are matched to the dataand the implied klein-nishina effects are explored.

1103.1216	background studies for acoustic neutrino detection at the south pole	the detection of acoustic signals from ultra-high energy neutrinointeractions is a promising method to measure the tiny flux of cosmogenicneutrinos expected on earth. the energy threshold for this process dependsstrongly on the absolute noise level in the target material. the south poleacoustic test setup (spats), deployed in the upper part of four boreholes ofthe icecube neutrino observatory, has monitored the noise in antarctic ice atthe geographic south pole for more than two years down to 500 m depth. thenoise is very stable and gaussian distributed. lacking an in-situ calibrationup to now, laboratory measurements have been used to estimate the absolutenoise level in the 10 to 50 khz frequency range to be smaller than 20 mpa.using a threshold trigger, sensors of the south pole acoustic test setupregistered acoustic pulse-like events in the icecube detector volume and itsvicinity. acoustic signals from refreezing icecube holes and from anthropogenicsources have been used to localize acoustic events. monte carlo simulations ofsound propagating from the established sources to the spats sensors haveallowed to check corresponding model expectations. an upper limit on theneutrino flux at energies $e_\nu &gt; 10^{11}$ gev is derived from acoustic datataken over eight months.

1104.0075	time-dependent searches for point sources of neutrinos with the  40-string and 22-string configurations of icecube	this paper presents searches for flaring sources of neutrinos using theicecube neutrino telescope. for the first time, a search is performed over theentire parameter space of energy, direction and time looking for neutrinoflares of 20 microseconds to a year duration from astrophysical sources amongthe atmospheric neutrino and muon backgrounds. searches which integrate overtime are less sensitive to flares because they are affected by a largerbackground of atmospheric neutrinos and muons that can be reduced by the timeconstraint. flaring sources considered here, such as active galactic nuclei,soft gamma-ray repeaters and gamma-ray bursts, are promising candidate neutrinoemitters. we used mainly data taken between april 5, 2008 and may 20, 2009 by apartially completed configuration of icecube with 40 strings. for the presentedsearches an unbinned maximum likelihood method is used with a time-dependentprior to test several different source hypotheses. an "untriggered" searchcovers any possible time-dependent emission from sources not correlated to anyother observation using other astrophysical messengers such as photons.moreover, a similar time scan is performed for a predefined catalogue ofsources that exhibit intense photon flares. searches triggered bymulti-wavelength information on flares from blazars and soft gamma-rayrepeaters are performed using the 40 string data and also the data taken by theprevious configuration of 22 strings in operation between may 31, 2007 andapril 5, 2008. flares for which extensive and continuous monitoring isavailable from fermi-lat and swift and flares detected by imaging cherenkovtelescopes with shorter time-scale monitoring are considered. the results fromall searches are compatible with a fluctuation of the background.

1106.3484	neutrino analysis of the september 2010 crab nebula flare and  time-integrated constraints on neutrino emission from the crab using icecube	we present the results for a search of high-energy muon neutrinos with theicecube detector in coincidence with the crab nebula flare reported onseptember 2010 by various experiments. due to the unusual flaring state of theotherwise steady source we performed a prompt analysis of the 79-stringconfiguration data to search for neutrinos that might be emitted along with theobserved gamma-rays. we performed two different and complementary dataselections of neutrino events in the time window of 10 days around the flare.one event selection is optimized for discovery of e^-2 neutrino spectrumtypical of 1st order fermi acceleration. a similar event selection has alsobeen applied to the 40-string data to derive the time-integrated limits to theneutrino emission from the crab. the other event selection was optimized fordiscovery of neutrino spectra with softer spectral index and tev energycut-offs as observed for various galactic sources in gamma-rays. the 90% clbest upper limits on the crab flux during the 10 day flare are 4.73 x 10^-11cm-2 s-1 tev-1 for an e^-2 neutrino spectrum and 2.50 x 10^-10 cm-2 s-1 tev-1for a softer neutrino spectra of e-2.7, as indicated by fermi measurementsduring the flare. icecube has also set a time-integrated limit on the neutrinoemission of the crab using 375.5 days of livetime of the 40-stringconfiguration data. this limit is compared to existing models of neutrinoproduction from the crab and its impact on astrophysical parameters isdiscussed. the most optimistic predictions of some models are already rejectedby the icecube neutrino telescope with more than 90% cl.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1412.1031	investigating broadband variability of the tev blazar 1es 1959+650	we summarize broadband observations of the tev-emitting blazar 1es 1959+650,including optical r-band observations by the robotic telescopes super-lotis anditelescope, uv observations by swift uvot, x-ray observations by the swiftx-ray telescope (xrt), high-energy gamma-ray observations with the fermi largearea telescope (lat) and very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray observations byveritas above 315 gev, all taken between 17 april 2012 and 1 june 2012 (mjd56034 and 56079). the contemporaneous variability of the broadband spectralenergy distribution is explored in the context of a simple synchrotron selfcompton (ssc) model. in the ssc emission scenario, we find that the parametersrequired to represent the high state are significantly different than those inthe low state. motivated by possible evidence of gas in the vicinity of theblazar, we also investigate a reflected-emission model to describe the observedvariability pattern. this model assumes that the non-thermal emission from thejet is reflected by a nearby cloud of gas, allowing the reflected emission tore-enter the blob and produce an elevated gamma-ray state with no simultaneouselevated synchrotron flux. the model applied here, although not required toexplain the observed variability pattern, represents one possible scenariowhich can describe the observations. as applied to an elevated vhe state of 66%of the crab nebula flux, observed on a single night during the observationperiod, the reflected-emission scenario does not support a purely leptonicnon-thermal emission mechanism. the reflected emission model does, however,predict a reflected photon field with sufficient energy to enable elevatedgamma-ray emission via pion production with protons of energies between 10 and100 tev.

1508.06625	the camera calibration strategy of the cherenkov telescope array	the cherenkov telescope array (cta) will be the next generation ground basedobservatory in very high energy gamma ray astronomy. the facility will achievea wide energy coverage, starting from a threshold of a few tens of gev up tohundreds of tev by utilising several classes of telescopes, each optimised fordifferent regions of the gamma-ray spectrum. the required energy resolution ofbetter than 10-15% over most of the energy range and a goal of 5% systematicuncertainty on the measurement of the cherenkov light intensity at the positionof each telescope means that a very precise evaluation of the entire systemwill need to be made. the composite nature of the array means multiple cameratechnologies will be employed so multiple calibration systems and procedureswill be necessary to meet the performance requirements. additional constraintswill come from the need to minimise observing time losses and that theobservatory is foreseen to operate for tens of years, so both short and longterm systematic changes in performance will need to be investigated andmonitored. this contribution summarises the recommended camera calibrationstrategy of cta based on the experience with current iacts.

1509.04936	first nustar observations of mrk 501 within a radio to tev  multi-instrument campaign	we report on simultaneous broadband observations of the tev-emitting blazarmarkarian 501 between 1 april and 10 august 2013, including the first detailedcharacterization of the synchrotron peak with swift and nustar. during thecampaign, the nearby bl lac object was observed in both a quiescent and anelevated state. the broadband campaign includes observations with nustar,magic, veritas, the fermi large area telescope (lat), swift x-ray telescope anduv optical telescope, various ground-based optical instruments, including thegasp-webt program, as well as radio observations by ovro, mets\"ahovi and thef-gamma consortium. some of the magic observations were affected by a sandlayer from the saharan desert, and had to be corrected using event-by-eventcorrections derived with a lidar (light detection and ranging) facility. thisis the first time that lidar information is used to produce a physics resultwith cherenkov telescope data taken during adverse atmospheric conditions, andhence sets a precedent for the current and future ground-based gamma-rayinstruments. the nustar instrument provides unprecedented sensitivity in hardx-rays, showing the source to display a spectral energy distribution between 3and 79 kev consistent with a log-parabolic spectrum and hard x-ray variabilityon hour timescales. none (of the four extended nustar observations) showsevidence of the onset of inverse-compton emission at hard x-ray energies. weapply a single-zone equilibrium synchrotron self-compton model to fivesimultaneous broadband spectral energy distributions. we find that thesynchrotron self-compton model can reproduce the observed broadband statesthrough a decrease in the magnetic field strength coinciding with an increasein the luminosity and hardness of the relativistic leptons responsible for thehigh-energy emission.

1510.07048	teraelectronvolt pulsed emission from the crab pulsar detected by magic	aims: to investigate the extension of the very-high-energy spectral tail ofthe crab pulsar at energies above 400 gev. methods: we analyzed $\sim$320 hoursof good quality data of crab with the magic telescope, obtained from february2007 until april 2014. results: we report the most energetic pulsed emissionever detected from the crab pulsar reaching up to 1.5 tev. the pulse profileshows two narrow peaks synchronized with the ones measured in the gev energyrange. the spectra of the two peaks follow two different power-law functionsfrom 70 gev up to 1.5 tev and connect smoothly with the spectra measured above10 gev by the large area telescope (lat) on board of the fermi satellite. whenmaking a joint fit of the lat and magic data, above 10 gev, the photon indicesof the spectra differ by 0.5$\pm$0.1. conclusions: we measured with the magictelescopes the most energetic pulsed photons from a pulsar to date. such tevpulsed photons require a parent population of electrons with a lorentz factorof at least $5\times 10^6$. these results strongly suggest ic scattering offlow energy photons as the emission mechanism and a gamma-ray production regionin the vicinity of the light cylinder.

1512.02235	multiwavelength study of quiescent states of mrk 421 with unprecedented  hard x-ray coverage provided by nustar in 2013	we present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the bright, nearby bllac object mrk 421 taken in 2013 january-march, involving gasp-webt, swift,nustar, fermi-lat, magic, veritas, and other collaborations and instruments,providing data from radio to very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray bands. nustaryielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 3-79 kev range, revealingthat the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the x-ray spectralshape saturates into a steep power law with a photon index of approximately 3,with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up toabout 80 kev. for the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and theinverse-compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (sed) simultaneouslyshifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order ofmagnitude. the fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows adouble-bump structure which relates to the two bumps of the broadband sed. ineach bump, the variability increases with energy which, in the framework of thesynchrotron self-compton model, implies that the electrons with higher energiesare more variable. the measured multi-band variability, the significantx-ray-to-vhe correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed inboth bands, the lack of correlation between optical/uv and x-ray flux, the lowdegree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the shortestimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer variabilitytimescale observed in the nustar light curves point toward in-situ electronacceleration, and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributingto the broadband emission of mrk 421 during low-activity states.

astro-ph;0104143	gamma ray and hadron generated \v{c}erenkov photon spectra at various  observation altitudes	we study the propagation of cerenkov photons generated by very high energygamma-rays and hadrons in the atmosphere. the photon production heightdistributions are estimated from semi-empirical methods and compared with thosederived by standard simulation techniques. incident spectra at variousobservation altitudes are then derived after applying wavelength dependentcorrections due to photon attenuation in the atmosphere during the propagationof photons from the height of production to the height of observation. theseare generated both for gamma- and hadron primaries of various energies. thederived production height distributions agree very well with those generated bythe simulation package `corsika' at all energies and for both gamma-$ray andproton primaries. the incident photon spectra are found to be both altitudedependent and primary energy dependent. the peak of the incident spectrumshifts towards the shorter wavelength with increasing altitude of observationfor a given primary. also the peak of the photon spectrum shifts towards theshorter wavelength with increasing energy of the primary at given altitude. thefraction of the uv component in the incident cerenkov spectrum is estimatedboth for gamma-ray and hadronic primaries at various observation altitudes andenergies. hadron generated cerenkov spectra are marginally richer in uv lightand the difference increases slightly at higher altitudes. the fraction of theuv to the visible light in the cerenkov spectrum could be a useful parameter toseparate gamma-rays from cosmic ray background only if one can measure thisfraction very accurately.
