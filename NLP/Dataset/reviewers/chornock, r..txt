0906.1616	improved distances to type ia supernovae with two spectroscopic  subclasses	we study the observables of 158 relatively normal type ia supernovae (sne ia)by dividing them into two groups in terms of the expansion velocity inferredfrom the absorption minimum of the si ii 6355 line in their spectra near b-bandmaximum brightness. one group ("normal") consists of normal sne ia populating anarrow strip in the si ii velocity distribution, with an average expansionvelocity v=10,600+/-400 km/s near b maximum; the other group ("hv") consists ofobjects with higher velocities, v &gt; 11,800 km/s. compared with the normalgroup, the hv one shows a narrower distribution in both the peak luminosity andthe luminosity decline rate dm_{15}. in particular, their b-v colors at maximumbrightness are found to be on average redder by ~0.1, suggesting that theyeither are associated with dusty environments or have intrinsically red b-vcolors. the hv sne ia are also found to prefer a lower extinction ratio rv~1.6(versus ~2.4 for the normal ones). applying such an absorption-correctiondichotomy to sne ia of these two groups remarkably reduces the dispersion intheir peak luminosity from 0.178 mag to only 0.125 mag.

0906.2201	new observations of the very luminous supernova 2006gy: evidence for  echoes	supernova (sn) 2006gy was a hydrogen-rich core-collapse sn that remains oneof the most luminous optical supernovae ever observed. the total energy budget(&gt; 2 x 10^51 erg radiated in the optical alone) poses many challenges forstandard sn theory. we present new ground-based near-infrared (nir)observations of sn 2006gy, as well as a single epoch of hubble space telescope(hst) imaging obtained more than two years after the explosion. our nir datataken around peak optical emission show an evolution that is largely consistentwith a cooling blackbody, with tentative evidence for a growing nir excessstarting at day ~100. our late-time keck adaptive optics (ao) nir image, takenon day 723, shows little change from previous nir observations taken around day400. furthermore, the optical hst observations show a reduced decline rateafter day 400, and the sn is bluer on day 810 than it was at peak. thislate-time decline is inconsistent with co56 decay, and thus is problematic forthe various pair-instability sn models used to explain the nature of sn 2006gy.the slow decline of the nir emission can be explained with a light echo, and weconfirm that the late-time nir excess is the result of a massive (&gt;10 msun)dusty shell heated by the sn peak luminosity. the late-time opticalobservations require the existence of a scattered light echo, which may begenerated by the same dust that contributes to the nir echo. both the nir andoptical echoes originate in the proximity of the progenitor, ~10^18 cm for thenir echo and &lt;~10-40 pc for the optical echo, which provides further evidencethat the progenitor of sn 2006gy was a very massive star.

0911.4719	sn 2008iy: an unusual type iin supernova with an enduring 400 day rise  time	we present spectroscopic and photometric observations of the type iinsupernova (sn) 2008iy. sn 2008iy showed an unprecedentedly long rise time of~400 days, making it the first sn to take significantly longer than 100 days toreach peak optical luminosity. the peak absolute magnitude of sn 2008iy was m_r~ -19.1 mag, and the total radiated energy over the first ~700 days was ~2 x10^50 erg. spectroscopically, sn 2008iy is very similar to the type iin sn1988z at late times, and, like sn 1988z, it is a luminous x-ray source (bothsupernovae had an x-ray luminosity l_ x &gt; 10^41 erg/s). the halpha emissionprofile of sn 2008iy shows a narrow p cygni absorption component, implying apre-sn wind speed of ~100 km/s. we argue that the luminosity of sn 2008iy ispowered via the interaction of the sn ejecta with a dense, clumpy circumstellarmedium. the ~400 day rise time can be understood if the number density ofclumps increases with distance over a radius ~1.7 x 10^16 cm from theprogenitor. this scenario is possible if the progenitor experienced an episodicphase of enhanced mass-loss &lt; 1 century prior to explosion or the progenitorwind speed increased during the decades before core collapse. we favour theformer scenario, which is reminiscent of the eruptive mass-loss episodesobserved for luminous blue variable (lbv) stars. the progenitor wind speed andincreased mass-loss rates serve as further evidence that at least some, andperhaps all, type iin supernovae experience lbv-like eruptions shortly beforecore collapse. we also discuss the host galaxy of sn 2008iy, a subluminousdwarf galaxy, and offer a few reasons why the recent suggestion that unusual,luminous supernovae preferentially occur in dwarf galaxies may be the result ofobservational biases.

1008.4353	displaying the heterogeneity of the sn 2002cx-like subclass of type ia  supernovae with observations of the pan-starrs-1 discovered sn2009ku	sn2009ku, discovered by pan-starrs-1, is a type ia supernova (snia), and amember of the distinct sn2002cx-like class of sneia. its light curves aresimilar to the prototypical sn2002cx, but are slightly broader and have a laterrise to maximum in g. sn2009ku is brighter (~0.6 mag) than other sn2002cx-likeobjects, peaking at m_v = -18.4 mag - which is still significantly fainter thantypical sneia. sn2009ku, which had an ejecta velocity of ~2000 kms^-1 at 18days after maximum brightness is spectroscopically most similar to sn2008ha,which also had extremely low-velocity ejecta. however, sn2008ha had anexceedingly low luminosity, peaking at m_v = -14.2 mag, ~4 mag fainter thansn2009ku. the contrast of high luminosity and low ejecta velocity for sn2009kuis contrary to an emerging trend seen for the sn2002cx class. sn2009ku is acounter-example of a previously held belief that the class was more homogeneousthan typical sneia, indicating that the class has a diverse progenitorpopulation and/or complicated explosion physics. as the first example of amember of this class of objects from the new generation of transient surveys,sn2009ku is an indication of the potential for these surveys to find rare andinteresting objects.

1106.3073	the spectroscopic classification and explosion properties of sn2009nz  associated with grb091127 at z=0.490	we present spectroscopic observations of grb091127 (z=0.490) at the peak ofthe putative associated supernova, sn2009nz. subtracting a late-time spectrumof the host galaxy, we isolate the contribution of sn2009nz and uncover broadfeatures typical of nearby grb-sne. this establishes unambiguously thatgrb091127 was accompanied by a broad-lined type ic sn, and links a cosmologicallong burst with a standard energy release (e_gamma,iso ~ 1.1e52 erg) to amassive star progenitor. the spectrum of sn2009nz closely resembles that ofsn2006aj, with sn2003dh also providing an acceptable match, but hassignificantly narrower features than sne 1998bw and 2010bh, indicative of alower expansion velocity. the photospheric velocity inferred from the siii 6355absorption feature, v_ph ~ 17,000 km/s, is indeed closer to that of sne 2006ajand 2003dh than to the other grb-sne. combining the measured velocity with thelight curve peak brightness and width, we estimate the following explosionparameters: m_ni ~ 0.35 m_sun, e_k ~ 2.3e51 erg, and m_ej ~ 1.4 m_sun, similarto those of sn2006aj. these properties indicate that sn2009nz follows a trendof lower m_ni for grb-sne with lower e_k and m_ej. equally important, sincegrb091127 is a typical cosmological burst, the similarity of sn2009nz tosn2006aj either casts doubt on the claim that xrf060218/sn2006aj was powered bya neutron star, or indicates that the nature of the central engine is encodedin the sn properties but not in the prompt emission. future spectra of grb-sneat z &gt; 0.3, including proper subtraction of the host galaxy contribution, willshed light on the full dispersion of sn properties for standard long grbs, onthe relation between sne associated with sub-energetic and standard grbs, andon a potential dispersion in the associated sn types.

1107.3552	pan-starrs1 discovery of two ultra-luminous supernovae at z ~ 0.9	we present the discovery of two ultra-luminous supernovae (sne) at z ~ 0.9with the pan-starrs1 medium-deep survey. these sne, ps1-10ky and ps1-10awh, areamongst the most luminous sne ever discovered, comparable to the unusualtransients sn 2005ap and scp 06f6. like sn 2005ap and scp 06f6, they showcharacteristic high luminosities (m_bol ~ -22.5 mag), blue spectra with a fewbroad absorption lines, and no evidence for h or he. we have constructed a fullmulti-color light curve sensitive to the peak of the spectral energydistribution in the rest-frame ultraviolet, and we have obtained time-seriesspectroscopy for these sne. given the similarities between the sne, we combinetheir light curves to estimate a total radiated energy over the course ofexplosion of (0.9-1.4) x 10^51 erg. we find photospheric velocities of12,000-19,000 km/s with no evidence for deceleration measured across ~3rest-frame weeks around light-curve peak, consistent with the expansion of anoptically-thick massive shell of material. we show that, consistent withfindings for other ultra-luminous sne in this class, radioactive decay is notsufficient to power ps1-10ky, and we discuss two plausible origins for theseevents: the initial spin-down of a newborn magnetar in a core-collapse sn, orsn shock breakout from the dense circumstellar wind surrounding a wolf-rayetstar.

1112.2210	light echoes reveal an unexpectedly cool eta carinae during its  19th-century great eruption	eta carinae (eta car) is one of the most massive binary stars in the milkyway. it became the second-brightest star in the sky during its mid-19th century"great eruption," but then faded from view (with only naked-eye estimates ofbrightness). its eruption is unique among known astronomical transients in thatit exceeded the eddington luminosity limit for 10 years. because it is only 2.3kpc away, spatially resolved studies of the nebula have constrained the ejectedmass and velocity, indicating that in its 19th century eruption, eta carejected more than 10 m_solar in an event that had 10% of the energy of atypical core-collapse supernova without destroying the star. here we report thediscovery of light echoes of eta carinae which appear to be from the 1838-1858great eruption. spectra of these light echoes show only absorption lines, whichare blueshifted by -210 km/s, in good agreement with predicted expansionspeeds. the light-echo spectra correlate best with those of g2-g5 supergiantspectra, which have effective temperatures of ~5000 k. in contrast to the classof extragalactic outbursts assumed to be analogs of eta car's great eruption,the effective temperature of its outburst is significantly cooler than allowedby standard opaque wind models. this indicates that other physical mechanismslike an energetic blast wave may have triggered and influenced the eruption.

1205.1401	composite reverberation mapping	reverberation mapping offers one of the best techniques for studying theinner regions of qsos. it is based on cross-correlating continuum andemission-line light curves. new time-resolved optical surveys will produce wellsampled light curves for many thousands of qsos. we explore the potential ofstacking samples to produce composite cross-correlations for groups of objectsthat have well sampled continuum light curves, but only a few (~2)emission-line measurements. this technique exploits current and futurewide-field optical monitoring surveys (e.g. pan-starrs, lsst) and themultiplexing capability of multi-object spectrographs (e.g. 2df, hectospec) tosignificantly reduce the observational expense of reverberation mapping, inparticular at high redshift (0.5 to 2.5).  we demonstrate the technique using simulated qso light curves and explore thebiases involved when stacking cross-correlations in some simplified situations.we show that stacked cross correlations have smaller amplitude peaks comparedto well sampled correlation functions as the mean flux of the emission lightcurve is poorly constrained. however, the position of the peak remains intact.we find there can be `kinks' in stacked correlation functions due to differentmeasurements contributing to different parts of the correlation function.  using the pan-starrs medium-deep survey (mds) as a template we show thatcross-correlation lags should be measurable in a sample size of 500 qsos thathave weekly photometric monitoring and two spectroscopic observations. finallywe apply the technique to a small sample (42) of qsos that have light curvesfrom the mds. we find no indication of a peak in the stacked cross-correlation.a larger spectroscopic sample is required to produce robust reverberation lags.

1211.6528	an independent measurement of the incidence of mgii absorbers along  gamma-ray burst sightlines: the end of the mystery?	in 2006, prochter et al. reported a statistically significant enhancement ofvery strong mg ii absorption systems intervening the sightlines to gamma-raybursts (grbs) relative to the in- cidence of such absorption along quasarsightlines. this counterintuitive result, has inspired a diverse set ofastrophysical explanations (e.g. dust, gravitational lensing) but none of thesehas obviously resolved the puzzle. using the largest set of grb afterglowspectra available, we reexamine the purported enhancement. in an independentsample of grb spectra with a survey path 3 times larger than prochter et al.,we measure the incidence per unit redshift of $\geq 1$\aa rest-frame equivalentwidth mg ii absorbers at $z \approx 1$ to be l(z)= 0.18 $\pm$ 0.06. this isfully consistent with current estimates for the incidence of such absorbersalong quasar sightlines. therefore, we do not confirm the original enhancementand suggest those results suffered from a statistical fluke. signatures of theoriginal result do remain in our full sample (l(z) shows an $\approx 1.5$enhancement over l(z)qso), but the statistical significance now lies at$\approx 90%$ c.l. restricting our analysis to the subset of high-resolutionspectra of grb afterglows (which overlaps substantially with prochter et al.),we still reproduce a statistically significant enhancement of mg ii absorption.the reason for this excess, if real, is still unclear since there is noconnection between the rapid afterglow follow-up process with echelle (orechellette) spectrographs and the detectability of strong mg ii doublets. onlya larger sample of such high-resolution data will shed some light on thismatter.

1302.2352	a new population of ultra-long duration gamma-ray bursts	we present comprehensive multiwavelength observations of three gamma-raybursts (grbs) with durations of several thousand seconds. we demonstrate thatthese events are extragalactic transients; in particular we resolve thelong-standing conundrum of the distance of grb 101225a (the "christmas-dayburst"), finding it to have a redshift z=0.847, and showing that two apparentlysimilar events (grb 111209a and grb 121027a) lie at z=0.677 and z=1.773respectively. the systems show extremely unusual x-ray and optical lightcurves,very different from classical grbs, with long lasting highly variable x-rayemission and optical light curves that exhibit little correlation with thebehaviour seen in the x-ray. their host galaxies are faint, compact, and highlystar forming dwarf galaxies, typical of "blue compact galaxies". we proposethat these bursts are the prototypes of a hitherto largely unrecognizedpopulation of ultra-long grbs, that while observationally difficult to detectmay be astrophysically relatively common. the long durations may naturally beexplained by the engine driven explosions of stars of much larger radii thannormally considered for grb progenitors which are thought to have compactwolf-rayet progenitor stars. however, we cannot unambiguously identifysupernova signatures within their light curves or spectra. we also consider thealternative possibility that they arise from the tidal disruption of stars bysupermassive black holes.

1303.1531	ps1-10bzj: a fast, hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova in a metal poor  host galaxy	we present observations and analysis of ps1-10bzj, a superluminous supernova(slsn) discovered in the pan-starrs medium deep survey at a redshift z = 0.650.spectroscopically, ps1-10bzj is similar to the hydrogen-poor slsne 2005ap andscp 06f6, though with a steeper rise and lower peak luminosity (m_bol = -21.4mag) than previous events. we construct a bolometric light curve, and show thatwhile ps1-10bzj's energetics were less extreme than previous events, itsluminosity still cannot be explained by radioactive nickel decay alone. weexplore both a magnetar spin-down and circumstellar interaction scenario andfind that either can fit the data. ps1-10bzj is located in the extended chandradeep field south and the host galaxy is imaged in a number of surveys,including with the hubble space telescope. the host is a compact dwarf galaxy(m_b ~ -18 mag, diameter &lt; 800 pc), with a low stellar mass (m_* ~ 2.4 * 10^7m_sun), young stellar population (\tau_* ~ 5 myr), and a star formation rate of~ 2-3 m_sun/yr. the specific star formation rate is the highest seen in a slsnhost so far (~ 100 gyr^{-1}). we detect the [o iii]\lambda 4363 line, and finda low metallicity: 12+(o/h) = 7.8 +/- 0.2 (~ 0.1 z_sun). together, thisindicates that at least some of the progenitors of slsne come from young,low-metallicity populations.

1303.1818	ps1-12sk is a peculiar supernova from a he-rich progenitor system in a  brightest cluster galaxy environment	we report on our discovery and observations of the pan-starrs1 supernova (sn)ps1-12sk, a transient with properties that indicate atypical star formation inits host galaxy cluster or pose a challenge to popular progenitor system modelsfor this class of explosion. the optical spectra of ps1-12sk classify it as atype ibn sn (c.f. sn 2006jc), dominated by intermediate-width (3x10^3 km/s) andtime variable he i emission. our multi-wavelength monitoring establishes therise time dt = 9-23 days and shows an nuv-nir sed with temperature &gt; 17x10^3 kand a peak rise magnitude of mz = -18.9 mag. sn ibn spectroscopic propertiesare commonly interpreted as the signature of a massive star (17 - 100 m_sun)explosion within a he-enriched circumstellar medium. however, unlike previoustype ibn supernovae, ps1-12sk is associated with an elliptical brightestcluster galaxy, cgcg 208-042 (z = 0.054) in cluster rxc j0844.9+4258. theexpected probability of an event like ps1-12sk in such environments is lowgiven the measured infrequency of core-collapse sne in red sequence galaxiescompounded by the low volumetric rate of sn ibn. furthermore, we find noevidence of star formation at the explosion site to sensitive limits (sigmahalpha &lt; 2x10^-3 m_sun/yr/kpc^2). we therefore discuss white dwarf binarysystems as a possible progenitor channel for sne ibn. we conclude that ps1-12skrepresents either a fortuitous and statistically unlikely discovery, evidencefor a top-heavy imf in galaxy cluster cooling flow filaments, or the first cluesuggesting an alternate progenitor channel for type ibn sne.

1305.1803	stacked reverberation lags at high redshift	over the past 20years reverberation mapping has proved one of the mostsuccessful techniques for studying the local (&lt;1pc) environment ofsuper-massive black holes that drive active galactic nuclei. key successes ofreverberation mapping have been direct black hole mass estimates, theradius-luminosity relation for the hbeta line and the calibration ofsingle-epoch mass estimators commonly employed up to z~7. however, observingconstraints mean that few studies have been successful at z&gt;0.1, or for themore-luminous quasars that make up the majority of current spectroscopicsamples, or for the rest-frame ultra-violet emission lines available in opticalspectra of z&gt;0.5 objects.  previously we described a technique for stacking cross correlations to obtainreverberation mapping results at high z. here we present the first results froma campaign designed for this purpose. we construct stacked cross-correlationfunctions for the civ and mgii lines and find a clear peak in both. we find thepeak in the mgii correlation is at longer lags than civ consistent withprevious results at low redshift. for the civ sample we are able to bin byluminosity and find evidence for increasing lags for more-luminous objects.this civ radius-luminosity relation is consistent with previous studies butwith a fraction of the observational cost.

1305.2453	a reverse shock in grb 130427a	we present extensive radio and millimeter observations of the unusuallybright grb 130427a at z=0.340, spanning 0.67 to 12 days after the burst. takenin conjunction with detailed multi-band uv, optical, nir, and x-rayobservations we find that the broad-band afterglow emission is composed ofdistinct reverse shock and forward shock contributions. the reverse shockemission dominates in the radio/millimeter and at &lt;0.1 days in theuv/optical/nir, while the forward shock emission dominates in the x-rays and at&gt;0.1 days in the uv/optical/nir. we further find that the optical and x-raydata require a wind circumburst environment, pointing to a massive starprogenitor. using the combined forward and reverse shock emission we find thatthe parameters of the burst are an isotropic kinetic energy of e_kiso~2e53 erg,a mass loss rate of mdot~3e-8 msun/yr (for a wind velocity of 1,000 km/s), anda lorentz factor at the deceleration time of gamma(200s)~130. due to the lowdensity and large isotropic energy, the absence of a jet break to ~15 daysplaces only a weak constraint on the opening angle of theta_j&gt;2.5 deg, andtherefore a total energy of e_gamma+e_k&gt;1.2e51 erg, similar to other grbs. thereverse shock emission is detectable in this burst due to the low circumburstdensity, which leads to a slow cooling shock. we speculate that this is arequired property for the detectability of reverse shocks in the radio andmillimeter bands. following on grb 130427a as a benchmark event, observationsof future grbs with the exquisite sensitivity of vla and alma, coupled withdetailed modeling of the reverse and forward shock contributions will test thishypothesis.

1306.0038	a panchromatic view of the restless sn2009ip reveals the explosive  ejection of a massive star envelope	the 2012 explosion of sn2009ip raises questions about our understanding ofthe late stages of massive star evolution. here we present a comprehensivestudy of sn2009ip during its remarkable re-brightening(s). high-cadencephotometric and spectroscopic observations from the gev to the radio bandobtained from a variety of ground-based and space facilities (including thevla, swift, fermi, hst and xmm) constrain sn2009ip to be a low energy (e~ 10^50erg for an ejecta mass ~ 0.5 msun) and likely asymmetric explosion in a complexmedium shaped by multiple eruptions of the restless progenitor star. most ofthe energy is radiated as a result of the shock breaking out through a denseshell of material located at 5x10^14 cm with m~0.1 msun, ejected by theprecursor outburst ~40 days before the major explosion. we interpret the nirexcess of emission as signature of dust vaporization of material locatedfurther out (r&gt;4x 10^15 cm), the origin of which has to be connected withdocumented mass loss episodes in the previous years. our modeling predictsbright neutrino emission associated with the shock break-out if the cosmic rayenergy is comparable to the radiated energy. we connect this phenomenology withthe explosive ejection of the outer layers of the massive progenitor star, thatlater interacted with material deposited in the surroundings by previouseruptions. future observations will reveal if the luminous blue variable (lbv)progenitor star survived. irrespective of whether the explosion was terminal,sn2009ip brought to light the existence of new channels for sustained episodicmass-loss, the physical origin of which has yet to be identified.

1306.2337	the fast and furious decay of the peculiar type ic supernova 2005ek	we present extensive multi-wavelength observations of the extremely rapidlydeclining type ic supernova, sn 2005ek. reaching a peak magnitude of m_r =-17.3 and decaying by ~3 mag in the first 15 days post-maximum, sn 2005ek isamong the fastest type i supernovae observed to date. the spectra of sn 2005ekclosely resemble those of normal sn ic, but with an accelerated evolution.there is evidence for the onset of nebular features at only nine dayspost-maximum. spectroscopic modeling reveals an ejecta mass of ~0.3 msun thatis dominated by oxygen (~80%), while the pseudo-bolometric light curve isconsistent with an explosion powered by ~0.03 msun of radioactive ni-56.although previous rapidly evolving events (e.g., sn 1885a, sn 1939b, sn 2002bj,sn 2010x) were hypothesized to be produced by the detonation of a helium shellon a white dwarf, oxygen-dominated ejecta are difficult to reconcile with thisproposed mechanism. we find that the properties of sn 2005ek are consistentwith either the edge-lit double detonation of a low-mass white dwarf or theiron-core collapse of a massive star, stripped by binary interaction. however,if we assume that the strong spectroscopic similarity of sn 2005ek to other snic is an indication of a similar progenitor channel, then a white-dwarfprogenitor becomes very improbable. sn 2005ek may be one of the lowest massstripped-envelope core-collapse explosions ever observed. we find that the rateof such rapidly declining type i events is at least 1-3% of the normal sn iarate.

1306.3960	an r-process kilonova associated with the short-hard grb 130603b	we present ground-based optical and hubble space telescope optical andnear-ir observations of the short-hard grb130603b at z=0.356, which demonstratethe presence of excess near-ir emission matching the expected brightness andcolor of an r-process powered transient (a "kilonova"). the early afterglowfades rapidly with alpha&lt;-2.6 at t~8-32 hr post-burst and has a spectral indexof beta=-1.5 (f_nu t^alpha*nu^beta), leading to an expected near-ir brightnessat the time of the first hst observation of m(f160w)&gt;29.3 ab mag. instead, thedetected source has m(f160w)=25.8+/-0.2 ab mag, corresponding to a rest-frameabsolute magnitude of m(j)=-15.2 mag. the upper limit in the hst opticalobservations is m(f606w)&gt;27.7 ab mag (3-sigma), indicating an unusually redcolor of v-h&gt;1.9 mag. comparing the observed near-ir luminosity to theoreticalmodels of kilonovae produced by ejecta from the merger of an ns-ns or ns-bhbinary, we infer an ejecta mass of m_ej~0.03-0.08 msun for v_ej=0.1-0.3c. theinferred mass matches the expectations from numerical merger simulations. thepresence of a kilonova provides the strongest evidence to date that short grbsare produced by compact object mergers, and provides initial insight on theejected mass and the primary role that compact object merger may play in ther-process. equally important, it demonstrates that gravitational wave sourcesdetected by advanced ligo/virgo will be accompanied by optical/near-ircounterparts with unusually red colors, detectable by existing and upcominglarge wide-field facilities (e.g., pan-starrs, decam, subaru, lsst).

1307.5324	a search for fast optical transients in the pan-starrs1 medium-deep  survey: m dwarf flares, asteroids, limits on extragalactic rates, and  implications for lsst	[abridged] we present a search for fast optical transients (~0.5 hr-1 day)using repeated observations of the pan-starrs1 medium-deep survey (ps1/mds)fields. our search takes advantage of the consecutive g/r-band observations(16.5 min in each filter), by requiring detections in both bands, withnon-detections on preceding and subsequent nights. we identify 19 transientsbrighter than 22.5 ab mag (s/n&gt;10). of these, 11 events exhibit quiescentcounterparts in the deep ps1/mds templates that we identify as m4-m9 dwarfs.the remaining 8 transients exhibit a range of properties indicative ofmain-belt asteroids near the stationary point of their orbits. withidentifications for all 19 transients, we place an upper limit ofr_fot(0.5hr)&lt;0.12 deg^-2 d^-1 (95% confidence level) on the sky-projected rateof extragalactic fast transients at &lt;22.5 mag, a factor of 30-50 times lowerthan previous limits; the limit for a timescale of ~day is r_fot&lt;2.4e-3 deg^-2d^-1. to convert these sky-projected rates to volumetric rates, we explore theexpected peak luminosities of fast optical transients powered by variousmechanisms, and find that non-relativistic events are limited to m~-10 mag(m~-14 mag) for a timescale of ~0.5 hr (~day), while relativistic sources(e.g., grbs, magnetar-powered transients) can reach much larger luminosities.the resulting volumetric rates are &lt;13 (m~-10 mag), &lt;0.05 (m~-14 mag) and &lt;1e-6mpc^-3 yr^-1 (m~-24 mag), significantly above the nova, supernova, and grbrates, respectively, indicating that much larger surveys are required toprovide meaningful constraints. motivated by the results of our search wediscuss strategies for identifying fast optical transients in the lsst mainsurvey, and reach the optimistic conclusion that the veil of foregroundcontaminants can be lifted with the survey data, without the need for expensivefollow-up observations.

1309.3009	the uv-bright, slowly declining transient ps1-11af as a partial tidal  disruption event	we present the pan-starrs1 discovery of the long-lived and blue transientps1-11af, which was also detected by galex with coordinated observations in thenear-ultraviolet (nuv) band. ps1-11af is associated with the nucleus of anearly-type galaxy at redshift z=0.4046 that exhibits no evidence for starformation or agn activity. four epochs of spectroscopy reveal a pair oftransient broad absorption features in the uv on otherwise featureless spectra.despite the superficial similarity of these features to p-cygni absorptions ofsupernovae (sne), we conclude that ps1-11af is not consistent with theproperties of known types of sne. blackbody fits to the spectral energydistribution are inconsistent with the cooling, expanding ejecta of a sn, andthe velocities of the absorption features are too high to represent material inhomologous expansion near a sn photosphere. however, the constant blue colorsand slow evolution of the luminosity are similar to previous optically-selectedtidal disruption events (tdes). the shape of the optical light curve isconsistent with models for tdes, but the minimum accreted mass necessary topower the observed luminosity is only ~0.002m_sun, which points to a partialdisruption model. a full disruption model predicts higher bolometricluminosities, which would require most of the radiation to be emitted in aseparate component at high energies where we lack observations. in addition,the observed temperature is lower than that predicted by pure accretion diskmodels for tdes and requires reprocessing to a constant, lower temperature.three deep non-detections in the radio with the vla over the first two yearsafter the event set strict limits on the production of any relativistic outflowcomparable to swift j1644+57, even if off-axis.

1310.4446	slowly fading super-luminous supernovae that are not pair-instability  explosions	super-luminous supernovae that radiate more than 10^44 ergs per second attheir peak luminosity have recently been discovered in faint galaxies atredshifts of 0.1-4. some evolve slowly, resembling models of 'pair-instability'supernovae. such models involve stars with original masses 140-260 times thatof the sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65-30 solar masses. in thesestars, the photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted toelectron-positron pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclearexplosions. many solar masses of 56ni are synthesized; this isotope decays to56fe via 56co, powering bright light curves. such massive progenitors areexpected to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early universe. recently,supernova 2007bi in a galaxy at redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years afterthe big bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the sun was observed to looklike a fading pair-instability supernova. here we report observations of twoslow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times andblue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability models. theirlate-time light-curve and spectral similarities to supernova 2007bi call thenature of that event into question. our early spectra closely resemble typicalfast-declining super-luminous supernovae, which are not powered byradioactivity. modelling our observations with 10-16 solar masses ofmagnetar-energized ejecta demonstrates the possibility of a common explosionmechanism. the lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests thattheir local rate of occurrence is less than 6x10^-6 times that of thecore-collapse rate.

1311.0026	hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae and long-duration gamma-ray  bursts have similar host galaxies	we present optical spectroscopy and optical/near-ir photometry of 31 hostgalaxies of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (slsne), including 15 eventsfrom the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey. our sample spans the redshift range0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1.6 and is the first comprehensive host galaxy study of this specificsubclass of cosmic explosions. combining the multi-band photometry andemission-line measurements, we determine the luminosities, stellar masses, starformation rates and metallicities. we find that as a whole, the hosts of slsneare a low-luminosity (&lt;m_b&gt; ~ -17.3 mag), low stellar mass (&lt;m_*&gt; ~ 2 x 10^8m_sun) population, with a high median specific star formation rate (&lt;ssfr&gt; ~ 2gyr^-1). the median metallicity of our spectroscopic sample is low, 12 +log(o/h}) ~ 8.35 ~ 0.45 z_sun, although at least one host galaxy has solarmetallicity. the host galaxies of h-poor slsne are statistically distinct fromthe hosts of goods core-collapse sne (which cover a similar redshift range),but resemble the host galaxies of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) interms of stellar mass, sfr, ssfr and metallicity. this result indicates thatthe environmental causes leading to massive stars forming either slsne or lgrbsare similar, and in particular that slsne are more effectively formed in lowmetallicity environments. we speculate that the key ingredient is large coreangular momentum, leading to a rapidly-spinning magnetar in slsne and anaccreting black hole in lgrbs.

1402.1631	selecting superluminous supernovae in faint galaxies from the first year  of the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey	the pan-starrs1 (ps1) survey has obtained imaging in 5 bands (grizy_p1) over10 medium deep survey (mds) fields covering a total of 70 square degrees. thispaper describes the search for apparently hostless supernovae (sne) within thefirst year of ps1 mds data with an aim of discovering new superluminoussupernovae (slsne). a total of 249 hostless transients were discovered down toa limiting magnitude of m_ab ~ 23.5, of which 76 were classified as type iasne. there were 57 sne with complete light curves that are likely core-collapsesne (ccsne) or slsne and 12 of these have had spectra taken. of these 12hostless, non-type ia sne, 7 were slsne of type ic at redshifts between0.5-1.4. this illustrates that the discovery rate of type ic slsne can bemaximised by concentrating on hostless transients and removing normal sne ia.we present data for two new possible slsne; ps1-10pm (z = 1.206) and ps1-10ahf(z = 1.1), and estimate the rate of slsne-ic to be between 3^{+3}_{-2} *10^{-5} and 8^{+2}_{-1} * 10^{-5} of the ccsne rate within 0.3 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.4 byapplying a monte-carlo technique. the rate of slowly evolving, sn2007bi-likeexplosions is estimated as a factor of 10 lower than this range.

1403.7202	light echoes from eta carinae's great eruption: spectrophotometric  evolution and the rapid formation of nitrogen-rich molecules	we present follow-up optical imaging and spectroscopy of one of the lightechoes of $\eta$ carinae's 19th-century great eruption discovered by rest etal. (2012). by obtaining images and spectra at the same light echo positionbetween 2011 and 2014, we follow the evolution of the great eruption on athree-year timescale. we find remarkable changes in the photometric andspectroscopic evolution of the echo light. the $i$-band light curve shows adecline of $\sim 0.9$ mag in $\sim 1$ year after the peak observed in early2011 and a flattening at later times. the spectra show a pure-absorption earlyg-type stellar spectrum at peak, but a few months after peak the lines of the[ca ii] triplet develop strong p-cygni profiles and we see the appearance of[ca ii] 7291,7324 doublet in emission. these emission features and theirevolution in time resemble those observed in the spectra of some type iinsupernovae and supernova impostors. most surprisingly, starting $\sim 300$ daysafter peak brightness, the spectra show strong molecular transitions of cn at$\gtrsim 6800$ \aa. the appearance of these cn features can be explained if theejecta are strongly nitrogen enhanced, as it is observed in modernspectroscopic studies of the bipolar homunculus nebula. given the spectroscopicevolution of the light echo, velocities of the main features, and detection ofstrong cn, we are likely seeing ejecta that contributes directly to thehomunculus nebula.

1404.2004	towards characterization of the type iip supernova progenitor  population: a statistical sample of light curves from pan-starrs1	in recent years, wide-field sky surveys providing deep multi-band imaginghave presented a new path for indirectly characterizing the progenitorpopulations of core-collapse supernovae (sn): systematic light curve studies.we assemble a set of 76 grizy-band type iip sn light curves from pan-starrs1,obtained over a constant survey program of 4 years and classified using bothspectroscopy and machine learning-based photometric techniques. we develop andapply a new bayesian model for the full multi-band evolution of each lightcurve in the sample. we find no evidence of a sub-population of fast-decliningexplosions (historically referred to as "type iil" sne). however, we identify ahighly significant relation between the plateau phase decay rate and peakluminosity among our sne iip. these results argue in favor of a singleparameter, likely determined by initial stellar mass, predominantly controllingthe explosions of red supergiants. this relation could also be applied forsupernova cosmology, offering a standardizable candle good to an intrinsicscatter of 0.2 mag. we compare each light curve to physical models fromhydrodynamic simulations to estimate progenitor initial masses and otherproperties of the pan-starrs1 type iip sn sample. we show that correction ofsystematic discrepancies between modeled and observed sn iip light curveproperties and an expanded grid of progenitor properties, are needed to enablerobust progenitor inferences from multi-band light curve samples of this kind.this work will serve as a pathfinder for photometric studies of core-collapsesne to be conducted through future wide field transient searches.

1405.3668	rapidly-evolving and luminous transients from pan-starrs1	in the past decade, several rapidly-evolving transients have been discoveredwhose timescales and luminosities are not easily explained by traditionalsupernovae (sn) models. the sample size of these objects has remained smalldue, at least in part, to the challenge of detecting short timescale transientswith traditional survey cadences. here we present the results from a searchwithin the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey (ps1-mds) for rapidly-evolving andluminous transients. we identify 10 new transients with a time abovehalf-maximum of less than 12 days and -16.5 &gt; m &gt; -20 mag. this increases thenumber of known events in this region of sn phase space by roughly a factor ofthree. the median redshift of the ps1-mds sample is z=0.275 and they allexploded in star forming galaxies. in general, the transients possess fasterrise than decline timescale and blue colors at maximum light (g - r &lt; -0.2).best fit blackbodies reveal photospheric temperatures/radii that expand/coolwith time and explosion spectra taken near maximum light are dominated by ablue continuum, consistent with a hot, optically thick, ejecta. we find itdifficult to reconcile the short timescale, high peak luminosity (l &gt; 10^43erg/s), and lack of uv line blanketing observed in many of these transientswith an explosion powered mainly by the radioactive decay of ni-56. rather, wefind that many are consistent with either (1) cooling envelope emission fromthe explosion of a star with a low-mass extended envelope which ejected verylittle (&lt;0.03 m_sun) radioactive material, or (2) a shock breakout within adense, optically thick, wind surrounding the progenitor star. after calculatingthe detection efficiency for objects with rapid timescales in the ps1-mds wefind a volumetric rate of 4800 - 8000 events/yr/gpc^3 (4-7% of thecore-collapse sn rate at z=0.2).

1405.7400	grb 140515a at z=6.33: constraints on the end of reionization from a  gamma-ray burst in a low hydrogen column density environment	we present the discovery and subsequent spectroscopy with gemini-north of theoptical afterglow of the swift gamma-ray burst (grb) 140515a. the spectrumexhibits a well-detected continuum at wavelengths longer than 8915 angs with asteep decrement to zero flux blueward of 8910 angs due to ly-alpha absorptionat redshift z~6.33. some transmission through the lyman-alpha forest is presentat 5.2&lt;z&lt;5.733, but none is detected at higher redshift, consistent withprevious measurements from quasars and grb 130606a. we model the red dampingwing of lyman-alpha in three ways that provide equally good fits to the data:(a) a single host galaxy absorber at z=6.327 with log(n_hi)=18.62+/-0.08; (b)pure intergalactic medium (igm) absorption from z=6.0 to z=6.328 with aconstant neutral hydrogen fraction of x_hi=0.056+0.011-0.027; and (c) a hybridmodel with a host absorber located within an ionized bubble of radius 10comoving mpc in an igm with x_hi=0.12+/-0.05 (x_hi&lt;0.21 at the 2-sigma level).regardless of the model, the sharpness of the dropoff in transmission isinconsistent with a substantial neutral fraction in the igm at this redshift.no narrow absorption lines from the host galaxy are detected, indicating a hostmetallicity of [z/h]&lt;~ -0.8. even if we assume that all of the hydrogenabsorption is due to the host galaxy, the column is unusually low for a grbsightline, similar to two out of the other three highest-redshift bursts withmeasured log(n_hi). this is possible evidence that the escape fraction ofionizing photons from normal star-forming galaxies increases at z&gt;~6.

1408.2520	alma observations of the host galaxy of grb090423 at z=8.23: deep limits  on obscured star formation 630 million years after the big bang	we present rest-frame far-infrared (fir) and optical observations of the hostgalaxy of grb090423 at z=8.23 from the atacama large millimeter array (alma)and the spitzer space telescope, respectively. the host remains undetected to3-sigma limits of fnu(222 ghz)&lt;33 microjy and fnu(3.6 micron)&lt;81 njy. the firlimit is about 20 times fainter than the luminosity of the local ulirg arp220,and comparable to the local starburst m82. comparing to model spectral energydistributions we place a limit on the ir luminosity of l_ir(8-1000 micron)&lt;3e10lsun, corresponding to a limit on the obscured star formation rate of sfr_ir&lt;5msun/yr; for comparison, the limit on the unobscured star formation rate fromhubble space telescope rest-frame uv observations is sfr_uv&lt;1 msun/yr. we alsoplace a limit on the host galaxy stellar mass of &lt;5e7 msun (for a stellarpopulation age of 100 myr and constant star formation rate). finally, wecompare our millimeter observations to those of field galaxies at z&gt;4 (lymanbreak galaxies, ly-alpha emitters, and submillimeter galaxies), and find thatour limit on the fir luminosity is the most constraining to date, although thefield galaxies have much larger rest-frame uv/optical luminosities than thehost of grb090423 by virtue of their selection techniques. we conclude that grbhost galaxies at z&gt;4, especially those with measured interstellar mediummetallicities from afterglow spectroscopy, are an attractive sample for futurealma studies of high redshift obscured star formation.

0803.3215	observations of the naked-eye grb 080319b: implications of nature's  brightest explosion	the first gamma-ray burst (grb) confirmed to be bright enough to be seen withthe naked eye, grb 080319b at redshift z = 0.937, allowed for exquisitefollow-up observations across the electromagnetic spectrum. we present ourdetailed optical and infrared observations of the afterglow, consisting of over5000 images starting 51 s after the grb trigger, in concert with our ownanalysis of the swift data. the event is extreme not only in observedproperties but intrinsically: it was the most luminous event ever recorded atoptical and infrared wavelengths and had an exceedingly highisotropic-equivalent energy release in gamma-rays. at early times, theafterglow evolution is broadly consistent with being reverse-shock dominated,but then is subsumed by a forward shock at around 1000 s. the overall spectralenergy distribution, spanning from ultraviolet through near-infraredwavelengths, shows no evidence for a significant amount of dust extinction inthe host frame. the afterglow evolution, however, is highly chromatic: startingat about 1000 s the index shifts blueward before shifting back to the red atlate times. in our deepest late-time observations, we find tentative evidencefor an optical jet break and a luminous supernova. finally, we examine thedetectability of such events with current and future facilities and find thatsuch an event could be detected in gamma-rays by bat out to z = 10.7 (8 sigma),while the nominal exist sensitivity would allow detection to z ~ 32. at k band,this source would have been easily detected with meter-class telescopes to z ~17.

1409.1536	a sample of type ii-l supernovae	what are type ii-linear supernovae (sne ii-l)? this class, which has been illdefined for decades, now receives significant attention -- both theoretically,in order to understand what happens to stars in the ~15-25mo range, andobservationally, with two independent studies suggesting that they cannot becleanly separated photometrically from the regular hydrogen-rich sne ii-pcharacterised by a marked plateau in their light curve. here, we analyze themulti-band light curves and extensive spectroscopic coverage of a sample of 35sne ii and find that 11 of them could be sne ii-l. the spectra of these sne arehydrogen deficient, typically have shallow halpha absorption, may show indirectsigns of helium via strong oi 7774 absorption, and have faster line velocitiesconsistent with a thin hydrogen shell. the light curves can be mostlydifferentiated from those of the regular, hydrogen-rich sne ii-p by theirsteeper decline rates and higher luminosity, and we propose as a definingphotometric characteristic the decline in the v band: sne ii-l seem to declineby more than 0.5 mag from peak brightness by day 50 after explosion. using oursample we provide template light curves for sne ii-l and ii-p in 4 photometricbands.

1411.1060	zooming in on the progenitors of superluminous supernovae with the hst	we present hubble space telescope (hst) rest-frame ultraviolet imaging of thehost galaxies of 16 hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (slsne), including11 events from the pan-starrs medium deep survey. taking advantage of thesuperb angular resolution of hst, we characterize the galaxies' morphologicalproperties, sizes and star formation rate (sfr) densities. we determine thesupernova (sn) locations within the host galaxies through precise astrometricmatching, and measure physical and host-normalized offsets, as well as the snpositions within the cumulative distribution of uv light pixel brightness. wefind that the host galaxies of h-poor slsne are irregular, compact dwarfgalaxies, with a median half-light radius of just 0.9 kpc. the uv-derived sfrdensities are high (&lt;sigma_sfr&gt; ~ 0.1 m_sun/yr/kpc^2), suggesting that slsneform in overdense environments. their locations trace the uv light of theirhost galaxies, with a distribution intermediate between that of long-durationgamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) (which are strongly clustered on the brightest regionsof their hosts) and a uniform distribution (characteristic of normalcore-collapse sne), though cannot be statistically distinguished from eitherwith the current sample size. taken together, this strengthens the picture thatslsn progenitors require different conditions than those of ordinarycore-collapse sne to form, and that they explode in broadly similar galaxies asdo lgrbs. if the tendency for slsne to be less clustered on the brightestregions than are lgrbs is confirmed by a larger sample, this would indicate adifferent, potentially lower-mass progenitor for slsne than lrgbs.

1501.01314	selection of burst-like transients and stochastic variables using  multi-band image differencing in the pan-starrs1 medium-deep survey	we present a novel method for the light-curve characterization of pan-starrs1medium deep survey (ps1 mds) extragalactic sources into stochastic variables(sv) and burst-like (bl) transients, using multi-band image-differencingtime-series data. we select detections in difference images associated withgalaxy hosts using a star/galaxy catalog extracted from the deep ps1 mdsstacked images, and adopt a maximum a posteriori formulation to model theirdifference-flux time-series in four pan-starrs1 photometric bands g,r,i, and z.we use three deterministic light-curve models to fit burst-like transients andone stochastic light curve model, the ornstein-uhlenbeck process, in order tofit variability that is characteristic of active galactic nuclei (agn). weassess the quality of fit of the models band-wise source-wise, using theirestimated leave-out-one cross-validation likelihoods and corrected akaikeinformation criteria. we then apply a k-means clustering algorithm on thesestatistics, to determine the source classification in each band. the finalsource classification is derived as a combination of the individual filterclassifications. we use our clustering method to characterize 4361extragalactic image difference detected sources in the first 2.5 years of theps1 mds, into 1529 bl, and 2262 sv, with a purity of 95.00% for agn, and 90.97%for sn based on our verification sets. we combine our light-curveclassifications with their nuclear or off-nuclear host galaxy offsets, todefine a robust photometric sample of 1233 active galactic nuclei and 812supernovae. we use these samples to identify simple photometric priors thatwould enable their real-time identification in future wide-field synopticsurveys.

1502.06964	galex detection of shock breakout in type ii-p supernova ps1-13arp:  implications for the progenitor star wind	we present the galex detection of a uv burst at the time of explosion of anoptically normal type ii-p supernova (ps1-13arp) from the pan-starrs1 survey atz=0.1665. the temperature and luminosity of the uv burst match the theoreticalpredictions for shock breakout in a red supergiant, but with a duration afactor of ~50 longer than expected. we compare the $nuv$ light curve ofps1-13arp to previous galex detections of type iip sne, and find cleardistinctions that indicate that the uv emission is powered by shock breakout,and not by the subsequent cooling envelope emission previously detected inthese systems. we interpret the ~ 1 d duration of the uv signal with a shockbreakout in the wind of a red supergiant with a pre-explosion mass-loss rate of~ 10^-3 msun yr^-1. this mass-loss rate is enough to prolong the duration ofthe shock breakout signal, but not enough to produce an excess in the opticalplateau light curve or narrow emission lines powered by circumstellarinteraction. this detection of non-standard, potentially episodic highmass-loss in a rsg sn progenitor has favorable consequences for the prospectsof future wide-field uv surveys to detect shock breakout directly in thesesystems, and provide a sensitive probe of the pre-explosion conditions of snprogenitors.

0805.2201	from shock breakout to peak and beyond: extensive panchromatic  observations of the type ib supernova 2008d associated with swift x-ray  transient 080109	we present extensive early photometric (ultraviolet through near-infrared)and spectroscopic (optical and near-infrared) data on supernova (sn) 2008d aswell as x-ray data analysis on the associated swift/x-ray transient (xrt)080109. our data span a time range of 5 hours before the detection of the x-raytransient to 150 days after its detection, and detailed analysis allowed us toderive constraints on the nature of the sn and its progenitor; throughout wedraw comparisons with results presented in the literature and find several keyaspects that differ. we show that the x-ray spectrum of xrt 080109 can be fitequally well by an absorbed power law or a superposition of about equal partsof both power law and blackbody. our data first established that sn 2008d is aspectroscopically normal sn ib (i.e., showing conspicuous he lines), and showthat sn 2008d had a relatively long rise time of 18 days and a modest opticalpeak luminosity. the early-time light curves of the sn are dominated by acooling stellar envelope (for \delta t~0.1- 4 day, most pronounced in the bluebands) followed by 56^ni decay. we construct a reliable measurement of thebolometric output for this stripped-envelope sn, and, combined with estimatesof e_k and m_ej from the literature, estimate the stellar radius r_star of itsprobable wolf-rayet progenitor. according to the model of waxman et al. and ofchevalier &amp; fransson, we derive r_star^{w07}= 1.2+/-0.7 r_sun andr_star^{cf08}= 12+/-7 r_sun, respectively; the latter being more in line withtypical wn stars. spectra obtained at 3 and 4 months after maximum light showdouble-peaked oxygen lines that we associate with departures from sphericalsymmetry, as has been suggested for the inner ejecta of a number of sn ibcores.

1507.03582	swift j1112.2-8238: a candidate relativistic tidal disruption flare	we present observations of swift j1112.2-8238, and identify it as a candidaterelativistic tidal disruption flare (rtdf). the outburst was first detected byswift/bat in june 2011 as an unknown, long-lived (order of days) $\gamma$-raytransient source. we show that its position is consistent with the nucleus of afaint galaxy for which we establish a likely redshift of $z=0.89$ based on asingle emission line that we interpret as the blended [oii]$\lambda3727$doublet. at this redshift, the peak x/$\gamma$-ray luminosity exceeded$10^{47}$ ergs s$^{-1}$, while a spatially coincident optical transient sourcehad $i^{\prime} \sim 22$ (m$_g \sim -21.4$ at $z=0.89$) during earlyobservations, $\sim 20$ days after the swift trigger. these properties placeswift j1112.2-8238 in a very similar region of parameter space to the twopreviously identified members of this class, swift j1644+57 and swiftj2058+0516. as with those events the high-energy emission shows evidence forvariability over the first few days, while late time observations, almost 3years post-outburst, demonstrate that it has now switched off. swiftj1112.2-8238 brings the total number of such events observed by swift to three,interestingly all detected by swift over a $\sim$3 month period ($&lt;3\%$ of itstotal lifetime as of march 2015). while this suggests the possibility thatfurther examples may be uncovered by detailed searches of the bat archives, thelack of any prime candidates in the years since 2011 means these events areundoubtedly rare.

1511.01907	metamorphosis of sn 2014c: delayed interaction between a hydrogen poor  core-collapse supernova and a nearby circumstellar shell	we present optical observations of supernova sn 2014c, which underwent anunprecedented slow metamorphosis from h-poor type ib to h-rich type iin overthe course of one year. the observed spectroscopic evolution is consistent withthe supernova having exploded in a cavity before encountering a massive shellof the progenitor star's stripped hydrogen envelope. possible origins for thecircumstellar shell include a brief wolf-rayet fast wind phase that overtook aslower red supergiant wind, eruptive ejection, or confinement of circumstellarmaterial by external influences of neighboring stars. an extended high velocityhalpha absorption feature seen in near-maximum light spectra implies that theprogenitor star was not completely stripped of hydrogen at the time of corecollapse. archival pre-explosion subaru telescope suprime-cam and hubble spacetelescope wide field planetary camera 2 images of the region obtained in 2009show a coincident source that is most likely a compact massive star cluster inngc 7331 that hosted the progenitor system. by comparing the emissionproperties of the source with stellar population models that incorporateinteracting binary stars we estimate the age of the host cluster to be 30 - 300myr, and favor ages closer to 30 myr in light of relatively strong halphaemission. sn 2014c is the best-observed member of a class of core-collapsesupernovae that fill the gap between events that interact strongly with dense,nearby environments immediately after explosion and those that never show signsof interaction. better understanding of the frequency and nature of thisintermediate population can contribute valuable information about the poorlyunderstood final stages of stellar evolution.

(2014). the light curve of ps1-10jh over a baseline of 3.5 yr is bestmodeled by fallback accretion of a tidally disrupted star. its strong broadhelium emission relative to hydrogen (he ii \lambda 4686/h\alpha &gt; 5) could beindicative of either the hydrogen-poor chemical composition of the disruptedstar, or certain conditions in the tidal debris of a solar-composition star inthe presence of an optically-thick, extended reprocessing envelope.

0808.2193	the exceptionally luminous type ii-l sn 2008es	we report on our early photometric and spectroscopic observations of theextremely luminous type ii supernova (sn) 2008es. with an observed peak opticalmagnitude of m_v = 17.8 and at a redshift z = 0.213, sn 2008es had a peakabsolute magnitude of m_v = -22.3, making it the second most luminous sn everobserved. the photometric evolution of sn 2008es exhibits a fast decline rate(~0.042 mag d^-1), similar to the extremely luminous type ii-l sn 2005ap. weshow that sn 2008es spectroscopically resembles the luminous type ii-l sn1979c. although the spectra of sn 2008es lack the narrow and intermediate-widthline emission typically associated with the interaction of a sn with thecircumstellar medium of its progenitor star, we argue that the extremeluminosity of sn 2008es is powered via strong interaction with a dense,optically thick circumstellar medium. the integrated bolometric luminosity ofsn 2008es yields a total radiated energy at ultraviolet and optical wavelengthsof &gt;10^51 ergs. finally, we examine the apparently anomalous rate at which thetexas supernova search has discovered rare kinds of supernovae, including thefive most luminous supernovae observed to date, and find that their results areconsistent with those of other modern sn searches.

astro-ph;0210047	"hidden" seyfert 2 galaxies and the x-ray background	obscured active galactic nuclei, which are classified optically as type 2(narrow-line) seyfert galaxies in the local universe, are by far the mostpromising candidates for the origin of the hard (2-10 kev) x-ray backgroundradiation. however, optical follow-up observations of faint x-ray sources indeep chandra images have revealed surprising numbers of apparently normalgalaxies at modest redshift. such objects represent ~40-60% of the sourcesclassified in deep chandra surveys, raising the possibility that the x-raygalaxy population has evolved with cosmic time. alternatively, most of thefaint x-ray galaxies in question are so distant that their angular diametersare comparable to the slit widths used in ground-based spectroscopicobservations; thus, their nuclear spectral features may be overwhelmed(``hidden'') by host-galaxy light. to test this hypothesis, we have obtainedintegrated spectra of a sample of nearby, well-studied seyfert 2 galaxies. thedata, which accurately simulate observations of distant chandra sources,demonstrate convincingly that the defining spectral signatures of seyfert 2scan be hidden by light from their host galaxies. in fact, 60% of the observedobjects would not be classified as seyfert 2s on the basis of their integratedspectra, similar to the fraction of faint x-ray sources identified with``normal'' galaxies. thus, the numbers of narrow-line active galaxies in deepchandra surveys (and perhaps all ground-based spectroscopic surveys of distantgalaxies) are likely to have been underestimated.

astro-ph;0404035	discovery and evolution of an unusual luminous variable star in ngc 3432  (supernova 2000ch)	we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of sn 2000ch, anunusual and extremely luminous variable star located in the galaxy ngc 3432.the object was discovered on 2000 may 3.2 during the course of the lickobservatory supernova search, at an unfiltered magnitude of about 17.4.pre-discovery images obtained in 1997, 1998, and 2000 april show the objectwith r = 19.2-19.5 mag. optical spectra obtained beginning on 2000 may 6 show asmooth, flat continuum and strong, broad hydrogen balmer emission lines atwavelengths consistent with the catalogued redshift of ngc 3432, strengtheningthe association of the variable with the galaxy. photometric monitoring revealsa complex and erratic light curve over a time span of ~10 days. subsequentoptical spectra over the next ~3 months continued to show strong balmeremission lines with a mean full-width at half-maximum intensity ~1550 km/s anda distinct red asymmetry. a spectrum obtained 9 months after the outburst issimilar to the previous spectra, but the integrated flux in h-alpha is nearlyhalf that observed during the outburst. the object's photometric behavior,spectrum, and luminosity suggest that it is a very massive and luminousvariable star and might be related to some luminous blue variable stars such aseta carinae and sn 1997bs in ngc 3627. the brightest apparent magnitude impliesan absolute magnitude of approximately -12.7 at the distance of ngc 3432, avalue which is comparable to eta carinae during its outburst in themid-nineteenth century.

astro-ph;0406546	the hubble higher-z supernova search: supernovae to z=1.6 and  constraints on type ia progenitor models	we present results from the hubble higher-z supernova search, the firstspace-based open field survey for supernovae (sne). in cooperation with thegreat observatories origins deep survey, we have used the hubble spacetelescope with the advanced camera for surveys to cover 300 square arcmin inthe area of the chandra deep field south and the hubble deep field north onfive separate search epochs (separated by 45 day intervals) to a limitingmagnitude of z'=26. these deep observations have allowed us to discover 42 snein the redshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.6. as these data span a large range inredshift, they are ideal for testing the validity of type ia supernovaprogenitor models with the distribution of expected ``delay times,'' fromprogenitor star formation to sn ia explosion, and the sn rates these modelspredict. through a bayesian maximum likelihood test, we determine whichdelay-time models best reproduce the redshift distribution of sne ia discoveredin this survey. we find that models that require a large fraction of ``prompt''(less than 2 gyr) sne ia poorly reproduce the observed redshift distributionand are rejected at 95% confidence. we find that gaussian models best fit theobserved data for mean delay times in the range of 3 to 4 gyr.

astro-ph;0411357	spectroscopy of high-redshift supernovae from the essence project: the  first two years	we present the results of spectroscopic observations of targets discoveredduring the first two years of the essence project. the goal of essence is touse a sample of ~200 type ia supernovae (sne ia) at moderate redshifts (0.2 &lt; z&lt; 0.8) to place constraints on the equation of state of the universe.spectroscopy not only provides the redshifts of the objects, but also confirmsthat some of the discoveries are indeed sne ia. this confirmation is criticalto the project, as techniques developed to determine luminosity distances tosne ia depend upon the knowledge that the objects at high redshift are the sameas the ones at low redshift. we describe the methods of target selection andprioritization, the telescopes and detectors, and the software used to identifyobjects. the redshifts deduced from spectral matching of high-redshift sne iawith low-redshift sne ia are consistent with those determined from host-galaxyspectra. we show that the high-redshift sne ia match well with low-redshifttemplates. we include all spectra obtained by the essence project, including 52sne ia, 5 core-collapse sne, 12 active galactic nuclei, 19 galaxies, 4 possiblyvariable stars, and 16 objects with uncertain identifications.

astro-ph;0508681	hubble space telescope observations of nine high-redshift essence  supernovae	we present broad-band light curves of nine supernovae ranging in redshiftfrom 0.5 to 0.8. the supernovae were discovered as part of the essence project,and the light curves are a combination of cerro tololo 4-m and hubble spacetelescope (hst) photometry. on the basis of spectra and/or light-curve fitting,eight of these objects are definitely type ia supernovae, while theclassification of one is problematic. the essence project is a five-yearendeavor to discover about 200 high-redshift type ia supernovae, with the goalof tightly constraining the time average of the equation-of-state parameter [w= p/(rho c^2)] of the "dark energy." to help minimize our systematic errors,all of our ground-based photometry is obtained with the same telescope andinstrument. in 2003 the highest-redshift subset of essence supernovae wasselected for detailed study with hst. here we present the first photometricresults of the survey. we find that all but one of the essence sne have slowlydeclining light curves, and the sample is not representative of thelow-redshift set of essence type ia supernovae. this is unlikely to be a signof evolution in the population. we attribute the decline-rate distribution ofhst events to a selection bias at the high-redshift edge of our sample and findthat such a bias will infect other magnitude-limited sn ia searches unlessappropriate precautions are taken.

astro-ph;0510089	using line profiles to test the fraternity of type ia supernovae at high  and low redshifts	using archival data of low-redshift (z &lt; 0.01) type ia supernovae (sn ia) andrecent observations of high-redshift (0.16 &lt; z &lt;0.64; matheson et al. 2005) snia, we study the "uniformity'' of the spectroscopic properties of nearby anddistant sn ia. we find no difference in the measures we describe here. in thispaper, we base our analysis solely on line-profile morphology, focusing onmeasurements of the velocity location of maximum absorption (vabs) and peakemission (vpeak). we find that the evolution of vabs and vpeak for our samplelines (ca ii 3945, si ii 6355, and s ii 5454, 5640) is similar for both thelow- and high-redshift samples. we find that vabs for the weak s ii 5454, 5640lines, and vpeak for s ii 5454, can be used to identify fast-declining [dm15 &gt;1.7] sn ia, which are also subluminous. in addition, we give the first directevidence in two high-z sn ia spectra of a double-absorption feature in ca ii3945, an event also observed, though infrequently, in low-redshift sn iaspectra (6/22 sn ia in our local sample). we report for the first time theunambiguous and systematic intrinsic blueshift of peak emission of opticalp-cygni line profiles in type ia spectra, by as much as 8000 km/s. all thehigh-z sn ia analyzed in this paper were discovered and followed up by theessence collaboration, and are now publicly available.

astro-ph;0602163	evidence for a supernova associated with the x-ray flash 020903	we present ground-based and hubble space telescope optical observations ofthe x-ray flash (xrf) 020903, covering 300 days. the afterglow showed a veryrapid rise in the first day, followed by a relatively slow decay in the nextfew days. there was a clear bump in the light curve after ~25 days, accompaniedby a drastic change in the spectral energy distribution. the light curve andthe spectral energy distribution are naturally interpreted as the emergence --and subsequent decay -- of a supernova (sn), similar to sn 1998bw. at peakluminosity, the sn is estimated to be 0.8 +/- 0.1 mag fainter than sn1998bw.this argues in favor of the existence of a supernova associated with this x-rayflash. a spectrum obtained 35 days after the burst shows emission lines fromthe host galaxy. we use this spectrum to put an upper limit on the oxygenabundance of the host at [o/h] &lt; -0.6 dex. we also discuss a possible trendbetween the softness of several bursts and the early behavior of the opticalafterglow, in the sense that xrfs and x-ray rich grbs seem to have a plateauphase or even a rising light curve. this can be naturally explained in modelswhere xrfs are similar to grbs but seen off the jet axis.

astro-ph;0611295	the peculiar sn 2005hk: do some type ia supernovae explode as  deflagrations?	we present extensive u'g'r'i'bvriyjhks photometry and optical spectroscopy ofsn 2005hk. these data reveal that sn 2005hk was nearly identical in itsobserved properties to sn 2002cx, which has been called ``the most peculiarknown type ia supernova.'' both supernovae exhibited high ionization sn1991t-like pre-maximum spectra, yet low peak luminosities like sn 1991bg. thespectra reveal that sn 2005hk, like sn 2002cx, exhibited expansion velocitiesthat were roughly half those of typical type ia supernovae. the r and i lightcurves of both supernovae were also peculiar in not displaying the secondarymaximum observed for normal type ia supernovae. our yjh photometry of sn 2005hkreveals the same peculiarity in the near-infrared. by combining our optical andnear-infrared photometry of sn 2005hk with published ultraviolet light curvesobtained with the swift satellite, we are able to construct a bolometric lightcurve from ~10 days before to ~60 days after b maximum. the shape and unusuallylow peak luminosity of this light curve, plus the low expansion velocities andabsence of a secondary maximum at red and near-infrared wavelengths, are all inreasonable agreement with model calculations of a 3d deflagration whichproduces ~0.25 m_sun of 56ni.

0811.4424	spectroscopy of high-redshift supernovae from the essence project: the  first four years	we present the results of spectroscopic observations from the essencehigh-redshift supernova (sn) survey during its first four years of operation.this sample includes spectra of all sne ia whose light curves were presented bymiknaitis et al. (2007) and used in the cosmological analyses of davis et al.(2007) and wood-vasey et al. (2007). the sample represents 273 hours ofspectroscopic observations with 6.5 - 10-m-class telescopes of objects detectedand selected for spectroscopy by the essence team. we present 174 spectra of156 objects. combining this sample with that of matheson et al. (2005), we havea total sample of 329 spectra of 274 objects. from this, we are able tospectroscopically classify 118 type ia sne. as the survey has matured, theefficiency of classifying sne ia has remained constant while we have observedboth higher-redshift sne ia and sne ia farther from maximum brightness.examining the subsample of sne ia with host-galaxy redshifts shows thatredshifts derived from only the sn ia spectra are consistent with redshiftsfound from host-galaxy spectra. moreover, the phases derived from only the snia spectra are consistent with those derived from light-curve fits. bycomparing our spectra to local templates, we find that the rate of objectssimilar to the overluminous sn 1991t and the underluminous sn 1991bg in oursample are consistent with that of the local sample. we do note, however, thatwe detect no object spectroscopically or photometrically similar to sn 1991bg.although systematic effects could reduce the high-redshift rate we expect basedon the low-redshift surveys, it is possible that sn 1991bg-like sne ia are lessprevalent at high redshift.
