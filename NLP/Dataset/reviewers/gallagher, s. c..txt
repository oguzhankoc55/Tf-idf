0902.0951	x-ray insights into the physics of mini-bal quasar outflows	we examine the uv and x-ray properties of 256 radio-quiet sdss quasars (qsos)observed in x-rays with chandra and/or xmm-newton in order to study therelationship between qsos with broad civ absorption lines (bals; width &gt;2000km/s) and those with civ mini-bals (here defined to have widths of 1000--2000km/s). our sample includes 42 bal and 48 mini-bal qsos. the relative x-raybrightness and hard spectral slopes of the mini-bal population are, on average,intermediate between those of bal and non-bal qsos, as might be expected ifnarrower and broader absorption line outflows are physically related. however,a significant population of mini-bals has outflow velocities higher than wouldbe expected for bal qsos of the same relative x-ray brightness. consistenlystrong x-ray absorption is apparently not required to accelerate at least somemini-bals to high outflow velocities. assuming the mini-bal features arecorrectly attributed to intrinsic civ absorption, we suggest that theirobserved properties may be explained if mini-bals are "seeds" which can beaccelerated to form bals when sufficient x-ray shielding is present.  we also examine several qsos with broad civ absorption that have beenrecently reported to be unusually x-ray bright. such cases are frequentlymini-bal qsos, which as a population are generally brighter in x-rays than balqsos. pointed xmm-newton observations also suggest that these sources (orunresolved neighbors) may have been previously observed in a high flux state.

0706.4461	the infrared properties of hickson compact groups	compact groups of galaxies provide a unique environment to study themechanisms by which star formation occurs amid continuous gravitationalencounters. we present 2mass (jhk), spitzer irac (3.5-8 micron) and mips (24micron) observations of a sample of twelve hickson compact groups (hcgs 2, 7,16, 19, 22, 31, 42, 48, 59, 61, 62, and 90) that includes a total of 45galaxies. the near-infrared colors of the sample galaxies are largelyconsistent with being dominated by slightly reddened normal stellarpopulations. galaxies that have the most significant pah and/or hot dustemission (as inferred from excess 8 micron flux) also tend to have largeramounts of extinction and/or k-band excess and stronger 24 micron emission, allof which suggest ongoing star formation activity. we separate the twelve hcgsin our sample into three types based on the ratio of the group hi mass todynamical mass. we find evidence that galaxies in the most gas-rich groups tendto be the most actively star forming. galaxies in the most gas-poor groups tendto be tightly clustered around a narrow range in colors consistent with theintegrated light from a normal stellar population. we interpret these trends asindicating that galaxies in gas-rich groups experience star formation and/ornuclear actively until their neutral gas consumed, stripped, or ionized. thegalaxies in this sample exhibit a ``gap'' between gas-rich and gas-poor groupsin infrared color space that is sparsely populated and not seen in the spitzerfirst look survey sample. this gap may suggest a rapid evolution of galaxyproperties in response to dynamical effects. these results suggest that theglobal properties of the groups and the local properties of the galaxies areconnected.

1002.3323	hierarchical structure formation and modes of star formation in hickson  compact group 31	the handful of low-mass, late-type galaxies that comprise hickson compactgroup 31 is in the midst of complex, ongoing gravitational interactions,evocative of the process of hierarchical structure formation at higherredshifts. with sensitive, multicolor hubble space telescope imaging, wecharacterize the large population of &lt;10 myr old star clusters that suffuse thesystem. from the colors and luminosities of the young star clusters, we findthat the galaxies in hcg 31 follow the same universal scaling relations asactively star-forming galaxies in the local universe despite the unusualcompact group environment. furthermore, the specific frequency of the globularcluster system is consistent with the low end of galaxies of comparable masseslocally. this, combined with the large mass of neutral hydrogen and tightconstraints on the amount of intragroup light, indicate that the group isundergoing its first epoch of interaction-induced star formation. in both themain galaxies and the tidal-dwarf candidate, f, stellar complexes, which aresensitive to the magnitude of disk turbulence, have both sizes and masses morecharacteristic of z=1-2 galaxies. after subtracting the light from compactsources, we find no evidence for an underlying old stellar population in f --it appears to be a truly new structure. the low velocity dispersion of thesystem components, available reservoir of hi, and current star formation rateof ~10 solar masses per year, indicate that hcg31 is likely to both exhaust itscold gas supply and merge within ~1 gyr. we conclude that the end product willbe an isolated, x-ray-faint, low-mass elliptical.

1003.5600	the evolution of quasar civ and siiv broad absorption lines over  multi-year time scales	we investigate the variability of civ 1549a broad absorption line (bal)troughs over rest-frame time scales of up to ~7 yr in 14 quasars at redshiftsz&gt;2.1. for 9 sources at sufficiently high redshift, we also compare civ andsiiv 1400a absorption variation. we compare shorter- and longer-termvariability using spectra from up to four different epochs per source and findcomplex patterns of variation in the sample overall. the scatter in the changeof absorption equivalent width (ew), delta ew, increases with the time betweenobservations. bals do not, in general, strengthen or weaken monotonically, andvariation observed over shorter (&lt;months) time scales is not predictive ofmulti-year variation. we find no evidence for asymmetry in the distribution ofdelta ew that would indicate that bals form and decay on different time scales,and we constrain the typical bal lifetime to be &gt;~30 yr. the bal absorption forone source, lbqs 0022+0150, has weakened and may now be classified as amini-bal. another source, 1235+1453, shows evidence of variable, blue continuumemission that is relatively unabsorbed by the bal outflow. civ and siiv balshape changes are related in at least some sources. given their highvelocities, bal outflows apparently traverse large spatial regions and mayinteract with parsec-scale structures such as an obscuring torus. assuming baloutflows are launched from a rotating accretion disk, notable azimuthalsymmetry is required in the outflow to explain the relatively small changesobserved in velocity structure over times up to 7 yr.

1007.3523	galaxy evolution in a complex environment: a multi-wavelength study of  hcg 7	[abridged] the environment where galaxies are found heavily influences theirevolution. close groupings, like the cores of galaxy clusters or compactgroups, evolve in ways far more dramatic than their isolated counterparts. wehave conducted a multiwavelength study of hcg7, consisting of four giantgalaxies: 3 spirals and 1 lenticular. we use hubble space telescope (hst)imaging to identify and characterize the young and old star clusterpopulations. we find young massive clusters (ymc) mostly in the three spirals,while the lenticular features a large, unimodal population of globular clusters(gc) but no detectable clusters with ages less than ~gyr. the spatial andapproximate age distributions of the ~300 ymcs and ~150 gcs thus hint at aregular star formation history in the group over a hubble time. while at firstglance the hst data show the galaxies as undisturbed, our deep ground-based,wide-field imaging that extends the hst coverage reveals faint signatures ofstellar material in the intra-group medium. we do not detect the intra-groupmedium in hi or chandra x-ray observations, signatures that would be expectedto arise from major mergers. we find that the hi gas content of the individualgalaxies and the group as a whole are a third of the expected abundance. theappearance of quiescence is challenged by spectroscopy that reveals an intenseionization continuum in one galaxy nucleus, and post-burst characteristics inanother. our spectroscopic survey of dwarf galaxy members yields one dwarfelliptical in an apparent tidal feature. we therefore suggest an evolutionaryscenario for hcg7, whereby the galaxies convert most of their available gasinto stars without major mergers and result in a dry merger. as the conditionsgoverning compact groups are reminiscent of galaxies at intermediate redshift,we propose that hcgs are appropriate for studying galaxy evolution at z~1-2.

1011.2282	unification of luminous type 1 quasars through civ emission	using a sample of 30,000 quasars from sdss-dr7, we explore the range ofproperties exhibited by high-ionization, broad emission lines, such as civ1549. specifically we investigate the anti-correlation between l_uv andemission line eqw (the baldwin effect) and the "blueshifting" ofhigh-ionization emission lines. the blueshift of the civ emission line isnearly ubiquitous, with a mean shift of 810 km/s for radio-quiet (rq) quasarsand 360 km/s for radio-loud (rl) quasars, and the baldwin effect is present inboth rq and rl samples. composite spectra are constructed as a function of civemission line properties in attempt to reveal empirical relationships betweendifferent line species and the sed. within a two-component disk+wind model ofthe broad emission line region (belr), where the wind filters the continuumseen by the disk component, we find that rl quasars are consistent with beingdominated by the disk component, while balqsos are consistent with beingdominated by the wind component. some rq objects have emission line featuressimilar to rl quasars; they may simply have insufficient black hole (bh) spinto form radio jets. our results suggest that there could be significantsystematic errors in the determination of l_bol and bh mass that make itdifficult to place these findings in a more physical context. however, it ispossible to classify quasars in a paradigm where the diversity of belrparameters are due to differences in an accretion disk wind between quasars(and over time); these differences are underlain primarily by the sed, whichultimately must be tied to bh mass and accretion rate.

1101.5393	star clusters in the tidal tails of interacting galaxies: cluster  populations across a variety of tail environments	we have searched for compact stellar structures within 17 tidal tails in 13different interacting galaxies using f606w- and f814w- band images from thewide field planetary camera 2 (wfpc2) on the hubble space telescope (hst). thesample of tidal tails includes a diverse population of optical properties,merging galaxy mass ratios, hi content, and ages. combining our tail samplewith knierman et al. (2003), we find evidence of star clusters formed in situwith mv &lt; -8.5 and v-i &lt; 2.0 in 10 of 23 tidal tails; we are able to identifycluster candidates to mv = -6.5 in the closest tails. three tails offer clearexamples of "beads on a string" star formation morphology in v-i color maps.two tails present both tidal dwarf galaxy (tdg) candidates and clustercandidates. statistical diagnostics indicate that clusters in tidal tails maybe drawn from the same power-law luminosity functions (with logarithmic slopes~ -2 - -2.5) found in quiescent spiral galaxies and the interiors ofinteracting systems. we find that the tail regions with the largest number ofobservable clusters are relatively young (&lt; 250 myr old) and bright (v &lt; 24 magarcsec^(-2)), probably attributed to the strong bursts of star formation ininteracting systems soon after periapse. otherwise, we find no statisticaldifference between cluster-rich and cluster-poor tails in terms of manyobservable characteristics, though this analysis suffers from complex,unresolved gas dynamics and projection effects.

1105.5840	star clusters as tracers of interactions in stephan's quintet (hickson  compact group 92)	stephan's quintet (sq) is a compact group of galaxies that exhibits numeroussigns of interactions between its members. using high resolution images of sqin b438, v606, and i814 bands from the early release science project obtainedwith the wide field camera 3 on the hubble space telescope, we identify 496star cluster candidates (sccs), located throughout the galaxies themselves aswell as in intergalactic regions. our photometry goes \sim2 mag deeper andcovers an additional three regions, the old tail, ngc 7317, and the southerndebris region, compared to previous work. through comparison of the b438 - v606and v606 - i814 colors of the star cluster candidates with simple stellarpopulation synthesis models we are able to constrain cluster ages. inparticular, the most massive galaxy of sq, ngc 7319, exhibits continuous starformation throughout its history, although at a lower rate over the past fewtens of myr. ngc 7318 a/b and the northern star burst region both show ongoingactive star formation; there are a number of star clusters that are youngerthan 10 myr. ngc 7318 a/b also features a peculiar gap in the colordistribution of the star clusters that can be used to date the onset of therecent burst. the majority of the sccs detected in the young tail were formed150-200 myr ago whereas the tight distribution of star cluster colors in theold tail, allow us to constrain its age of formation to \sim400 myr ago. thestar clusters in the southern debris region are seemingly divided into twogroups with ages of 50 and \sim500 myr and virtually all of the sccs detectedin ngc 7317 are over 2 gyr old. based on these ages, we estimate time intervalsfor the interactions between sq members that triggered the massive star clusterformation.

1109.1515	civ emission and the ultraviolet through x-ray spectral energy  distribution of radio-quiet quasars	in the restframe uv, two of the parameters that best characterize the rangeof emission-line properties in quasar broad emission-line regions are theequivalent width and the blueshift of the civ line relative to the quasar restframe. we explore the connection between these emission-line properties and theuv through x-ray spectral energy distribution (sed) for radio-quiet (rq)quasars. our sample consists of a heterogeneous compilation of 406 quasars fromthe sloan digital sky survey and palomar-green survey that have well-measuredciv emission-line and x-ray properties (including 164 objects with measuredgamma). we find that rq quasars with both strong civ emission and small civblueshifts can be classified as "hard-spectrum" sources that are (relatively)strong in the x-ray as compared to the uv. on the other hand, rq quasars withboth weak civ emission and large civ blueshifts are instead "soft-spectrum"sources that are (relatively) weak in the x-ray as compared to the uv. thiswork helps to further bridge optical/soft x-ray "eigenvector 1" relationshipsto the uv and hard x-ray. based on these findings, we argue that future workshould consider systematic errors in bolometric corrections (and thus accretionrates) that are derived from a single mean sed. detailed analysis of the civemission line may allow for sed-dependent corrections to these quantities.

1110.0501	the merger history, agn and dwarf galaxies of hickson compact group 59	compact group galaxies often appear unaffected by their unusually denseenvironment. closer examination can, however, reveal the subtle, cumulativeeffects of multiple galaxy interactions. hickson compact group (hcg) 59 is anexcellent example of this situation. we present a photometric study of thisgroup in the optical (hst), infrared (spitzer) and x-ray (chandra) regimesaimed at characterizing the star formation and nuclear activity in itsconstituent galaxies and intra-group medium. we associate five dwarf galaxieswith the group and update the velocity dispersion, leading to an increase inthe dynamical mass of the group of up to a factor of 10 (to 2.8e13 msun), and asubsequent revision of its evolutionary stage. star formation is proceeding ata level consistent with the morphological types of the four main galaxies, ofwhich two are star-forming and the other two quiescent. unlike in some othercompact groups, star-forming complexes across hcg 59 closely follow mass-radiusscaling relations typical of nearby galaxies. in contrast, the ancient globularcluster populations in galaxies hcg 59a and b show intriguing irregularities,and two extragalactic hii regions are found just west of b. we age-date a faintstellar stream in the intra-group medium at ~1 gyr to examine recentinteractions. we detect a likely low-luminosity agn in hcg 59a by its ~10e40erg/s x-ray emission; the active nucleus rather than star formation can accountfor the uv+ir sed. we discuss the implications of our findings in the contextof galaxy evolution in dense environments.

1202.4681	sweeping away the mysteries of dusty continuous winds in agn	an integral part of the unified model for active galactic nuclei (agns) is anaxisymmetric obscuring medium, which is commonly depicted as a torus of gas anddust surrounding the central engine. however, a robust, dynamical model of thetorus is required in order to understand the fundamental physics of agns andinterpret their observational signatures. here we explore self-similar, dustydisk-winds, driven by both magnetocentrifugal forces and radiation pressure, asan explanation for the torus. using these models, we make predictions of agninfrared (ir) spectral energy distributions (seds) from 2-100 microns byvarying parameters such as: the viewing angle; the base column density of thewind; the eddington ratio; the black hole mass; and the amount of power in theinput spectrum emitted in the x-ray relative to that emitted in the uv/optical.we find that models with n_h,0 = 10^25 cm^-2, l/l_edd = 0.1, and m_bh &gt;= 10^8msun are able to adequately approximate the general shape and amount of powerexpected in the ir as observed in a composite of optically luminous sloandigital sky survey (sdss) quasars. the effect of varying the relative powercoming out in x-rays relative to the uv is a change in the emission below ~5micron from the hottest dust grains; this arises from the differingcontributions to heating and acceleration of uv and x-ray photons. we see massoutflows ranging from ~1-4 msun/yr, terminal velocities ranging from ~1900-8000km/s, and kinetic luminosities ranging from ~1x10^42-8x10^43 erg/s. furtherdevelopment of this model holds promise for using specific features of observedir spectra in agns to infer fundamental physical parameters of the systems.

1303.7142	why a windy torus?	mass ejection in the form of winds or jets appears to be as fundamental toquasar activity as accretion, and can be directly observed in many objects withbroadened and blue-shifted uv absorption features. a convincing argument forradiation pressure driving this ionized outflow can be made within the dustsublimation radius. beyond, radiation pressure is even more important, as highenergy photons from the central engine can now push on dust grains. thisphysics underlies the dusty-wind model for the putative obscuring torus.specifically, the dusty wind in our model is first launched from the outeraccretion disk as a magneto-centrifugal wind and then accelerated and shaped byradiation pressure from the central continuum. such a wind can plausiblyaccount for both the necessary obscuring medium to explain the ratio ofbroad-to-narrow-line objects and the mid-infrared emission commonly seen inquasar spectral energy distributions. a convincing demonstration thatlarge-scale, organized magnetic fields are present in radio-quiet activegalactic nuclei is now required to bolster the case for this paradigm.

1312.0706	shocks and star formation in stephan's quintet. i. gemini spectroscopy  of h{\alpha}-bright knots	we present a gemini-gmos spectroscopic study of hst-selectedh{\alpha}-emitting regions in stephan's quintet (hcg 92), a nearby compactgalaxy group, with the aim of disentangling the processes of shock-inducedheating and star formation in its intra-group medium. the $\approx$40 sourcesare distributed across the system, but most densely concentrated in the$\sim$kpc-long shock region. their spectra neatly divide them into narrow- andand broad-line emitters, and we decompose the latter into three or moreemission peaks corresponding to spatial elements discernible in hst imaging.the emission line ratios of the two populations of h{\alpha}-emitters confirmtheir nature as h ii regions (90% of the sample) or molecular gas heated by ashock-front propagating at $\lesssim$300 km/s. their redshift distributionreveals interesting three-dimensional structure with respect to gas-phasebaryons, with no h ii regions associated with shocked gas, no shocked regionsin the intruder galaxy ngc 7318b, and a sharp boundary between shocks and starformation. we conclude that star formation is inhibited substantially, if notentirely, in the shock region. attributing those h ii regions projected againstthe shock to the intruder, we find a lopsided distribution of star formation inthis galaxy, reminiscent of pile-up regions in models of interacting galaxies.the h{\alpha} luminosities imply mass outputs, star formation rates, andefficiencies similar to nearby star-forming regions. two large knots are anexception to this, being comparable in stellar output to the prolific 30doradus region. we also examine stephan's quintet in the context of compactgalaxy group evolution, as a paradigm for intermittent star formation historiesin the presence of a rich, x-ray emitting intra-group medium.

1312.0974	characterizing quasars in the mid-infrared: high signal-to-noise  spectral templates	mid-infrared (mir) quasar spectra exhibit a suite of emission featuresincluding high ionization coronal lines from the narrow line region illuminatedby the ionizing continuum, broad dust bumps from silicates and graphites, andpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) features from star formation in the hostgalaxy. however, in spitzer infared spectrograph (irs) data, few features aredetected in most individual spectra because of typically low signal-to-noiseratios (s/n). by generating spectral composites from over 180 irs observationsof sloan digital sky survey broad-line quasars, we boost the s/n and revealfeatures in the complex spectra that are otherwise lost in the noise. inaddition to an overall composite, we generate composites in three differentluminosity bins that span the range of 5.6 micron luminosities of10$^{40}$--10$^{46}$ (erg~s$^{-1}$). we detect the high-ionization, forbiddenemission lines of [siv], [oiv], and [nev] 14 micron in all templates and pahfeatures in all but the most luminous template. ratios of lines with a range ofionization potentials show no evidence for a strong difference in the shape ofthe 41--97 ev ionizing continuum over this range of luminosities. the scalingof the emission-line luminosities as a function of continuum luminosity isconsistent with what is expected, and shows no indication of a ``disappearingnarrow-line region.'' the broad 10 and 18 micron silicate features in emissionincrease in strength with increasing luminosity, and a broad 3--5 micron blackbody consistent with graphite emission at 750 k is evident in the highestluminosity template. we find that the intrinsic quasar continua for allluminosity templates are consistent; apparent differences arise primarily fromhost galaxy contamination most evident at low luminosity.

1403.3856	a $chandra-swift$ view of point sources in hickson compact groups: high  agn fraction but a dearth of strong agns	we present $chandra$ x-ray point source catalogs for 9 hickson compact groups(hcgs, 37 galaxies) at distances $34 - 89$ mpc. we perform detailed x-ray pointsource detection and photometry, and interpret the point source population bymeans of simulated hardness ratios. we thus estimate x-ray luminosities ($l_x$)for all sources, most of which are too weak for reliable spectral fitting. forall sources, we provide catalogs with counts, count rates, power-law indices($\gamma$), hardness ratios, and $l_x$, in the full ($0.5-8.0$ kev), soft($0.5-2.0$ kev) and hard ($2.0-8.0$ kev) bands. we use optical emission-lineratios from the literature to re-classify 24 galaxies as star-forming,accreting onto a supermassive black hole (agns), transition objects, orlow-ionization nuclear emission regions (liners). two-thirds of our galaxieshave nuclear x-ray sources with $swift$/uvot counterparts. two nuclei have$l_{x,{\rm 0.5-8.0 kev}}$~$ &gt; 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, are strongmulti-wavelength agns and follow the known $\alpha_{\rm ox}-\nu l_{\nu,\rm nearuv}$ correlation for strong agns. otherwise, most nuclei are x-ray faint,consistent with either a low-luminosity agn or a nuclear x-ray binarypopulation, and fall in the "non-agn locus" in $\alpha_{\rm ox}-\nu l_{\nu,\rmnear uv}$ space, which also hosts other, normal, galaxies. our results suggestthat hcg x-ray nuclei in high specific star formation rate spiral galaxies arelikely dominated by star formation, while those with low specific starformation rates in earlier types likely harbor a weak agn. the agn fraction inhcg galaxies with $m_r \le -20$ and $l_{x,{\rm 0.5-8.0 kev}} \ge 10^{41}$ ergs$^{-1}$ is $0.08^{+0.35}_{-0.01}$, somewhat higher than the $\sim 5%$ fractionin galaxy clusters.

1502.00735	tracing quasar narrow-line regions across redshift: a library of high  s/n optical spectra	in a single optical spectrum, the quasar narrow-line region (nlr) reveals lowdensity, photoionized gas in the host galaxy interstellar medium, while theimmediate vicinity of the central engine generates the accretion disk continuumand broad emission lines. to isolate these two components, we construct alibrary of high s/n optical composite spectra created from the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss-dr7). we divide the sample into bins of continuum luminosityand hbeta fwhm that are used to construct median composites at differentredshift steps up to 0.75. we measure the luminosities of the narrow-emissionlines [nev]3427, [neiii]3870, [oiii]5007, and [oii]3728 with ionizationpotentials (ips) of 97, 40, 35, and 13.6 ev respectively. the high ip lines'luminosities show no evidence of increase with redshift consistent with noevolution in the agn sed or the host galaxy ism illuminated by the continuum.in contrast, we find that the [oii] line becomes stronger at higher redshifts,and we interpret this as a consequence of enhanced star formation contributingto the [oii] emission in host galaxies at higher redshifts. the sfrs estimatedfrom the [oii] luminosities show a flatter increase with z than non-agngalaxies given our assumed agn contribution to the [oii] luminosity. finally,we confirm an inverse correlation between the strength of the feii4570 complexand both the [oiii] ew (though not the luminosity) and the width of the hbetaline as known from the eigenvector 1 correlations.

1503.05278	a comprehensive hst bvi catalogue of star clusters in five hickson  compact groups of galaxies	we present a photometric catalogue of star cluster candidates in hicksoncompact groups (hcgs) 7, 31, 42, 59, and 92, based on observations with theadvanced camera for surveys and the wide field camera 3 on the hubble spacetelescope. the catalogue contains precise cluster positions (right ascensionand declination), magnitudes, and colours in the bvi filters. the number ofdetected sources ranges from 2200 to 5600 per group, from which we constructthe high-confidence sample by applying a number of criteria designed to reduceforeground and background contaminants. furthermore, the high-confidencecluster candidates for each of the 16 galaxies in our sample are split into twosub-populations: one that may contain young star clusters and one that isdominated by globular older clusters. the ratio of young star cluster toglobular cluster candidates varies from group to group, from equal numbers tothe extreme of hcg 31 which has a ratio of 8 to 1, due to a recent starburstinduced by interactions in the group. we find that the number of blue clusterswith $m_v &lt; -9$ correlates well with the current star formation rate in anindividual galaxy, while the number of globular cluster candidates with $m_v &lt;-7.8$ correlates well (though with large scatter) with the stellar mass.analyses of the high-confidence sample presented in this paper show that starclusters can be successfully used to infer the gross star formation history ofthe host groups and therefore determine their placement in a proposedevolutionary sequence for compact galaxy groups.

0705.2213	chandra stacking constraints on the contribution of 24 micron spitzer  sources to the unresolved cosmic x-ray background	we employ x-ray stacking techniques to examine the contribution from x-rayundetected, mid-infrared-selected sources to the unresolved, hard (6-8 kev)cosmic x-ray background (cxb). we use the publicly available, 24 micron spitzerspace telescope mips catalogs from the great observatories origins deep survey(goods) - north and south fields, which are centered on the 2 ms chandra deepfield-north and the 1 ms chandra deep field-south, to identify bright (s_24 &gt;80 microjy) mid-infrared sources that may be powered by heavily obscured agns.we measure a significant stacked x-ray signal in all of the x-ray bandsexamined, including, for the first time, a significant (3.2 sigma) 6-8 kevstacked x-ray signal from an x-ray undetected source population. we find thatthe x-ray-undetected mips sources make up about 2% (or less) of the total cxbbelow 6 kev, but about 6% in the 6-8 kev band. the 0.5-8 kev stacked x-rayspectrum is consistent with a hard power-law (gamma = 1.44 +/- 0.07), with thespectrum hardening at higher x-ray energies. our findings show that thesebright mips sources do contain obscured agns, but are not the primary source ofthe unresolved 50% of 6-8 kev cxb. our study rules out obscured, luminous qsosas a significant source of the remaining unresolved cxb and suggests that itmost likely arises from a large population of obscured, high-redshift (z &gt; 1),seyfert-luminosity agns.

1505.01161	ultraviolet/x-ray variability and the extended x-ray emission of the  radio-loud broad absorption line quasar pg 1004+130	we present the results of recent chandra, xmm-newton, and hubble spacetelescope observations of the radio-loud (rl), broad absorption line (bal)quasar pg 1004+130. we compare our new observations to archival x-ray and uvdata, creating the most comprehensive, high signal-to-noise, multi-epoch,spectral monitoring campaign of a rl bal quasar to date. we probe forvariability of the x-ray absorption, the uv bal, and the x-ray jet, onmonth-year timescales. the x-ray absorber has a low column density of$n_{h}=8\times10^{20}-4\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ when it is assumed to be fullycovering the x-ray emitting region, and its properties do not varysignificantly between the 4 observations. this suggests the observed absorptionis not related to the typical "shielding gas" commonly invoked in bal quasarmodels, but is likely due to material further from the central black hole. incontrast, the civ bal shows strong variability. the equivalent width (ew) in2014 is ew=11.24$\pm$0.56 \aa, showing a fractional increase of $\delta ew /\langle ew \rangle$=1.16$\pm$0.11 from the 2003 observation, 3183 days earlierin the rest-frame. this places pg 1004+130 among the most highly variable balquasars. by combining chandra observations we create an exposure 2.5 timesdeeper than studied previously, with which to investigate the nature of thex-ray jet and extended diffuse x-ray emission. an x-ray knot, likely with asynchrotron origin, is detected in the radio jet ~8 arcsec (30 kpc) from thecentral x-ray source with a spatial extent of ~4 arcsec (15 kpc). no similarx-ray counterpart to the counterjet is detected. asymmetric, non-thermaldiffuse x-ray emission, likely due to inverse compton scattering of cosmicmicrowave background photons, is also detected.

1505.04219	investigating the structure of the windy torus in quasars	thermal mid-infrared emission of quasars requires an obscuring structure thatcan be modeled as a magneto-hydrodynamic wind in which radiation pressure ondust shapes the outflow. we have taken the dusty wind models presented bykeating and collaborators that generated quasar mid-infrared spectral energydistributions (seds), and explored their properties (such as geometry, openingangle, and ionic column densities) as a function of eddington ratio and x-rayweakness. in addition, we present new models with a range of magnetic fieldstrengths and column densities of the dust-free shielding gas interior to thedusty wind. we find this family of models -- with input parameters tuned toaccurately match the observed mid-ir power in quasar seds -- providesreasonable values of the type 1 fraction of quasars and the column densities ofwarm absorber gas, though it does not explain a purely luminosity-dependentcovering fraction for either. furthermore, we provide predictions of thecumulative distribution of e(b-v) values of quasars from extinction by the windand the shape of the wind as imaged in the mid-infrared. within the frameworkof this model, we predict that the strength of the near-infrared bump from hotdust emission will be correlated primarily with l/l_edd rather than luminosityalone, with scatter induced by the distribution of magnetic field strengths.the empirical successes and shortcomings of these models warrant furtherinvestigations into the composition and behaviour of dust and the nature ofmagnetic fields in the vicinity of actively accreting supermassive black holes.

1507.07247	constraining felobal outflows from absorption line variability	felobals are a rare class of quasar outflows with low-ionization broadabsorption lines (bals), large column densities, and potentially large kineticenergies that might be important for `feedback' to galaxy evolution. in orderto probe the physical properties of these outflows, we conducted amultiple-epoch, absorption line variability study of 12 felobal quasarsspanning a redshift range between 0.7 and 1.9 over rest frame time-scales ofapproximately 10 d to 7.6 yr. we detect absorption line variability withgreater than 8 sigma confidence in 3 out of the 12 sources in our sample overtime-scales of 0.6 to 7.6 yr. variable wavelength intervals are associated withground and excited state fe ii multiplets, the mg ii 2796, 2803 doublet, mg i2852, and excited state ni ii multiplets. the observed variability along withevidence of saturation in the absorption lines favors transverse motions of gasacross the line of sight (los) as the preferred scenario, and allows us toconstrain the outflow distance from the supermassive black hole (smbh) to beless than 69, 7, and 60 pc for our three variable sources. in combination withother studies, these results suggest that the outflowing gas in felobal quasarsresides on a range of scales and includes matter within tens of parsecs of thecentral source.

(2012) $l_x$ - star formation rate(sfr) correlation or have higher $l_x$ than predicted by this correlation fortheir sfr. we discuss how these "excesses" may be due to low metallicities andhigh interaction levels. for elliptical and s0 galaxies, after accounting foragns and nuclear sources, most cg galaxies are consistent with the boroson etal. (2011) $l_x$ - stellar mass correlation for low-mass xrbs, with largerscatter, likely due to residual effects such as agn activity or hot gas.assuming non-nuclear sources are low- or high-mass xrbs, we use appropriate xrbluminosity functions to estimate the probability that stochastic effects canlead to such extreme $l_x$ values. we find that, although stochastic effects donot in general appear to be important, for some galaxies there is a significantprobability that high $l_x$ values can be observed due to strong xrbvariability.

astro-ph;0306125	xmm-newton reveals the quasar outflow in pg 1115+080	we report on an observation of the broad absorption line (bal) quasar pg1115+080 performed with the xmm-newton observatory. spectral analysis revealsthe second case of a relativistic x-ray absorbing outflow in a bal quasar. thefirst case was revealed in a recent observation of apm 08279+5255 with thechandra x-ray observatory. the spectrum of pg1115+080 indicates the presence ofcomplex low-energy absorption in the 0.2-0.6 kev observed energy band andhigh-energy absorption in the 2-5 kev observed energy band. the high-energyabsorption is best modeled by two gaussian absorption lines with rest-frameenergies of 7.4 kev and 9.5 kev. assuming that these two lines are produced byresonant absorption due to fe xxv kalpha, we infer that the x-ray absorbers areoutflowing with velocities of ~0.10c and ~0.34c, respectively. we have detectedsignificant variability of the energies and widths of the x-ray bals in pg1115+080 and apm 08279+5255 over timescales of 19 and 1.8 weeks (proper-time),respectively. the bal variability observed from apm 08279+5255 supports ourearlier conclusion that these absorbers are most likely launched at relativelysmall radii of ~ 10^(16)(m_bh/m_8)^(1/2)cm. a comparison of the ionizationproperties and column densities of the low-energy and high-energy absorbersindicates that these absorbers are likely distinct; however, higher spectralresolution is needed to confirm this result. finally, we comment on prospectsfor constraining the kinematic and ionization properties of these x-ray balswith the next generation of x-ray observatories.

astro-ph;0311401	dramatic x-ray spectral variability of the broad absorption line quasar  pg2112+059	with a 1999 asca observation, pg2112+059 became notable as the first broadabsorption line (bal) quasar found to exhibit a typical radio-quiet quasarx-ray continuum underlying a large amount of intrinsic absorption. we present arecent chandra acis-s3 observation of pg2112+059 that demonstrates remarkablespectral and luminosity variability since that time. in addition to a decreasein the continuum normalization by a factor of ~3.5, the absorption columndensity has apparently increased substantially, and a strong feature in the fek alpha region has appeared. concurrent hst stis data compared with archivalhst data from earlier epochs show evidence for variability of the continuum (upto a factor of ~1.7 in the ultraviolet), and in some absorption features of theciv 1549 bal since 1992; however, the ovi bal structure is consistent with a1995 observation. we also present evidence for ly beta--ovi 1037.62 and lyalpha--nv 1242.80 line-locked absorption systems, supporting the assumptionthat ultraviolet line pressure is driving the bal outflow. whereas ultravioletbals typically exhibit only modest equivalent-width variability over timescalesof years, the dramatic x-ray variability of pg2112+059 suggests that x-rayspectral variability studies of bal quasars have great potential for probingthe physics of quasar winds.

astro-ph;0410641	x-ray insights into interpreting civ blueshifts and optical/uv continua	we present 0.5-8.0 kev chandra observations of six bright quasars thatrepresent extrema in quasar emission-line properties -- three quasars each withsmall and large blueshifts of the civ emission line with respect to thesystemic redshift of the quasars. supplemented with seven archival chandraobservations of quasars that met our selection criteria, we investigate theorigin of this emission-line phenomenon in the general context of the structureof quasars. we find that the quasars with the largest civ blueshifts showevidence, from joint-spectral fitting, for intrinsic x-ray absorption (n_h ~10^22 cm^-2). given the lack of accompanying civ absorption, this gas is likelyto be highly ionized, and may be identified with the shielding gas in thedisk-wind paradigm. furthermore, we find evidence for a correlation ofalpha_uv, the ultraviolet spectral index, with the hardness of the x-raycontinuum; an analysis of independent bright quasar survey data from theliterature supports this conclusion. this result points to intrinsically redquasars having systematically flatter hard x-ray continua without evidence forx-ray absorption. we speculate on the origins of these correlations of x-rayproperties with both civ blueshift and alpha_uv and discuss the implicationsfor models of quasar structure.

astro-ph;0509146	xmm-newton spectroscopy of the highly polarized and luminous broad  absorption line quasar cso 755	we present the results from xmm-newton observations of the highly opticallypolarized broad absorption line quasar (balqso) cso 755. by analyzing its x-rayspectrum with a total of ~3000 photons we find that this source has an x-raycontinuum of `typical' radio-quiet quasars, with a photon index ofgamma=1.83^{+0.07}_{-0.06}, and a rather flat (x-ray bright) intrinsicoptical-to-x-ray spectral slope of alpha_ox=-1.51. the source shows evidencefor intrinsic absorption, and fitting the spectrum with a neutral-absorptionmodel gives a column density of n_h~1.2x10^{22} cm^{-2}; this is among thelowest x-ray columns measured for balqsos. we do not detect, with highsignificance, any other absorption features in the x-ray spectrum. upper limitswe place on the rest-frame equivalent width of a neutral (ionized) fe ka line,&lt;=180 ev (&lt;=120 ev), and on the compton-reflection component parameter, r&lt;=0.2,suggest that most of the x-rays from the source are directly observed ratherthan being scattered or reflected; this is also supported by the relativelyflat intrinsic alpha_ox we measure. the possibility that most of the x-ray fluxis scattered due to the high level of uv-optical polarization is ruled out.considering data for 46 balqsos from the literature, including cso 755, we havefound that the uv-optical continuum polarization level of balqsos is notcorrelated with any of their x-ray properties. a lack of significant short- andlong-term x-ray flux variations in the source may be attributed to a largeblack-hole mass in cso 755. we note that another luminous balqso, pg 2112+059,has both similar shallow c iv bals and moderate x-ray absorption.

astro-ph;0509702	seyfert galaxies and the hard x-ray background: artificial chandra  observations of z = 0.3 active galaxies	deep x-ray surveys have resolved much of the x-ray background radiation below2 kev into discrete sources, but the background above 8 kev remains largelyunresolved. the obscured (type 2) active galactic nuclei (agns) that areexpected to dominate the hard x-ray background have not yet been detected insufficient numbers to account for the observed background flux. however, deepx-ray surveys have revealed large numbers of faint quiescent and starburstgalaxies at moderate redshifts. in hopes of recovering the missing agnpopulation, it has been suggested that the defining optical spectral featuresof low-luminosity seyfert nuclei at large distances may be overwhelmed by theirhost galaxies, causing them to appear optically quiescent in deep surveys. wetest this possibility by artificially redshifting a sample of 23 nearby,well-studied active galaxies to z = 0.3, testing them for x-ray agn signaturesand comparing them to the objects detected in deep x-ray surveys. we find thatthese redshifted galaxies have properties consistent with the deep field``normal'' and ``optically bright, x-ray faint'' (obxf) galaxy populations,supporting the hypothesis that the numbers of agns in deep x-ray surveys arebeing underestimated, and suggesting that obxfs should not be ruled out ascandidate agn hosts that could contribute to the hard x-ray background sourcepopulation.

astro-ph;0701076	stratified quasar winds: integrating x-ray and infrared views of broad  absorption line quasars	quasars are notable for the luminous power they emit across decades infrequency from the far-infrared through hard x-rays; emission at differentfrequencies emerges from physical scales ranging from aus to parsecs. eachwavelength regime thus offers a different line of sight into the central engineand a separate probe of outflowing material. therefore, obtaining a completeaccounting of the physical characteristics and kinetic power of quasar windsrequires a panchromatic approach. x-ray and infrared studies are particularlypowerful for covering the range of interesting physical scales and ionizationstates of the outflow. we present a stratified wind picture based on asynthesis of multiwavelength research programs designed to constrain the natureof mass ejection from radio-quiet quasars. this wind comprises three zones: thehighly ionized shielding gas, the uv broad absorption line wind, and the colddusty outflow. the primary launching mechanism for the wind likely varies ineach zone. while radiative acceleration on resonance lines dominates for the uvabsorbing wind, the shielding gas may instead be driven by magnetic forces.ultraviolet continuum radiative pressure, perhaps coupled with magneticlaunching, accelerates a dusty outflow that obscures the inner broad lineregion in unification schemes.

astro-ph;0702272	an investigation into the effects of luminosity on the mid-infrared  spectral energy distributions of radio-quiet quasars	we present an analysis of the effects of luminosity on the shape of themid-infrared spectral energy distributions (seds) of 234 radio-quiet quasarsoriginally presented by richards et al. in quasars without evident dustextinction, the spectrally integrated optical and infrared luminosities arelinearly correlated over nearly three decades in luminosity. we find asignificant (&gt;99.99% confidence) correlation between the 1.8-8.0 micronspectral index and infrared luminosity that indicates an enhancement of themid-infrared continuum with increasing luminosity. coupled with strong evidencefor spectral curvature in more luminous quasars, we conclude this trend islikely a manifestation of the `near-infrared (3-5 micron) bump' noticed inearlier quasar sed surveys. the strength of this feature is indicative of thecontribution of emission from the hottest (&gt;1000 k) dust to the mid-infraredspectrum; higher luminosity quasars tend to show more hot dust emission.finally, the comparable distribution of bolometric corrections from themonochromatic 3 micron luminosity as well as its lack of sensitivity to dustextinction as compared to the standard bolometric correction from nu*l_{5100a}suggest that the former may be a more robust indicator of bolometric quasarluminosity. the close link between the power in the mid-infrared and opticaland the effect of luminosity on the shape of the mid-infrared continuumindicate that considering mid-infrared emission independent of the propertiesof the quasar itself is inadequate for understanding the parsec-scale quasarenvironment.
