0905.2594	the iphas-poss-i proper motion survey of the galactic plane	we present a proper motion survey of the galactic plane, using iphas data andposs-i schmidt plate data as a first epoch, that probes down to proper motionsbelow 50 milliarcseconds per year. the iphas survey covers the northern plane($|b| &lt; 5^{\circ}$) with ccd photometry in the $r$, $i$ and h${\alpha}$passbands. we examine roughly 1400 sq. deg. of the iphas survey area and drawup a catalogue containing 103058 objects with significant proper motions below150 millarcseconds per year in the magnitude range 13.5$&lt; r' &lt;$19. our surveysample contains large samples of white dwarfs and subdwarfs which can beidentified using a reduced proper motion diagram. we also found several objectswith iphas colours suggesting h${\alpha}$ emission and significant propermotions. one is the known cataclysmic variable gd552; two are known db whitedwarfs and five others are found to be non-da (db and dc) white dwarfs, whichwere included in the h$\alpha$ emission line catalogue due to their lack ofabsorption in the h$\alpha$ narrow-band.

0909.2642	near-ir spectra of iphas extremely red galactic agb stars	we present a library of 139 near-ir spectra of cool asymptotic giant branchstars that will be useful for comparison with theoretical model atmospherecalculations and for modeling the integrated emission from intermediate-agestellar populations. the source list was selected from the `extremely red'region of the int photometric h alpha survey (iphas) colour-colour plane thatis overwhelmingly dominated by very late-type stars. the spectral library alsoincludes a large fraction of s-type and carbon stars. we present a number ofspectral classification sequences highlighting the various molecular featuresidentified and discuss a number of rare features with uncertain identificationsin the literature. with its focus on particularly cool photospheres thiscatalogue serves as a companion to recent spectroscopic atlases of mk standardsin the near-ir. finally the relationship between iphas (r'-i') and (r'-h alpha)colours and spectroscopically determined properties is discussed and a strongcorrelation between (r'-h alpha) colour and the c/o abundance index for s-typeand carbon stars is noted. this relation has the potential to separate o-rich,s-type and carbon stars in the galaxy based on their photometry alone.

0909.3857	the structure of the outer galactic disc as revealed by iphas early a  stars	this study is an investigation of the stellar density profile of the galacticdisc in the anticentre direction. we select over 40,000 early a stars fromiphas photometry in the galactic longitude range 160 &lt; l &lt; 200 close to theequatorial plane (-1 &lt; b &lt; +1). we then compare their observedreddening-corrected apparent magnitude distribution with simulated photometryobtained from parameterised models in order to set constraints on theanticentre stellar density profile. by selecting a stars, we are appraising theproperties of a population only ~100 myrs old. we find the stellar densityprofile of young stars is well fit to an exponential with length scale of (3020\pm 120_{statistical} \pm 180_{systematic}) pc, which is comparable to thatobtained in earlier studies, out to a galactocentric radius of r_t = (13.0 \pm0.5_{statistical} \pm 0.6_{systematic}) kpc. at larger radii the rate ofdecline appears to increase with the scale length dropping to (1200 \pm300_{statistical} \pm 70_{systematic}) pc. this result amounts to a refinementof the conclusions reached in previous studies that the stellar density profileis abruptly truncated. the iphas a star data are not compatible with modelsthat propose a sudden change in metallicity at r_g = 10 kpc.

1011.3295	identification of a population of x-ray emitting massive stars in the  galactic plane	we present x-ray, infrared, optical and radio observations of four previouslyunidentified galactic plane x-ray sources, ax j163252-4746, ax j184738-0156, axj144701-5919 and ax j144547-5931. detection of each source with the chandrax-ray observatory has provided sub-arcsecond localizations, which we use toidentify bright infrared counterparts to all four objects. infrared and opticalspectroscopy of these counterparts demonstrate that all four x-ray sources areextremely massive stars, with spectral classifications ofpe/wn9 (axj163252-4746), wn7 (ax j184738-0156 = wr121a), wn7-8h (ax j144701-5919) andoif+ (ax j144547-5931). ax j163252-4746 and ax j184738-0156 are both luminous,hard, x-ray emitters with strong fe xxv emission lines in their x-ray spectraat ~6.7 kev. the multi-wavelength properties of ax j163252-4746 and axj184738-0156 are not consistent with isolated massive stars or accretion onto acompact companion; we conclude that their x-ray emission is most likelygenerated in a colliding-wind binary system. for both ax j144701-5919 and axj144547-5931, the x-ray emission is an order of magnitude less luminous andwith a softer spectrum. these properties are consistent with a colliding-windbinary interpretation for these two sources also, but other mechanisms for thegeneration of x-rays cannot be excluded. there are many other as yetunidentified x-ray sources in the galactic plane, with x-ray properties similarto those seen for ax j163252-4746, ax j184738-0156, ax j144701-5919 and axj144547-5931. this may indicate a substantial population of x-ray-emittingmassive stars and colliding-wind binaries in the milky way.

1103.1646	t tauri candidates and accretion rates using iphas: method and  application to ic1396	the int photometric h-alpha survey (iphas) is a 1800 deg^2 survey of thenorthern galactic plane, reaching down to r'~21. we demonstrate how the surveycan be used to (1) reliably select classical t tauri star candidates and (2)constrain the mass accretion rates with an estimated relative uncertainty of0.6 dex. iphas is a necessary addition to spectroscopic surveys because itallows large and uniform samples of accretion rates to be obtained with aprecise handle on the selection effects.  we apply the method on a region of 7 deg^2 towards the hii region ic1396 incepheus ob2 and identify 158 pre-main sequence candidates with masses between0.2 and 2.0 msun and accretion rates between 10^-9.2 and 10^-7.0 msun yr^-1. wefind a power-law dependency between the stellar mass and the accretion rateswith a slope of \alpha = 1.1 +/- 0.2, which is less steep than indicated byprevious studies. we discuss the influence of method-dependent systematiceffects on the determination of this relationship.  the majority of our sample consists of faint, previously unknown, low-mass ttauri candidates (56 per cent between 0.2 and 0.5 msun). many candidates areclustered in front of three bright-rimmed molecular clouds, which are beingionized by the massive star hd206267 (o6.5v). we discover a spatio-temporalgradient of increasing accretion rates, increasing spitzer infrared excess, andyounger ages away from the ionizing star, providing a strong indication thatthe formation of these clusters has been sequentially triggered by hd206267during the last ~1 myr.

0709.3746	the enigma of the oldest `nova': the central star and nebula of ck vul	ck vul is classified as, amongst others, the slowest known nova, ahibernating nova, or a very late thermal pulse object. following its eruptionin ad 1670, the star remained visible for 2 years. a 15-arcsec nebula wasdiscovered in the 1980's, but the star itself has not been detected since theeruption. we here present radio images which reveal an 0.1-arcsec radio sourcewith a flux of 1.5 mjy at 5 ghz. deep halpha images show a bipolar nebula witha longest extension of 70 arcsec, with the previously known compact nebula atits waist. the emission-line ratios show that the gas is shock-ionized, atvelocities &gt;100 km/s. dust emission yields an envelope mass of ~0.05 msun.echelle spectra indicate outflow velocities up to 360 km/s. from a comparisonof images obtained in 1991 and 2004 we find evidence for expansion of thenebula, consistent with an origin in the 1670 explosion; the measured expansionis centred on the radio source. no optical or infrared counterpart is found atthe position of the radio source. the radio emission is interpreted as thermalfree-free emission from gas with tel ~ 10000 k. the radio source may be due toa remnant circumbinary disk, similar to those seen in some binary post-agbstars. we discuss possible classifications of this unique outburst, includingthat of a sub-chandrasekhar mass supernova, a nova eruption on a cool, low-masswhite dwarf, or a thermal pulse induced by accretion from a circumbinary disk.

1106.3949	on the alignment between the circumstellar disks and orbital planes of  herbig ae/be binary systems	the majority of the pre-main-sequence herbig ae/be stars reside in binarysystems. as these systems are young, their properties may contain an imprint ofthe star formation process at intermediate masses. however, these systems aregenerally spatially unresolved, making it difficult to probe theircircumstellar environment to search for manifestations of their formationprocess, such as accretion disks. here we investigate the formation mechanismof herbig ae/be (hae/be) binary systems by studying the relative orientation oftheir binary orbits and circumstellar disks. we present linearspectropolarimetric observations of hae/be stars over the halpha line, whichare used to determine the orientation of their circumstellar disks. inconjunction with data from the literature, we obtain a sample of 20 binarieswith known disk position angles (pas). we compare our disk pa data to a modelto investigate whether hae/be binary systems and their disks are co-planar.moreover, in the light of a recent suggestion that some hae/be starspectropolarimetric signatures may not necessarily be related to circumstellardisks, we re-assess the relationship between spectropolarimetric signatures anddisk pas. we do this by comparing spectropolarimetric and high spatialresolution observations of young stellar objects. we find thatspectropolarimetric observations of pre-main-sequence stars do tracecircumstellar disks. this finding is significant above the 3 sigma level. usingthis result, our data are entirely consistent with the situation in whichhae/be binary systems and circumstellar disks are co-planar, while randomorientations can be rejected at the 2.2 sigma level. we conclude that hae/bebinary systems and the disks around the primaries are likely to be co-planar,which is consistent with the notion that these systems form via monolithiccollapse and subsequent disk fragmentation (abridged).

1202.6333	initial data release of the kepler-int survey	this paper describes the first data release of the kepler-int survey (kis),that covers a 116 deg2 region of the cygnus and lyra constellations. the keplerfield is the target of the most intensive search for transiting planets todate. despite the fact that the kepler mission provides superior time seriesphotometry, with an enormous impact on all areas of stellar variability, itsfield lacks optical photometry complete to the confusion limit of the keplerinstrument necessary for selecting various classes of targets. for this reason,we follow the observing strategy and data reduction method used in the iphasand uvex galactic plane surveys in order to produce a deep optical survey ofthe kepler field. this initial release concerns data taken between may andaugust 2011, using the isaac newton telescope on the island of la palma. fourbroadband filters were used, u, g, r, i, as well as one narrowband one, halpha,reaching down to a 10-sigma limit of around 20th mag in the vega system.observations covering around 50 deg2, thus about half of the field, passed ourquality control thresholds and constitute this first data release. we derive aglobal photometric calibration by placing the kis magnitudes as close aspossible to the kepler input catalog (kic) photometry. the initial data releasecatalogue containing around 6 million sources from all the good photometricfields is available for download from the kis webpage, as well as via mast.

1205.2296	tracers of discs and winds around intermediate and high mass young  stellar objects	we present a study of the kinematical properties of a small sample of nearbynear-infrared bright massive and intermediate mass young stellar objects usingemission lines sensitive to discs and winds. we show for the first time thatthe broad ($\sim500$kms$^{-1}$) symmetric line wings on the hi brackett serieslines are due to stark broadening or electron scattering, rather than puredoppler broadening due to high speed motion. the results are consistent withthe presence of a very dense circumstellar environment. in addition, many ofthese lines show evidence for weak line self-absorption, suggestive of a windor disc-wind origin for that part of the absorbing material. the weakness ofthe self-absorption suggests a large opening angle for such an outflow. we alsostudy the fluorescent 1.688$\mu$m feii line, which is sensitive to densematerial. we fitted a keplerian disc model to this line, and find reasonablefits in all bar one case, in agreement with previous finding for classical bestars that fluorescent iron transitions are reasonable disc tracers. overallthe picture is one in which these stars still have accretion discs, with a verydense inner circumstellar environment which may be tracing either the innerregions of a disc, or of a stellar wind, and in which ionised outflow is alsopresent. the similarity with lower mass stars is striking, suggesting that atleast in this mass range they form in a similar fashion.

1403.6601	novalike cataclysmic variables in the infrared	novalike cataclysmic variables have persistently high mass transfer rates andprominent steady state accretion disks. we present an analysis of infraredobservations of twelve novalikes obtained from the two micron all sky survey,the spitzer space telescope, and the wide-field infrared survey explorer allsky survey. the presence of an infrared excess at &gt;3-5 microns over theexpectation of a theoretical steady state accretion disk is ubiquitous in oursample. the strength of the infrared excess is not correlated with orbitalperiod, but shows a statistically significant correlation (but shallow trend)with system inclination that might be partially (but not completely) linked tothe increasing view of the cooler outer accretion disk and disk rim at higherinclinations. we discuss the possible origin of the infrared excess in terms ofemission from bremsstrahlung or circumbinary dust, with either mechanismfacilitated by the mass outflows (e.g., disk wind/corona, accretion streamoverflow, and so on) present in novalikes. our comparison of the relativeadvantages and disadvantages of either mechanism for explaining theobservations suggests that the situation is rather ambiguous, largelycircumstantial, and in need of stricter observational constraints.

1405.1205	empirical classification of vlt/giraffe stellar spectra in the  wavelength range 6440-6810 a in the gamma vel cluster, and calibration of  spectral indices	we study spectral diagnostics available from optical spectra with r=17000obtained with the vlt/giraffe hr15n setup, using observations from the gaia-esosurvey, on the gamma vel young cluster, in order to determine the fundamentalparameters of these stars. we define a set of spectroscopic indices, samplingtio bands, h-alpha core and wings, and many temperature- and gravity-sensitivelines. combined indices tau (gamma) are also defined as teff (log g) indicatorsover a wide spectral-type range. h-alpha emission-line indices are alsochromospheric activity or accretion indicators. a metallicity-sensitive indexis also defined. these indices enable us to find a clear difference betweengravities of main-sequence and pre-main-sequence stars (as well as giantstars): the (gamma,tau) diagram is thus argued to be a promisingdistance-independent age measurement tool for young clusters.  our indices were quantitatively calibrated by means of photometry andliterature reference spectra (from uves-pop and elodie 3.1 libraries, and otherdatasets), over a wide range of stellar parameters. the ability of our indicesto select peculiar, or other rare classes of stars is also established.finally, our gravity determinations support the existence of an olderpre-main-sequence population in the gamma vel sky region, in agreement with thelithium depletion pattern of those stars (abridged).

1407.1510	the gaia-eso survey: stellar content and elemental abundances in the  massive cluster ngc 6705	chemically inhomogeneous populations are observed in most globular clusters,but not in open clusters. cluster mass seems to play a key role in theexistence of multiple populations.  studying the chemical homogeneity of the most massive open clusters isnecessary to better understand the mechanism of their formation and determinethe mass limit under which clusters cannot host multiple populations. here westudied ngc6705, that is a young and massive open cluster located towards theinner region of the milky way. this cluster is located inside the solar circle.this makes it an important tracer of the inner disk abundance gradient. thisstudy makes use of bvi and ri photometry and comparisons with theoreticalisochrones to derive the age of ngc6705. we study the density profile of thecluster and the mass function to infer the cluster mass. based on abundances ofthe chemical elements distributed in the first internal data release of thegaia-eso survey, we study elemental ratios and the chemical homogeneity of thered clump stars. radial velocities enable us to study the rotation and internalkinematics of the cluster.  the estimated ages range from 250 to 316myr, depending on the adopted stellarmodel. luminosity profiles and mass functions show strong signs of masssegregation. we derive the mass of the cluster from its luminosity function andfrom the kinematics, finding values between 3700 m$_{\odot}$ and 11 000m$_{\odot}$. after selecting the cluster members from their radial velocities,we obtain a metallicity of [fe/h]=0.10$\pm$0.06 based on 21 candidate members.moreover, ngc6705 shows no sign of the typical correlations oranti-correlations between al, mg, si, and na, that are expected in multiplepopulations. this is consistent with our cluster mass estimate, which is lowerthan the required mass limit proposed in literature to develop multiplepopulations.

1410.0842	the gaia-eso survey: extracting diffuse interstellar bands from cool  star spectra, dib-based interstellar medium line-of-sight structures at the  kpc scale	we study how diffuse interstellar bands (dibs) measured towarddistance-distributed target stars can be used to locate dense interstellar (is)clouds in the galaxy and probe a line-of-sight (los) kinematical structure, apotential useful tool when gaseous absorption lines are saturated or notavailable in the spectral range. cool target stars are numerous enough for thispurpose. we have devised automated dib fitting methods appropriate to cool starspectra and multiple is components. the data is fitted with a combination of asynthetic stellar spectrum, a synthetic telluric transmission, and empiricaldib profiles. in parallel, stellar distances and extinctions are estimatedself-consistently by means of a 2d bayesian method, fromspectroscopically-derived stellar parameters and photometric data. we haveanalyzed gaia-eso survey (ges) and previously recorded spectra that probebetween $\sim$ 2 and 10 kpc long los in five different regions of the milkyway. depending on the observed spectral intervals, we extracted one or more ofthe following dibs: $\lambda\lambda$ 6283.8, 6613.6 and 8620.4. for each field,we compared the dib strengths with the bayesian distances and extinctions, andthe dib doppler velocities with the hi emission spectra. for all fields, thedib strength and the target extinction are well correlated. in case of targetswidely distributed in distance, marked steps in dibs and extinction radialdistance profiles match with each other and broadly correspond to the expectedlocations of spiral arms. for all fields, the dib velocity structure agreeswith hi emission spectra and all detected dibs correspond to strong nai lines.this illustrates how dibs can be used to locate the galactic interstellar gasand to study its kinematics at the kpc scale.

1505.07019	the gaia-eso survey: empirical determination of the precision of stellar  radial velocities and projected rotation velocities	the gaia-eso survey (ges) is a large public spectroscopic survey at theeuropean southern observatory very large telescope. a key aim is to provideprecise radial velocities (rvs) and projected equatorial velocities (v sin i)for representative samples of galactic stars, that will complement informationobtained by the gaia astrometry satellite. we present an analysis toempirically quantify the size and distribution of uncertainties in rv and v sini using spectra from repeated exposures of the same stars. we show that theuncertainties vary as simple scaling functions of signal-to-noise ratio (s/n)and v sin i, that the uncertainties become larger with increasing photospherictemperature, but that the dependence on stellar gravity, metallicity and age isweak. the underlying uncertainty distributions have extended tails that arebetter represented by student's t-distributions than by normal distributions.parametrised results are provided, that enable estimates of the rv precisionfor almost all ges measurements, and estimates of the v sin i precision forstars in young clusters, as a function of s/n, v sin i and stellar temperature.the precision of individual high s/n ges rv measurements is 0.22-0.26 km/s,dependent on instrumental configuration.

astro-ph;0107463	fuse observations of u geminorum during outburst and decline	we have obtained fuv (904 -- 1187 \aa) spectra of u gem in outburst withfuse. three of the observations were acquired during the plateau phase of theoutburst, while the fourth was obtained during late outburst decline. theplateau spectra have continuum shapes and fluxes that are approximated bysteady-state accretion disk model spectra with $\dot{m} \simeq$ 7e-09 m_sun/yr.the spectra also show numerous absorption lines of h i, he ii, and two- tofive-times ionized transitions of c, n, o, p, s and si. there are no emissionfeatures in the spectra, with the possible exception of a weak feature on thered wing of the o vi doublet. the absorption lines are narrow (fwhm ~ 500km/s), too narrow to arise from the disk photosphere, and at low velocities (&lt;=700 km/s). the s vi and o vi doublets are optically thick. the absorption linesin the plateau spectra show orbital variability: in spectra obtained at orbitalphases 0.53 -- 0.79, low-ionization absorption lines appear and the centraldepths of the pre-existing lines increase. the increase in line absorptionoccurs at the same orbital phases as previously observed euv and x-ray lightcurve dips. if the absorbing material is in (near-) keplerian rotation aroundthe disk, it must be located at large disk radii. the final observationoccurred when u gem was about two magnitudes from optical quiescence. thespectra are dominated by emission from an $\simeq$43,000 k, metal-enrichedwhite dwarf (wd). the inferred radius of the wd is 4.95e+08 cm, close to thatobserved in quiescence. allowing for a hot heated region on the surface of thewd improves the fit to the spectrum at short (&lt; 960 \aa) wavelengths.

astro-ph;0109486	the evolution of disks and winds in dwarf novae outbursts	far ultraviolet (fuv) observations are excellent probes of the inneraccretion disk, disk outflows, and the mass-accumulating white dwarf incataclysmic variables. here we study the contrasting behavior of two canonicaldwarf novae in outburst by presenting fuse fuv (904 -- 1187 a) spectroscopy ofu gem and ss cyg. we observed each system four times during a single outburst.the outburst peak and early decline spectra of ss cyg are well fit by models ofa steady-state accretion disk and a biconical wind. a broad, blueshifted oviwind-formed absorption line is the only strong spectral feature. in lateoutburst decline, ovi and ciii lines are seen as broad emission features andthe continuum has flattened. in u gem, the continua of the optical outburstplateau spectra are plausibly fit by accretion disk model spectra. the spectraalso show numerous narrow, low-velocity absorption lines that do not originatein the inner accretion disk. we discuss the line spectra in the context ofpartial absorption of the fuv continuum by low-velocity, vertically-extendedmaterial located at large disk radii. the late outburst decline spectrum of ugem is dominated by the white dwarf. wd model fits confirm the sub-solar c andsuper-solar n abundances found in earlier studies.

astro-ph;0202384	resonance line-profile calculations based on hydrodynamical models of  cataclysmic variable winds	we present synthetic line profiles as predicted by the models of 2-d line-driven disk winds due to proga, stone &amp; drew. we compare the model lineprofiles with hst observations of the cataclysmic variable ix vel. the modelwind consists of a slow outflow that is bounded on the polar side by a faststream. we find that these two components of the wind produce distinct spectralfeatures. the fast stream produces profiles which show features consistent withobservations. these include the appearance of the p-cygni shape for a range ofinclinations, the location of the maximum depth of the absorption component atvelocities less than the terminal velocity, and the transition from absorptionto emission with increasing inclination. however the model profiles have toolittle absorption or emission equivalent width. this quantitative differencebetween our models and observations is not a surprise because the line-drivenwind models predict a mass loss rate that is lower than the rate required bythe observations. we note that the model profiles exhibit a double-humpedstructure near the line center which is not echoed in observations. we identifythis structure with a non-negligible redshifted absorption which is formed inthe slow component of the wind where the rotational velocity dominates overexpansion velocity. we conclude that the next generation of disk wind models,developed for application to cvs, needs to yield stronger wind driving out tolarger disk radii than do the present models.

0808.2441	extremely red stellar objects revealed by iphas	we present photometric analysis and follow-up spectroscopy for a populationof extremely red stellar objects extracted from the point-source catalogue ofthe int photometric h-alpha survey (iphas) of the northern galactic plane. thevast majority of these objects have no previous identification. analysis ofoptical, near- and mid-infrared photometry reveals that they are mostlyhighly-reddened asymptotic giant branch stars, with significant levels ofcircumstellar material. we show that the distribution of these objects tracesgalactic extinction, their highly reddened colours being a product of bothinterstellar and circumstellar reddening. this is the first time that such alarge sample of evolved low-mass stars has been detected in the visual andallows optical counterparts to be associated with sources from recent infraredsurveys.  follow-up spectroscopy on some of the most interesting objects in the samplehas found significant numbers of s-type stars which can be clearly separatedfrom oxygen-rich objects in the iphas colour-colour diagram. we show that thisis due to the positions of different molecular bands relative to thenarrow-band h-alpha filter used for iphas observations. the iphas (r' -h-alpha) colour offers a valuable diagnostic for identifying s-type stars. aselection method for identifying s-type stars in the galactic plane is brieflydiscussed and we estimate that over a thousand new objects of this type may bediscovered, potentially doubling the number of known objects in this short butimportant evolutionary phase.

astro-ph;0507495	spiral waves and the secondary in the novalike variable, v3885 sgr	we present seven nights' blue spectroscopy of the novalike variable star,v3885 sgr. the line spectrum shows a typical combination of broad absorptionand emission in h gamma and h beta and he i, which is associated with theaccretion disk. we also observe anti-phased narrow emission, which we attributeto irradiation of the secondary star. the he ii 4686 and n iii--c iii--c ivemission lines are devoid of structure and are most likely formed in anoutflow. we measure radial velocity shifts in the absorption and emissionlines, from which we fit an orbital period of 4.97126+/-0.00036h. from thevelocity semi-amplitudes of the disk and companion star, we are able toconstrain the binary mass ratio to q&gt;0.7.  the phase-folded spectra provide dense coverage of the entire orbital cycle.doppler tomograms of the hydrogen and he i lines reveal spiral structure in theaccretion disk and the irradiated donor star. we believe this is the firstunambiguous detection of spiral waves in a novalike variable.

astro-ph;0509662	near-infrared line spectropolarimetry of hot massive stars	in order to study the inner parts of the circumstellar material aroundoptically faint, infrared bright objects, we present the firstmedium-resolution spectropolarimetric data taken in the near-infrared. in thispaper we discuss pa beta line data of gl 490, a well-known embedded massiveyoung stellar object, and of mwc 349a and mwc 342, two optically faint starsthat are proposed to be in the pre-main sequence phase of evolution. as a checkon the method, the classical be star zeta tau, known to display linepolarization changes at optical wavelengths, was observed as well. three of ourtargets show a ``line effect'' across pa beta. for zeta tau and mwc 349a thisline effect is due to depolarisation by a circumstellar electron-scatteringdisk. in both cases, the position angle of the polarisation is consistent withthat of the larger scale disks imaged at other wavelengths, validating infraredspectropolarimetry as a means to detect flattening on small scales. thetentative detection of a rotation in the polarization position angle at pa betain the embedded massive young stellar object gl 490 suggests the presence of asmall scale rotating accretion disk with an inner hole - similar to thoserecently discovered at optical wavelengths in herbig ae and t tauri stars.

astro-ph;0512028	the shaping of planetary nebula sh 2-188 through interaction with the  interstellar medium	sh 2-188 is an example of strong interaction between a planetary nebula (pn)and the interstellar medium (ism). its structure is postulated to be the resultof motion through the ism. we present new h$\alpha$ images from the isaacnewton telescope photometric h$\alpha$ survey of the northern galactic planewhich reveal new structure. the nebula extends 15 arcmin on the sky in total.we have developed a `triple-wind' hydrodynamical model, comprising of theinitial `slow' asymptotic giant branch (agb) wind and the later `fast' stellarwind plus a third wind reflecting the motion through the ism. simulations atvarious velocities of the central star relative to the ism indicate that a highvelocity of 125 kms is required to reproduce the observed structure. we findmost of the structure already forms during the agb phase. the closure of thering arises from the slow--fast wind interaction. most of the mass lost on theagb has been swept downstream, providing a potential explanation of the missingmass problem in pne. we report a proper motion for the central star of 30 masyr^-1 in the direction of the bright limb, implying a distance to the nebula of850^{+500}_{-420} pc, consistent with a spectroscopic distances. expansionvelocities measured from spectroscopic data are consistent with velocitiesmeasured from the simulation. the model shows that the size of the pn wasalready set during the agb phase.

astro-ph;0605291	the properties of cataclysmic variables in photometric halpha surveys	we report on the properties of 71 known cataclysmic variables (cvs) inphotometric halpha emission line surveys. our study is motivated by the factthat the isaac newton telescope (int) photometric halpha survey of the northerngalactic plane (iphas) will soon provide r', i' and narrow-band halphameasurements down to r' \simeq 20 for all northern objects between -5 degrees &lt;b &lt; +5 degrees. iphas thus provides a unique resource, both for studying theemission line properties of known cvs and for constructing a new cv sampleselected solely on the basis of halpha excess. our goal here is to carry outthe first task and prepare the way for the second. in order to achieve this, weanalyze data on 19 cvs already contained in the iphas data base and supplementthis with identical observations of 52 cvs outside the galactic plane.  our key results are as follows: (i) the recovery rate of known cvs as halphaemitters in a survey like iphas is \simeq 70 per cent; (ii) of the \simeq 30per cent of cvs which were not recovered \simeq 75 per cent were clearlydetected but did not exhibit a significant halpha excess at the time of ourobservations; (iii) the recovery rate depends only weakly on cv type; (iv) therecovery rate depends only weakly on orbital period; (v) short-period dwarfnovae tend to have the strongest halpha lines. these results imply thatphotometric emission line searches provide an efficient way of constructing cvsamples that are not biased against detection of intrinsically faint,short-period systems.

astro-ph;0608108	the "principes de asturias" nebula: a new quadrupolar planetary nebula  from the iphas survey	the isaac newton telescope photometric h-alpha survey (iphas) is currentlymapping the northern galactic plane reaching to r'=20 mag with typically 1"resolution. hundreds of planetary nebulae (pne), both point-like and resolved,are expected to be discovered. we report on the discovery of the first new pnfrom this survey: it is an unusual object located at a large galactocentricdistance and has a very low oxygen abundance. the nebula shows an intricatemorphology: there is an inner ring surrounding the central star, bright innerlobes with an enhanced waist, and very faint lobular extensions reaching up tomore than 100". we classify it as a quadrupolar pn, a rather unusual class ofplanetary showing two pairs of misaligned lobes. from long-slit spectroscopy wederive te[nii] =12800+-1000k, ne = 390+-40 cm-3, and chemical abundancestypical of peimbert's type i nebulae (he/h =0.13, n/o =1.8) with an oxygenabundance of 12 + log(o/h)=8.17+-0.15. a kinematic distance of 7.0 kpc isderived, implying an unusually large size of &gt;4 pc for the nebula. thephotometry of the central star indicates the presence of a relatively coolcompanion. this, and the evidence for a dense circumstellar disk andquadrupolar morphology, all of which are rare among pne, support the hypothesisthat this morphology is related to binary interaction.

astro-ph;9907177	line-driven disk wind models with an improved line force	we describe an efficient method of calculating the radiation pressure due tospectral lines, including all the terms in the velocity gradient tensor. weapply this method to calculate the two-dimensional, time-dependent structure ofwinds from luminous disks. qualitative features of our new models are verysimilar to those we calculated including only the dominant terms in the tensor(proga, stone &amp; drew 1998, hereafter psd). in particular, we find that modelswhich displayed unsteady behaviour in psd are also unsteady with the newmethod, and gross properties of the winds, such as mass-loss rate andcharacteristic velocity are not changed by the more accurate approach. thelargest change caused by the new method is in the disk-wind opening angle:winds driven only by the disk radiation are more polar with the new methodwhile winds driven by the disk and central object radiation are typically moreequatorial. in the closing discussion, we provide further insight into the waythe geometry of the radiation field and consequent flow determines the timeproperties of the flow.

0810.0401	a planetary nebula around nova v458 vul undergoing flash ionization	nova v458 vul erupted on 2007 august 8th and reached a visual magnitude of8.1 a few days later. h$\alpha$ images obtained six weeks before the outburstas part of the iphas galactic plane survey reveal an 18th magnitude progenitorsurrounded by an extended nebula. subsequent images and spectroscopy of thenebula reveal an inner nebular knot increasing rapidly in brightness due toflash ionization by the nova event. we derive a distance of 13 kpc based onlight travel time considerations, which is supported by two other distanceestimation methods. the nebula has an ionized mass of 0.2 m$_{\odot}$ and a lowexpansion velocity: this rules it out as ejecta from a previous nova eruption,and is consistent with it being a ~14,000 year old planetary nebula, probablythe product of a prior common envelope (ce) phase of evolution of the binarysystem. the large derived distance means that the mass of the erupting wdcomponent of the binary is high. we identify two possible evolutionaryscenarios, in at least one of which the system is massive enough to produce atype ia supernova on merging.

0810.2547	high spatial resolution galactic 3d extinction mapping with iphas	we present an algorithm ({\scshape mead}, for `mapping extinction againstdistance') which will determine intrinsic ($r' - i'$) colour, extinction, anddistance for early-a to k4 stars extracted from the iphas $r'/i'/\halpha$photometric database. these data can be binned up to map extinction in threedimensions across the northern galactic plane. the large size of the iphasdatabase ($\sim 200$ million unique objects), the accuracy of the digitalphotometry it contains and its faint limiting magnitude ($r' \sim 20$) allowextinction to be mapped with fine angular ($ \sim 10 $ arcmin) and distance($\sim 0.1$ ~kpc) resolution to distances of up to 10 kpc, outside the solarcircle. high reddening within the solar circle on occasion brings this rangedown to $\sim 2$ kpc. the resolution achieved, both in angle and depth, greatlyexceeds that of previous empirical 3d extinction maps, enabling the structureof the galactic plane to be studied in increased detail. {\scshape mead}accounts for the effect of the survey magnitude limits, photometric errors,unresolved ism substructure, and binarity. the impact of metallicityvariations, within the range typical of the galactic disc is small. theaccuracy and reliability of {\scshape mead} are tested through the use ofsimulated photometry created with monte-carlo sampling techniques. the successof this algorithm is demonstrated on a selection of fields and the results arecompared to the literature.

0810.4042	an iphas-based search for accreting very low-mass objects using vo tools	the main goal of this paper is to prove that accreting very low-mass starsand brown dwarfs can be identified in iphas, a halpha emission survey of thenorthern milky way.full exploitation of the iphas database and a futureextension of it in the southern hemisphere will be useful to identify verylow-mass accreting objects near and far well-known star forming regions. wehave used virtual observatory tools to cross-match the iphas catalogue with the2mass catalogue. we defined photometric criteria to identify halpha emissionsources with near-infrared colours similar to known young very low-mass starsand brown dwarfs. 4000 candidates were identified that met our criteria over anarea of 1600 square degrees. we present low-resolution optical spectra of 113candidates. spectral types have been derived for the 33 candidates that havespectroscopically confirmed halpha emission, negligible reddening and mspectral class. we have also measured halpha emission and investigated the naidoublet (818.3 nm, 819.5 nm) in these 33 objects. we confirm that 33 iphascandidates have strong halpha indicative of disk accretion for their spectraltype. 23 of them have spectral class m4 or later, of which 10 have classes inthe range m5.5-m7.0 and thus could be very young brown dwarfs. also manyobjects have weak nai doublet, an indication of low surface gravity.we concludethat iphas provides a very valuable database to identify accreting verylow-mass stars and brown dwarfs, and that virtual observatory tools provide anefficient method for identifying these objects over large areas of the sky.based on our success rate of 23 halpha emission objects with spectral type inthe range m4-m7 out of 113 candidates with spectroscopic follow-up, we estimatethat there could be hundreds of such objects in the full iphas survey.
