physics;0703153	reduction of time-resolved space-based ccd photometry developed for most  fabry imaging data	the most (microvariability &amp; oscillations of stars) satellite obtainsultraprecise photometry from space with high sampling rates and duty cycles.astronomical photometry or imaging missions in low earth orbits, like most, areespecially sensitive to scattered light from earthshine, and all these missionshave a common need to extract target information from voluminous data cubes.they consist of upwards of hundreds of thousands of two-dimensional ccd frames(or sub-rasters) containing from hundreds to millions of pixels each, where thetarget information, superposed on background and instrumental effects, iscontained only in a subset of pixels (fabry images, defocussed images,mini-spectra). we describe a novel reduction technique for such data cubes:resolving linear correlations of target and background pixel intensities. thisstepwise multiple linear regression removes only those target variations whichare also detected in the background. the advantage of regression analysisversus background subtraction is the appropriate scaling, taking into accountthat the amount of contamination may differ from pixel to pixel. themultivariate solution for all pairs of target/background pixels is minimallyinvasive of the raw photometry while being very effective in reducingcontamination due to, e.g., stray light. the technique is tested anddemonstrated with both simulated oscillation signals and real most photometry.

0907.1929	a search for p-modes and other variability in the binary system 85  pegasi using most photometry	context: asteroseismology has great potential for the study of metal-poorstars due to its sensitivity to determine stellar ages. aims: our goal was todetect p-mode oscillations in the metal-poor sub-dwarf 85 peg a and to searchfor other variability on longer timescales. methods: we have obtainedcontinuous high-precision photometry of the binary system 85 pegasi with themost space telescope in two seasons (2005 &amp; 2007). furthermore, we redeterminedvsini for 85 peg a using high resolution spectra obtained through the esoarchive, and used photometric spot modeling to interpret long periodicvariations. results: our frequency analysis yields no convincing evidence forp-modes significantly above a noise level of 4 ppm. using simulated p-modepatterns we provide upper rms amplitude limits for 85 peg a. the light curveshows evidence for variability with a period of about 11 d and this periodicityis also seen in the follow up run in 2007; however, as different methods toremove instrumental trends in the 2005 run yield vastly different results, theexact shape and periodicity of the 2005 variability remain uncertain. ourre-determined vsini value for 85 peg a is comparable to previous studies and weprovide realistic uncertainties for this parameter. using these values incombination with simple photometric spot models we are able to reconstruct theobserved variations. conclusions: the null-detection of p-modes in 85 peg a isconsistent with theoretical values for pulsation amplitudes in this star. thedetected long-periodic variation must await confirmation by furtherobservations with similar or better precision and long-term stability. if the11 d periodicity is real, rotational modulation of surface features on one ofthe components is the most likely explanation.

1001.0229	solar-like oscillations in low-luminosity red giants: first results from  kepler	we have measured solar-like oscillations in red giants using time-seriesphotometry from the first 34 days of science operations of the kepler mission.the light curves, obtained with 30-minute sampling, reveal clear oscillationsin a large sample of g and k giants, extending in luminosity from the red clumpdown to the bottom of the giant branch. we confirm a strong correlation betweenthe large separation of the oscillations (delta nu) and the frequency ofmaximum power (nu_max). we focus on a sample of 50 low-luminosity stars (nu_max&gt; 100 muhz, l &lt;~ 30 l_sun) having high signal-to-noise ratios and showing theunambiguous signature of solar-like oscillations. these are h-shell-burningstars, whose oscillations should be valuable for testing models of stellarevolution and for constraining the star-formation rate in the local disk. weuse a new technique to compare stars on a single echelle diagram by scalingtheir frequencies and find well-defined ridges corresponding to radial andnon-radial oscillations, including clear evidence for modes with angular degreel=3. measuring the small separation between l=0 and l=2 allows us to plot theso-called c-d diagram of delta nu_02 versus delta nu. the small separationdelta nu_01 of l=1 from the midpoint of adjacent l=0 modes is negative,contrary to the sun and solar-type stars. the ridge for l=1 is notablybroadened, which we attribute to mixed modes, confirming theoreticalpredictions for low-luminosity giants. overall, the results demonstrate thetremendous potential of kepler data for asteroseismology of red giants.

1009.3444	on noise treatment in radio measurements of cosmic ray air showers	precise measurements of the radio emission by cosmic ray air showers requirean adequate treatment of noise. unlike to usual experiments in particlephysics, where noise always adds to the signal, radio noise can in principledecrease or increase the signal if it interferes by chance destructively orconstructively. consequently, noise cannot simply be subtracted from thesignal, and its influence on amplitude and time measurement of radio pulsesmust be studied with care. first, noise has to be determined consistently withthe definition of the radio signal which typically is the maximum fieldstrength of the radio pulse. second, the average impact of noise on radio pulsemeasurements at individual antennas is studied for lopes. it is shown that acorrect treatment of noise is especially important at low signal-to-noiseratios: noise can be the dominant source of uncertainty for pulse height andtime measurements, and it can systematically flatten the slope of lateraldistributions. the presented method can also be transfered to other experimentsin radio and acoustic detection of cosmic rays and neutrinos.

1107.0490	amplitudes of solar-like oscillations: constraints from red giants in  open clusters observed by kepler	scaling relations that link asteroseismic quantities to global stellarproperties are important for gaining understanding of the intricate physicsthat underpins stellar pulsation. the common notion that all stars in an opencluster have essentially the same distance, age, and initial composition,implies that the stellar parameters can be measured to much higher precisionthan what is usually achievable for single stars. this makes clusters ideal forexploring the relation between the mode amplitude of solar-like oscillationsand the global stellar properties. we have analyzed data obtained with nasa'skepler space telescope to study solar-like oscillations in 100 red giant starslocated in either of the three open clusters, ngc 6791, ngc 6819, and ngc 6811.by fitting the measured amplitudes to predictions from simple scaling relationsthat depend on luminosity, mass, and effective temperature, we find that thedata cannot be described by any power of the luminosity-to-mass ratio aspreviously assumed. as a result we provide a new improved empirical relationwhich treats luminosity and mass separately. this relation turns out to alsowork remarkably well for main-sequence and subgiant stars. in addition, themeasured amplitudes reveal the potential presence of a number of previouslyunknown unresolved binaries in the red clump in ngc 6791 and ngc 6819, pointingto an interesting new application for asteroseismology as a probe into theformation history of open clusters.

1109.1194	granulation in red giants: observations by the kepler mission and 3d  convection simulations	the granulation pattern that we observe on the surface of the sun is due tohot plasma from the interior rising to the photosphere where it cools down, anddescends back into the interior at the edges of granules. this is the visiblemanifestation of convection taking place in the outer part of the solarconvection zone. because red giants have deeper convection zones and moreextended atmospheres than the sun, we cannot a priori assume that granulationin red giants is a scaled version of solar granulation. until now, neitherobservations nor 1d analytical convection models could put constraints ongranulation in red giants. however, thanks to asteroseismology, this study cannow be performed. the resulting parameters yield physical information about thegranulation. we analyze \sim1000 red giants that have been observed by keplerduring 13 months. we fit the power spectra with harvey-like profiles toretrieve the characteristics of the granulation (time scale tau_gran and powerp_gran). we also introduce a new time scale, tau_eff, which takes into accountthat different slopes are used in the harvey functions. we search for acorrelation between these parameters and the global acoustic-mode parameter(the position of maximum power, nu_max) as well as with stellar parameters(mass, radius, surface gravity (log g) and effective temperature (t_eff)). weshow that tau_eff nu_max^{-0.89} and p_gran nu_max^{-1.90}, which is consistentwith the theoretical predictions. we find that the granulation time scales ofstars that belong to the red clump have similar values while the time scales ofstars in the red-giant branch are spread in a wider range. finally, we showthat realistic 3d simulations of the surface convection in stars, spanning the(t_eff, log g)-range of our sample of red giants, match the kepler observationswell in terms of trends.

1208.1675	the rapid atmospheric monitoring system of the pierre auger observatory	the pierre auger observatory is a facility built to detect air showersproduced by cosmic rays above 10^17 ev. during clear nights with a lowilluminated moon fraction, the uv fluorescence light produced by air showers isrecorded by optical telescopes at the observatory. to correct the observationsfor variations in atmospheric conditions, atmospheric monitoring is performedat regular intervals ranging from several minutes (for cloud identification) toseveral hours (for aerosol conditions) to several days (for vertical profilesof temperature, pressure, and humidity). in 2009, the monitoring program wasupgraded to allow for additional targeted measurements of atmosphericconditions shortly after the detection of air showers of special interest,e.g., showers produced by very high-energy cosmic rays or showers with atypicallongitudinal profiles. the former events are of particular importance for thedetermination of the energy scale of the observatory, and the latter arecharacteristic of unusual air shower physics or exotic primary particle types.the purpose of targeted (or "rapid") monitoring is to improve the resolution ofthe atmospheric measurements for such events. in this paper, we report on theimplementation of the rapid monitoring program and its current status. therapid monitoring data have been analyzed and applied to the reconstruction ofair showers of high interest, and indicate that the air fluorescencemeasurements affected by clouds and aerosols are effectively corrected usingmeasurements from the regular atmospheric monitoring program. we find that therapid monitoring program has potential for supporting dedicated physicsanalyses beyond the standard event reconstruction.

1208.6294	verifying asteroseismically determined parameters of kepler stars using  hipparcos parallaxes: self-consistent stellar properties and distances	accurately determining the properties of stars is of prime importance forcharacterizing stellar populations in our galaxy. the field of asteroseismologyhas been thought to be particularly successful in such an endeavor for stars indifferent evolutionary stages. however, to fully exploit its potential, robustmethods for estimating stellar parameters are required and independentverification of the results is mandatory. with this purpose, we present a newtechnique to obtain stellar properties by coupling asteroseismic analysis withthe infrared flux method. by using two global seismic observables andmulti-band photometry, the technique allows us to obtain masses, radii,effective temperatures, bolometric fluxes, and hence distances for field starsin a self-consistent manner. we apply our method to 22 solar-like oscillatorsin the kepler short-cadence sample, that have accurate hipparcos parallaxes.our distance determinations agree to better than 5%, while measurements ofspectroscopic effective temperatures and interferometric radii also validateour results. we briefly discuss the potential of our technique for stellarpopulation analysis and models of galactic chemical evolution.

1303.7068	thunderstorm observations by air-shower radio antenna arrays	relativistic, charged particles present in extensive air showers lead to acoherent emission of radio pulses which are measured to identify the showerinitiating high-energy cosmic rays. especially during thunderstorms, there areadditional strong electric fields in the atmosphere, which can lead to furthermultiplication and acceleration of the charged particles and thus haveinfluence on the form and strength of the radio emission. for a reliable energyreconstruction of the primary cosmic ray by means of the measured radio signalit is very important to understand how electric fields affect the radioemission. in addition, lightning strikes are a prominent source of broadbandradio emissions that are visible over very long distances. this, on the onehand, causes difficulties in the detection of the much lower signal of the airshower. on the other hand the recorded signals can be used to study features ofthe lightning development. the detection of cosmic rays via the radio emissionand the influence of strong electric fields on this detection technique isinvestigated with the lopes experiment in karlsruhe, germany. the importantquestion if a lightning is initiated by the high electron density given at themaximum of a high-energy cosmic-ray air shower is also investigated, but couldnot be answered by lopes. but, these investigations exhibit the capabilities ofeas radio antenna arrays for lightning studies. we report about the studies oflopes measured radio signals of air showers taken during thunderstorms and givea short outlook to new measurements dedicated to search for correlations oflightning and cosmic rays.

1309.0702	kepler white paper: asteroseismology of solar-like oscillators in a  2-wheel mission	we comment on the potential for continuing asteroseismology of solar-type andred-giant stars in a 2-wheel kepler mission. our main conclusion is that bytargeting stars in the ecliptic it should be possible to perform high-qualityasteroseismology, as long as favorable scenarios for 2-wheel pointingperformance are met. targeting the ecliptic would potentially facilitate uniquescience that was not possible in the nominal mission, notably from the study ofclusters that are significantly brighter than those in the kepler field. ourconclusions are based on predictions of 2-wheel observations made by a spacephotometry simulator, with information provided by the kepler project used asinput to describe the degraded pointing scenarios. we find that elevated levelsof frequency-dependent noise, consistent with the above scenarios, would have asignificant negative impact on our ability to continue asteroseismic studies ofsolar-like oscillators in the kepler field. however, the situation may be muchmore optimistic for observations in the ecliptic, provided that pointing resetsof the spacecraft during regular desaturations of the two functioning reactionwheels are accurate at the &lt; 1 arcsec level. this would make it possible toapply a post-hoc analysis that would recover most of the lost photometricprecision. without this post-hoc correction---and the accurate re-pointing itrequires---the performance would probably be as poor as in the kepler-fieldcase. critical to our conclusions for both fields is the assumed level ofpointing noise (in the short-term jitter and the longer-term drift). we suggestthat further tests will be needed to clarify our results once more detail anddata on the expected pointing performance becomes available, and we offer ourassistance in this work.

1309.5920	comparing lopes measurements of air-shower radio emission with reas 3.11  and coreas simulations	cosmic ray air showers emit radio pulses at mhz frequencies, which can bemeasured with radio antenna arrays - like lopes at the karlsruhe institute oftechnology in germany. to improve the understanding of the radio emission, wetest theoretical descriptions with measured data. the observables used forthese tests are the absolute amplitude of the radio signal, and the shape ofthe radio lateral distribution. we compare lateral distributions of more than500 lopes events with two recent and public monte carlo simulation codes, reas3.11 and coreas (v 1.0). the absolute radio amplitudes predicted by reas 3.11are in good agreement with the lopes measurements. the amplitudes predicted bycoreas are lower by a factor of two, and marginally compatible with the lopesmeasurements within the systematic scale uncertainties. in contrast to anyprevious versions of reas, reas 3.11 and coreas now reproduce the shape of themeasured lateral distributions correctly. this reflects a remarkable progresscompared to the situation a few years ago, and it seems that the main processesfor the radio emission of air showers are now understood: the emission ismainly due to the geomagnetic deflection of the electrons and positrons in theshower. less important but not negligible is the askaryan effect (net chargevariation). moreover, we confirm that the refractive index of the air plays animportant role, since it changes the coherence conditions for the emission:only the new simulations including the refractive index can reproduce risinglateral distributions which we observe in a few lopes events. finally, we showthat the lateral distribution is sensitive to the energy and the mass of theprimary cosmic ray particles.

1312.4500	pulsating red giant stars in eccentric binary systems discovered from  kepler space-based photometry	the unparalleled photometric data obtained by nasa's kepler space telescopeled to an improved understanding of red giant stars and binary stars.seismology allows us to constrain the properties of red giants. in addition toeclipsing binaries, eccentric non-eclipsing binaries, exhibiting ellipsoidalmodulations, have been detected with kepler. we aim to study the properties ofeccentric binary systems containing a red giant star and derive the parametersof the primary giant component. we apply asteroseismic techniques to determinemasses and radii of the primary component of each system. for a selectedtarget, light and radial velocity curve modelling techniques are applied toextract the parameters of the system. the effects of stellar on the binarysystem are studied. the paper presents the asteroseismic analysis of 18pulsating red giants in eccentric binary systems, for which masses and radiiwere constrained. the orbital periods of these systems range from 20 to440days. from radial velocity measurements we find eccentricities between e=0.2to 0.76. as a case study we present a detailed analysis of kic5006817. fromseismology we constrain the rotational period of the envelope to be at least165 d, roughly twice the orbital period. the stellar core rotates 13 timesfaster than the surface. from the spectrum and radial velocities we expect thatthe doppler beaming signal should have a maximum amplitude of 300ppm in thelight curve. through binary modelling, we determine the mass of the secondarycomponent to be 0.29$\pm$0.03\,$m_\odot$. for kic5006817 we excludepseudo-synchronous rotation of the red giant with the orbit. the comparison ofthe results from seismology and modelling of the light curve shows a possiblealignment of the rotational and orbital axis at the 2$\sigma$ level. red gianteccentric systems could be progenitors of cataclysmic variables and hotsubdwarf b stars.

1403.2754	stroemgren survey for asteroseismology and galactic archaeology: let the  saga begin	asteroseismology has the capability of precisely determining stellarproperties which would otherwise be inaccessible, such as radii, masses andthus ages of stars. when coupling this information with classicaldeterminations of stellar parameters, such as metallicities, effectivetemperatures and angular diameters, powerful new diagnostics for galacticstudies can be obtained. the ongoing stroemgren survey for asteroseismology andgalactic archaeology (saga) has the goal of transforming the kepler field intoa new benchmark for galactic studies, similarly to the solar neighborhood. herewe present first results from a stripe centred at galactic longitude 74deg andcovering latitude from about 8 to 20deg, which includes almost 1000 k-giantswith seismic information and the benchmark open cluster ngc 6819. we describethe coupling of classical and seismic parameters, the accuracy as well as thecaveats of the derived effective temperatures, metallicities, distances,surface gravities, masses, and radii. confidence in the achieved precision iscorroborated by the detection of the first and secondary clump in a populationof field stars with a ratio of 2 to 1, and by the negligible scatter in theseismic distances among ngc 6819 member stars. an assessment of the reliabilityof stellar parameters in the kepler input catalogue is also performed, and theimpact of our results for population studies in the milky way is discussed,along with the importance of an all-sky stroemgren survey.

1404.3283	the wavefront of the radio signal emitted by cosmic ray air showers	analyzing measurements of the lopes antenna array together with correspondingcoreas simulations for more than 300 measured events with energy above$10^{17}\,$ev and zenith angles smaller than $45^\circ$, we find that the radiowavefront of cosmic-ray air showers is of approximately hyperbolic shape. thesimulations predict a slightly steeper wavefront towards east than towardswest, but this asymmetry is negligible against the measurement uncertainties oflopes. at axis distances $\gtrsim 50\,$m, the wavefront can be approximated bya simple cone. according to the simulations, the cone angle is clearlycorrelated with the shower maximum. thus, we confirm earlier predictions thatarrival time measurements can be used to study the longitudinal showerdevelopment, but now using a realistic wavefront. moreover, we show that thehyperbolic wavefront is compatible with our measurement, and we present severalexperimental indications that the cone angle is indeed sensitive to the showerdevelopment. consequently, the wavefront can be used to statistically study theprimary composition of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. at lopes, theexperimentally achieved precision for the shower maximum is limited bymeasurement uncertainties to approximately $140\,$g/cm$^2$. but the simulationsindicate that under better conditions this method might yield an accuracy forthe atmospheric depth of the shower maximum, $x_\mathrm{max}$, better than$30\,$g/cm$^2$. this would be competitive with the established air-fluorescenceand air-cherenkov techniques, where the radio technique offers the advantage ofa significantly higher duty-cycle. finally, the hyperbolic wavefront can beused to reconstruct the shower geometry more accurately, which potentiallyallows a better reconstruction of all other shower parameters, too.

1405.1493	m-dwarf fast rotators and the detection of relatively young multiple  m-star systems	we have searched the kepler light curves of ~3900 m-star targets for evidenceof periodicities that indicate, by means of the effects of starspots, rapidstellar rotation. several analysis techniques, including fourier transforms,inspection of folded light curves, 'sonograms', and phase tracking ofindividual modulation cycles, were applied in order to distinguish theperiodicities due to rapid rotation from those due to stellar pulsations,eclipsing binaries, or transiting planets. we find 178 kepler m-star targetswith rotation periods, p_rot, of &lt; 2 days, and 110 with p_rot &lt; 1 day. some 30of the 178 systems exhibit two or more independent short periods within thesame kepler photometric aperture, while several have three or more shortperiods. adaptive optics imaging and modeling of the kepler pixel responsefunction for a subset of our sample support the conclusion that the targetswith multiple periods are highly likely to be relatively young physical binary,triple, and even quadruple m star systems. we explore in detail the one objectwith four incommensurate periods all less than 1.2 days, and show that two ofthe periods arise from one of a close pair of stars, while the other two arisefrom the second star, which itself is probably a visual binary. if most ofthese m-star systems with multiple periods turn out to be bound m stars, thiscould prove a valuable way of discovering young hierarchical m-star systems;the same approach may also be applicable to g and k stars. the ~5% occurrencerate of rapid rotation among the ~3900 m star targets is consistent with spinevolution models that include an initial contraction phase followed by magneticbraking, wherein a typical m star can spend several hundred myr before spinningdown to periods longer than 2 days.

1406.4038	a targeted search for point sources of eev neutrons	a flux of neutrons from an astrophysical source in the galaxy can be detectedin the pierre auger observatory as an excess of cosmic-ray air showers arrivingfrom the direction of the source. to avoid the statistical penalty for makingmany trials, classes of objects are tested in combinations as nine "targetsets", in addition to the search for a neutron flux from the galactic center orfrom the galactic plane. within a target set, each candidate source is weightedin proportion to its electromagnetic flux, its exposure to the augerobservatory, and its flux attenuation factor due to neutron decay. thesesearches do not find evidence for a neutron flux from any class of candidatesources. tabulated results give the combined p-value for each class, with andwithout the weights, and also the flux upper limit for the most significantcandidate source within each class. these limits on fluxes of neutronssignificantly constrain models of eev proton emission from non-transientdiscrete sources in the galaxy.

0803.1721	most photometry of the roap star 10 aql	context: we present 31.2 days of nearly continuous most photometry of theroap star 10aql. aims:the goal was to provide an unambiguous frequencyidentification for this little studied star, as well as to discuss the detectedfrequencies in the context of magnetic models and analyze the influence of themagnetic field on the pulsation. methods: using traditional fourier analysistechniques on three independent data reductions, intrinsic frequencies for thestar are identified. theoretical non-adiabatic axisymmetric modes influenced bya magnetic field having polar field strengths bp = 0-5kg were computed tocompare the observations to theory. results: the high-precision data allow usto identify three definite intrinsic pulsation frequencies and two othercandidate frequencies with low s/n. considering the observed spacings, only one(50.95microhz) is consistent with the main sequence nature of roap stars. thecomparison with theoretical models yields a best fit for a 1.95msun modelhaving solar metallicity, suppressed envelope convection, and homogenous heliumabundance. furthermore, our analysis confirms the suspected slow rotation ofthe star and sets new lower limits to the rotation period (prot&gt;1 month) andinclination (i&gt;30\pm10deg.). conclusions:the observed frequency spectrum is notrich enough to unambiguously identify a model. on the other hand, the modelshardly represent roap stars in detail due to the approximations needed todescribe the interactions of the magnetic field with stellar structure andpulsation. consequently, errors in the model frequencies needed for the fittingprocedure can only be estimated. nevertheless, it is encouraging that modelswhich suppress convection and include solar metallicity, in agreement withcurrent concepts of roap stars, fit the observations best.

1409.3128	searches for large-scale anisotropy in the arrival directions of cosmic  rays detected above energy of $10^{19}$ ev at the pierre auger observatory  and the telescope array	spherical harmonic moments are well-suited for capturing anisotropy at anyscale in the flux of cosmic rays. an unambiguous measurement of the full set ofspherical harmonic coefficients requires full-sky coverage. this can beachieved by combining data from observatories located in both the northern andsouthern hemispheres. to this end, a joint analysis using data recorded at thetelescope array and the pierre auger observatory above $10^{19}$ ev ispresented in this work. the resulting multipolar expansion of the flux ofcosmic rays allows us to perform a series of anisotropy searches, and inparticular to report on the angular power spectrum of cosmic rays above$10^{19}$ ev. no significant deviation from isotropic expectations is foundthroughout the analyses performed. upper limits on the amplitudes of the dipoleand quadrupole moments are derived as a function of the direction in the sky,varying between 7% and 13% for the dipole and between 7% and 10% for asymmetric quadrupole.

1501.04738	the gravity metrology system: narrow-angle astrometry via phase-shifting  interferometry	the vlti instrument gravity will provide very powerful astrometry bycombining the light from four telescopes for two objects simultaneously. itwill measure the angular separation between the two astronomical objects to aprecision of 10 microarcseconds. this corresponds to a differential opticalpath difference (dopd) between the targets of few nanometers and the pathswithin the interferometer have to be maintained stable to that level. for thispurpose, the novel metrology system of gravity will monitor the internal dopdsby means of phase-shifting interferometry. we present the four-stepphase-shifting concept of the metrology with emphasis on the method used forcalibrating the phase shifts. the latter is based on a phase-step insensitivealgorithm which unambiguously extracts phases in contrast to other methods thatare strongly limited by non-linearities of the phase-shifting device. the mainconstraint of this algorithm is to introduce a robust ellipse fitting routine.via this approach we are able to measure phase shifts in the laboratory with atypical accuracy of lambda/2000 or 1 nanometer of the metrology wavelength.

1507.07389	improved absolute calibration of lopes measurements and its impact on  the comparison with reas 3.11 and coreas simulations	lopes was a digital antenna array detecting the radio emission of cosmic-rayair showers. the calibration of the absolute amplitude scale of themeasurements was done using an external, commercial reference source, whichemits a frequency comb with defined amplitudes. recently, we obtained improvedreference values by the manufacturer of the reference source, whichsignificantly changed the absolute calibration of lopes. we reanalyzedpreviously published lopes measurements, studying the impact of the changedcalibration. the main effect is an overall decrease of the lopes amplitudescale by a factor of $2.6 \pm 0.2$, affecting all previously published valuesfor measurements of the electric-field strength. this results in a major changein the conclusion of the paper 'comparing lopes measurements of air-showerradio emission with reas 3.11 and coreas simulations' published inastroparticle physics 50-52 (2013) 76-91: with the revised calibration, lopesmeasurements now are compatible with coreas simulations, but in tension withreas 3.11 simulations. since coreas is the latest version of the simulationcode incorporating the current state of knowledge on the radio emission of airshowers, this new result indicates that the absolute amplitude prediction ofcurrent simulations now is in agreement with experimental data.
