0903.1861	studying the whim with gamma ray bursts	we assess the possibility to detect and characterize the physical state ofthe missing baryons at low redshift by analyzing the x-ray absorption spectraof the gamma ray burst [grb] afterglows, measured by a micro calorimeters-baseddetector with 3 ev resolution and 1000 cm2 effective area and capable of fastre-pointing, similar to that on board of the recently proposed x-ray satellitesedge and xenia. for this purpose we have analyzed mock absorption spectraextracted from different hydrodynamical simulations used to model theproperties of the warm hot intergalactic medium [whim]. these models predictthe correct abundance of ovi absorption lines observed in uv and satisfycurrent x-ray constraints. according to these models space missions like edgeand xenia should be able to detect about 60 whim absorbers per year through theovii line. about 45 % of these have at least two more detectable lines inaddition to ovii that can be used to determine the density and the temperatureof the gas. systematic errors in the estimates of the gas density andtemperature can be corrected for in a robust, largely model-independentfashion. the analysis of the grb absorption spectra collected in three yearswould also allow to measure the cosmic mass density of the whim with about 15 %accuracy, although this estimate depends on the whim model. our results suggestthat grbs represent a valid, if not preferable, alternative to active galacticnuclei to study the whim in absorption. the analysis of the absorption spectranicely complements the study of the whim in emission that the spectrometerproposed for edge and xenia would be able to carry out thanks to its highsensitivity and large field of view.

0907.0384	extremely energetic fermi gamma-ray bursts obey spectral energy  correlations	the extremely energetic fermi grbs 080916c, with its eiso of ~ 10^{55} erg in1 kev - 10 gev and intense gev emission, and 090323 give us a uniqueopportunity to test the reliability and extension of spectral energycorrelations. based on konus/wind and fermi spectral measurements, we find thatboth events are fully consistent with the updated (95 events as of april 2009)ep,i - eiso correlation, thus further confirming and extending it and pointingagainst a possible flattening or increased dispersion at very high energies.this also suggests that the physics behind the emission of peculiarly brightand hard grbs is the same as for softer and weaker ones. in addition, we findthat the normalization of the correlation obtained by considering these twogrbs and the other long ones for which ep,i was measured with high accuracy bythe fermi/gbm are fully consistent with those obtained by other instruments(e.g., bepposax, swift, konus-wind), thus indicating that the correlation isnot affected significantly by detectors limited thresholds and energy bands.prompted by the extension of the spectrum of grb 080916c up to several gevswithout any excess or cut-off, we also investigated if the evaluation of eisoin the commonly adopted 1 kev - 10 mev energy band may bias the ep,i - eisocorrelation contributing to its scatter. by computing eiso from 1 kev to 10gev, the slope of the correlation becomes slightly flatter, while itsdispersion does not change significantly. finally, we find that grb 080916c isalso consistent with most of the other spectral energy correlations derivedfrom it, with the possible exception of the ep,i - eiso - tb correlation.

1002.2232	the ep,i - eiso correlation and fermi gamma-ray bursts	the ep,i - eiso correlation is one of the most intriguing properties of grbs,with significant implications for the understanding of the physics and geometryof the prompt emission, the identification and investigation of differentclasses of grbs, the use of grbs as cosmological probes. the fermi satellite,by exploiting the high accuracy of the gbm instrument in the measurement of ep,the simultaneous detection of grbs with swift, and the detection andlocalization of grbs in the gev energy range by the lat instrument, is allowingus to enrich the sample of of grbs with known redshift and reliable estimate ofep,i, and, thus, to further test the robustness, reliability and extension ofthis correlation. based on published results and preliminary spectral dataavailable as of the end of 2009, it is found that the locations in the ep,i -eiso plane of fermi long and short grbs with measured redshift, includingextremely energetic events, are consistent with the results provided byprevious / other experiments.

1006.4469	searching for differences in swift's intermediate grbs	gamma-ray bursts are usually classified through their high-energy emissioninto short-duration and long-duration bursts, which presumably reflect twodifferent types of progenitors. however, it has been shown on statisticalgrounds that a third, intermediate population is needed in this classificationscheme, although an extensive study of the properties of this class has so farnot been done. the large amount of follow-up studies generated during the swiftera allows us to have a suficient sample to attempt a study of this thirdpopulation through the properties of their prompt emission and theirafterglows. our study is focused on a sample of grbs observed by swift duringits first four years of operation. the sample contains those bursts withmeasured redshift since this allows us to derive intrinsic properties.intermediate bursts are less energetic and have dimmer afterglows than longgrbs, especially when considering the x-ray light curves, which are on averageone order of magnitude fainter than long bursts. there is a less significanttrend in the redshift distribution that places intermediate bursts closer thanlong bursts. except for this, intermediate bursts show similar properties tolong bursts. in particular, they follow the epeak vs. eiso correlation andhave, on average, positive spectral lags with a distribution similar to that oflong bursts. like long grbs, they normally have an associated supernova,although some intermediate bursts have shown no supernova component. this studyshows that intermediate bursts are different from short bursts and, in spite ofsharing many properties with long bursts, there are some differences betweenthem as well. we suggest that the physical difference between intermediate andlong bursts could be that for the first the ejecta are thin shells while forthe latter they are thick shells.

1007.0383	the swift/fermi grb 080928 from 1 ev to 150 kev	we present the results of a comprehensive study of the gamma-ray burst 080928and of its afterglow. grb 080928 was a long burst detected by swift/bat andfermi/gbm. it is one of the exceptional cases where optical emission hadalready been detected when the grb itself was still radiating in the gamma-rayband. for nearly 100 seconds simultaneous optical, x-ray and gamma-ray dataprovide a coverage of the spectral energy distribution of the transient sourcefrom about 1 ev to 150 kev. in particular, we show that the sed during the mainprompt emission phase agrees with synchrotron radiation. we constructed theoptical/near-infrared light curve and the spectral energy distribution based onswift/uvot, rotse-iiia (australia), and grond (la silla) data and compared itto the x-ray light curve retrieved from the swift/xrt repository. we show thatits bumpy shape can be modeled by multiple energy-injections into the forwardshock.furthermore, we investigate whether the temporal and spectral evolutionof the tail emission of the first strong flare seen in the early x-ray lightcurve can be explained by large-angle emission (lae). we find that anonstandard lae model is required to explain the observations. finally, wereport on the results of our search for the grb host galaxy, for which only adeep upper limit can be provided.

1007.4769	challenging grb models through the broadband dataset of grb060908	context: multiwavelength observations of gamma-ray burst prompt and afterglowemission are a key tool to disentangle the various possible emission processesand scenarios proposed to interpret the complex gamma-ray burst phenomenology.aims: we collected a large dataset on grb060908 in order to carry out acomprehensive analysis of the prompt emission as well as the early and lateafterglow. methods: data from swift-bat, -xrt and -uvot together with data froma number of different ground-based optical/nir and millimeter telescopesallowed us to follow the afterglow evolution from about a minute from thehigh-energy event down to the host galaxy limit. we discuss the physicalparameters required to model these emissions. results: the prompt emission ofgrb060908 was characterized by two main periods of activity, spaced by a fewseconds of low intensity, with a tight correlation between activity andspectral hardness. observations of the afterglow began less than one minuteafter the high-energy event, when it was already in a decaying phase, and itwas characterized by a rather flat optical/nir spectrum which can beinterpreted as due to a hard energy-distribution of the emitting electrons. onthe other hand, the x-ray spectrum of the afterglow could be fit by a rathersoft electron distribution. conclusions: grb060908 is a good example of agamma-ray burst with a rich multi-wavelength set of observations. theavailability of this dataset, built thanks to the joint efforts of manydifferent teams, allowed us to carry out stringent tests for variousinterpretative scenarios showing that a satisfactorily modeling of this eventis challenging. in the future, similar efforts will enable us to obtainoptical/nir coverage comparable in quality and quantity to the x-ray data formore events, therefore opening new avenues to progress gamma-ray burstresearch.

1010.5379	spectral catalogue of bright gamma-ray bursts detected with the  bepposax/grbm	the emission process responsible for the so-called "prompt" emission ofgamma-ray bursts is still unknown. a number of empirical models fitting thetypical spectrum still lack a satisfactory interpretation. a few grb spectralcatalogues derived from past and present experiments are known in theliterature and allow to tackle the issue of spectral properties of gamma-raybursts on a statistical ground. we extracted and studied the time-integratedphoton spectra of the 200 brightest grbs observed with the gamma-ray burstmonitor which flew aboard the bepposax mission (1996-2002) to provide anindependent statistical characterisation of grb spectra. the spectra were fitwith three models: a simple power-law, a cut-off power law or a band function.the typical photon spectrum of a bright grb consists of a low-energy indexaround 1.0 and a peak energy of the nufnu spectrum e_p~240 kev in agreementwith previous results on a sample of bright cgro/batse bursts. spectra of ~35%of grbs can be fit with a power-law with a photon index around 2, indicative ofpeak energies either close to or outside the grbm energy boundaries. we confirmthe correlation between e_p and fluence, with a logarithmic dispersion of 0.13around the power-law with index 0.21+-0.06. the low-energy and peak energydistributions are not yet explained in the current literature. the capabilityof measuring time-resolved spectra over a broadband energy range, ensuringprecise measurements of parameters such as e_p, will be crucial for futureexperiments (abridged).

1104.2048	origin: metal creation and evolution from the cosmic dawn	origin is a proposal for the m3 mission call of esa aimed at the study ofmetal creation from the epoch of cosmic dawn. using high-spectral resolution inthe soft x-ray band, origin will be able to identify the physical conditions ofall abundant elements between c and ni to red-shifts of z=10, and beyond. themission will answer questions such as: when were the first metals created? howdoes the cosmic metal content evolve? where do most of the metals reside in theuniverse? what is the role of metals in structure formation and evolution? toreach out to the early universe origin will use gamma-ray bursts (grbs) tostudy their local environments in their host galaxies. this requires thecapability to slew the satellite in less than a minute to the grb location. bystudying the chemical composition and properties of clusters of galaxies we canextend the range of exploration to lower redshifts (z ~ 0.2). for this task weneed a high-resolution spectral imaging instrument with a large field of view.using the same instrument, we can also study the so far only partially detectedbaryons in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim). the less dense part of thewhim will be studied using absorption lines at low redshift in the spectra forgrbs.

1105.4915	a photometric redshift of z ~ 9.4 for grb 090429b	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) serve as powerful probes of the early universe, withtheir luminous afterglows revealing the locations and physical properties ofstar forming galaxies at the highest redshifts, and potentially locating firstgeneration (population iii) stars. since grb afterglows have intrinsically verysimple spectra, they allow robust redshifts from low signal to noisespectroscopy, or photometry. here we present a photometric redshift of z~9.4for the swift-detected grb 090429b based on deep observations withgemini-north, the very large telescope, and the grb optical and near-infrareddetector. assuming a small magellanic cloud dust law (which has been found in amajority of grb sight-lines), the 90% likelihood range for the redshift is 9.06&lt; z &lt; 9.52, although there is a low-probability tail to somewhat lowerredshifts. adopting milky way or large magellanic cloud dust laws leads to verysimilar conclusions, while a maiolino law does allow somewhat lower redshiftsolutions, but in all cases the most likely redshift is found to be z&gt;7. thenon-detection of the host galaxy to deep limits (y_ab &gt;~ 28 mag, which wouldcorrespond roughly to 0.001 l* at z=1) in our late time optical and infraredobservations with the hubble space telescope strongly supports the extremeredshift origin of grb 090429b, since we would expect to have detected anylow-z galaxy, even if it were highly dusty. finally, the energetics of grb090429b are comparable to those of other grbs, and suggest that its progenitoris not greatly different to those of lower redshift bursts.

0710.1327	unveiling grb hard x-ray afterglow emission with simbol-x	despite the enormous progress occurred in the last 10 years, the gamma-raybursts (grb) phenomenon is still far to be fully understood. one of the mostimportant open issues that have still to be settled is the afterglow emissionabove 10 kev, which is almost completely unexplored. this is due to the lack ofsensitive enough detectors operating in this energy band. the only detection,by the bepposax/pds instrument (15-200 kev), of hard x-ray emission from a grb(the very bright grb 990123), combined with optical and radio observations,seriously challenged the standard scenario in which the dominant mechanism issynchrotron radiation produced in the shock of a ultra-relativistic fireballwith the ism, showing the need of a substantial revision of present models. inthis respect, thanks to its unprecedented sensitivity in the 10-80 kev energyband, simbol-x, through follow-up observations of bright grbs detected andlocalized by grb dedicated experiments that will fly in the &gt;2010 time frame,will provide an important breakthrough in the grb field.

[...]. aims: in precise analogy with grb 090618 we aim to analyze the89s of emission of grb 101023 to see if we are in presence of two differentepisodes: the first one presenting a characteristic black-body temperatureevolution, evolving in time with a broken power-law, and the second oneconsistent with a canonical grb. [...] results: we confirm that the firstepisode can be well fit by a black body plus a power-law model. the temperaturechanges with time following a broken power law, and the photon index of thepower-law component presents a soft to hard evolution. we estimate the radiusof this source, increasing with time with a velocity of 1.5x10^4 km/s. thesecond episode appears to be a canonical grb. by using the amati relation andthe atteia relation, we determine the cosmological redshift, z ~ 0.9 +- 0.084(stat.) +- 0.2 (sys.). [...]. particularly striking is the scaling law of thesoft x-ray component of the afterglow. conclusions: we identify grb 090618 andgrb 101023 with a new family of grbs presenting a double astrophysicalcomponent. a first one, related to the proto-black hole, prior to the processof gravitational collapse (episode 1) and a second one which is the canonicalgrb (episode 2) emitted during the formation of the black-hole. [...] thisanalysis indicates progress towards developing a grb distance indicator basedon the understanding of the p-grb and the prompt radiation as well as the softx-ray behavior of the late afterglow.

1202.1434	a deep search for the host galaxies of grbs with no detected optical  afterglow	gamma-ray bursts can provide information about star formation at highredshifts. even in the absence of a optical/near-infrared/radio afterglow, thehigh detection rate of x-ray afterglows by swift/xrt and its localizationprecision of 2-3 arcsec facilitates the identification and study of grb hostgalaxies. we focus on the search for the host galaxies of a sample of 17 burstswith xrt error circles but no detected long-wavelength afterglow. three ofthese events can also be classified as truly dark bursts: the observed upperlimit on the optical flux of the afterglow was less than expected based on thex-ray flux. our study is based on deep r and k-band observations performed witheso/vlt instruments, supported by grond and newfirm. to be conservative, wesearched for host galaxies in an area with a radius twice the 90% swift/xrterror circle. for 15 of the 17 bursts we find at least one galaxy inside thedoubled xrt error circle. in seven cases we discover extremely red objects inthe error circles. the most remarkable case is the host of grb 080207 which asa colour of r-k~4.7 mag (ab), one of the reddest galaxies ever associated witha grb. as a by-product of our study we identify the optical afterglow of grb070517a. optically dim afterglows result from cosmological lyman drop out anddust extinction, but the former process is only equired for a minority of cases(&lt;1/3). extinction by dust in the host galaxies might explain all other events.thereby, a seemingly non-negligible fraction of these hosts are globallydust-enshrouded, extremely red galaxies. this suggests that bursts withoptically dim afterglows trace a subpopulation of massive starburst galaxies,which are markedly different from the main body of the grb host galaxypopulation, namely the blue, subluminous, compact galaxies.

1202.3443	average power density spectrum of swift long gamma-ray bursts in the  observer and in the source rest frames	we calculate the average power density spectra (pds) of 244 long gamma-raybursts detected with the swift burst alert telescope in the 15-150 kev bandfrom january 2005 to august 2011. for the first time we derived the average pdsin the source rest frame of 97 grbs with known redshift. for 49 of them anaverage pds was also obtained in a common source-frame energy band to accountfor the dependence of time profiles on energy. previous results obtained onbatse grbs with unknown redshift showed that the average spectrum in the25-2000 kev band could be modelled with a power-law with a 5/3 index overnearly two decades of frequency with a break at ~1 hz. depending on thenormalisation and on the subset of grbs considered, our results show analogousto steeper slopes (between 1.7 and 2.0) of the power-law. however, no clearevidence for the break at ~1 hz was found, although the softer energy band ofbat compared with batse might account for that. we instead find a break atlower frequency corresponding to a typical source rest frame characteristictime of a few seconds. we furthermore find no significant differences betweenobserver and source rest frames. notably, no distinctive pds features are foundfor grbs with different intrinsic properties of the prompt emission either.finally, the average pds of grbs at higher redshifts shows possibly shallowerpower-law indices than that of low-z grbs. it is not clear whether this is dueto an evolution with z of the average pds.

1404.6654	diversity of grb energetics vs. sn homogeneity: supernova 2013cq  associated with the gamma-ray burst 130427a	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been found to be associated withbroad-lined type-ic supernovae (sne), but only a handful of cases have beenstudied in detail. prompted by the discovery of the exceptionally bright,nearby grb130427a (redshift z=0.3399), we aim at characterising the propertiesof its associated sn2013cq. this is the first opportunity to test directly theprogenitors of high-luminosity grbs. we monitored the field of the swift longduration grb130427a using the 3.6-m tng and the 8.2-m vlt during the timeinterval between 3.6 and 51.6 days after the burst. photometric andspectroscopic observations revealed the presence of the type ic sn2013cq.spectroscopic analysis suggests that sn2013cq resembles two previous grb-sne,sn1998bw and sn2010bh associated with grb980425 and xrf100316d, respectively.the bolometric light curve of sn2013cq, which is significantly affected by thehost galaxy contribution, is systematically more luminous than that of sn2010bh($\sim$ 2 mag at peak), but is consistent with sn1998bw. the comparison withthe light curve model of another grb-connected sn2003dh, indicates thatsn2013cq is consistent with the model when brightened by 20%. this suggests asynthesised radioactive $^{56}$ni mass of $\sim 0.4 m_\odot$.grb130427a/sn2013cq is the first case of low-z grb-sn connection where the grbenergetics are extreme ($e_{\rm \gamma, iso} \sim 10^{54}$ erg). we show thatthe maximum luminosities attained by sne associated with grbs span a verynarrow range, but those associated with xrfs are significantly less luminous.on the other hand the isotropic energies of the accompanying grbs span 6 ordersof magnitude (10$^{48}$ erg $&lt; e_{\rm \gamma, iso} &lt;$ 10$^{54}$ erg), althoughthis range is reduced when corrected for jet collimation. the grb totalradiated energy is in fact a small fraction of the sn energy budget.

1408.6227	a search for \textit{fermi} bursts associated to supernovae and their  frequency of occurrence	context: observations suggest that the major fraction of long durationgamma-ray bursts (grbs) are connected with broad-lines supernovae ib/c,(sne-ibc). the presence of grb-sne is revealed by rebrightenings emerging fromthe optical grb afterglow $10$--$15$ days, in the rest-frame of the source,after the prompt grb emission. aims: \textit{fermi}-gbm has a field of view(fov) which is about 6.5 times larger than the fov of \textit{swift}, thereforewe expect that a number of grb-sn connections have been missed due to lack ofoptical and x-ray instruments on board of \textit{fermi}, which are essentialto reveal sne associated with grbs. this fact has motivated our search in the\textit{fermi} catalogue for possible grb-sn events. methods: the search forpossible grb-sn associations follows two requirements: (1) sn should fallinside the \textit{fermi}-gbm error box of the considered long grb, and (2)this grb should occur within $20$ days before the sn event. results: we havefound $5$ cases, within $z&lt;0.2$ fulfilling the above reported requirements. oneof them, grb 130702a-sn 2013dx, was already known as grb-sn association. wehave analyzed the remaining $4$ cases and we concluded that three of them are,very likely, just random coincidences, due to the \textit{fermi}-gbm largeerror box associated with each grb detection. we found one grb possiblyassociated with a sn 1998bw-like, grb 120121b/sn 2012ba. conclusions: the verylow redshift of grb 120121b/sn 2012ba ($z = 0.017$) implies a low isotropicenergy of this burst ($e_{iso} = 1.39 \times 10^{48}$) erg. we then compute therate of \textit{fermi} low-luminosity grbs connected with sne to be $\rho_{0,b}\leq 770\ $gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$. we estimate that \textit{fermi}-gbm coulddetect $1$--$4$ grbs-sne within $z \leq 0.2$ in the next 4 years.

1501.02706	a common stochastic process rules gamma-ray burst prompt emission and  x-ray flares	prompt gamma-ray and early x-ray afterglow emission in gamma-ray bursts(grbs) are characterized by a bursty behavior and are often interspersed withlong quiescent times. there is compelling evidence that x-ray flares are linkedto prompt gamma-rays. however, the physical mechanism that leads to the complextemporal distribution of gamma-ray pulses and x-ray flares is not understood.here we show that the waiting time distribution (wtd) of pulses and flaresexhibits a power-law tail extending over 4 decades with index ~2 and can be themanifestation of a common time-dependent poisson process. this result is robustand is obtained on different catalogs. surprisingly, grbs with many (&gt;=8)gamma-ray pulses are very unlikely to be accompanied by x-ray flares after theend of the prompt emission (3.1 sigma gaussian confidence). these results areconsistent with a simple interpretation: an hyperaccreting disk breaks up intoone or a few groups of fragments, each of which is independently accreted withthe same probability per unit time. prompt gamma-rays and late x-ray flares arenothing but different fragments being accreted at the beginning and at the end,respectively, following the very same stochastic process and likely the samemechanism.

1502.02676	accessing the population of high redshift gamma ray bursts	gamma ray bursts (grbs) are a powerful probe of the high redshift universe.we present a tool to estimate the detection rate of high-z grbs by a genericdetector with defined energy band and sensitivity. we base this on a populationmodel that reproduces the observed properties of grbs detected by swift, fermiand cgro in the hard x-ray and gamma-ray bands. we provide the expectedcumulative distributions of the flux and fluence of simulated grbs in differentenergy bands. we show that scintillator detectors, operating at relatively highenergies (e.g. tens of kev to the mev), can detect only the most luminous grbsat high redshifts due to the link between the peak spectral energy and theluminosity (ep-liso) of grbs. we show that the best strategy for catching thelargest number of high-z bursts is to go softer (e.g. in the soft x-ray band)but with a very high sensitivity. for instance, an imaging soft x-ray detectoroperating in the 0.2-5 kev energy band reaching a sensitivity, corresponding toa fluence of ~10^-8 erg cm^-2, is expected to detect ~40 grbs yr^-1 sr^-1 atz&gt;5 (~3 grbs yr^-1 sr^-1 at z&gt;10). once high-z grbs are detected the principalissue is to secure their redshift. to this aim we estimate their nir afterglowflux at relatively early times and evaluate the effectiveness of following themup and construct usable samples of events with any forthcoming grb missiondedicated to explore the high-z universe.

0804.4367	the complex light-curve of the afterglow of grb071010a	we present and discuss the results of an extensive observational campaigndevoted to grb071010a, a long-duration gamma-ray burst detected by the swiftsatellite. this event was followed for almost a month in theoptical/near-infrared (nir) with various telescopes starting from about 2minafter the high-energy event. swift-xrt observations started only later at about0.4d. the light-curve evolution allows us to single out an initial rising phasewith a maximum at about 7min, possibly the afterglow onset in the context ofthe standard fireball model, which is then followed by a smooth decayinterrupted by a sharp rebrightening at about 0.6d. the rebrightening wasvisible in both the optical/nir and x-rays and can be interpreted as an episodeof discrete energy injection, although various alternatives are possible. asteepening of the afterglow light curve is recorded at about 1d. the entireevolution of the optical/nir afterglow is consistent with being achromatic.this could be one of the few identified grb afterglows with an achromatic breakin the x-ray through the optical/nir bands. polarimetry was also obtained atabout 1d, just after the rebrightening and almost coincident with thesteepening. this provided a fairly tight upper limit of 0.9% for thepolarized-flux fraction.

0805.0377	measuring the cosmological parameters with the ep,i-eiso correlation of  gamma-ray bursts	we have used the ep,i-eiso correlation of grbs to measure the cosmologicalparameter omega_m. by adopting a maximum likelihood approach which allows us tocorrectly quantify the extrinsic (i.e. non--poissonian) scatter of thecorrelation, we constrain (for a flat universe) omega_m to 0.04-0.40 (68%confidence level), with a best fit value of omega_m ~ 0.15, and exclude omega_m= 1 at 99.9% confidence level. if we release the assumption of a flat universe,we still find evidence for a low value of omega_m (0.04-0.50 at 68% confidencelevel) and a weak dependence of the dispersion of the ep,i-eiso correlation onomega_lambda (with an upper limit of omega_lambda ~ 1.15 at 90% confidencelevel). our approach makes no assumptions on the ep,i-eiso correlation and itdoes not use other calibrators to set the "zero' point of the relation,therefore our treatment of the data is not affected by circularity and theresults are independent of those derived via type ia sne (or other cosmologicalprobes). unlike other multi-parameters correlations, our analysis grounds ononly two parameters, then including a larger number (a factor ~3) of grbs andbeing less affected by systematics. simulations based on realisticextrapolations of ongoing (and future) grb experiments (e.g., swift,konus-wind, glast) show that: i) the uncertainties on cosmological parameterscan be significantly decreased; ii) future data will allow us to get clues onthe "dark energy" evolution.

astro-ph;0002229	bepposax spectrum of grb971214: evidence of a substantial energy output  during afterglow	we report the x/gamma-ray spectrum of grb971214 and of its afterglow. theafterglow was measured few hours after the main event and for an elapsed timeof more than two days. the measure of this grb and afterglow is relevant due toits extreme, cosmological distance (z=3.42). the prompt event shows a hardphoton spectrum, consistent with a broken power law with photon indicesgamma_x~0.1 below ~20 kev and gamma_g~1.3 above 60 kev. the afterglow spectrum,measured with the mecs and lecs bepposax telescopes, is consistent with a powerlaw with spectral photon index gamma=1.6. within the statistical accuracy ofour measure no spectral evolution is detected during the observation of theafterglow. when integrated during the time span covered by bepposaxobservations, the power in the afterglow emission, even with very conservativeassumptions, is at least comparable with the power in the main event. their-to-x rays broad band spectrum is also presented, collecting data from theliterature and adding them to the bepposax measure. it shows that thepredictions from synchrotron emission models is qualitatively confirmed. thebepposax measurement of the x and gamma ray spectrum of this grb/afterglow isdiscussed in the framework of current theoretical models.

astro-ph;0009044	hard x-rays from type ii bursts of the rapid burster and its transition  toward quiescence	we report on 4 bepposax target of opportunity observations of mxb 1730-335,the rapid burster (rb), made during the 1998 february-march outburst. in thefirst observation, approximately 20 days after the outburst peak, the x-raylight curve showed type ii bursts at a rate of 43 per hour. nine days later,during the second bepposax pointing, only 5 type ii bursts were detected at thebeginning of the observation. during the third pointing no x-ray bursts weredetected and in the fourth and final observation the rb was not detected atall. persistent emission from the rb was detected up to 10 kev during the firstthree pointings. the spectra of the persistent and bursting emissions below 10kev were best fit with a model consisting of two blackbodies. an additionalcomponent (a power law) was needed to describe the 1-100 kev bursting spectrumwhen the persistent emission was subtracted. to our knowledge, this is thefirst detection of the rb beyond 20 kev. we discuss the evolution of thespectral parameters for the bursting and persistent emission during theoutburst decay. the light curve, after the second bepposax pointing, showed asteepening of the previous decay trend, and a sharper decay rate leading toquiescence was observed with bepposax in the two subsequent observations. weinterpret this behaviour as caused by the onset of the propeller effect.finally, we infer a neutron star magnetic field b ~ 4 10^8 gauss.

astro-ph;0104062	on the absorption feature in the prompt x-ray spectrum of grb 990705	the absorption feature detected in the prompt x-ray emission of grb 990705bears important consequences. we investigate different production mechanismsand we conclude that the absorbing material cannot be very close to the bursterand is likely to be moderately clumped. these properties challenge any model inwhich the burst explodes in coincidence with the core-collapse of a massiverotating star. we show that the straightforward interpretation of theabsorption feature as a photoionization k edge of neutral iron faces a severeproblem in that it requires a huge amount of iron in the close vicinity of theburster. we then discuss an alternative scenario, in which iron ions are keptin a high ionization state by the burst flux, and the absorption feature isproduced by resonant scattering from hydrogen-like iron, broadened by a rangeoutflow velocities. in this case the physical conditions and geometry of theabsorbing material are fully consistent with the presence of a young supernovaremnant surrounding the burst site at a radius r ~ 10^{16} cm. we finallydiscuss how this remnant might affect the generation of afterglows with astandard power-law flux decay.

astro-ph;0406575	a decreasing column density during the prompt emission from grb000528  observed with bepposax	we report observation results of the prompt x-- and $\gamma$--ray emissionfrom grb 000528. this event was detected with the gamma-ray burst monitor andone of the two wide field cameras aboard the bepposax satellite. the grb waspromptly followed on with the bepposax narrow field instruments and with groundoptical and radio telescopes. the x-ray afterglow source was identified, but nooptical or radio counterpart found. we report here results from the prompt andafterglow emission analysis. the main feature derived from spectral evolutionof the prompt emission is a high hydrogen-equivalent column density withevidence of its decrease with time. we model this behavior in terms of atime-dependent photoionization of the local circum-burst medium, finding that acompact and dense environment is required by the data. we also find a fading ofthe late part of the 2--10 kev prompt emission which is consistent withafterglow emission. we discuss this result in the light of the external shockmodel scenario.

astro-ph;0412589	probing the environment in gamma-ray bursts: the case of an x-ray  precursor, afterglow late onset and wind vs constant density profile in  grb011121 and grb011211	in this paper we present bepposax and xmm observations of two long gamma-raybursts, the x-ray rich event of december 11, 2001 (grb011211) and the hard andvery bright event of november 21, 2001 (grb011121). in both events we findevidence of a late x-ray burst, taking place several minutes after the promptemission. the temporal and spectral behaviour of this phenomenon suggest thatit represents the onset of the afterglow. broad band spectral modelling of theafterglow indicate that the fireball evolution in the december burst takesplace in a ism environment. on the contrary in the november burst the wind caseis revealed by an x-ray decay slower than that observed in the optical($\delta_{\rm x}=1.29\pm0.04$ vs $\delta_{\rm o}=1.66\pm0.06$). the windprofile should change into a constant density profile at large radii, in orderto reconcile late-time radio data with a jet. two other results are obtainedfor this burst. an x-ray burst is preceding by about 30 s the much harder grb.contrary to the prediction of simple models of precursor activity forcollapsars, its spectrum is not consistent with a black body. finally, asubstantial absorption column ($\nh=(7\pm2)\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$) isdetected during the early part of the prompt emission. this is much greaterthan that of the wind, and it is thus likely associated with the regionsurrounding the burst.

astro-ph;0501206	the transient hard x-ray tail of gx 17+2: new bepposax results	we report on results of two bepposax observations of the z source gx 17+2. inboth cases the source is in the horizontal branch of the colour-intensitydiagram. the persistent continuum can be fit by two-component models consistingof a blackbody plus a comptonization spectrum. with one of these models, twosolutions for the blackbody temperature of both the observed and seed photonsfor comptonization are equally accepted by the data. in the first observation,when the source is on the left part of the horizontal branch, we observe a hardtail extending up to 120 kev, while in the second observation, when the sourcemoves towards right in the same branch, the tail is no longer detected. thehard ($\ga 30$ kev) x-ray emission can be modeled either by a simple power-lawwith photon index $\gamma \sim$ 2.7, or assuming comptonization of $\sim$ 1 kevsoft photons off a hybrid thermal plus non-thermal electron plasma. thespectral index of the non-thermal injected electrons is $p \sim 1.7$. theobservation of hard {x-ray} emission only in the left part of the horizontalbranch could be indicative of the presence of a threshold in the accretion rateabove which the hard tail disappears. an emission line at 6.7 kev withequivalent width $\sim 30$ ev is also found in both observations. we discussthese results and their physical implications

astro-ph;0504592	late-epoch optical and near-infrared observations of the grb000911  afterglow and its host galaxy	we present the results of an optical and near-infrared (nir) monitoringcampaign of the counterpart of gamma-ray burst (grb) 000911, located atredshift z=1.06, from 5 days to more than 13 months after explosion. ourextensive dataset is a factor of 2 larger and spans a time interval about 4times longer than the ones considered previously for this grb afterglow; thisallows a more thorough analysis of its light curve and of the grb host galaxyproperties. the afterglow light curves show a single power-law temporaldecline, modified at late times by light from a host galaxy with moderateintrinsic extinction, and possibly by an emerging supernova (sn). the afterglowevolution is interpreted within the classical "fireball" scenario as a weaklycollimated adiabatic shock propagating in the interstellar medium. the presenceof a sn light curve superimposed on the non-thermal afterglow emission isinvestigated: while in the optical bands no significant contribution to thetotal light is found from a sn, the nir j-band data show an excess which isconsistent with a sn as bright as the known hypernova sn1998bw. if the sninterpretation is true, this would be the farthest grb-associated sn, as wellas the farthest core-collapse sn, discovered to date. however, other possibleexplanations of this nir excess are also investigated. finally, we studied thephotometric properties of the host, and found that it is likely to be aslightly reddened, subluminous, extreme starburst compact galaxy, withluminosity about 0.1 l*, an age of about 0.5 gyr and a specific star formationrate (sfr) of approximately 30 msol yr-1 (l/l*)-1. this is the highest specificsfr value for a grb host inferred from optical/nir data.

astro-ph;0504607	the puzzling case of grb 990123: prompt emission and broad-band  afterglow modeling	we report on bepposax simultaneous x- and gamma-ray observations of thebright grb 990123. we present the broad-band spectrum of the prompt emission,including optical, x- and gamma-rays, confirming the suggestion that theemission mechanisms at low and high frequencies must have different physicalorigins. in the framework of the standard fireball model, we discuss the x-rayafterglow observed by the nfis and its hard x-ray emission up to 60 kev severalhours after the burst, detected for about 20 ks by the pds. considering the2-10 kev and optical light curves, the 0.1-60 kev spectrum during the 20 ks inwhich the pds signal was present and the 8.46 ghz upper limits, we find thatthe multi-wavelength observations cannot be readily accommodated by basicafterglow models. while the temporal and spectral behavior of the opticalafterglow is possibly explained by a synchrotron cooling frequency between theoptical and the x-ray energy band during the nfis observations, in x-rays thisassumption only accounts for the slope of the 2-10 kev light curve, but not forthe flatness of the 0.1-60 kev spectrum. including the contribution of inversecompton (ic) scattering, we solve the problem of the flat x-ray spectrum andjustify the hard x-ray emission; we suggest that the lack of a significantdetection of 15-60 kev emission in the following 75 ks and last 70 ks spectra,should be related to poorer statistics rather than to an important suppressionof ic contribution. however, considering also the radio band data, we find the8.46 ghz upper limits violated. on the other hand, leaving unchanged theemission mechanism requires modifying the hydrodynamics by invoking an ambientmedium whose density rises rapidly with radius and by having the shock losingenergy. thus we are left with an open puzzle which requires further inspection.

astro-ph;0603530	an optical supernova associated with the x-ray flash xrf 060218	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are associated with type ic supernovaethat are more luminous than average and that eject material at very highvelocities. less-luminous supernovae were not hitherto known to be associatedwith grbs, and therefore grb-supernovae were thought to be rare events. whetherx-ray flashes - analogues of grbs, but with lower luminosities and fewergamma-rays - can also be associated with supernovae, and whether they areintrinsically 'weak' events or typical grbs viewed off the axis of the burst,is unclear. here we report the optical discovery and follow-up observations ofthe type ic supernova sn 2006aj associated with x-ray flash xrf 060218.supernova 2006aj is intrinsically less luminous than the grb-supernovae, butmore luminous than many supernovae not accompanied by a grb. the ejectavelocities derived from our spectra are intermediate between these two groups,which is consistent with the weakness of both the grb output and the supernovaradio flux. our data, combined with radio and x-ray observations, suggest thatxrf 060218 is an intrinsically weak and soft event, rather than a classical grbobserved off-axis. this extends the grb-supernova connection to x-ray flashesand fainter supernovae, implying a common origin. events such as xrf 060218 areprobably more numerous than grb-supernovae.

(2005) in logl-logv plane isstill well described with slope m = 3.4^{+0.9}_{-0.6}. here we compare theresults of two methods accounting for the variance of the sample, thatimplemented by reichart (2001) and that by d'agostini (2005). we demonstratethat the method by reichart (2001) provides an inconsistent estimate of theslope when the sample variance is comparable with the interval of valuescovered by the variability. we also show that, using the d'agostini method, theslope is consistent with that derived by us earlier and inconsistent with thatderived by reichart &amp; nysewander (2005). finally we discuss the implications onthe interpretations and show that our results are in agreement with the peakenergy/variability correlation found by lloyd-ronning &amp; ramirez-ruiz (2002) andthe peak energy/peak luminosity correlation (yonetoku et al. 2004; ghirlanda etal. 2005) [abridged].

astro-ph;0611489	gamma-ray lens development status for a european gamma-ray imager	a breakthrough in the sensitivity level of the hard x-/gamma-ray telescopes,which today are based on detectors that view the sky through (or not) codedmasks, is expected when focusing optics will be available also in this energyrange. focusing techniques are now in an advanced stage of development. to datethe most efficient technique to focus hard x-rays with energies above 100 kevappears to be the bragg diffraction from crystals in transmission configuration(laue lenses). crystals with mosaic structure appear to be the most suitable tobuild a laue lens with a broad passband, even though other alternativestructures are being investigated. the goal of our project is the developmentof a broad band focusing telescope based on gamma-ray lenses for the study ofthe continuum emission of celestial sources from 60 kev up to &gt;600 kev. we willreport details of our project, its development status and results of ourassessment study of a lens configuration for the european gamma ray imager(gri) mission now under study for the esa plan "cosmic vision 2015-2025".

astro-ph;9707215	the first x-ray localization of a gamma-ray burst by bepposax and its  fast spectral evolution	in this paper we present the observations performed by the bepposax gamma-rayburst monitor (grbm) and wide field cameras (wfc) of gb960720. we derive aprecise localization (3 arcmin radius) and fast broad band (2-700 kev) spectralevolution of the event. a search in the catalogues at all wavelengths in theerror box yields a unique outstanding source: the bright radio quasar 4c 49.29.although the probability of finding such a source by chance is very low(0.0002), the absence of similar counterparts in other small error boxessuggests a chance occurrence. we also find that the duration-energyrelationship for bursts previously observed above 25kev (fenimore et al. 1995)extends down to 1.5 kev. this result suggests that the same radiation mechanismis operating from x-rays to gamma-rays and is in agreement with radiativecooling by synchotron emission. a fast evolution of the spectrum is found, inwhich the ratio of x- to gamma-ray intensities varies over three orders ofmagnitude. furthermore, the spectrum in the initial phase of the event betraysthe presence of an optically thick source rapidly evolving in a thinconfiguration.no other class of sources in the universe shows such a fast andextreme evolution. these results pose new and tighter constraints ontheoretical models for gamma-ray bursts.

astro-ph;9710355	evidence for a late-time outburst of the x-ray afterglow of gb970508  from bepposax	the gamma-ray burst gb970508 was observed simultaneously by the gamma rayburst monitor (grbm) and one of the x-ray wide field cameras (wfc) aboardbepposax. the latter provided a position within 1.9' radius. a series offollow-up observations with the narrow field intruments (nfi) was thenperformed in a period from 6 hours to 6 days after the main event. a previouslyunknown source, which we associate with the afterglow of the grb, wasdiscovered in the error box. we find that, after the initial burst, x-rayemission is still present and decays as t^(-1.1) up to 6 times 10^4 s. this isfollowed by a burst of activity with a duration 10^5 s. the energy produced inthis event is a substantial fraction of the total energy of the grb, whichmeans that the afterglow is not a remnant of the initial burst (the grb) thatfades away smoothly. our results support the idea that the processes generatingthe grb and its afterglow are the same.

astro-ph;9807314	gamma-ray burst 980329 and its x-ray afterglow	grb 980329 is the brightest gamma-ray burst detected so far with the widefield cameras aboard bepposax, both in gamma-rays and x-rays. with respect toits fluence (2.6 x 10**-5 erg/s/cm**2 in 50 to 300 kev) it would be in the top4% of gamma-ray bursts in the 4b catalog (meegan et al. 1998). thetime-averaged burst spectrum from 2 to 20 and 70 to 650 kev can be welldescribed by the empirical model of band et al. (1993). the resulting photonindex above the break energy is exceptionally hard at -1.32 +/- 0.03. an x-rayafterglow was detected with the narrow-field instruments aboard bepposax 7 hafter the event within the error box as determined with the wide field cameras.its peak flux is (1.4 +/- 0.2) x 10**-12 erg/s/cm**2 (2 to 10 kev). theafterglow decayed according to a power law function with an index of -1.35 +/-0.03. grb 980329 is characterized by being bright and hard, and lacking strongspectral evolution.

astro-ph;9809287	multifrequency observations of xte j0421+560/ci cam in outburst	we report on two x-ray observations of the transient source xte j0421+560performed by bepposax, and on a series of observations performed by the 0.7mteramo-normale telescope. outburst peak occurrence time and duration depend onphoton energy: the outburst peak is achieved first in the x-ray band, then inthe optical and finally in the radio. an exponential decay law fits well thex-ray data except in the too2 0.5-1.0 kev band, where erratic time variabilityis detected. during too1 the e-folding time scale decreases with energy up to ~20 kev, when it achieves a saturation; during too2 it decreases up to ~ 2 kevand then increases. this change is correlated with a spectral change,characterized by the onset of a soft (&lt; 2 kev) component in too2 (orr et al.1998). this component might originate from the relativistic jets, while thehard component is more likely associated to processes occurring in thecircumstellar matter and/or near the compact object. optical observations showthat the object appears intrinsically red even during the outburst. the natureof the compact object is discussed.

astro-ph;9902013	the x-ray afterglow of the gamma-ray burst of may 8, 1997: spectral  variability and possible evidence of an iron line	we report the possible detection (99.3% of statistical significance) ofredshifted fe iron line emission in the x-ray afterglow of gamma-ray burstgrb970508 observed by bepposax. its energy is consistent with the redshift ofthe putative host galaxy determined from optical spectroscopy. the linedisappeared about 1 day after the burst. we have also analyzed the spectralvariability during the outburst event that characterizes the x-ray afterglow ofthis grb. the spectrum gets harder during the flare, turning to steep when theflux decreases. the variability, intensity and width of the line indicate thatthe emitting region should have a mass approximately greater than 0.5 solarmasses (assuming the iron abundance similar to its solar value), a size ofabout 3 times 10^15 cm, be distributed anisotropically, and be moving withsub-relativistic speed. in contrast to the fairly clean environment expected inthe merging of two neutron stars, the observed line properties would imply thatthe site of the burst is embedded in a large mass of material, consistent withpre-explosion ejecta of a very massive star. this material could be relatedwith the outburst observed in the afterglow 1 day after the grb and with thespectral variations measured during this phase.

astro-ph;9902096	a giant outburst from sgr 1900+14 observed with the bepposax gamma ray  burst monitor	we report the detection by the gamma ray burst monitor onboard bepposax ofthe strongest and longest ever detected outburst from sgr 1900+14. oscillationsare detectable with a period of ~5.16 s for the entire duration of the event~300 s. the temporal analysis reveals also a remarkable periodic substructure:after about 35 s from the event onset each 5.16-s pulse shows a pattern of foursubpulses and a dip, each separated by ~1 s. significant spectral variation isdetected during the event and for each individual oscillation. the first andmost intense part of the outburst is quite hard, and similar to what previouslydetected from the `march 5th event'. a hard non-thermal spectral componentpersists for ~200 s. sgr 1900+14 was proposed to be a strongly magnetizedneutron star (b&gt;10^14 g) undergoing violent instabilities by internalmagnetic/crustal stresses. however, the onset of an apparent 1-s periodicitywithin the 5.16-s pulsations and the observed spectral properties show acomplex behaviour that is not satisfactorily modelled yet.

astro-ph;9910235	bepposax observations of grb980425: detection of the prompt event and  monitoring of the error box	we present bepposax follow-up observations of grb980425 obtained with thenarrow field instruments (nfi) in april, may, and november 1998. the first nfiobservation has detected within the 8' radius error box of the grb an x-raysource positionally consistent with the supernova 1998bw, which exploded withina day of grb980425, and a fainter x-ray source, not consistent with theposition of the supernova. the former source is detected in the following nfipointings and exhibits a decline of a factor of two in six months. if it isassociated with sn 1998bw, this is the first detection of x-ray emission from atype i supernova above 2 kev. the latter source exhibits only marginallysignificant variability. the x-ray spectra and variability of the supernova arecompared with thermal and non-thermal models of supernova high energy emission.based on the bepposax data, it is not possible to firmly establish which of thetwo detected sources is the grb x-ray counterpart, although probabilityconsiderations favor the supernova.

astro-ph;9911228	prompt and delayed emission properties of gamma-ray bursts observed with  bepposax	we investigated the spectral evolution in the 2--700 kev energy band ofgamma-ray bursts (grbs) detected by the gamma-ray burst monitor (grbm) andlocalized with the wide field cameras (wfcs) aboard the bepposax satellitebefore may 1998. most of them have been followed-up with the narrow fieldinstruments aboard the same satellite. in the light of these results we discussopen issues on the grb phenomenon. we find that the optically thin synchrotronshock model (ssm) provides an acceptable representation of most of thetime-resolved grb spectra extending down to 2 kev, except in the initial phasesof several bursts and during the whole duration of the quite strong grb970111,where a low-energy photon depletion with respect to the thin ssm spectrum isobserved. we find that the x-ray afterglow starts at about 50% of the grbduration, and that its fluence, as computed from the wfc light curve, isconsistent with the decay law found from the afterglow nfi observations. wealso investigate the hydrodynamical evolution of the grb in our sample andtheir associated afterglow, when it was detected. we find that the photon indexof the latest spectrum of the grb prompt emission is correlated with the indexof the afterglow fading law, when available, as expected on the basis of anexternal shock of a relativistic fireball.
