0908.2421	out of the frying pan: a young pulsar with a long radio trail emerging  from snr g315.9-0.0	the faint radio supernova remnant snr g315.9-0.0 is notable for a long andthin trail that extends outward perpendicular from the edge of itsapproximately circular shell. in a search with the parkes telescope we havefound a young and energetic pulsar that is located at the tip of thiscollimated linear structure. psr j1437-5959 has period p = 61 ms,characteristic age tau_c = 114 kyr, and spin-down luminosity de/dt = 1.4e36erg/s. it is very faint, with a flux density at 1.4 ghz of about 75 ujy. fromits dispersion measure of 549 pc/cc, we infer d ~ 8 kpc. at this distance andfor an age comparable to tau_c, the implied pulsar velocity in the plane of thesky is v_t = 300 km/s for a birth at the center of the snr, although it ispossible that the snr/pulsar system is younger than tau_c and that v_t &gt; 300km/s. the highly collimated linear feature is evidently the pulsar wind trailleft from the supersonic passage of psr j1437-5959 through the interstellarmedium surrounding snr g315.9-0.0.

0908.2626	radio detection of lat psrs j1741-2054 and j2032+4127: no longer just  gamma-ray pulsars	sixteen pulsars have been discovered so far in blind searches of photonscollected with the large area telescope on the fermi gamma-ray space telescope.we here report the discovery of radio pulsations from two of them. psrj1741-2054, with period p=413ms, was detected in archival parkes telescope dataand subsequently has been detected at the green bank telescope (gbt). itsreceived flux varies greatly due to interstellar scintillation and it has avery small dispersion measure of dm=4.7pc/cc, implying a distance of ~0.4kpcand possibly the smallest luminosity of any known radio pulsar. at thisdistance, for isotropic emission, its gamma-ray luminosity above 0.1gevcorresponds to 25% of the spin-down luminosity of de/dt=9.4e33erg/s. thegamma-ray profile occupies 1/3 of pulse phase and has three closely-spacedpeaks with the first peak lagging the radio pulse by delta=0.29p. we have alsoidentified a soft swift source that is the likely x-ray counterpart. in manyrespects psr j1741-2054 resembles the geminga pulsar. the second source, psrj2032+4127, was detected at the gbt. it has p=143ms, and its dm=115pc/ccsuggests a distance of ~3.6kpc, but we consider it likely that it is locatedwithin the cyg ob2 stellar association at half that distance. the radioemission is nearly 100% linearly polarized, and the main radio peak precedes bydelta=0.15p the first of two narrow gamma-ray peaks that are separated bydelta=0.50p. faint, diffuse x-ray emission in a chandra image is possibly itspulsar wind nebula. psr j2032+4127 likely accounts for the egret source 3egj2033+4118, while its pulsar wind is responsible for the formerly unidentifiedhegra source tev j2032+4130.

0912.3944	constraining pulsar emission physics through radio/gamma-ray correlation  of crab giant pulses	to constrain the giant pulse (gp) emission mechanism and test the model oflyutikov (2007) of gp emission, we are carrying out a campaign of simultaneousobservations of the crab pulsar between gamma-rays (fermi) and radiowavelengths. the correlation between times of arrival of radio gps andhigh-energy photons, whether it exists or not, will allow us to choose betweendifferent origins of gp emission and further constrain the emission physics.our foremost goal was testing whether radio gps are due to changes in thecoherence of the radio emission mechanism, variations in the pair creation ratein the pulsar magnetosphere, or changes in the beaming direction. accomplishingthis goal requires an enormous number of simultaneous radio gps andgamma-photons. thus, we organized a radio observations campaign using the 42-fttelescope at the jodrell bank observatory (uk), the 140-ft telescope, and the100-m robert c. byrd green bank telescope (gbt) at the green bank observatory(wv). while the observations with the two first ones are ongoing, here wepresent the preliminary results of 20 hrs of observations with the gbt at thehigh frequency of 8.9 ghz. these particular observations were aimed to probethe model of gp emission by lyutikov (2007) which predicts that gps atfrequencies &gt; 4 ghz should be accompanied by gamma-ray photons of energies of1-100 gev.

1006.2134	eight gamma-ray pulsars discovered in blind frequency searches of fermi  lat data	we report the discovery of eight gamma-ray pulsars in blind frequencysearches using the lat, onboard the fermi gamma-ray space telescope. five ofthe eight pulsars are young (tau_c&lt;100 kyr), energetic (edot&gt;10^36 erg/s), andlocated within the galactic plane (|b|&lt;3 deg). the remaining three are older,less energetic, and located off the plane. five pulsars are associated withsources included in the lat bright gamma-ray source list, but only one, psrj1413-6205, is clearly associated with an egret source. psr j1023-5746 has thesmallest characteristic age (tau_c=4.6 kyr) and is the most energetic(edot=1.1e37 erg/s) of all gamma-ray pulsars discovered so far in blindsearches. psrs j1957+5033 and j2055+25 have the largest characteristic ages(tau_c~1 myr) and are the least energetic (edot~5e33 erg/s) of thenewly-discovered pulsars. we present the timing models, light curves, anddetailed spectral parameters of the new pulsars. we used recent xmmobservations to identify the counterpart of psr j2055+25 as xmmuj205549.4+253959. in addition, publicly available archival chandra x-ray dataallowed us to identify the likely counterpart of psr j1023-5746 as a faint,highly absorbed source, cxou j102302.8-574606. the large x-ray absorptionindicates that this could be among the most distant gamma-ray pulsars detectedso far. psr j1023-5746 is positionally coincident with the tev source hessj1023-575, located near the young stellar cluster westerlund 2, while psrj1954+2836 is coincident with a 4.3 sigma excess reported by milagro at amedian energy of 35 tev. deep radio follow-up observations of the eight pulsarsresulted in no detections of pulsations and upper limits comparable to thefaintest known radio pulsars, indicating that these can be included among thegrowing population of radio-quiet pulsars in our galaxy being uncovered by thelat, and currently numbering more than 20.

1011.5809	on the nature and evolution of the unique binary pulsar j1903+0327	(abridged) psr j1903+0327, a millisecond pulsar in an eccentric (e = 0.44)95-day orbit with a (~ 1msun) companion poses a challenge to our understandingof stellar evolution in binary and multiple-star systems. here we describeoptical and radio observations which rule out most of the scenarios proposed toexplain formation of this system. radio timing measurements of threepost-keplerian effects yield the most precise measurement of the mass of amillisecond pulsar to date: 1.667 +/- 0.021 solar masses (99.7% confidencelimit) (...). optical spectroscopy of a proposed main sequence counterpart showthat its orbital motion mirrors the pulsar's 95-day orbit; being therefore itsbinary companion (...) the optical detection also provides a measurement of thesystemic radial velocity of the binary; this and the proper motion measuredfrom pulsar timing allow the determination of the systemic 3-d velocity in thegalaxy. we find that the system is always within 270 pc of the plane of thegalaxy, but always more than 3 kpc away from the galactic centre. thus anexchange interaction in a dense stellar environment (like a globular cluster orthe galactic centre) is not likely to be the origin of this system. we suggestthat after the supernova that formed it, the neutron star was in a tight orbitwith a main-sequence star, the present companion was a tertiary farther out.the neutron star then accreted matter from its evolving inner ms companion,forming a millisecond pulsar. the former donor star then disappears, either dueto a chaotic 3-body interaction with the outer star (caused by the expansion ofthe inner orbit that necessarily results from mass transfer), or in the case ofa very compact inner system, due to ablation/accretion by the newly formedmillisecond pulsar.

1101.1434	correlation of fermi photons with high-frequency radio giant pulses from  the crab pulsar	to constrain the giant pulse (gp) emission mechanism and test the model oflyutikov (2007) for gp emission, we have carried out a campaign of simultaneousobservations of the crab pulsar at gamma-ray (fermi) and radio (green banktelescope) wavelengths. over 10 hours of simultaneous observations we obtaineda sample of 2.1x10^4 giant pulses, observed at a radio frequency of 9 ghz, and77 fermi photons, with energies between 100 mev and 5 gev. the majority of gpscame from the interpulse (ip) phase window. we found no change in the gpgeneration rate within 10-120 s windows at lags of up to +-40 min of observedgamma-ray photons. the 95% upper limit for a gamma-ray flux enhancement inpulsed emission phase window around all gps is 4 times the average pulsedgamma-ray flux from the crab. for the subset of ip gps, the enhancement upperlimit, within the ip emission window, is 12 times the average pulsed gamma-rayflux. these results suggest that gps, at least high-frequency ip gps, are dueto changes in coherence of radio emission rather than an overall increase inthe magnetospheric particle density.

1102.0648	discovery of millisecond pulsars in radio searches of southern fermi lat  sources	using the parkes radio telescope we have carried out deep observations ofeleven unassociated gamma-ray sources. periodicity searches of these data havediscovered two millisecond pulsars, psr j1103-5403 (1fgl j1103.9-5355) and psrj2241-5236 (1fgl j2241.9-5236), and a long period pulsar, psr j1604-44 (1fglj1604.7-4443). in addition we searched for but did not detect any radiopulsations from six gammaray pulsars discovered by the fermi satellite to alevel of - 0.04 mjy (for pulsars with a 10% duty cycle). timing of themillisecond pulsar psr j1103-5403 has shown that its position is 9' from thecentroid of the gamma-ray source. since these observations were carried out,independent evidence has shown that 1fgl j1103.9-5355 is associated with theflat spectrum radio source pks 1101-536. it appears certain that the pulsar isnot associated with the gamma-ray source, despite the seemingly low probabilityof a chance detection of a radio millisecond pulsar. we consider that psrj1604-44 is a chance discovery of a weak, long period pulsar and is unlikely tobe associated with 1fgl j1604.7-4443. psr j2241-5236 has a spin period of 2.2ms and orbits a very low mass companion with a 3.5 hour orbital period. therelatively high flux density and low dispersion measure of psr j2241-5236 makesit an excellent candidate for high precision timing experiments. the gamma-raysof 1fgl j2241.9-5236 have a spectrum that is well modelled by a power law withexponential cutoff, and phasebinning with the radio ephemeris results in amulti-peaked gamma-ray pulse profile. observations with chandra have identifieda coincident x-ray source within 0.1" of the position of the pulsar obtained byradio timing

1201.2637	the double pulsar eclipses i: phenomenology and multi-frequency analysis	the double pulsar psr j0737-3039a/b displays short, 30 s eclipses that arisearound conjunction when the radio waves emitted by pulsar a are absorbed asthey propagate through the magnetosphere of its companion pulsar b. theseeclipses offer a unique opportunity to probe directly the magnetosphericstructure and the plasma properties of pulsar b. we have performed acomprehensive analysis of the eclipse phenomenology using multi-frequency radioobservations obtained with the green bank telescope. we have characterized theperiodic flux modulations previously discovered at 820 mhz by mclaughlin etal., and investigated the radio frequency dependence of the duration and depthof the eclipses. based on their weak radio frequency evolution, we concludethat the plasma in pulsar b's magnetosphere requires a large multiplicityfactor (~ 10^5). we also found that, as expected, flux modulations are presentat all radio frequencies in which eclipses can be detected. their complexbehavior is consistent with the confinement of the absorbing plasma in thedipolar magnetic field of pulsar b as suggested by lyutikov &amp; thompson and sucha geometric connection explains that the observed periodicity is harmonicallyrelated to pulsar b's spin frequency. we observe that the eclipses require asharp transition region beyond which the plasma density drops off abruptly.such a region defines a plasmasphere which would be well inside themagnetospheric boundary of an undisturbed pulsar. it is also two times smallerthan the expected standoff radius calculated using the balance of the windpressure from pulsar a and the nominally estimated magnetic pressure of pulsarb.

1201.6484	correlation of chandra photons with the radio giant pulses from the crab  pulsar	no apparent correlation was found between giant pulses (gps) and x-rayphotons from the crab pulsar during 5.4 hours of simultaneous observations withthe green bank telescope at 1.5 ghz and chandra x-ray observatory primarily inthe energy range 1.5-4.5 kev. during the crab pulsar periods with gps the x-rayflux in radio emission phase windows does not change more than by +-10% formain pulse (mp) gps and +-30% for interpulse (ip) gps. during giant pulsesthemselves, the x-ray flux does not change more than by two times for mp gpsand 5 times for ip gps. all limits quoted are compatible with 2-sigmafluctuations of the x-ray flux around the sets of false gps with random arrivaltimes. the results speak in favor of changes in plasma coherence as the originof gps. however, the results do not rule out variations in the rate of particlecreation if the particles that emit coherent radio emission are mostly at thelowest landau level.

1202.1128	discovery of the millisecond pulsar psr j2043+1711 in a fermi source  with the nancay radio telescope	we report the discovery of the millisecond pulsar psr j2043+1711 in a searchof a fermi large area telescope (lat) source with no known associations, withthe nancay radio telescope. the new pulsar, confirmed with the green banktelescope, has a spin period of 2.38 ms, is relatively nearby (d &lt;~ 2 kpc), andis in a 1.48 day orbit around a low mass companion, probably a he-type whitedwarf. pulsed gamma-ray emission was detected in the data recorded by the fermilat. the gamma-ray light curve and spectral properties are typical of othergamma-ray millisecond pulsars seen with fermi. x-ray observations of the pulsarwith suzaku and the swift/xrt yielded no detection. at 1.4 ghz we observestrong flux density variations because of interstellar diffractivescintillation, however a sharp peak can be observed at this frequency duringbright scintillation states. at 327 mhz the pulsar is detected with a muchhigher signal-to-noise ratio and its flux density is far more steady. however,at that frequency the arecibo instrumentation cannot yet fully resolve thepulse profile. despite that, our pulse time-of-arrival measurements have apost-fit residual rms of 2 \mus. this and the expected stability of this systemhas made psr j2043+1711 one of the first new fermi-selected millisecond pulsarsto be added to pulsar gravitational wave timing arrays. it has also allowed asignificant measurement of relativistic delays in the times of arrival of thepulses due to the curvature of space-time near the companion, but not yet withenough precision to derive useful masses for the pulsar and the companion. amass for the pulsar between 1.7 and 2.0 solar masses can be derived if astandard millisecond pulsar formation model is assumed. in this article we alsopresent a comprehensive summary of pulsar searches in fermi lat sources withthe nancay radio telescope to date.

1205.3699	discovery of the optical/ultraviolet/gamma-ray counterpart to the  eclipsing millisecond pulsar j1816+4510	the energetic, eclipsing millisecond pulsar j1816+4510 was recentlydiscovered in a low-frequency radio survey with the green bank telescope. withan orbital period of 8.7 hr and minimum companion mass of 0.16 msun it appearsto belong to an increasingly important class of pulsars that are ablating theirlow-mass companions. we report the discovery of the gamma-ray counterpart tothis pulsar, and present a likely optical/ultraviolet counterpart as well.using the radio ephemeris we detect pulsations in the unclassified gamma-raysource 2fgl j1816.5+4511, implying an efficiency of ~25% in converting thepulsar's spin-down luminosity into gamma-rays and adding psr j1816+4510 to thelarge number of millisecond pulsars detected by fermi. the likely optical/uvcounterpart was identified through position coincidence (&lt;0.1") and unusualcolors. assuming that it is the companion, with r=18.27+/-0.03 mag andeffective temperature &gt;15,000 k it would be among the brightest and hottest oflow-mass pulsar companions, and appears qualitatively different from othereclipsing pulsar systems. in particular, current data suggest that it is afactor of two larger than most white dwarfs of its mass, but a factor of foursmaller than its roche lobe. we discuss possible reasons for its hightemperature and odd size, and suggest that it recently underwent a violentepisode of mass loss. regardless of origin, its brightness and the relativeunimportance of irradiation make it an ideal target for a mass, and hence aneutron star mass, determination.

0711.3780	outburst of the 2 s anomalous x-ray pulsar 1e 1547.0-5408	following our discovery of radio pulsations from the newly recognizedanomalous x-ray pulsar (axp) 1e 1547.0-5408, we initiated x-ray monitoring withthe swift x-ray telescope, and obtained a single target-of-opportunityobservation with the newton x-ray multi-mirror mission (xmm-newton). incomparison with its historic minimum flux of 3e-13 ergs cm^-2 s^-1, the sourcewas found to be in a record high state, f_x(1-8 kev) = 5e-12 ergs cm^-2 s^-1,or l_x = 1.7e35(d/9 kpc)^2 ergs s^-1, and declining by 25% in 1 month.extrapolating the decay, we bound the total energy in this outburst to 1e42 &lt; e&lt; 1e43 ergs. the spectra (fitted with a comptonized blackbody) show that anincrease in the temperature and area of a hot region, to 0.5 kev and ~16% ofthe surface area of the neutron star, respectively, are primarily responsiblefor its increase in luminosity. the energy, spectrum, and timescale of decayare consistent with a deep crustal heating event, similar to an interpretationof the x-ray turn-on of the transient axp xte j1810-197. simultaneous with the4.6 hour xmm-newton observation, we observed at 6.4 ghz with the parkestelescope, measuring the phase relationship of the radio and x-ray pulse. thex-ray pulsed fraction of 1e 1547.0-5408 is only ~7%, while its radio pulse isrelatively broad for such a slow pulsar, which may indicate a nearly alignedrotator. as also inferred from the transient behavior of xte j1810-197, theonly other axp known to emit in the radio, the magnetic field rearrangementresponsible for this x-ray outburst of 1e 1547.0-5408 is probably the cause ofits radio turn-on.

1302.1790	discovery of the optical counterparts to four energetic fermi  millisecond pulsars	in the last few years, over 43 millisecond radio pulsars have been discoveredby targeted searches of unidentified gamma-ray sources found by the fermigamma-ray space telescope. a large fraction of these millisecond pulsars are incompact binaries with low-mass companions. these systems often show eclipses ofthe pulsar signal and are commonly known as black widows and redbacks becausethe pulsar is gradually destroying its companion. in this paper, we report onthe optical discovery of four strongly irradiated millisecond pulsarcompanions. all four sources show modulations of their color and luminosity atthe known orbital periods from radio timing. light curve modelling of ourexploratory data shows that the equilibrium temperature reached on thecompanion's dayside with respect to their nightside is consistent with about10-30% of the available spin-down energy from the pulsar being reprocessed toincrease the companion's dayside temperature. this value compares well with therange observed in other irradiated pulsar binaries and offers insights aboutthe energetics of the pulsar wind and the production of gamma-ray emission. inaddition, this provides a simple way of estimating the brightness of irradiatedpulsar companions given the pulsar spin-down luminosity. our analysis alsosuggests that two of the four new irradiated pulsar companions are onlypartially filling their roche lobe. some of these sources are relatively brightand represent good targets for spectroscopic follow-up. these measurementscould enable, among other things, mass determination of the neutron stars inthese systems.

1305.3884	swings between rotation and accretion power in a millisecond binary  pulsar	it is thought that neutron stars in low-mass binary systems can accretematter and angular momentum from the companion star and be spun-up tomillisecond rotational periods. during the accretion stage, the system iscalled a low-mass x-ray binary, and bright x-ray emission is observed. when therate of mass transfer decreases in the later evolutionary stages, thesebinaries host a radio millisecond pulsar whose emission is powered by theneutron star's rotating magnetic field. this evolutionary model is supported bythe detection of millisecond x-ray pulsations from several accreting neutronstars and also by the evidence for a past accretion disc in a rotation-poweredmillisecond pulsar. it has been proposed that a rotation-powered pulsar maytemporarily switch on during periods of low mass inflow in some such systems.only indirect evidence for this transition has hitherto been observed. here wereport observations of accretion-powered, millisecond x-ray pulsations from aneutron star previously seen as a rotation-powered radio pulsar. within a fewdays after a month-long x-ray outburst, radio pulses were again detected. thisnot only shows the evolutionary link between accretion and rotation-poweredmillisecond pulsars, but also that some systems can swing between the twostates on very short timescales.

1401.0535	a millisecond pulsar in a stellar triple system	gravitationally bound three-body systems have been studied for hundreds ofyears and are common in our galaxy. they show complex orbital interactions,which can constrain the compositions, masses, and interior structures of thebodies and test theories of gravity, if sufficiently precise measurements areavailable. a triple system containing a radio pulsar could provide suchmeasurements, but the only previously known such system, b1620-26 (with amillisecond pulsar, a white dwarf, and a planetary-mass object in an orbit ofseveral decades), shows only weak interactions. here we report precision timingand multi-wavelength observations of psr j0337+1715, a millisecond pulsar in ahierarchical triple system with two other stars. strong gravitationalinteractions are apparent and provide the masses of the pulsar (1.4378(13)msun, where msun is the solar mass and the parentheses contain the uncertaintyin the final decimal places) and the two white dwarf companions (0.19751(15)msun and 0.4101(3) msun), as well as the inclinations of the orbits (bothapproximately 39.2 degrees). the unexpectedly coplanar and nearly circularorbits indicate a complex and exotic evolutionary past that differs from thoseof known stellar systems. the gravitational field of the outer white dwarfstrongly accelerates the inner binary containing the neutron star, and thesystem will thus provide an ideal laboratory in which to test the strongequivalence principle of general relativity.

1404.1120	interstellar scintillation of the double pulsar j0737$-$3039	we report here a series of observations of the interstellar scintillation(iss) of the double pulsar j0737$-$3039 over the course of 18 months. as inearlier work (coles et al., 2005) the basic phenomenon is the variation in theiss caused by the changing transverse velocities of each pulsar, the ionizedinterstellar medium (iism), and the earth. the transverse velocity of thebinary system can be determined both by vlbi and timing observations. theorbital velocity and inclination is almost completely determined from timingobservations, but the direction of the orbital angular momentum is not known.since the earth's velocity is known, and can be compared with the orbitalvelocity by its effect on the timescale of the iss, we can determine theorientation $\omega$ of the pulsar orbit with respect to equatorial coordinates($\omega = 65\pm2$ deg). we also resolve the ambiguity ($i= 88.7$ or $91.3$deg) in the inclination of the orbit deduced from the measured shapiro delay byour estimate $i=88.1\pm0.5$ deg. this relies on analysis of the iss over bothfrequency and time and provides a model for the location, anisotropy,turbulence level and transverse phase gradient of the iism. we find that theiism can be well-modeled during each observation, typically of a few orbitalperiods, but its turbulence level and mean velocity vary significantly over the18 months.

1404.1267	nanograv limits on gravitational waves from individual supermassive  black hole binaries in circular orbits	the north american nanohertz observatory for gravitational waves (nanograv)project currently observes 43 pulsars using the green bank and arecibo radiotelescopes. in this work we use a subset of 17 pulsars timed for a span ofroughly five years (2005--2010). we analyze these data using standard pulsartiming models, with the addition of time-variable dispersion measure andfrequency-variable pulse shape terms. within the timing data, we perform asearch for continuous gravitational waves from individual supermassive blackhole binaries in circular orbits using robust frequentist and bayesiantechniques. we find that there is no evidence for the presence of a detectablecontinuous gravitational wave; however, we can use these data to place the mostconstraining upper limits to date on the strength of such gravitational waves.using the full 17 pulsar dataset we place a 95% upper limit on the sky-averagedstrain amplitude of $h_0\lesssim 3.8\times 10^{-14}$ at a frequency of 10 nhz.furthermore, we place 95% \emph{all sky} lower limits on the luminositydistance to such gravitational wave sources finding that the $d_l \gtrsim 425$mpc for sources at a frequency of 10 nhz and chirp mass $10^{10}{\rmm}_{\odot}$. we find that for gravitational wave sources near our best timedpulsars in the sky, the sensitivity of the pulsar timing array is increased bya factor of $\sim$4 over the sky-averaged sensitivity. finally we place limitson the coalescence rate of the most massive supermassive black hole binaries.

1404.2934	fast radio burst discovered in the arecibo pulsar alfa survey	recent work has exploited pulsar survey data to identify temporally isolated,millisecond-duration radio bursts with large dispersion measures (dms). thesebursts have been interpreted as arising from a population of extragalacticsources, in which case they would provide unprecedented opportunities forprobing the intergalactic medium; they may also be linked to new sourceclasses. until now, however, all so-called fast radio bursts (frbs) have beendetected with the parkes radio telescope and its 13-beam receiver, casting someconcern about the astrophysical nature of these signals. here we present frb121102, the first frb discovery from a geographic location other than parkes.frb 121102 was found in the galactic anti-center region in the 1.4-ghz pulsaralfa survey with the arecibo observatory with a dm = 557.4 $\pm$ 3 pccm$^{-3}$, pulse width of $3\; \pm 0.5$ ms, and no evidence of interstellarscattering. the observed delay of the signal arrival time with frequency agreesprecisely with the expectation of dispersion through an ionized medium. despiteits low galactic latitude ($b = -0.2^{\circ}$), the burst has three times themaximum galactic dm expected along this particular line-of-sight, suggesting anextragalactic origin. a peculiar aspect of the signal is an inverted spectrum;we interpret this as a consequence of being detected in a sidelobe of the alfareceiver. frb 121102's brightness, duration, and the inferred event rate areall consistent with the properties of the previously detected parkes bursts.

1408.1694	a 24-hour global campaign to assess precision timing of the millisecond  pulsar j1713+0747	the radio millisecond pulsar j1713+0747 is regarded as one of thehighest-precision clocks in the sky, and is regularly timed for the purpose ofdetecting gravitational waves. the international pulsar timing arraycollaboration undertook a 24-hour global observation of psr j1713+0747 in aneffort to better quantify sources of timing noise in this pulsar, particularlyon intermediate (1 - 24 hr) timescales. we observed the pulsar continuouslyover 24 hr with the arecibo, effelsberg, gmrt, green bank, lofar, lovell,nancay, parkes, and wsrt radio telescopes. the combined pulse times-of-arrivalpresented here provide an estimate of what sources of timing noise, excludingdm variations, would be present as compared to an idealized root-n improvementin timing precision, where n is the number of pulses analyzed. in the case ofthis particular pulsar, we find that intrinsic pulse phase jitter dominatesarrival time precision when the s/n of single pulses exceeds unity, as measuredusing the eight telescopes that observed at l-band/1.4 ghz. we present firstresults of specific phenomena probed on the unusually long timescale (for asingle continuous observing session) of tens of hours, in particularinterstellar scintillation, and discuss the degree to which scintillation andprofile evolution affect precision timing. this paper presents the data set asa basis for future, deeper studies.

1501.00281	observing radio pulsars in the galactic centre with the square kilometre  array	the discovery and timing of radio pulsars within the galactic centre is afundamental aspect of the ska science case, responding to the topic of "strongfield tests of gravity with pulsars and black holes" (kramer et al. 2004;cordes et al. 2004). pulsars have in many ways proven to be excellent tools fortesting the general theory of relativity and alternative gravity theories (seewex (2014) for a recent review). timing a pulsar in orbit around a companion,provides a unique way of probing the relativistic dynamics and spacetime ofsuch a system. the strictest tests of gravity, in strong field conditions, areexpected to come from a pulsar orbiting a black hole. in this sense, a pulsarin a close orbit ($p_{\rm orb}$ &lt; 1 yr) around our nearest supermassive blackhole candidate, sagittarius a* - at a distance of ~8.3 kpc in the galacticcentre (gillessen et al. 2009a) - would be the ideal tool. given the size ofthe orbit and the relativistic effects associated with it, even a slowlyspinning pulsar would allow the black hole spacetime to be explored in greatdetail (liu et al. 2012). for example, measurement of the frame dragging causedby the rotation of the supermassive black hole, would allow a test of the"cosmic censorship conjecture." the "no-hair theorem" can be tested bymeasuring the quadrupole moment of the black hole. these are two of the primeexamples for the fundamental studies of gravity one could do with a pulsararound sagittarius a*. as will be shown here, ska1-mid and ultimately the skawill provide the opportunity to begin to find and time the pulsars in thisextreme environment.

0807.2404	chandra x-ray observatory observations of the globular cluster m71	we observed the nearby, low-density globular cluster m71 (ngc 6838) with thechandra x-ray observatory to study its faint x-ray populations. five x-raysources were found inside the cluster core radius, including the knowneclipsing binary millisecond pulsar (msp) psr j1953+1846a. the x-ray lightcurve of the source coincident with this msp shows marginal evidence forperiodicity at the binary period of 4.2 h. its hard x-ray spectrum andluminosity resemble those of other eclipsing binary msps in 47 tuc, suggestinga similar shock origin of the x-ray emission. a further 24 x-ray sources werefound within the half-mass radius, reaching to a limiting luminosity of 1.510^30 erg/s (0.3-8 kev). from a radial distribution analysis, we find that18+/-6 of these 29 sources are associated with m71, somewhat more thanpredicted, and that 11+/-6 are background sources, both galactic andextragalactic. m71 appears to have more x-ray sources between l_x=10^30--10^31erg/s than expected by extrapolating from other studied clusters using eithermass or collision frequency. we explore the spectra and variability of thesesources, and describe the results of ground-based optical counterpart searches.

astro-ph;0702616	polarized radio emission from the magnetar xte j1810-197	we have used the parkes radio telescope to study the polarized emission fromthe anomalous x-ray pulsar xte j1810-197 at frequencies of 1.4, 3.2, and 8.4ghz. we find that the pulsed emission is nearly 100% linearly polarized. theposition angle of linear polarization varies gently across the observed pulseprofiles, varying little with observing frequency or time, even as the pulseprofiles have changed dramatically over a period of 7 months. in the context ofthe standard pulsar "rotating vector model," there are two possibleinterpretations of the observed position angle swing coupled with the wideprofile. in the first, the magnetic and rotation axes are substantiallymisaligned and the emission originates high in the magnetosphere, as seen forother young radio pulsars, and the beaming fraction is large. in the secondinterpretation, the magnetic and rotation axes are nearly aligned and the lineof sight remains in the emission zone over almost the entire pulse phase. wedeprecate this possibility because of the observed large modulation of thermalx-ray flux. we have also measured the faraday rotation caused by the galacticmagnetic field, rm = +77 rad/m^2, implying an average magnetic field componentalong the line of sight of 0.5 microg.

0810.0008	discovery of high-energy gamma-ray pulsations from psr j2021+3651 with  agile	discovered after the end of the compton gamma-ray observatory mission, theradio pulsar psr j2021+3651 was long considered a likely counterpart of thehigh-energy gamma-ray source 2cg 075+00 = 3eg j2021+3716 = gev j2020+3658, butit could not be confirmed due to the lack of a contemporaneous radio pulsarephemeris to fold the sparse, archival gamma-ray photons. here, we report thediscovery of gamma-ray pulsations from psr j2021+3651 in the 100-1500 mev rangeusing data from the agile satellite gathered over 8 months, folded on a denselysampled, contemporaneous radio ephemeris obtained for this purpose at the greenbank telescope. the gamma-ray pulse consists of two sharp peaks separated by0.47+/-0.01 cycles. the single radio pulse leads the first gamma-ray peak by0.165+/-0.010 cycles. these properties are similar to those of other gamma-raypulsars, and the phase relationship of the peaks can be interpreted in thecontext of the outer-gap accelerator model for gamma-ray emission. pulse-phaseresolved images show that there is only one dominant source, agl j2020.5+3653 =psr j2021+3651 in the region previously containing confused sources 3egj2021+3716 and 3eg j2016+3657.

0810.1637	pulsar timing for the fermi gamma-ray space telescope	we describe a comprehensive pulsar monitoring campaign for the large areatelescope (lat) on the {\em fermi gamma-ray space telescope} (formerly glast).the detection and study of pulsars in gamma rays give insights into thepopulations of neutron stars and supernova rates in the galaxy, into particleacceleration mechanisms in neutron star magnetospheres, and into the "engines"driving pulsar wind nebulae. lat's unprecedented sensitivity between 20 mev and300 gev together with its 2.4 sr field-of-view makes detection of manygamma-ray pulsars likely, justifying the monitoring of over two hundred pulsarswith large spin-down powers. to search for gamma-ray pulsations from most ofthese pulsars requires a set of phase-connected timing solutions spanning ayear or more to properly align the sparse photon arrival times. we describe thechoice of pulsars and the instruments involved in the campaign. attention ispaid to verifications of the lat pulsar software, using for example giant radiopulses from the crab and from psr b1937+21 recorded at nan\c{c}ay, and usingx-ray data on psr j0218+4232 from xmm-newton. we demonstrate accuracy of thepulsar phase calculations at the microsecond level. data table 1 is onlyavailable in electronic form at the cds via anonymous ftp tocdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or viahttp://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?j/a+a/ .
