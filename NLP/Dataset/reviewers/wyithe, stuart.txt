0706.3744	the imprint of cosmic reionization on galaxy clustering	we consider the effect of reionization on the clustering properties of galaxysamples at intermediate redshifts (z~0.3-5.5). current models for thereionization of intergalactic hydrogen predict that overdense regions will bereionized early, thus delaying the build up of stellar mass in the progenitorsof massive lower-redshift galaxies. as a result, the stellar populationsobserved in intermediate redshift galaxies are somewhat younger and hencebrighter in overdense regions of the universe. galaxy surveys would thereforebe sensitive to galaxies with a somewhat lower dark matter mass in overdenseregions. the corresponding increase in the observed number density of galaxiescan be parameterized as a galaxy bias due to reionization. we model thisprocess using merger trees combined with a stellar synthesis code. our modeldemonstrates that reionization has a significant effect on the clusteringproperties of galaxy samples that are selected based on their star-formationproperties. the bias correction in lyman-break galaxies (including those inproposed baryonic oscillation surveys at z&lt;1) is at the level of 10-20% for ahalo mass of 10^12 solar masses, leading to corrections factors of 1.5-2 in thehalo mass inferred from measurements of clustering length. the reionization ofhelium could also lead to a sharp increase in the amplitude of the galaxycorrelation function at z~3. we find that the reionization bias isapproximately independent of scale and halo mass. however since the traditionalgalaxy bias is mass dependent, the reionization bias becomes relatively moreimportant for lower mass systems. the correction to the bias due toreionization is very small in surveys of luminous red galaxies at z&lt;1.

0908.0193	determining the escape fraction of ionizing photons during reionization  with the grb derived star-formation rate	the fraction of ionizing photons that escape their host galaxies and so areable to ionize hydrogen in the inter-galactic medium (igm) is a criticalparameter in analyses of the reionization era and early galaxy formation.studies of the reionization history normally suffer from a degeneracy betweenthe unknown values for the efficiency with which high redshift galaxies turnmass into stars and the escape fraction of ionizing photons. recent gamma-rayburst (grb) measurements of the star formation rate density during reionizationprovide the first opportunity to break this degeneracy. we confront asemi-analytic model for reionization with the grb-derived star formation rate,as well as observations of the ly-alpha forest and the cmb. assuming that uvphotons produced in star-forming galaxies dominate the reionization process, weshow that the escape fraction of ionizing photons from high redshift galaxiesis ~5% [log(f_esc)=-1.35+/-0.15 (68%)] for our fiducial model. this value isreasonably stable against uncertainties in the modeling, including theimplementation of radiative feedback, the possibility of an evolving escapefraction, and the unknown shape of the imf, which in sum contribute ~0.2 dex ofadditional systematic uncertainty on the value of escape fraction.

0908.2854	the halo occupation distribution of hi galaxies	we perform an analysis of the spatial clustering properties of hi selectedgalaxies from the hi parkes all sky survey (hipass) using the formalism of thehalo occupation distribution (hod). the resulting parameter constraints showthat the fraction of satellite galaxies (i.e. galaxies which are not thecentral member of their host dark matter halo) among hipass galaxies is &lt;20%,and that satellite galaxies are therefore less common in hipass than inoptically selected galaxy redshift surveys. moreover the lack of fingers-of-godin the redshift space correlation function of hipass galaxies may indicate thatthe hi rich satellites which do exist are found in group mass rather thancluster mass dark matter halos. we find a minimum halo mass for hipass galaxiesat the peak of the redshift distribution of m~10^11 solar masses, and show thatless than 10% of baryons in hipass galaxies are in the form of hi. quantitativeconstraints on hod models from hipass galaxies are limited by uncertaintiesintroduced through the small survey volume. however our results imply thatfuture deeper surveys will allow the distribution of hi with environment to bestudied in detail via clustering of hi galaxies.

0909.0003	on merger bias and the clustering of quasars	we use the large catalogues of haloes available for the millennium simulationto test whether recently merged haloes exhibit stronger large-scale clusteringthan other haloes of the same mass. this effect could help to understand thevery strong clustering of quasars at high redshift. however, we find nostatistically significant excess bias for recently merged haloes over theredshift range 2 &lt; z &lt; 5, with the most massive haloes showing an excess of atmost ~5%. we also consider galaxies extracted from a semianalytic model builton the millennium simulation. at fixed stellar mass, we find an excess bias of~ 20-30% for recently merged objects, decreasing with increasing stellar mass.the fact that recently-merged galaxies are found in systematically more massivehaloes than other galaxies of the same stellar mass accounts for about half ofthis signal, and perhaps more for high-mass galaxies. the weak merger bias ofmassive systems suggests that objects of merger-driven nature, such as quasars,do not cluster significantly differently than other objects of the samecharacteristic mass. we discuss the implications of these results for theinterpretation of clustering data with respect to quasar duty cycles,visibility times, and evolution in the black hole-host mass relation.

0704.1671	very massive stars in high-redshift galaxies	a significant fraction of lyman alpha (lya) emitting galaxies (laes) at z&gt;5.7 have rest-frame equivalent widths (ew) greater than ~100 angstrom. howeveronly a small fraction of the lya flux produced by a galaxy is transmittedthrough the igm, which implies intrinsic lya ews that are in excess of themaximum allowed for a population-ii stellar population having a salpeter massfunction. in this paper we study characteristics of the sources powering lyaemission in high redshift galaxies. we propose a simple model for lya emittersin which galaxies undergo a burst of very massive star formation that resultsin a large intrinsic ew, followed by a phase of population-ii star formationwith a lower ew. we confront this model with a range of high redshiftobservations and find that the model is able to simultaneously describe thefollowing eight properties of the high redshift galaxy population withplausible values for parameters like the efficiency and duration of starformation: i-iv) the uv and lya luminosity functions of laes at z=5.7 and 6.5,v-vi) the mean and variance of the ew distribution of lya selected galaxies atz=5.7, vii) the ew distribution of i-drop galaxies at z~6, and viii) theobserved correlation of stellar age with ew. our modeling suggests that theobserved anomalously large intrinsic equivalent widths require a burst of verymassive star formation lasting no more than a few to ten percent of thegalaxies star forming lifetime. this very massive star formation may indicatethe presence of population-iii star formation in a few per cent of i-dropgalaxies, and in about half of the lya selected galaxies.

0912.2130	the halo occupation distribution of hi from 21cm intensity mapping at  moderate redshifts	the spatial clustering properties of hi galaxies can be studied using theformalism of the halo occupation distribution (hod). the resulting parameterconstraints describe properties like gas richness verses environment.unfortunately, clustering studies based on individual hi galaxies will berestricted to the local universe for the foreseeable future, even with thedeepest hi surveys. here we discuss how clustering studies of the hi hod couldbe extended to moderate redshift, through observations of fluctuations in thecombined 21cm intensity of unresolved galaxies. in particular we make ananalytic estimate for the clustering of hi in the hod. our joint goals are toestimate i) the amplitude of the signal, and ii) the sensitivity of telescopeslike the australian ska pathfinder to hod parameters. we find that the powerspectrum of redshifted 21cm intensity could be used to study the distributionof hi within dark matter halos at z&gt;0.5 where individual galaxies cannot bedetected. in addition to the hod of hi, the amplitude of the 21cm powerspectrum would also yield estimates of the cosmic hi content at epochs betweenthe local universe, and redshifts probed by damped ly-alpha absorbers.

1004.2081	a gravitational lensing explanation for the excess of strong mg-ii  absorbers in grb afterglow spectra	grb afterglows offer a probe of the intergalactic medium out to high redshiftwhich complements observations along more abundant quasar lines-of-sight.although both quasars and grb afterglows should provide a-priori randomsight-lines through the intervening igm, it has been observed that strong mg-iiabsorbers are twice as likely to be found along sight-lines toward grbs.several proposals to reconcile this discrepancy have been put forward, but nonehas been found sufficient to explain the magnitude of the effect. in this paperwe estimate the effect of gravitational lensing by galaxies and theirsurrounding mass distributions on the statistics of mg-ii absorption. we findthat the multi-band magnification bias could be very strong in thespectroscopic grb afterglow population and that gravitational lensing canexplain the discrepancy in density of absorbers, for plausibly steep luminosityfunctions. the model makes the prediction that approximately 20%-60% of thespectroscopic afterglow sample (i.e. ~ 5-15 of 26 sources) would have beenmultiply imaged, and hence result in repeating bursts. we show that despitethis large lensing fraction it is likely that none would yet have beenidentified by chance owing to the finite sky coverage of grb searches. wepredict that continued optical monitoring of the bright grb afterglow locationsin the months and years following the initial decay would lead toidentification of lensed grb afterglows. a confirmation of the lensinghypothesis would allow us to constrain the grb luminosity function down tootherwise inaccessibly faint levels, with potential consequences for grbmodels.

1004.2490	seeing through the trough: outflows and the detectability of lyman alpha  emission from the first galaxies	the next generation of telescopes aim to directly observe the firstgeneration of galaxies that initiated the reionization process in our universe.the lyman alpha (lya) emission line is robustly predicted to be the mostprominent intrinsic spectral feature of these galaxies, making it an idealtarget to search for and study high redshift galaxies. unfortunately the largegunn-peterson optical depth of the surrounding neutral intergalactic medium(igm) is thought to render this line extremely difficult to detect prior toreionization. in this paper we demonstrate that the radiative transfer effectsin the interstellar medium (ism), which cause lya flux to emerge from galaxiesat frequencies where the gunn-peterson optical depth is reduced, cansubstantially enhance the prospects for detection of the lya line at highredshift. in particular, scattering off outflows of interstellar hi gas canmodify the lya spectral line shape such that &gt;5% of the emitted lya radiationis transmitted directly to the observer, even through a fully neutral igm. itmay therefore be possible to directly observe `strong' lya emission lines (ew &gt;50 angstrom rest frame) from the highest redshift galaxies that reside in thesmallest hii `bubbles' early in the reionization era with jwst. in addition, weshow that outflows can boost the fraction of lya radiation that is transmittedthrough the igm during the latter stages of reionization, and evenpost-reionization. coupled with the fact that the first generation of galaxiesare thought to have very large intrinsic equivalent lya equivalent widths, ourresults suggest that the search for galaxies in their redshifted lya emissionline can be competitive with the drop-out technique out to the highestredshifts that can be probed in the jwst era.

0708.0951	smooth matter and source size in microlensing simulations of  gravitationally lensed quasars	several gravitationally lensed quasars are observed with anomalousmagnifications in pairs of images that straddle a critical curve. simpletheoretical arguments suggest that the magnification of these images should beapproximately equivalent, whereas one image is observed to be significantlydemagnified. microlensing provides a possible explanation for this discrepancy.there are two key parameters when modelling this effect. the first, thefraction of smooth matter in the lens at the image positions, has been exploredby schechter and wambsganss (2002). they have shown that the anomalous fluxratio observed in the lensed quasar mg 0414+0534 is a priori a factor of 5 morelikely if the assumed smooth matter content in the lens model is increased from0% to 93%. the second parameter, the size of the emission region, is exploredin this paper, and shown to be more significant. we find that the broadening ofthe magnification probability distributions due to smooth matter content iswashed out for source sizes that are predicted by standard models for quasars.we apply our model to the anomalous lensed quasar mg 0414+0534, and find a 95%upper limit of 2.62 x 10^(16) h^(-1/2) (m/msun)^(1/2) cm on the radius of thei-band emission region. the smooth matter percentage in the lens isunconstrained.

0708.1788	reionization bias in high redshift quasar near-zones	absorption spectra of high redshift quasars exhibit an increasingly thickly-alpha forest towards z~6. however, the interpretation of these spectra iscomplicated by the fact that the ly-alpha optical depth is already large forneutral hydrogen fractions in excess of 10^-4, and also because quasars areexpected to reside in dense regions of the igm. we present a model for theevolution of the ionization state of the igm which is applicable to the dense,biased regions around high-redshift quasars as well as more typical regions inthe igm, and combine this with numerical radiative transfer simulations. ourmodel is able to simultaneously reproduce the observed ly-alpha forest opacityat 4&lt;z&lt;6, the ionizing photon mean-free-path at z~4 and the rapid evolution ofhighly ionized near-zone sizes around high-redshift quasars at 5.8&lt;z&lt;6.4. wefind that within 5 physical mpc of a high redshift quasar, the evolution of theionization state of the igm precedes that in more typical regions by around 0.3redshift units. more importantly, when combined with the rapid increase in theionizing photon mean-free-path expected shortly after overlap, this offsetresults in an ionizing background near the quasar which exceeds the value inthe rest of the igm by a factor of ~2-3. we further find that in thepost-overlap phase of reionization the size of the observed quasar near-zonesis not directly sensitive to the neutral hydrogen fraction of the igm. instead,these sizes probe the level of the background ionization rate and thetemperature of the surrounding igm. the observed rapid evolution of the quasarnear-zone sizes at 5.8&lt;z&lt;6.4 can thus be explained by the rapid evolution ofthe ionizing background, which in our model is caused by the completion ofoverlap at the end of reionization by 6&lt;z&lt;7.

1008.1107	near-zone sizes and the rest frame extreme ultra-violet spectral index  of the highest redshift quasars	the discovery of quasars with redshifts higher than six has prompted a greatdeal of discussion in the literature regarding the role of quasars, both assources of reionization, and as probes of the ionization state of the igm.however the extreme ultra-violet (euv) spectral index cannot be measureddirectly for high redshift quasars owing to absorption at frequencies above thelyman limit, and as a result, studies of the impact of quasars on theintergalactic medium during reionization must assume a spectral energydistribution in the extreme ultra-violet based on observations at low redshift,z&lt;1. in this paper we use regions of high ly-alpha transmission (near-zones)around the highest redshift quasars to measure the quasar euv spectral index atz~6. we jointly fit the available observations for variation of near-zone sizewith both redshift and luminosity, and propose that the observed relationprovides evidence for an euv spectral index that varies with absolute magnitudein the high redshift quasar sample, becoming softer at higher luminosity. usinga large suite of detailed numerical simulations we find that the typical valueof spectral index for a luminous quasar at z~6 is constrained to bealpha=1.3+/-0.4 for a specific luminosity of the form l\propto\nu^{-alpha}. wefind the scatter in spectral index among individual quasars to be in the range~0.75-1.25. these values are in agreement with direct observations at lowredshift, and indicate that there has been no significant evolution in the euvspectral index of quasars over 90% of cosmic time.

0708.3392	fluctuations in 21cm emission after reionization	the fluctuations in the emission of redshifted 21cm photons from neutralinter-galactic hydrogen will provide an unprecedented probe of the reionizationera. conventional wisdom assumes that this 21cm signal disappears as soon asreionization is complete, when little atomic hydrogen is left through most ofthe volume of the inter-galactic medium (igm). however observations of dampedly-alpha absorbers indicate that the fraction of hydrogen in its neutral formis significant by mass at all redshifts. here we use a physically-motivatedmodel to show that residual neutral gas, confined to dense regions in the igmwith a high recombination rate, will generate a significant post-reionization21cm signal. we show that the power-spectrum of fluctuations in this signalwill be detectable by the first generation of low-frequency observatories at asignal-to-noise that is comparable to that achievable in observations of thereionization era. the statistics of 21cm fluctuations will therefore probe notonly the pre-reionization igm, but rather the entire process of hii regionoverlap, as well as the appearance of the diffuse ionized igm.

0708.3716	the impact of a percolating igm on redshifted 21 cm observations of  quasar hii regions	we assess the impact of inhomogeneous reionization on detection of hiiregions surrounding luminous high redshift quasars using planned low frequencyradio telescopes. our approach is to implement a semi-numerical scheme tocalculate the 3-dimensional structure of ionized regions surrounding a massivehalo at high redshift, including the ionizing influence of a luminous quasar.as part of our analysis we briefly contrast our scheme with publishedsemi-numerical models. we calculate mock 21cm spectra along the line of sighttowards high redshift quasars, and estimate the ability of the plannedmurchison widefield array to detect the presence of hii regions. thesignal-to-noise for detection will drop as the characteristic bubble size growsduring reionization because the quasar's influence becomes less prominent.however, quasars will imprint a detectable signature on observed 21cm spectrathat is distinct from a region of typical igm. at epochs where the meanhydrogen neutral fraction is ~30% or greater we find that neutral gas in theigm surrounding a single quasar will be detectable (at a significance of 5sigma) within 100 hour integrations in more than 50% of cases. 1000 hourintegrations will be required to detect a smaller neutral fraction of 15% inmore than 50% of cases. a highly significant detection will be possible in only100 hours for a stack of 10 smaller 3 proper mpc hii regions. the accuratemeasurement of the global average neutral fraction (&lt;x_hi&gt;) will be limited bysystematic fluctuations between lines of sight for single hii regions. weestimate the accuracy with which the global neutral fraction could be measuredfrom a single hii region to be 50%, 30% and 20% for &lt;x_hi&gt; ~ 0.15, 0.3 and 0.5respectively.

0709.2955	baryonic acoustic oscillations in 21cm emission: a probe of dark energy  out to high redshifts	low-frequency observatories are currently being constructed with the goal ofdetecting redshifted 21cm emission from the epoch of reionization. theseobservatories will also be able to detect intensity fluctuations in thecumulative 21cm emission after reionization, from hydrogen in unresolved dampedly-alpha absorbers (such as gas rich galaxies) down to a redshift z~3.5. theinferred power spectrum of 21cm fluctuations at all redshifts will showacoustic oscillations, whose co-moving scale can be used as a standard ruler toinfer the evolution of the equation of state for the dark energy. we find thatthe first generation of low-frequency experiments (such as mwa or lofar) willbe able to constrain the acoustic scale to within a few percent in a redshiftwindow just prior to the end of the reionization era, provided that foregroundscan be removed over frequency band-passes of &gt;8mhz. this sensitivity to theacoustic scale is comparable to the best current measurements from galaxyredshift surveys, but at much higher redshifts. future extensions of the firstgeneration experiments (involving an order of magnitude increase in theantennae number of the mwa) could reach sensitivities below one percent inseveral redshift windows and could be used to study the dark energy in theunexplored redshift regime of 3.5&lt;z&lt;12. moreover, new experiments with antennaedesigned to operate at higher frequencies would allow precision measurements(&lt;1%) of the acoustic peak to be made at more moderate redshifts (1.5&lt;z&lt;3.5),where they would be competitive with ambitious spectroscopic galaxy surveyscovering more than 1000 square degrees. together with other data sets,observations of 21cm fluctuations will allow full coverage of the acousticscale from the present time out to z~12.

1104.0712	non-gravitational contributions to the clustering of ly-alpha selected  galaxies: implications for cosmological surveys	we show that the dependence of ly-alpha absorption on environment leads tosignificant non-gravitational features in the redshift space power-spectrum ofly-alpha selected galaxies. we derive a physically motivated fitting formulathat can be included in clustering analyses, and use this to discuss thepredicted features in the ly-alpha galaxy power-spectrum based on detailedmodels in which ly-alpha absorption is influenced by gas infall and/or bystrong galactic outflows. we show that power-spectrum measurements could beused to study the astrophysics of the galaxy-igm connection, and to measure theproperties of outflows from star-forming galaxies. applying the modifiedredshift space power-spectrum to a ly-alpha survey with parameterscorresponding to the planned hobby-eberly telescope dark energy experiment(hetdex), we find that the dependence of observed ly-alpha flux on velocitygradient and ionising background may compromise the ability of ly-alphaselected galaxy redshift surveys to constrain cosmology using information fromthe full power-spectrum. this is because the effects of fluctuating ionizingbackground and velocity gradients effect the shape of the observedpower-spectrum in ways that are similar to the shape of the primordialpower-spectrum and redshift space distortions respectively. we use thealcock-paczynski test to show that without prior knowledge of the details ofly-alpha absorption in the igm, the precision of line-of-sight and transversedistance measurements for hetdex will be ~1.3-1.7%, decreased by a factor of~1.5-2 relative to the best case precision of ~0.8% available in a traditionalgalaxy redshift survey. we specify the precision with which modelling ofly-alpha radiative transfer must be understood in order for hetdex to achievedistance measurements that are better than 1%.

1108.3840	an empirical study of the relationship between ly{\alpha} and uv  selected galaxies: do theorists and observers `select' the same objects?	lyman alpha emitters (laes) are galaxies that have been selected on the basisof a strong ly{\alpha} emission line in their spectra. observational campaignshave dramatically increased the sample of known laes, which now extends out toz=7. these discoveries have motivated numerous theoretical studies on thesubject, which usually define laes in their models based on sharp ly{\alpha}luminosity and equivalent width (ew) cuts. while broadly representative, thisprocedure does not mimic the selection from observational programs in detail,which instead use cuts in various colour-spaces. we investigate whatimplications this disjoint may have for studies that aim to model laes. weconstruct an empirical model for the number density of star forming galaxies asa function of their uv and ly{\alpha} luminosity, utilising measuredconstraints on the luminosity functions (lfs) of drop-out galaxies, and theirluminosity dependent probability distribution function of ly{\alpha} ew. inparticular, we investigate whether the lae lfs can be reproduced by defininglaes using a (z-dependent) ly{\alpha} luminosity and ew threshold. while we areable to reproduce the observed distribution of ly{\alpha} ew among laes out torestframe ew 200 a, we find that our formalism over-predicts both the uv andly{\alpha} lfs of laes by a factor of 2-3, and is inconsistent withobservations at the ~95% level. this tension is partially resolved if we assumethe ly{\alpha} ew-distribution of drop-out galaxies to be truncated atrestframe ew&gt;150 a. however the overprediction indicates that modeling laeswith simple rew and luminosity cuts does not accurately mimic observedselection criteria, and can lead to uncertainties in the predicted numberdensity of laes. on the other hand, the predicted z-evolution is not affected.we apply our formalism to drop-out galaxies at z&gt;6, and predict the lfs of laesat z=7-9.

1111.5424	photon trapping enables super-eddington growth of black-hole seeds in  galaxies at high redshift	we identify a physical mechanism that would have resulted in rapid, obscuredgrowth of seed super-massive black-holes in galaxies at z&gt;6. specifically, wefind that the density at the centre of typical high redshift galaxies was at alevel where the bondi accretion rate implies a diffusion speed of photons thatwas slower than the gravitational infall velocity, resulting in photons beingtrapped within the accretion flow and advected into the black-hole. we showthat there is a range of black-hole masses (m_bh ~ 10^3-10^5 solar masses)where the accretion flow traps radiation, corresponding to black-holes thatwere massive enough to generate a photon trapping accretion flow, but smallenough that their bondi radii did not exceed the isothermal scale height ofself-gravitating gas. under these conditions we find that the accretion reacheslevels far in excess of the eddington rate. a prediction of this scenario isthat x-ray number counts of active galactic nuclei at z&gt;6 would exhibit acutoff at the low luminosities corresponding to black-hole masses below ~10^5solar masses. at low redshifts we find photon trapping to be unimportantbecause it could only occur in rare low spin halos, and would requireblack-hole masses in excess of expectations from the observed black-hole - halomass relation. the super-eddington growth of ~10^5 solar mass seed black-holesat high redshift may have provided a natural acceleration towards the growth ofsuper-massive black-holes at z~6-7, less than a billion years after the bigbang.

1209.2215	a suppressed contribution of low mass galaxies to reionization due to  supernova feedback	motivated by recent observations of the star formation rate density functionout to z~7, we describe a simple model for the star formation rate densityfunction at high redshift based on the extended press-schechter formalism. thismodel postulates a starburst following each major merger, lasting for a timet_sf and converting at most f_star of galactic gas into stars. we include asimple physical prescription for supernovae feedback that suppresses starformation in low mass galaxies. constraining t_sf and f_star to describe theobserved star formation rate density at high redshifts, we find that individualstarbursts were terminated after a time t_sf~10^7 years. this is comparable tothe main-sequence lifetimes of supernova progenitors, indicating that highredshift starbursts are quenched once supernovae feedback had time to develop.high redshift galaxies convert ~10% of their mass into stars for galaxies withstar formation rates above ~1 solar mass per year, but a smaller fraction forlower luminosity galaxies. our best fit model successfully predicts theobserved relation between star formation rate and stellar mass at z&gt;~4, whileour deduced relation between stellar mass and halo mass is also consistent withdata on the dwarf satellites of the milky way. we find that supernovae feedbacklowers the efficiency of star formation in the lowest mass galaxies and makestheir contribution to reionization small. as a result, photo-ionizationfeedback on low mass galaxy formation does not significantly affect thereionization history. using a semi-analytic model for the reionization history,we infer that approximately half of the ionizing photons needed to completereionization have already been observed in star-forming galaxies.

1308.2030	a predicted new population of uv-faint galaxies at z&gt;4	we show that a bursty model of high redshift star formation explains severalpuzzling observations of the high redshift galaxy population. we begin bypointing out that the observed specific star formation rate requires aduty-cycle of ~10%, which is much lower than found in many hydro-dynamicalsimulations. this value follows directly from the fact that the observed starformation rate in galaxies integrated over a hubble time exceeds the observedstellar mass by an order of magnitude. we use the large observed specific starformation rate to calibrate the efficiency of feedback in a model for the highredshift star formation rate which includes merger driven star formationregulated by sne feedback. this model reproduces the star formation ratedensity function and the stellar mass function of galaxies at 4&lt;z&lt;7. aprediction of the model is that the specific star formation rate does notevolve very rapidly with either mass or redshift, in agreement withobservation. this is in contrast to results from hydrodynamical simulationswhere the star formation closely follows the accretion rate, and so increasesstrongly towards high redshift. the bursty star formation model naturallyexplains the observation that there is not enough stellar mass at z~2-4 toaccount for all of the star-formation observed, without invoking propertieslike an evolving initial mass function of stars. the finding of a duty cyclethat is ~10% implies that there should be ten times the number of knowngalaxies at fixed stellar mass that have not yet been detected through standarduv selection at high redshift. we therefore predict the existence of a largeundetected population of uv-faint galaxies that accounts for most of thestellar mass density at z~4-8.

1312.4964	the stellar mass function and star formation rate-stellar mass relation  of galaxies at z ~ 4 - 7	we investigate the evolution of the star formation rate-stellar mass relation(sfr-m*) and galaxy stellar mass function (gsmf) of z ~ 4-7 galaxies, usingcosmological simulations run with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics codep-gadget3(xxl). we explore the effects of different feedback prescriptions(supernova driven galactic winds and agn feedback), initial stellar massfunctions and metal cooling. we show that our fiducial model, with strongenergy-driven winds and early agn feedback, is able to reproduce the observedstellar mass function obtained from lyman-break selected samples of starforming galaxies at redshift 6 &lt; z &lt; 7. at z ~ 4, observed estimates of thegsmf vary according to how the sample was selected. our simulations are moreconsistent with recent results from k-selected samples, which provide a betterproxy of stellar masses and are more complete at the high mass end of thedistribution. we find that in some cases simulated and observed sfr-m*relations are in tension, and this can lead to numerical predictions for thegsmf in excess of the gsmf observed. by combining the simulated sfr(m*)relationship with the observed star formation rate function at a givenredshift, we argue that this disagreement may be the result of the uncertaintyin the sfr-m* (luv-m*) conversion. our simulations predict a population offaint galaxies not seen by current observations.

1312.5310	simulated star formation rate functions at z~4-7, and the role of  feedback in high-z galaxies	we study the role of feedback from supernovae and black holes in theevolution of the star formation rate function (sfrf) of z~4-7 galaxies. we usea new set of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, angus (australian gadget-3early universe simulations), run with a modified and improved version of theparallel treepm-smoothed particle hydrodynamics code gadget-3 calledp-gadget3(xxl), that includes a self-consistent implementation of stellarevolution and metal enrichment. in our simulations both supernova (sn) drivengalactic winds and active galactic nuclei (agn) act simultaneously in a complexinterplay. the sfrf is insensitive to feedback prescription at z&gt;5, meaningthat it cannot be used to discriminate between feedback models duringreionisation. however, the sfrf is sensitive to the details of feedbackprescription at lower redshift. by exploring different sn driven windvelocities and regimes for the agn feedback, we find that the key factor forreproducing the observed sfrfs is a combination of "strong" sn winds and earlyagn feedback in low mass galaxies. conversely, we show that the choice ofinitial mass function and inclusion of metal cooling have less impact on theevolution of the sfrf. when variable winds are considered, we find that anon-aggressive wind scaling is needed to reproduce the sfrfs at z&gt;4. otherwise,the amount of objects with low sfrs is greatly suppressed and at the same timewinds are not effective enough in the most massive systems.

1401.7676	evolution in the escape fraction of ionizing photons and the decline in  strong lya emission from z&gt;6 galaxies	the rapid decline in the number of strong lyman alpha (lya) emitting galaxiesat z &gt; 6 provides evidence for neutral hydrogen in the igm, but is difficult toexplain with plausible models for reionization. we demonstrate that theobserved reduction in lya flux from galaxies at z &gt; 6 can be explained byevolution in the escape fraction of ionizing photons, f_esc. we find that themedian observed drop in the fraction of galaxies showing strong lya emission,as well as the observed evolution of the lya luminosity function both followfrom a small increase in f_esc of delta f_esc ~ 0.1 from f_esc ~ 0.6 at z ~ 6.this high escape fraction may be at odds with current constraints on theionising photon escape fraction, which favor smaller values of f_esc &lt; 20%.however, models that invoke a redshift evolution of f_ esc that is consistentwith these constraints can suppress the z~7 lya flux to the observed level, ifthey also include a small evolution in global neutral fraction of delta x_hi ~0.2. thus, an evolving escape fraction of ionising photons can be a plausiblepart of the explanation for evolution in the lya emission of high redshiftgalaxies. more generally, our analysis also shows that the drop in the lyafraction is quantitatively consistent with the observed evolution in the lyaluminosity functions of lya emitters.

0804.0468	redshifted 21cm observations of high redshift quasar proximity zones	the introduction of low-frequency radio arrays is expected to revolutionizethe study of the reionization epoch. observation of the contrast in redshifted21cm emission between a large hii region and the surrounding neutralinter-galactic medium (igm) will be the simplest and most easily interpretedsignature. however the highest redshift quasars known are thought to reside inan ionized igm. using a semi-analytic model we describe the redshifted 21cmsignal from the igm surrounding quasars discovered using the i-drop outtechnique (i.e. quasars at z~6). we argue that while quasars at z&lt;6.5 seem toreside in the post overlap igm, they will still provide valuable probes of thelate stages of the overlap era because the light-travel time across a quasarproximity zone should be comparable to the duration of overlap. for redshifted21cm observations within a 32mhz bandpass, we find that the subtraction of aspectrally smooth foreground will not remove spectral features due to theproximity zone. these features could be used to measure the neutral hydrogencontent of the igm during the late stages of reionization. the density ofquasars at z~6 is now well constrained. we use the measured quasar luminosityfunction to estimate the prospects for discovery of high redshift quasars infields that will be observed by the murchison widefield array.

0804.1624	a method to measure the mass of damped ly-alpha absorber host galaxies  using fluctuations in 21cm emission	observations of damped ly-alpha absorbers (dla) indicate that the fraction ofhydrogen in its neutral form (hi) is significant by mass at all redshifts. thisgas represents the reservoir of material that is available for star formationat late times. as a result, observational identification of the systems inwhich this neutral hydrogen resides is an important missing ingredient inmodels of galaxy formation. precise identification of dla host mass viatraditional clustering studies is not practical owing to the small numbers ofknown systems being spread across sparsely distributed sight lines. howeverfollowing the completion of reionization, 21cm surface brightness fluctuationswill be dominated by neutral hydrogen in dlas. observations of thesefluctuations will measure the combined clustering signal from all dlas within alarge volume. we show that measurement of the spherically averagedpower-spectrum of 21cm intensity fluctuations due to dlas could be used tomeasure the galaxy bias for dla host galaxies when combined with an independentmeasurement of the cosmological hi mass density from quasar absorption studies.utilising this technique, the low frequency arrays now under construction couldmeasure the characteristic dla host mass with a statistical precision as low as0.3 dex at z~4. in addition, high signal-to-noise observations of thepeculiar-motion induced anisotropy of the power-spectrum would facilitatemeasurement of both the dla host mass and the cosmic hi density directly from21cm fluctuations. by exploiting this anisotropy, a second generation of lowfrequency arrays with an order of magnitude increase in collecting area couldmeasure the values of cosmic hi density and dla host mass, with uncertaintiesof a few percent and a few tens of percent respectively.

0705.1825	the correlation between star formation and 21cm emission during the  reionization epoch	reionization is thought to be dominated by low mass galaxies, while directobservations of resolved galaxies probe only the most massive, rarest objects.the cross-correlation between fluctuations in the surface brightness of thecumulative ly-alpha emission (which serves as a proxy for the star formationrate) and the redshifted 21cm signal from neutral hydrogen in the intergalacticmedium (igm), will directly probe the causal link between the production ofionizing photons in galaxies and the reionization of the igm. we discuss theprospects for detecting this cross-correlation for unresolved galaxies. we findthat on angular scales &lt;10 arc-minutes, detection will be practical usingwidefield near-ir imaging from space in combination with the forthcomingmileura widefield array - low frequency demonstrator. when redshifted 21cmobservations of the neutral igm are combined with space-based near-ir imagingof ly-alpha emission, the detection on angular scales &lt;3 arc-minutes will belimited by the sensitivity of the 21cm signal, even when a small apertureoptical telescope (~2m) and a moderate field of view (~10 square degrees) areused. on scales &gt;3 arc-minutes, the measurement of cross-correlation will belimited by the accuracy of the foreground sky subtraction.

1501.04246	imaging hii regions from galaxies and quasars during reionisation with  ska	the ionisation structure of the intergalactic medium (igm) duringreionisation is sensitive to the unknown galaxy formation physics thatprevailed at that time. this structure introduces non-gaussian statistics intothe redshifted 21 cm fluctuation amplitudes that can only be studied throughtomographic imaging, which will clearly discriminate between different galaxyformation scenarios. imaging the ionisation structure and cosmological hiiregions during reionisation is therefore a key goal for the ska. for example,the ska1-low baseline design with a 1 km diameter core will resolve hii regionsexpected from galaxy formation models which include strong feedback on low-massgalaxy formation. imaging the smaller hii regions that result from galaxyformation in the absence of sne feedback will also be possible for ska1-low inthe later stages of reionisation, but may require the greater sensitivity ofska early in the reionisation era. in addition to having baselines long enoughto resolve the hii regions, the field of view for ska1-low reionisationexperiments should be at least several degrees in order to image the largest histructures towards the end of reionisation. the baseline design with 35 meterdiameter stations has a field of view within a single primary pointing which issufficient for this purpose.

1502.03795	correcting the z~8 galaxy luminosity function for gravitational lensing  magnification bias	we present a bayesian framework to account for the magnification bias fromboth strong and weak gravitational lensing in estimates of high-redshift galaxyluminosity functions. we illustrate our method by estimating the $z\sim8$ uvluminosity function using a sample of 97 y-band dropouts (lyman break galaxies)found in the brightest of reionizing galaxies (borg) survey and from theliterature. we find the luminosity function is well described by a schechterfunction with characteristic magnitude of $m^\star = -19.85^{+0.30}_{-0.35}$,faint-end slope of $\alpha = -1.72^{+0.30}_{-0.29}$, and number density of$\log_{10} \psi^\star [\textrm{mpc}^{-3}] = -3.00^{+0.23}_{-0.31}$. theseparameters are consistent within the uncertainties with those inferred from thesame sample without accounting for the magnification bias, demonstrating thatthe effect is small for current surveys at $z\sim8$, and cannot account for theapparent overdensity of bright galaxies compared to a schechter function foundrecently by bowler et al. (2014a,b) and finkelstein et al. (2014). we estimatethat the probability of finding a strongly lensed $z\sim8$ source in our sampleis in the range $\sim 3-15 \%$ depending on limiting magnitude. we identify onestrongly-lensed candidate and three cases of intermediate lensing in borg(estimated magnification $\mu&gt;1.4$) in addition to the previously knowncandidate group-scale strong lens. using a range of theoretical luminosityfunctions we conclude that magnification bias will dominate wide field surveys-- such as those planned for the euclid and wfirst missions -- especially at$z&gt;10$. magnification bias will need to be accounted for in order to deriveaccurate estimates of high-redshift luminosity functions in these surveys andto distinguish between galaxy formation models.

0805.0038	the effect of galactic foreground subtraction on redshifted 21-cm  observations of quasar hii regions	we assess the impact of galactic synchrotron foreground removal on theobservation of high-redshift quasar hii regions in redshifted 21-cm emission.we consider the case where a quasar is observed in an intergalactic medium(igm) whose ionisation structure evolves slowly relative to the light crossingtime of the hii region, as well as the case where the evolution is rapid. thelatter case is expected towards the end of the reionisation era where thehighest redshift luminous quasars will be observed. in the absence offoregrounds the fraction of neutral hydrogen in the igm could be measureddirectly from the contrast between the hii region and surrounding igm. however,we find that foreground removal lowers the observed contrast between the hiiregion and the igm. this indicates that measurement of the neutral fractionwould require modelling to correct for this systematic effect. on the otherhand, foreground removal does not modify the most prominent features of the21-cm maps. using a simple algorithm we demonstrate that measurements of thesize and shape of observed hii regions will not be affected by continuumforeground removal. moreover, measurements of these quantities will not beadversely affected by the presence of a rapidly evolving igm.

0807.4782	the escape fraction of ionizing photons from high redshift galaxies	the fraction of ionizing photons which escape their host galaxy and so areable to ionize hydrogen in the inter-galactic medium (igm) is a criticalparameter in studies of the reionization era and early galaxy formation. inthis paper we combine observations of lyman-alpha absorption towards highredshift quasars with the measured uv luminosity function of high redshiftgalaxies to constrain the escape fraction (f_esc) of ionizing photons fromgalaxies at z ~ 5.5-6. the observed lyman-alpha transmission constrains theescape fraction to lie in the range f_esc ~ 10-25 % (at z ~ 5.5-6). excludinghalos with m&lt; 10^10 m_sun (as might be expected if galaxy formation issuppressed due to the reionization of the igm) implies a larger escape fractionof f_esc ~ 20-45 %. using the numerical results to calibrate an analyticrelation between the escape fraction and minimum galaxy halo mass we alsoextrapolate our results to a mass (m~10^8 m_sun) corresponding to the hydrogencooling threshold. in this case we find f_esc ~ 5-10 %, consistent withobserved estimates at lower redshift. we find that the escape fraction of highredshift galaxies must be greater than 5 % irrespepctive of galaxy mass. basedon these results we use a semi-analytic description to model the reionizationhistory of the igm, assuming ionizing sources with escape fractions suggestedby our numerical simulations. we find that the ibg observed at z ~ 5.5-6implies a sufficient number of ionizing photons to have reionized the universeby z ~ 6. however, if the minimum mass for star-formation were greater than10^9 m_sun, the ibg would be over-produced at redshifts less than z ~ 5. insummary, our results support a scenario in which the igm was reionized by lowmass galaxies.

astro-ph;0203116	gravitational lenses magnify up to one third of the most distant quasars	exceptionally bright quasars with redshifts up to z=6.28 have recently beendiscovered. quasars are thought to be powered by the accretion of gas ontosupermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies. their maximum (eddington)luminosity is proportional to the mass of the black hole, and so these brightquasars are inferred to have black holes with masses of more than a few billionsolar masses. the existence of such massive black holes poses a challenge tomodels for the formation of structures in the early universe, as it requiresthat the black holes would grow so massive in less than a billion years afterthe big bang. here we show that up to a third of known quasars with z~6 willhave their observed flux magnified by a factor of 10 or more throughgravitational lensing by galaxies along the line of sight. the inferredabundance of quasar host galaxies, as well as the luminosity density providedby the quasars, are therefore substantially overestimated.

astro-ph;0203119	gravitational lensing of the sdss high-redshift quasars	we predict the effects of gravitational lensing on the color-selectedflux-limited samples of z~4.3 and z&gt;5.8 quasars, recently published by thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). our main findings are: (i) the lensingprobability should be 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than for conventionalsurveys. the expected fraction of multiply-imaged quasars is highly sensitiveto redshift and the uncertain slope of the bright end of the luminosityfunction, beta_h. for beta_h=2.58 (3.43) we find that at z~4.3 and i*&lt;20.0 thefraction is ~4% (13%) while at z~6 and z*&lt;20.2 the fraction is ~7% (30%). (ii)the distribution of magnifications is heavily skewed; sources having theredshift and luminosity of the sdss z&gt;5.8 quasars acquire median magnificationsof med(mu_obs)~1.1-1.3 and mean magnifications of &lt;mu_obs&gt;~5-50. estimates ofthe quasar luminosity density at high redshift must therefore filter outgravitationally-lensed sources. (iii) the flux in the gunn-peterson trough ofthe highest redshift (z=6.28) quasar is known to be f_lambda&lt;3 10^-19erg/sec/cm^2/angstrom. should this quasar be multiply imaged, we estimate a 40%chance that light from the lens galaxy would have contaminated the same part ofthe quasar spectrum with a higher flux. hence, spectroscopic studies of theepoch of reionization need to account for the possibility that a lens galaxy,which boosts the quasar flux, also contaminates the gunn-peterson trough. (iv)microlensing by stars should result in ~1/3 of multiply imaged quasars in thez&gt;5.8 catalog varying by more than 0.5 magnitudes over the next decade. themedian equivalent width would be lowered by ~20% with respect to the intrinsicvalue due to differential magnification of the continuum and emission-lineregions.

astro-ph;0204529	measuring the size of quasar broad-line clouds through time delay  light-curve anomalies of gravitational lenses	intensive monitoring campaigns have recently attempted to measure the timedelays between multiple images of gravitational lenses. some of the resultinglight-curves show puzzling low-level, rapid variability which is unique toindividual images, superimposed on top of (and concurrent with) longertime-scale intrinsic quasar variations which repeat in all images. wedemonstrate that both the amplitude and variability time-scale of the rapidlight-curve anomalies, as well as the correlation observed between intrinsicand microlensed variability, are naturally explained by stellar microlensing ofa smooth accretion disk which is occulted by optically-thick broad-line clouds.the rapid time-scale is caused by the high velocities of the clouds (~5x10^3km/s), and the low amplitude results from the large number of clouds coveringthe magnified or demagnified parts of the disk. the observed amplitudes ofvariations in specific lenses implies that the number of broad-line clouds thatcover ~10% of the quasar sky is ~10^5 per 4 pi steradian. this is comparable tothe expected number of broad line clouds in models where the clouds originatefrom bloated stars.

astro-ph;0206154	a physical model for the luminosity function of high-redshift quasars	we provide a simple theoretical model for the quasar luminosity function athigh redshifts that naturally reproduces the statistical properties of theluminous sdss quasar sample at redshifts z~4.3 and z&gt;5.7. our model is based onthe assumptions that quasar emission is triggered by galaxy mergers, and thatthe black hole mass is proportional to a power-law in the circular velocity vof the host galactic halo. we assume that quasars shine at their eddingtonluminosity over a time proportional to the mass ratio between the small andfinal galaxies in the merger. this simple model fits the quasar luminosityfunction at z~2-3, reproduces the normalization and logarithmic slope (beta-2.58) at z~4.3, explains the space density of bright sdss quasars at z~6.0,reproduces the black hole - halo mass relation for dormant black holes in thelocal universe, and matches the estimated duty cycle of quasar activity (~10^7years) in lyman-break galaxies at z~3. based on the derived luminosity functionwe predict the resulting gravitational lensing rates for high redshift quasars.the lens fractions in the sdss samples are predicted to be ~2% at z~4.3 and~10% at z&gt;5.7. interestingly, the limiting quasar luminosity in our best-fitrelation of l proportional to v^5/g, scales as the binding energy of the hostgalaxy divided by its dynamical time, implying that feedback is the mechanismthat regulates black hole growth in galactic potential wells.

astro-ph;0209056	reionization of hydrogen and helium by early stars and quasars	we compute the reionization histories of hydrogen and helium due to theionizing radiation fields produced by stars and quasars. for the quasars we usea model based on halo-merger rates that reproduces all known properties of thequasar luminosity function at high redshifts. the less constrained propertiesof the ionizing radiation produced by stars are modeled with two freeparameters: (i) a transition redshift, z_tran, above which the stellarpopulation is dominated by massive, zero-metallicity stars and below which itis dominated by a scalo mass function; (ii) the product of the escape fractionof stellar ionizing photons from their host galaxies and the star-formationefficiency, f_esc f_*. we constrain the allowed range of these free parametersat high redshifts based on the lack of the hi gunn-peterson trough at z&lt;6 andthe upper limit on the total intergalactic optical depth for electronscattering, tau_es&lt;0.18, from recent cosmic microwave background (cmb)experiments. we find that quasars ionize helium by a redshift z~4, but cannotreionize hydrogen by themselves before z~6. a major fraction of the allowedcombinations of f_esc f_* and z_tran lead to an early peak in the ionizedfraction due to metal-free stars at high redshifts. this sometimes results intwo reionization epochs, namely an early hii or heiii overlap phase followed byrecombination and a second overlap phase. even if early overlap is notachieved, the peak in the visibility function for scattering of the cmb oftencoincides with the early ionization phase rather than with the actualreionization epoch. consequently, tau_es does not correspond directly to thereionization redshift. we generically find values of tau_es&gt;7%, that should bedetectable by the map satellite.

astro-ph;0304156	self-regulated growth of supermassive black holes in galaxies as the  origin of the optical and x-ray luminosity functions of quasars	we postulate that supermassive black-holes grow in the centers of galaxiesuntil they unbind the galactic gas that feeds them. we show that thecorresponding self-regulation condition yields a correlation between black-holemass (mbh) and galaxy velocity dispersion (sigma) as inferred in the localuniverse, and recovers the observed optical and x-ray luminosity functions ofquasars at redshifts up to z~6 based on the hierarchical evolution of galaxyhalos in a lambda-cdm cosmology. with only one free parameter and a simplealgorithm, our model yields the observed evolution in the number density ofoptically bright or x-ray faint quasars between 2&lt;z&lt;6 across 3 orders ofmagnitude in bolometric luminosity and 3 orders of magnitude in comovingdensity per logarithm of luminosity. the self-regulation condition identifiesthe dynamical time of galactic disks during the epoch of peak quasar activity(z~2.5) as the origin of the inferred characteristic quasar lifetime of ~10million years. since the lifetime becomes comparable to the salpeter e-foldingtime at this epoch, the model also implies that the mbh-sigma relation is aproduct of feedback regulated accretion during the peak of quasar activity. themass-density in black-holes accreted by that time is consistent with the localblack-hole mass density of ~(0.8-6.3) times 10^5 solar masses per cubic mpc,which we have computed by combining the mbh-sigma relation with the measuredvelocity dispersion function of sdss galaxies (sheth et al.~2003). applying asimilar self-regulation principle to supernova-driven winds from starbursts, wefind that the ratio between the black hole mass and the stellar mass ofgalactic spheroids increases with redshift as (1+z)^1.5 although the mbh-sigmarelation is redshift-independent.

astro-ph;0308290	the shallow slope of the z~6 quasar luminosity function: limits from the  lack of multiple image gravitational lenses	we place a limit on the logarithmic slope of the luminous quasar luminosityfunction at z~6 of beta&gt;-3.0 (90%) using gravitational lensing constraints tobuild on the limit of beta&gt;-3.3 (90%) derived from an analysis of theluminosity distribution (fan et al. 2003). this tight constraint is obtained bynoting that of the two quasars which are lensed by foreground galaxies, neitherare multiply imaged. these observations are surprising if the luminosityfunction is steep because magnification bias results in an overabundance ofmultiply imaged relative to singly imaged lensed quasars. our bayesian analysisuses the a-posteriori information regarding alignments with foreground galaxiesof the two lensed quasars, and provides a constraint on beta that is nearlyindependent of the uncertain evolution in the lens population. the resultssuggest that the bright end of the quasar luminosity function continues toflatten out to z~6, as is observed between z~3 and z~5 (fan et al. 2001).provided that sdss j1148-5251 at z=6.37 is magnified by an intervening lensgalaxy at z~5 (white et al. 2003), we also show that the high lens redshift inthis system implies a co-moving density of massive galaxies that is close toconstant out to high redshift. this is in agreement with the lack of redshiftevolution in the velocity function of dark-matter halos with velocitydispersions near 200 km/sec as predicted by the press-schechter formalism. thecombination of constraints on the quasar luminosity function and lens galaxyevolution are used to compute an improved estimate for the z~6 multiple imagelens fraction of ~1-3%.

astro-ph;0401188	cosmic hydrogen was significantly neutral a billion years after the big  bang	the ionization fraction of cosmic hydrogen, left over from the big bang,provides crucial fossil evidence for when the first stars and quasar blackholes formed in the infant universe. spectra of the two most distant quasarsknown show nearly complete absorption of photons with wavelengths shorter thanthe ly-alpha transition of neutral hydrogen, indicating that hydrogen in theintergalactic medium (igm) had not been completely ionized at a redshift z~6.3,about a billion years after the big bang. here we show that the radii ofinfluence of ionizing radiation from these quasars imply that the surroundingigm had a neutral hydrogen fraction of tens of percent prior to the quasaractivity, much higher than previous lower limits of ~0.1%. when combined withthe recent inference of a large cumulative optical depth to electron scatteringafter cosmological recombination from the wmap data, our result suggests theexistence of a second peak in the mean ionization history, potentially due toan early formation episode of the first stars.

astro-ph;0401554	redshifted 21cm signatures around the highest redshift quasars	the ly-alpha absorption spectrum of the highest redshift quasars indicatesthat they are surrounded by giant hii regions, a few mpc in size. the neutralgas around these hii regions should emit 21cm radiation in excess of the cosmicmicrowave background, and enable future radio telescopes to measure thetransverse extent of these hii regions. at early times, the hii regions expandwith a relativistic speed. consequently, their measured sizes along theline-of-sight (via ly-alpha absorption) and transverse to it (via 21 cmemission) should have different observed values due to relativistic time-delay.we show that the combined measurement of these sizes would directly constrainthe neutral fraction of the surrounding intergalactic medium (igm) as well asthe quasar lifetime. based on current number counts of luminous quasars at z&gt;6,an instrument like lofar should detect &gt;2 redshifted 21cm shells per field(with a radius of 11 degrees) around active quasars as bright as those alreadydiscovered by sdss, and &gt;200 relic shells of inactive quasars per field. weshow that ly-alpha photons from the quasar are unable to heat the igm or tocouple the spin and kinetic temperatures of atomic hydrogen beyond the edge ofthe hii region. the detection of the igm in 21cm emission around high redshiftquasars would therefore gauge the presence of a cosmic ly-alpha backgroundduring the reionization epoch.

astro-ph;0403714	calibrating the galaxy halo - black hole relation based on the  clustering of quasars	the observed number counts of quasars may be explained either by long-livedactivity within rare massive hosts, or by short-lived activity within smaller,more common hosts. it has been argued that quasar lifetimes may therefore beinferred from their clustering length, which determines the typical mass of thequasar host. here we point out that the relationship between the mass of theblack-hole and the circular velocity of its host dark-matter halo is morefundamental to the determination of the clustering length. in particular, theclustering length observed in the 2df quasar redshift survey is consistent withthe galactic halo - black-hole relation observed in local galaxies, providedthat quasars shine at ~10-100% of their eddington luminosity. the slowevolution of the clustering length with redshift inferred in the 2df quasarsurvey favors a black-hole mass whose redshift-independent scaling is with halocircular velocity, rather than halo mass. these results are independent fromobservations of the number counts of bright quasars which may be used todetermine the quasar lifetime and its dependence on redshift. we show that ifquasar activity results from galaxy mergers, then the number counts of quasarsimply an episodic quasar lifetime that is set by the dynamical time of the hostgalaxy rather than by the salpeter time. our results imply that as the redshiftincreases, the central black-holes comprise a larger fraction of their hostgalaxy mass and the quasar lifetime gets shorter.

astro-ph;0501330	properties of high redshift quasars-i: evolution of the super-massive  black-hole to halo mass ratio	in the local universe, the masses of super-massive black-holes (smbh) appearto correlate with physical properties of their hosts, including the mass of thedark-matter halos. at higher redshifts, we observe the growth of smbhsindirectly through identification of high redshift quasars. however informationon their hosts is difficult to obtain. in this paper we determine the masses ofhalos that host high redshift quasars (at z&gt;4) by comparing the rate of growthof quasar density with that predicted by the press-schechter mass function. thehost mass determined depends on how the ratio between smbh and host halo massevolves with redshift. assuming the ratio between smbh and halo mass does notevolve with redshift, we find a host halo mass of log(m)=11.7+/-0.3 solarmasses. even if the quasars shine at their eddington limit, this mass issignificantly smaller than that seen in the local universe. indeed thenull-hypothesis, of a constant smbh to halo mass ratio at all redshifts, can beruled out at greater than a 5-sigma level. smbhs must therefore havecontributed a larger fraction to the host mass in the past. including redshiftevolution of the smbh to halo mass ratio, we find larger halo masses oflog(m)=12.4+/-0.3 solar masses, and a ratio between smbh and halo mass thatincreases with redshift as ~(1+z)^1.5 are required to be consistent with bothlocal and high redshift observations. we investigate restrictions placed on thecritical linear overdensity of quasar hosts at their epoch of virialisation andfind that it cannot exceed the traditional value of delta_c=1.69 by more than afactor of two. finally, we find that the high redshift quasars are hosted byfluctuations on scales that have a variance of (delta m/m) = 2-3, correspondingto (3-4.5)-sigma fluctuations in the density field.

astro-ph;0503435	a log-quadratic relation between the nuclear black-hole masses and  velocity dispersions of galaxies	we demonstrate that a log-linear relation does not provide an adequatedescription of the correlation between the masses of super-massive black-holes(smbh, m_bh) and the velocity dispersions of their host spheroid (sigma). anunknown relation between log(m_bh) and log(sigma) may be expanded to secondorder to obtain a log-quadratic relation of the form log(m_bh)=alpha+betalog(sigma/200) + beta_2[log(sigma/200)]^2. we perform a bayesian analysis usingthe nuker sample, and solve for beta, beta_2 and alpha, in addition to theintrinsic scatter (delta). we find unbiased parameter estimates ofbeta=4.2+/-0.37, beta_2=1.6+/-1.3 and delta=0.275+/-0.05. at the 80% level them_bh-sigma relation does not follow a uniform power-law. indeed, over thevelocity range 70km/s&lt;sigma&lt;380km/s the logarithmic slope of the best fitrelation varies between 2.7 and 5.1, which should be compared with a power-lawestimate of 4.02+/-0.33. assuming no systematic offset, single epoch virialsmbh masses estimated for agn follow the same log-quadratic m_bh-sigma relationas the nuker sample, but extend it downward in mass by an order of magnitude.the log-quadratic term in the m_bh-sigma relation has a significant effect onestimates of the local smbh mass function at m_bh&gt;10^9 solar masses, leading todensities of smbhs with m_bh&gt;10^10 solar masses that are several orders ofmagnitude larger than inferred from a log-linear relation. we also estimateunbiased parameters for the smbh-bulge mass relation. with a parameterisationlog(m_bh)=alpha_b + beta_b log(m_b/10^{11}) + beta_2b[log(m_b/10^{11})]^2, wefind beta_b=1.15+/-0.18 and beta_2b=0.12+/-0.14. we determined an intrinsicscatter delta_b=0.41+/-0.07 which is ~50% larger than the scatter in them_bh-sigma relation.

astro-ph;0506045	prospects for redshifted 21-cm observations of quasar hii regions	the introduction of low-frequency radio arrays over the coming decade isexpected to revolutionize the study of the reionization epoch. observation ofthe contrast in redshifted 21cm emission between a large hii region and thesurrounding neutral igm will be the simplest and most easily interpretedsignature. we find that an instrument like the planned mileura widefield arraylow-frequency demonstrator (lfd) will be able to obtain good signal to noise onhii regions around the most luminous quasars, and determine some grossgeometric properties, e.g. whether the hii region is spherical or conical. ahypothetical follow-up instrument with 10 times the collecting area of the lfd(mwa-5000) will be capable of mapping the detailed geometry of hii regions,while ska will be capable of detecting very narrow spectral features as well asthe sharpness of the hii region boundary. the mwa-5000 will discoverserendipitous hii regions in widefield observations. we estimate the number ofhii regions which are expected to be generated by quasars. assuming a latereionization at z~6 we find that there should be several tens of quasar hiiregions larger than 4mpc at z~6-8 per field of view. identification of hiiregions in forthcoming 21cm surveys can guide a search for bright galaxies inthe middle of these regions. most of the discovered galaxies would be themassive hosts of dormant quasars that left behind fossil hii cavities thatpersisted long after the quasar emission ended, owing to the long recombinationtime of intergalactic hydrogen. a snap-shot survey of candidate hii regionsselected in redshifted 21cm image cubes may prove to be the most efficientmethod for finding very high redshift quasars and galaxies.

astro-ph;0506294	constraints on the process that regulates the growth of supermassive  black holes based on the intrinsic scatter in the m_bh-sigma relation	we show that the observed scatter in the relations between the mass ofsupermassive black holes (smbhs), m_bh, and the velocity dispersion sigma ormass m_sph of their host spheroid, place interesting constraints on the processthat regulates smbh growth in galaxies. when combined with the observedproperties of early-type sdss galaxies, the observed intrinsic scatters implythat smbh growth is regulated by the spheroid velocity dispersion rather thanits mass. the m_bh-m_sph relation is therefore a by-product of a morefundamental m_bh-sigma relation. we construct a theoretical model for thescatter among baryon modified dark matter halo profiles, out of which wegenerate a population of spheroid hosts and show that these naturally lead to arelation between effective radius and velocity dispersion of the form r_sph ~sigma^1.5 with a scatter of ~0.2dex, in agreement with the correspondingprojection of the fundamental plane for early type galaxies in sdss. at theredshift of formation, our model predicts the minimum scatter that smbhs canhave at fixed velocity dispersion or spheroid mass under different formationscenarios. we also estimate the additional scatter that is introduced intothese relations through collisionless mergers of purely stellar spheroids atz&lt;1. we find that the observed scatter in the m_bh-sigma and m_bh-m_sphrelations preclude the properties of dark matter halos from being the governingfactor in smbh growth. finally, we show that smbh growth governed by theproperties of the host spheroid can lead to the observed values of scatter inthe m_bh-sigma and m_bh-m_sph relations, only if the smbh growth is limited bymomentum or energy feedback over the dynamical time of the host spheroid.

astro-ph;0508604	cosmic variance in the transparency of the intergalactic medium after  reionization	following the completion of cosmic reionization, the mean-free-path ofionizing photons was set by a population of ly-limit absorbers. as themean-free-path steadily grew, the intensity of the ionizing background alsogrew, thus lowering the residual neutral fraction of hydrogen in ionizationequilibrium throughout the diffuse intergalactic medium (igm). ly-alpha photonsprovide a sensitive probe for tracing the distribution of this residualhydrogen at the end of reionization. here we calculate the cosmic varianceamong different lines-of-sight in the distribution of the mean ly-alpha opticaldepths. we find fractional variations in the effective post-reionizationoptical depth that are of order unity on a scale of ~100 co-moving mpc, inagreement with observations towards high-redshift quasars. significantcontributions to these variations are provided by the cosmic variance in thedensity contrast on the scale of the mean-free-path for ionizing photons, andby fluctuations in the ionizing background induced by delayed or enhancedstructure formation. cosmic variance results in a highly asymmetricdistribution of transmission through the igm, with fractional fluctuations inly-alpha transmission that ar larger than in ly-beta transmission.

astro-ph;0602503	the extended starformation history of the first generation of stars, and  the reionization of cosmic hydrogen	population-iii (pop-iii) starformation (sf) is thought to be quenched whenthe metallicity of the star-forming gas reaches a critical level. at high z,when the general intergalactic medium (igm) was enriched with metals, thefraction of primordial gas already collapsed in minihalos was significantlylarger than the fraction of primordial gas that had already been involved inpop-iii sf. we argue that this minihalo gas remained largely in a metal-freestate, until these minihalos merged into large systems and formed stars. as aresult, the era of pop-iii sf was significantly prolonged, leading to anintegrated pop-iii sf an order of magnitude larger than expected for an abrupttransition redshift. the contribution of pop-iii sf to the reionization ofhydrogen could have been significant until z~10 and may have extended to z~6.our modeling allows for gradual enrichment of the igm, feedback fromphoto-ionization and screening of reionization by minihalos. nevertheless,extended pop-iii sf can result in complex, multi-peaked reionization histories.the contribution of pop-iii stars to reionization will be tested by thethree-year wmap results: (1) if pop-iii stars do not contribute toreionization, tau_es&lt;0.05-0.06 and a rapid reionization at z~6 is expected; (2)if the product of star formation efficiency and escape fraction for pop-iiistars is significantly larger than for pop-ii stars, then a maximum tau_es=0.21is achievable; (3) in a scenario where the product of star formation efficiencyand escape fraction for pop-iii stars is comparable to that for pop-ii stars,tau_es=0.09-0.12 would be observed, with reionization histories characterizedby an extended ionization plateau from z=7-12. this result holds regardless ofthe redshift where the igm becomes enriched with metals.

astro-ph;0603333	properties of high redshift quasars-ii: what does the quasar luminosity  function tell us about super-massive black-hole evolution?	in the local universe, the masses of super-massive black-holes (smbh) appearto correlate with the physical properties of their hosts, including the mass ofthe dark-matter halo. using these clues as a starting point many studies haveproduced models that can explain phenomena like the quasar luminosity function.the shortcoming of this approach is that working models are not unique, and asa result it is not always clear what input physics is being constrained. herewe take a different approach. we identify critical parameters that describe theevolution of smbhs at high redshift, and constrain their parameter space basedon observations of high redshift quasars from the sloan digital sky survey. wefind that the luminosity function taken in isolation is somewhat limited in itsability to constrain smbh evolution due to some strong degeneracies. thisexplains the presence in the literature of a range of equally successful modelsbased on different physical hypotheses. including the constraint of the localsmbh to halo mass ratio breaks some of the degeneracies, and our resultssuggest halo masses at z~4.8 of 10^{12.5+/-0.3}m_solar (with 90% confidence),with a smbh to halo mass ratio that decreases with time (&gt;99%). we also find aquasar luminosity to halo mass ratio that increases with halo mass (&gt;99%).these features need to be incorporated in all successful models of smbhevolution. on the other hand current observations do not permit any conclusionsregarding the evolution of quasar lifetime, or the smbh occupation fraction indark matter halos.

astro-ph;0603550	dwarf galaxy formation was suppressed by cosmic reionization	a large number of faint galaxies, born less than a billion years after thebig bang, have recently been discovered. the fluctuations in the distributionof these galaxies contributed to a scatter in the ionization fraction of cosmichydrogen on scales of tens of mpc, as observed along the lines of sight to theearliest known quasars. theoretical simulations predict that the formation ofdwarf galaxies should have been suppressed after cosmic hydrogen was reionized,leading to a drop in the cosmic star formation rate. here we present evidencefor this suppression. we show that the post-reionization galaxies whichproduced most of the ionizing radiation at a redshift z~5.5, must have had amass in excess of ~10^{10.6+/-0.4} solar masses or else the aforementionedscatter would have been smaller than observed. this limiting mass is two ordersof magnitude larger than the galaxy mass that is thought to have dominated thereionization of cosmic hydrogen (~10^8 solar masses). we predict that futuresurveys with space-based infrared telescopes will detect a population ofsmaller galaxies that reionized the universe at an earlier time, prior to theepoch of dwarf galaxy suppression.

0809.1271	the impact of hi in galaxies on 21-cm intensity fluctuations during the  reionisation epoch	we investigate the impact of neutral hydrogen (hi) in galaxies on thestatistics of 21-cm fluctuations using analytic and semi-numerical modelling.following the reionisation of hydrogen the hi content of the universe isdominated by damped absorption systems (dlas), with a cosmic density in hi thatis observed to be constant at a level equal to ~2% of the cosmic baryon densityfrom z~1 to z~5. we show that extrapolation of this constant fraction into thereionisation epoch results in a reduction of 10-20% in the amplitude of 21-cmfluctuations over a range of spatial scales. the assumption of a differentpercentage during the reionisation era results in a proportional change in the21-cm fluctuation amplitude. we find that consideration of hi in galaxies/dlasreduces the prominence of the hii region induced shoulder in the 21-cm powerspectrum (ps), and hence modifies the scale dependence of 21-cm fluctuations.we also estimate the 21cm-galaxy cross ps, and show that the cross ps changessign on scales corresponding to the hii regions. from consideration of thesensitivity for forthcoming low-frequency arrays we find that the effects of hiin galaxies/dlas on the statistics of 21-cm fluctuations will be significantwith respect to the precision of a ps or cross ps measurement. in addition,since overdense regions are reionised first we demonstrate that thecross-correlation between galaxies and 21-cm emission changes sign at the endof the reionisation era, providing an alternative avenue to pinpoint the end ofreionisation. the sum of our analysis indicates that the hi content of thegalaxies that reionise the universe will need to be considered in detailedmodelling of the 21-cm intensity ps in order to correctly interpretmeasurements from forthcoming low-frequency arrays.

astro-ph;0606334	lyman alpha constraints on very low luminosity agn	recent surveys have detected lya emission from z=4.5-6.5 at luminosities aslow as 10^41 erg/s. there is good evidence that low numbers of agn are amongobserved faint lya emitters. combining these observations with an empiricalrelation between the intrinsic lya and b-band luminosities of agn, we obtain anupper limit on the number density of agn with absolute magnitudes m_b=[-16,-19]at z=4.5-6.5. these agn are up to two orders of magnitude fainter than thosediscovered in the chandra deep field, resulting in the faintest observationalconstraints to date at these redshifts. at z=4.5, the powerlaw slope of thevery faint end of the luminosity function of agn is shallower than the slopeobserved at lower redshifts, beta &lt;1.6, at the 98% confidence level. in fact,we find marginal evidence that the luminosity function rises with luminosity,corresponding to a powerlaw slope beta &lt;0, at magnitudes fainter than m_b~-20(75% confidence level). these results suggest either that accretion onto lowermass black holes is less efficient than onto their more massive counterparts,or that the number of black holes powering agn with m_b &gt;-20 is lower thanexpected from the m_bh-sigma relation by one-two orders of magnitude.extrapolating from reverberation-mapping studies suggests that these blackholes would have m_bh=10^6-10^7 msun. to facilitate the identification of agnamong observed lya emitters, we derive observational properties of faint agn inthe lya line, as well as in the x-ray and optical bands.

astro-ph;0611195	luminosity functions of lyman alpha emitting galaxies and cosmic  reionization of hydrogen	recent observations imply that the observed number counts of lya emitters(laes) evolved significantly between z=5.7 and z=6.5. it has been suggestedthat this was due to a rapid evolution in the ionisation state, and hencetransmission of the igm which caused lya flux from z=6.5 galaxies to be morestrongly suppressed. in this paper we consider the joint evolution of the lyaand uv luminosity functions (lfs) and show that the igm transmission evolvedbetween z=6.5 and z=5.7 by a factor 1.1 &lt;r &lt; 1.8 (95% cl). this result isinsensitive to the underlying model of the lya lf (as well as cosmic variance).using a model for igm transmission, we find that the evolution of the mean igmdensity through cosmic expansion alone may result in a value for the ratio oftransmissions as high as r=1.3. thus, the existing lfs do not provide evidencefor overlap. furthermore, the constraint r&lt;1.8 suggests that the universe atz=6.5 was more than half ionised by volume, i.e. x_i,v&gt;0.5.

0809.1954	modification of the 21-cm power spectrum by x-rays during the epoch of  reionisation	we incorporate a contribution to reionization from x-rays within analytic andsemi-numerical simulations of the 21-cm signal arising from neutral hydrogenduring the epoch of reionization. we explore the impact that x-ray ionizationshave on the power spectrum (ps) of 21-cm fluctuations by varying both theaverage x-ray mfp and the fractional contribution of x-rays to reionization. ingeneral, prior to the epoch when the intergalactic medium is dominated byionized regions (h {\sevensize ii} regions), x-ray-induced ionization enhancesfluctuations on spatial scales smaller than the x-ray mfp, provided that x-rayheating does not strongly supress galaxy formation. conversely, at later timeswhen \h2 regions dominate, small-scale fluctuations in the 21-cm signal aresuppressed by x-ray ionization. our modelling also shows that the modificationof the 21-cm signal due to the presence of x-rays is sensitive to the relativescales of the x-ray mfp, and the characteristic size of \h2 regions. wetherefore find that x-rays imprint an epoch and scale-dependent signature onthe 21-cm ps, whose prominence depends on fractional x-ray contribution. thedegree of x-ray heating of the igm also determines the extent to which thesefeatures can be discerned. we show that the mwa will have sufficientsensitivity to detect this modification of the ps, so long as the x-ray photonmfp falls within the range of scales over which the array is most sensitive($\sim0.1$ mpc$^{-1}$). in cases in which this mfp takes a much smaller value,an array with larger collecting area would be required.

astro-ph;0701667	the impact of the igm on high-redshift lyman alpha emission lines	we calculate the impact of the intergalactic medium (igm) on the observedlyman alpha lines (hereafter lya) emitted by galaxies in an ionised igm at z&gt;4.our model accounts for gas clumping in the igm and for the fact thathigh-redshift galaxies reside in overdense regions, which causes the velocityfield of the igm to depart from the hubble flow. the observed shape of the lyaline varies widely, with dependence on the intrinsic width and systemicvelocity of the line, a galaxies star formation rate and the localextra-galactic uv-background. for large star formation rates and levels of theuv-background, absorption in the igm does not result in a lya line that isasymmetric as is common among known high-redshift lya emitters. for models inwhich the lines do show the observed strong asymmetry, the igm typicallytransmits only 10-30% of the lya flux. the increase in the ionising backgroundthat accompanied the completion of reionisation barely increased the igmtransmission, which suggests that laes of comparable luminosity should notappear to be significantly dimmer prior to overlap. in this light, we brieflydiscuss the potential of lya emitters as a probe into the epoch ofreionisation.

astro-ph;0703070	biased reionisation and non-gaussianity in redshifted 21cm intensity  maps of the reionisation epoch	spatial dependence in the statistics of redshifted 21cm fluctuations promisesto provide the most powerful probe of the reionisation epoch. in this paper weconsider the second and third moments of the redshifted 21cm intensitydistribution using a simple model that accounts for galaxy bias during thereionisation process. we demonstrate that skewness in redshifted 21cm mapsshould be substantial throughout the reionisation epoch and on all angularscales, owing to the effects of galaxy bias which leads to early reionisationin over-dense regions of the igm. the variance (or power-spectrum) of 21cmfluctuations will exhibit a minimum in redshift part way through thereionisation process, when the global ionisation fraction is around 50%. thisminimum is generic, and is due to the transition from 21cm intensity beingdominated by over-dense too under-dense regions as reionisation progresses. weshow that the details of the reionisation history, including the presence ofradiative feedback are encoded in the evolution of the auto-correlation andskewness functions with redshift and mean igm neutral fraction. we discuss thedetection of skewness by first generation instruments, and conclude that themileura widefield array - low frequency demonstrator will have sufficientsensitivity to detect skewness on a range of angular scales at redshifts nearthe end of reionisation, while a subsequent instrument of 10 times thecollecting area could map out the evolution of skewness in detail. theobservation of a minimum in variance during the reionisation history, and thedetection of skewness would both provide important confirmation of thecosmological origin of redshifted 21cm intensity fluctuations.

0810.0014	fluctuations in the high-redshift lyman-werner background: close halo  pairs as the origin of supermassive black holes	the earliest generation of stars and black holes must have established anearly 'lyman-werner' background (lwb) at high redshift, prior to the epoch ofreionization. because of the long mean free path of photons with energiese&lt;13.6 ev, the lwb was nearly uniform. however, some variation in the lwb isexpected due to the discrete nature of the sources, and their highly clusteredspatial distribution. in this paper, we compute the probability distributionfunction (pdf) of the lw flux that irradiates dark matter (dm) halos collapsingat high-redshift (z~10). our model accounts for (i) the clustering of dm halos,(ii) poisson fluctuations in the number of corresponding star forming galaxies,and (iii) scatter in the lw luminosity produced by halos of a given mass(calibrated using local observations). we find that &gt; 99% of the dm halos areilluminated by a lw flux within a factor of 2 of the global mean value.however, a small fraction, ~1e-8 to 1e-6, of dm halos with virial temperaturesabove 1e4 k have a close luminous neighbor within &lt; 10 kpc, and are exposed toa lw flux exceeding the global mean by a factor of &gt; 20, or to j_(21,lw)&gt; 1e3(in units of 1e-21 erg/s/hz/sr/cm^2). this large lw flux can photo--dissociateh_2 molecules in the gas collapsing due to atomic cooling in these halos, andprevent its further cooling and fragmentation. such close halo pairs thereforeprovide possible sites in which primordial gas clouds collapse directly intomassive black holes (m_bh~ 1e4 - 1e6 m_sun), and subsequently grow intosupermassive (m_bh &gt; 1e9 m_sun) black holes by z~6.

0810.3455	evidence for merger-driven activity in the clustering of high redshift  quasars	recently, a very large clustering length has been measured for quasars at aredshift of z~4. in combination with the observed quasar luminosity function weassess the implications of this clustering for the relationship between quasarluminosity and dark matter halo mass. our analysis allows for non-linearity andfinite scatter in the relation between quasar luminosity and halo mass, as wellas a luminosity dependent quasar lifetime. the additional novel ingredient inour modelling is the allowance for an excess in the observed bias over theunderlying halo bias owing to the merger driven nature of quasar activity. wefind that the observations of clustering and luminosity function can beexplained only if both of the following conditions hold: (i) the luminosity tohalo mass ratio increases with halo mass; (ii) the observed clusteringamplitude is in excess of that expected solely from halo bias. the latterresult is statistically significant at the 99% level. taken together, theobservations provide compelling evidence for merger driven quasar activity,with a black-hole growth that is limited by feedback. in difference fromprevious analyses, we show that there could be scatter in the luminosity halomass relation of up to 1 dex, and that quasar clustering can not be used toestimate the quasar lifetime.
