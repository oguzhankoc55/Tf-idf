0904.0452	the chandra deep protocluster survey: ly-alpha blobs are powered by  heating, not cooling	we present the results of a 400ks chandra survey of 29 extended ly-alphaemitting nebulae (ly-alpha blobs, labs) in the z=3.09 proto-cluster in thessa22 field. we detect luminous x-ray counterparts in five labs, implying alarge fraction of active galactic nuclei (agn) in labs, f_agn = 17% down tol_2-32kev ~ 10^44 erg/s. all of the agn appear to be heavily obscured, withspectral indices implying obscuring column densities of n_h &gt; 10^23 cm^-2. theagn fraction should be considered a lower limit, since several more labs notdetected with chandra show agn signatures in their mid-infrared emission. weshow that the uv luminosities of the agn are easily capable of powering theextended ly-alpha emission via photo-ionization alone. when combined with theuv flux from a starburst component, and energy deposited by mechanicalfeedback, we demonstrate that 'heating' by a central source, rather thangravitational cooling is the most likely power source of labs. we argue thatall labs could be powered in this manner, but that the luminous host galaxiesare often just below the sensitivity limits of current instrumentation, or areheavily obscured. no individual labs show evidence for extended x-ray emission,and a stack equivalent to a &gt;9ms exposure of an average lab also yields nostatistical detection of a diffuse x-ray component. the resulting diffusex-ray/ly-alpha luminosity limit implies there is no hot (t&gt;10^7 k) gascomponent in these halos, and also rules out inverse compton scattering ofcosmic microwave background photons, or local far-infrared photons, as a viablepower source for labs.

0910.5756	molecular gas in submillimetre-faint, star-forming ultraluminous  galaxies at z&gt;1	[abridged] we present interferometric co observations of twelve z~2submillimetre-faint, star-forming radio galaxies (sfrgs) which are thought tobe ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) possibly dominated by warmer dust(t_dust ~&gt; 40 k) than submillimetre galaxies (smgs) of similar luminosities.four other co-observed sfrgs are included from the literature, and allobservations are taken at the plateau de bure interferometer (pdbi) in thecompact configuration. ten of the sixteen sfrgs observed in co (63%) aredetected at &gt;4sigma with a mean inferred molecular gas mass of ~2*10^10 m_sun.sfrgs trend slightly above the local ulirg l_fir-l'_co relation. since sfrgsare about two times fainter in radio luminosity but exhibit similar columinosities to smgs, this suggests sfrgs are slightly more efficient starformers than smgs at the same redshifts. sfrgs also have a narrow mean co linewidth, 320+-80km/s. sfrgs bridge the gap between properties of very luminous&gt;5*10^12 l_sun smgs and those of local ulirgs and are consistent withintermediate stage major mergers. we suspect that more moderate-luminositysmgs, not yet surveyed in co, would show similar molecular gas properties tosfrgs. the agn fraction of sfrgs is consistent with smgs and is estimated to be0.3+-0.1, suggesting that sfrgs are observed near the peak phase of starformation activity and not in a later, post-smg enhanced agn phase. this cosurvey of sfrgs serves as a pilot project for the much more extensive survey ofherschel and scuba-2 selected sources which only partially overlap with smgs.better constraints on co properties of a diverse high-z ulirg population areneeded from alma to determine the evolutionary origin of extreme starbursts,and what role ulirgs serve in catalyzing the formation of massive stellarsystems in the early universe.

0912.1598	high-resolution co and radio imaging of z~2 ulirgs: extended co  structures, and implications for the universal star formation law	we present high spatial resolution (0.4", ~3.5 kpc) pdbi interferometric dataon three ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) at z~2: two submillimetregalaxies and one submillimetre faint star forming radio galaxy. the threegalaxies have been ro- bustly detected in co rotational transitions, either12co(j=4-3) or 12co(j=3-2), allowing their sizes and gas masses to beaccurately constrained. these are the highest spatial resolution observationsobserved to date (by a factor of ~2) for intermediate-excitation co emission inz~2 ulirgs. the galaxies appear extended over several resolution elements,having a mean radius of 3.7 kpc. high-resolution (0.3") combined merlin-vlaobservations of their radio continua allow an analysis of the star formationbehaviour of these galaxies, on comparable spatial scales to that of the coobservations. this 'matched beam' approach sheds light on the spatialdistribution of both molecular gas and star formation, and we can thereforecalculate accurate star formation rates and gas surface densities: this allowsus to place the three systems in the context of a kennicutt-schmidt (ks)-stylestar formation law. we find a difference in size between the co and radioemission regions, and as such we suggest that using the spatial extent of theco emission region to estimate the surface density of star formation may leadto error. this size difference also causes the star formation efficiencieswithin systems to vary by up to a factor of 5. we also find, with our newaccurate sizes, that smgs lie significantly above the ks relation, indicatingthat stars are formed more efficiently in these extreme systems than in otherhigh-z star forming galaxies.

1003.0447	mid-infrared spectroscopy of candidate agn-dominated submillimeter  galaxies	spitzer spectroscopy has revealed that ~80% of submm galaxies (smgs) arestarburst (sb) dominated in the mid-infrared. here we focus on the remaining~20% that show signs of harboring powerful active galactic nuclei (agn). wehave obtained spitzer-irs spectroscopy of a sample of eight smgs which arecandidates for harboring powerful agn on the basis of irac color-selection(s8/s4.5&gt;2; i.e. likely power-law mid-infrared seds). smgs with an agndominating (&gt;50%) their mid-infrared emission could represent `missing link'sources in an evolutionary sequence involving a major merger. first of all, wedetect pah features in all of the smgs, indicating redshifts from 2.5-3.4,demonstrating the power of the mid-infrared to determine redshifts for theseoptically faint dusty galaxies. secondly, we see signs of both star-formation(from the pah features) and agn activity (from continuum emission) in oursample: 62% of the sample are agn-dominated in the mid-infrared with a medianagn content of 56%, compared with &lt;30% on average for typical smgs, revealingthat our irac color selection has successfully singled out sources withproportionately more agn emission than typical sb-dominated smgs. however, wefind that only about 10% of these agn dominate the bolometric emission of thesmg when the results are extrapolated to longer infrared wavelengths, implyingthat agn are not a significant power source to the smg population overall, evenwhen there is evidence in the mid-infrared for substantial agn activity. whenexisting samples of mid-infrared agn-dominated smgs are considered, we findthat s8/s4.5&gt;1.65 works well at selecting mid-infrared energetically dominantagn in smgs, implying a duty cycle of ~15% if all smgs go through a subsequentmid-infrared agn-dominated phase in the proposed evolutionary sequence.

1005.2410	herschel atlas: the cosmic star formation history of quasar host  galaxies	we present a derivation of the star formation rate per comoving volume ofquasar host galaxies, derived from stacking analyses of far-infrared to mm-wavephotometry of quasars with redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;6 and absolute i-band magnitudes-22&gt;i_ab&gt;-32. we use the science demonstration observations of the first ~16deg^2 from the herschel astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) inwhich there are 240 quasars from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) and afurther 171 from the 2df-sdss lrg and qso (2slaq) survey. we supplement thisdata with a compilation of data from iras, iso, spitzer, scuba and mambo.h-atlas alone statistically detects the quasars in its survey area at &gt;5sigmaat 250, 350 and 500um. from the compilation as a whole we find strikingevidence of downsizing in quasar host galaxy formation: low-luminosity quasarswith absolute magnitudes in the range -22&gt;i_ab&gt;-24 have a comoving starformation rate (derived from 100um rest-frame luminosities) peaking betweenredshifts of 1 and 2, while high-luminosity quasars with i_ab&lt;-26 have amaximum contribution to the star formation density at z~3. the volume-averagedstar formation rate of -22&gt;i_ab&gt;-24 quasars evolves as (1+z)^{2.3 +/- 0.7} atz&lt;2, but the evolution at higher luminosities is much faster reaching (1+z)^{10+/- 1} at -26&gt;i_ab&gt;-28. we tentatively interpret this as a combination of adeclining major merger rate with time and gas consumption reducing fuel forboth black hole accretion and star formation.

1005.3820	the herschel lensing survey (hls): overview	the herschel lensing survey (hls) will conduct deep pacs and spire imaging of~40 massive clusters of galaxies. the strong gravitational lensing power ofthese clusters will enable us to penetrate through the confusion noise, whichsets the ultimate limit on our ability to probe the universe with herschel.here, we present an overview of our survey and a summary of the major resultsfrom our science demonstration phase (sdp) observations of the bullet cluster(z=0.297). the sdp data are rich, allowing us to study not only the backgroundhigh-redshift galaxies (e.g., strongly lensed and distorted galaxies at z=2.8and 3.2) but also the properties of cluster-member galaxies. our preliminaryanalysis shows a great diversity of far-infrared/submillimeter spectral energydistributions (seds), indicating that we have much to learn with herschel aboutthe properties of galaxy seds. we have also detected the sunyaev-zel'dovich(sz) effect increment with the spire data. the success of this sdp programdemonstrates the great potential of the herschel lensing survey to produceexciting results in a variety of science areas.

1006.0238	the stellar mass content of submillimeter-selected galaxies	we present a new study of the stellar mass in a sample of ~ 70submillimeter-selected galaxies (smgs) with accurate spectroscopic redshifts.we fit combinations of stellar population synthesis models and power laws tothe galaxies' observed-frame optical through mid-ir spectral energydistributions to separate stellar emission from non-stellar near-ir continuum.by separating the stellar emission from the non-stellar near-ir continuum, wefind that ~ 50% of our sample have non-stellar continuum contributions of lessthan 10% in rest-frame h-band, but ~ 10% of our sample have non-stellarcontributions greater than 50%. we find that the k-band luminosity of thenon-stellar continuum emission is correlated with hard x-ray luminosity,indicating an agn origin of the emission. upon subtracting this agn-contributedcontinuum component from all of the galaxies in our sample, we determine alower median stellar mass for smgs than previous studies, ~ 7 x 10^10 m_sun. weuse constraints of the starburst time-scale from molecular gas studies toestimate the amount of fading our sample would undergo if they passively evolveafter the starburst terminates. the results suggest that typical smgs, whileamong the most massive galaxies at z ~ 2, are likely to produce descendants ofsimilar mass and luminosity to l* galaxies in the local universe.

[nev] and [neiii] emission lines areidentified in a subset of the spectra indicating the presence of an activegalactic nucleus (agn). in addition, a host of interstellar absorption linescorresponding to transitions of mgii and feii ions are also detected. thesefeatures show up prominently in composite spectra and we use these compositesto demonstrate that the absorption lines are present at an average blueshift of$-240\pm$50 kms$^{-1}$ relative to the systemic velocities of the galaxiesderived from [oii]. this indicates the presence of large-scale outflowinginterstellar gas in these systems (abridged)

1108.3107	comparison of millimeter-wave and x-ray emission in seyfert galaxies	we compare the emission at multiple wavelengths of an extended seyfert galaxysample, including both types of seyfert nuclei. we use the caltechsubmillimeter observatory to observe the co j = 2-1 transition line in a sampleof 45 seyfert galaxies and detect 35 of them. the galaxies are selected bytheir joint soft x-ray (0.1-2.4 kev) and far-infrared ({\lambda} = 60-100{\mu}m) emission from the rosat/iras sample. since the co line widths (w co)reflect the orbital motion in the gravitational potential of the host galaxy,we study how the kinematics are affected by the central massive black hole(bh), using the x-ray luminosity. a significant correlation is found betweenthe co line width and hard (0.3-8 kev from chandra and xmm-newton) x-rayluminosity for both types of seyfert nuclei. assuming an eddington accretion toestimate the bh mass (m bh) from the x-ray luminosity, the w co-l x relationestablishes a direct connection between the kinematics of the molecular gas ofthe host galaxy and the nuclear activity, and corroborates the previous studiesthat show that the co is a good surrogate for the bulge mass. we also find atight correlation between the (soft and hard) x-ray and the co luminosities forboth seyfert types. these results indicate a direct relation between themolecular gas (i.e., star formation activity) of the host galaxy and thenuclear activity. to establish a clear causal connection between molecular gasand the fueling of nuclear activity, high-resolution maps (&lt;100 pc) of the coemission of our sample will be required and provided in a forthcoming atacamalarge millimeter array observation.

1207.2174	discovery of "warm dust" galaxies in clusters at z~0.3: evidence for  stripping of cool dust in the dense environment?	using far-infrared imaging from the "herschel lensing survey", we derive dustproperties of spectroscopically-confirmed cluster member galaxies within twomassive systems at z~0.3: the merging bullet cluster and the more relaxedms2137.3-2353. most star-forming cluster sources (~90%) have characteristicdust temperatures similar to local field galaxies of comparable infrared (ir)luminosity (t_dust ~ 30k). several sub-lirg (l_ir &lt; 10^11 l_sun) bullet clustermembers are much warmer (t_dust &gt; 37k) with far-infrared spectral energydistribution (sed) shapes resembling lirg-type local templates. x-ray andmid-infrared data suggest that obscured active galactic nuclei do notcontribute significantly to the infrared flux of these "warm dust" galaxies.sources of comparable ir-luminosity and dust temperature are not observed inthe relaxed cluster ms2137, although the significance is too low to speculateon an origin involving recent cluster merging. "warm dust" galaxies are,however, statistically rarer in field samples (&gt; 3sigma), indicating that theresponsible mechanism may relate to the dense environment. the spatialdistribution of these sources is similar to the whole far-infrared brightpopulation, i.e. preferentially located in the cluster periphery, although thegalaxy hosts tend towards lower stellar masses (m_* &lt; 10^10 m_sun). we proposedust stripping and heating processes which could be responsible for theunusually warm characteristic dust temperatures. a normal star-forming galaxywould need 30-50% of its dust removed (preferentially stripped from the outerreaches, where dust is typically cooler) to recover a sed similar to a "warmdust" galaxy. these progenitors would not require a higher ir-luminosity ordust mass than the currently observed normal star-forming population.

1209.2065	characterizing the mid-ir extragalactic sky with wise and sdss	the wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise) has completed its all-skysurvey at 3.4-22 micron. we merge the wise data with optical sdss data andprovide a phenomenological characterization of mid-ir, extragalactic sources.wise is most sensitive at 3.4micron(w1) and least at 22micron(w4). the w1 bandprobes massive early-type galaxies out to z\gtrsim1. this is more distant thansdss identified early-type galaxies, consistent with the fact that 28% of3.4micron sources have faint or no r-band counterparts (r&gt;22.2). in contrast,92-95% of 12 and 22micron sources have sdss optical counterparts with r&lt;22.2.wise 3.4micron detects 89.8% of the entire sdss qso catalog at snr(w1)&gt;7, butonly 18.9% at 22micron with snr(w4)&gt;5. we show that wise colors alone areeffective in isolating stars (or local early-type galaxies), star-forminggalaxies and strong agn/qsos at z&lt;3. we highlight three major applications ofwise colors: (1) selection of strong agn/qsos at z&lt;3 using w1-w2&gt;0.8 andw2&lt;15.2 criteria, producing a census of this population. the surface density ofthese strong agn/qso candidates is 67.5+-0.14/deg^2. (2) selection ofdust-obscured, type-2 agn/qso candidates. we show that wise w1-w2&gt;0.8, w2&lt;15.2combined with r-w2&gt;6 (vega) colors can be used to identify type-2 agncandidates. the fraction of these type-2 agn candidates is 1/3rd of all wisecolor-selected agns. (3) selection of ulirgs at z\sim2 with extremely redcolors, r-w4&gt;14 or well-detected 22micron sources lacking detections in the 3.4and 4.6micron bands. the surface density of z~2 r-w4&gt;14 ulirgs is0.9+-0.07/deg^2 at snr(w4)&gt;5 (flux(w4)&gt;=2.5mjy), which is consistent with thatinferred from smaller area spitzer surveys. optical spectroscopy of a smallnumber of these high-redshift ulirgs confirms our selection, and reveals apossible trend that optically fainter or r-w4 redder candidates are at higherredshifts.

1307.6282	uv-bright nearby early type galaxies observed in the mid-infrared:  evidence for a multi-stage formation history by way of wise and galex imaging	in the local universe, 10% of massive elliptical galaxies are observed toexhibit a peculiar property: a substantial excess of ultraviolet emission (uvx)over what is expected from their old, red stellar populations. several originsfor the uvx have been proposed, including a population of hot young stars, or apopulation of old, blue horizontal branch or extended horizontal branch (bhb orehb) stars that have undergone substantial mass loss from their outeratmospheres. we explore the radial distribution of ultraviolet excess (uvx) ina selection of 49 nearby e/s0-type galaxies by measuring the extendedphotometry in the uv-midir with galex, sdss and wise. we compare uv/optical anduv/mid-ir colors with the flexible stellar population synthesis with ehb models(conroy &amp; gunn 2010). we find that combined wise mid-ir and galex uv colors aremore effective in distinguishing models than optical colors, and that theuv/mid-ir combination is sensitive to ehb fraction. there are strong colorgradients with the outer radii bluer than the inner half-light radii by ~1magnitude. this color difference is easily accounted for with a bhb fractionincrease of 0.25 with radius. we estimated the average ages for the inner andouter radii are 7.0+/-0.3 gyr, and 6.2+/-0.2 gyr, respectively, with theimplication that the outer regions are likely to have formed ~1 gyr after theinner regions. additionally, we find that metallicity gradients are likely nota significant factor in the color difference. the separation of color betweenthe inner and outer regions, which agrees with a specific stellar populationdifference (e.g., higher ehb populations), and the ~0.5-2 gyr age differencesuggests multi-stage formation. our results are best explained by inside-outformation: rapid star formation within the core at early epochs (&gt;4 gyr ago)and at least one later stage starburst event coinciding with z~1

1402.6335	a submillimeter galaxy illuminating its circumgalactic medium: ly-alpha  scattering in a cold, clumpy outflow	we report the detection at 850um of the central source in ssa22-lab1, thearchetypal lyman-alpha blob (lab), a 100kpc-scale radio-quiet emission-linenebula at z=3.1. the flux density of the source, $s_{850}=4.6\pm1.1$mjy impliesthe presence of a galaxy, or group of galaxies, with a total luminosity of$l_{\rm ir}\approx10^{12}l_\odot$. the position of an active source at thecenter of a ~50kpc-radius ring of linearly polarized ly-alpha emission detectedby hayes et al. (2011) suggests that the central source is leaking ly-alphaphotons preferentially in the plane of the sky, which undergo scattering in hiclouds at large galactocentric radius. the ly-alpha morphology around thesubmillimeter detection is reminiscent of biconical outflow, and the averagely-alpha line profiles of the two `lobes' are dominated by a red peak, expectedfor a resonant line emerging from a medium with a bulk velocity gradient thatis outflowing relative to the line center. taken together, these observationsprovide compelling evidence that the central active galaxy (or galaxies) isresponsible for a large fraction of the extended ly-alpha emission andmorphology. less clear is the history of the cold gas in the circumgalacticmedium being traced by ly-alpha: is it mainly pristine material accreting intothe halo that has not yet been processed through an interstellar medium (ism),now being blown back as it encounters an outflow, or does it mainly comprisegas that has been swept-up within the ism and expelled from the galaxy?

0803.0634	weighing the black holes in z~2 submillimeter-emitting galaxies hosting  active galactic nuclei	we place direct observational constraints on the black-hole masses of thecosmologically important z~2 submillimeter-emitting galaxy (smg; f850&gt;4mjy)population, and use measured host-galaxy masses to explore their evolutionarystatus. we employ the well-established virial black-hole mass estimator to'weigh' the black holes of a sample of z~2 smgs with broad halpha or hbetaemission. the average black-hole mass and eddington ratio (eta) of thelower-luminosity broad-line smgs (l_x~10^44 erg/s} are log(m_bh/m_sol)~8.0 andeta~0.2, respectively. these lower-luminosity broad-line smgs lie in the samelocation of the l_x-l_fir plane as more typical smgs hosting x-ray obscured agnand may be intrinsically similar systems, but orientated so that the rest-frameoptical nucleus is visible. under this hypothesis, we conclude that smgs hostblack holes with log(m_bh/m_odot)~7.8; we find supporting evidence fromobservations of local ulirgs. combining these black-hole mass constraints withmeasured host-galaxy masses, we find that the black holes in smgs are &gt;3 timessmaller than those found in comparably massive normal galaxies in the localuniverse, albeit with considerable uncertainty, and &gt;10 times smaller thanthose predicted for z~2 luminous quasars and radio galaxies. these resultsimply that the growth of the black hole lags that of the host galaxy in smgs,in stark contrast with that previously suggested for radio galaxies andluminous quasars at z~2. on the basis of current host-galaxy mass constraints,we show that smgs and their descendants cannot lie significantly above thelocally defined m_bh-m_gal relationship. we argue that the black holes in thez~0 descendents of smgs will have log(m_bh/m_odot)~8.6, indicating that theyonly need to grow by a factor of ~6 by the present day (abridged).

1407.6712	the scuba-2 cosmology legacy survey: the submillimetre properties of  lyman break galaxies at z=3-5	we present statistically significant detections at 850um of the lyman breakgalaxy (lbg) population at z=3, 4, and 5 using data from the submillimetrecommon user bolometer array 2 (scuba-2) cosmology legacy survey (s2cls) in theunited kingdom infrared deep sky survey ultra deep survey (ukidss-uds) field.we employ a stacking technique to probe beneath the survey limit to measure theaverage 850um flux density of lbgs at z=3, 4, and 5 with typical ultravioletluminosities of l(1700a)~10^29 erg/s/hz. we measure 850um flux densities of(0.25 +/- 0.03, (0.41 +/- 0.06), and (0.88 +/- 0.23) mjy respectively, and findthat they contribute at most 20 per cent to the cosmic far-infrared backgroundat 850um. fitting an appropriate range of spectral energy distributions to thez=3, 4, and 5 lbg stacked 24-850um fluxes, we derive infrared (ir) luminositiesof l(8-1000um)~3.2, 5.5, and 11.0x10^11 lsun (corresponding to star formationrates of ~50-200 msun/yr) respectively. we find that the evolution in the irluminosity density of lbgs is broadly consistent with model predictions for theexpected contribution of luminous ir galaxy (lirg) to ultraluminous ir galaxy(ulirg) type systems at these epochs. we also see a strong positive correlationbetween stellar mass and ir luminosity. our data are consistent with the mainsequence of star formation showing little or no evolution from z=3 to 5. wehave also confirmed that, for a fixed mass, the reddest lbgs (uv slope beta -&gt;0) are indeed redder due to dust extinction, with sfr(ir)/sfr(uv) increasing byapproximately an order of magnitude over -2&lt;beta&lt;0 such that sfr(ir)/sfr(uv)~20for the reddest lbgs. furthermore, the most massive lbgs also tend to havehigher obscured-to-unobscured ratio, hinting at a variation in the obscurationproperties across the mass range.

1411.5025	the scuba-2 cosmology legacy survey: alma resolves the rest-frame  far-infrared emission of sub-millimeter galaxies	we present high-resolution (0.3'') alma 870um imaging of 52 sub-millimetergalaxies (smgs) in the ultra deep survey (uds) field and investigate the sizeand morphology of the sub-millimeter (sub-mm) emission on 2-10kpc scales. wederive a median intrinsic angular size of fwhm=0.30$\pm$0.04'' for the 23 smgsin the sample detected at a signal-to-noise ratio (snr) &gt;10. using thephotometric redshifts of the smgs we show that this corresponds to a medianphysical half-light diameter of 2.4$\pm$0.2kpc. a stacking analysis of the smgsdetected at an snr &lt;10 shows they have sizes consistent with the 870um-brightsmgs in the sample. we compare our results to the sizes of smgs derived fromother multi-wavelength studies, and show that the rest-frame ~250um sizes ofsmgs are consistent with studies of resolved 12co (j=3-2 to 7-6) emissionlines, but that sizes derived from 1.4ghz imaging appear to be approximatelytwo times larger on average, which we attribute to cosmic ray diffusion. therest-frame optical sizes of smgs are around four times larger than thesub-millimeter sizes, indicating that the star formation in these galaxies iscompact relative to the pre-existing stellar distribution. the size of thestarburst region in smgs is consistent with the majority of the star formationoccurring in a central region, a few kpc in extent, with a median starformation rate surface density of 90$\pm$30msol/yr/kpc$^2$, which may suggestthat we are witnessing an intense period of bulge growth in these galaxies.

astro-ph;0010186	the temperatures of dust-enshrouded agns	a high density of massive dark objects (mdos), probably supermassive blackholes, in the centres of nearby galaxies has been inferred from recentobservations. there are various indications that much of the accretionresponsible for producing these objects took place in dust-enshrouded activegalactic nuclei (agns). if so, then measurements of the intensity of backgroundradiation and the source counts in the far-infrared and submillimetre wavebandsconstrain the temperature of dust in these agns. an additional constraint comesfrom the hard x-ray background, if this is produced by accretion. onepossibility is that the dust shrouds surrounding the accreting agns are cold,about 30 k. in this event, the dusty agns could be some subset of thepopulation of luminous distant sources discovered at 850 microns using thescuba array on the jcmt, as proposed by almaini et al. (1999). an alternativeis that the dust shrouds surrounding the accreting agns are much hotter (&gt; 60k). these values are closer to the dust temperatures of a number ofwell-studied low-redshift ultraluminous galaxies that are thought to derivetheir power from accretion. if the local mdo density is close to the maximumpermitted, then cold sources cannot produce this density without thesubmillimetre background being overproduced if they accrete at high radiativeefficiency, and thus a hot population is required. if the dust-enshroudedaccretion occurred at similar redshifts to that taking place in unobscuredoptical quasars, then a significant fraction of the far-infrared backgroundradiation measured by cobe at 140 microns, but very little of thesubmilllimetre background at 850 microns, may have been produced by hotdust-enshrouded agns which may have already been seen in recent x-ray surveys.

astro-ph;0103239	extinction of gamma-ray burst afterglows as a diagnostic of the location  of cosmic star formation	the properties of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) and their afterglows are used toinvestigate the location of star formation activity through the history of theuniverse. this approach is motivated by the following: (i) grbs are thought tobe associated with the deaths of massive stars and so the grb rate ought tofollow the massive star formation rate, (ii) grbs are the final evolutionaryphase of these short-lived stars, which do not travel far from theirbirthplace, and so should be located where the stars formed, and (iii) thedifferential effects of dust extinction on grb afterglows between the x-ray andoptical wavebands can reveal whether or not large amounts of gas and dust arepresent in grb host galaxies. from recent evidence, we estimate that asignificant fraction (about 75%) of stars in the universe formed in galaxiesthat are brightest at rest-frame far-infrared (ir) wavelengths. this value ismarginally consistent with observations: 60 +/- 15% of grbs have no detectedoptical afterglow, whereas almost all have an x-ray afterglow. if the x-rayafterglows of a large number of grbs disappear at soft x-ray wavelengths (&lt;2kev), then this would provide strong evidence for dominant heavily obscuredstar-formation activity. far-ir and submillimetre studies of grb hosts wouldalso test this idea: about 20% of hosts should be detectable using scuba.

astro-ph;0104169	the visibility of gamma-ray burst afterglows in dusty star-forming  regions	recent observations of the environments of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) favourmassive stars as their progenitors, which are likely to be surrounded by gasand dust. the visibility of the optical and uv emission of a grb are expectedto depend on the characteristics of both the dust and the grb emission itself.a reasonable distribution of surrounding dust is capable of absorbing all theoptical and uv emission of the optical flash and afterglow of a grb, unless theoptical flash has a peak isotropic luminosity l_peak &gt; 10^49 erg/s. this meansthat dark bursts should exist and these bursts will have to be studied atinfrared rather than optical wavelengths. in this paper details will be givenabout the infrared grb dust emission. the reprocessed dust emission peaks at arest-frame wavelength of about 8 micron. forthcoming space telescopes, inparticular the irac camera aboard the space infrared telescope facility coulddetect this emission out to a redshift of about 2. however, an accurateposition of the grb afterglow must be provided for this emission to beidentified, because the light curve of the reprocessed dust emission does notvary on time-scales less than several years.

astro-ph;0108400	the coincidence and angular clustering of chandra and scuba sources	we explore the relationship between the hard x-ray and sub-mm populationsusing deep chandra observations of a large, contiguous scuba survey. inagreement with other recent findings, we confirm that the direct overlap issmall. of the 17 sub-mm sources detected in this field at 850 microns, only oneis coincident with a chandra source. the resulting limits imply that themajority of scuba sources are not powered by agn, unless the central engine isobscured by compton-thick material with a low (&lt;1 per cent) scatteredcomponent. furthermore, since chandra detects only ~5 per cent of scubasources, the typical obscuration would need to be almost isotropic. the x-rayupper limits are so strong that in most cases we can also rule out a starburstsed at low redshift, suggesting that the majority of scuba sources lie at z&gt;1even if they are purely starburst galaxies. despite the low detection rate, wefind evidence for strong angular clustering between the x-ray and sub-mmpopulations. the implication is that agn and scuba sources trace the samelarge-scale structure but do not generally coincide. if bright sub-mm sourcesrepresent massive elliptical galaxies in formation, we suggest that (for agiven galaxy) the major episode of star-formation must be distinct from theperiod of observable quasar activity.

astro-ph;0201004	centimeter searches for molecular line emission from high-redshift  galaxies	we consider the capabilities for detecting low order co emission lines fromhigh-z galaxies using the next generation of radio telescopes operating at 22and 43 ghz. we employ models for the evolution of dusty star forming galaxiesbased on source counts at (sub)millimeter wavelengths, and on the observed mmthrough infrared backgrounds, to predict the expected detection rate oflow-order co(2-1) and co(1-0) line emitting galaxies for optimalcentimeter(cm)-wave surveys using future radio telescopes, such as the squarekilometer array (ska) and the expanded very large array (evla). we then comparethese results to surveys that can be done with the next-generation mm-wavetelescope, the atacama large millimeter array (alma). operating at 22 ghz theska will be competitive with the alma in terms of the detection rate of linesfrom high-z galaxies, and will be potentially superior by an order of magnitudeif extended to 43 ghz. perhaps more importantly, cm-wave telescopes aresensitive to lower excitation gas in higher redshift galaxies, and so provide acomplementary view of conditions in high redshift galaxies to mm-wave surveys.we have also included in our models emission from hcn. the number of hcn(1-0)detections will be about 5% of the co detections in the (co-optimized) 22 ghzsurveys, and about 1.5% for 43 ghz surveys. in order not to over-resolve thesources, brightness temperature limitations require that a future large area cmtelescopes have much of its collecting area on baselines shorter than 10 km.

astro-ph;0204350	gamma-ray bursts in normal and extreme star-forming galaxies	we discuss how gamma-ray burst (grb) optical afterglows and multiwavelengthobservations of their host galaxies can be used to obtain information about therelative amounts of star formation happening in optical and submillimetregalaxies. that such an analysis will be possible follows from thecurrently-favoured idea that grbs are closely linked with high-mass starformation. studying grb host galaxies offers a method of finding low-luminositysubmillimetre galaxies, which cannot be identified either in optical lymanbreak surveys, because so much of their star formation is hidden by dust, or insubmillimetre surveys, because their submillimetre fluxes are close to or belowthe confusion limit. much of the star formation in the universe could haveoccurred in such objects, so searching for them is an important exercise. fromcurrent observations, grb host galaxies appear to be neither optically-luminousclass-2 scuba galaxies like smm j02399$-$0136 or smm j14011+0252, nor galaxiescontaining dense molecular cores like local ultraluminous infrared galaxies(uligs), but rather some intermediate kind of galaxy. the host galaxy of grb980703 is a prototype of this kind of galaxy.

astro-ph;0212467	discs in early-type lensing galaxies: effects on magnification ratios  and measurements of $h_0$	observations of early-type galaxies, both in the local universe and inclusters at medium redshifts, suggest that these galaxies often contain discsor disc-like structures. using the results of kelson et al. (2000) for theincidence of disc-components among the galaxies in the redshift z=0.33 clustercl 1358+62, we investigate the effect of disc structures on the lensingproperties of early-type galaxies. statistical properties, like magnificationcross sections and the expected number of quad (four-image) lens systems, arenot affected greatly by the inclusion of discs that contain less than about 10per cent of the total stellar mass. however, the properties of individual lenssystems are affected. we estimate that 10-30 per cent of all quad lens systems,with early-type deflector galaxies, would be affected measurably by thepresence of disc components. intriguingly, the image magnification ratios arealtered significantly. the amplitude of the predicted change is sufficient toexplain the observed magnification ratios in systems like b1422+231 withoutrequiring compact substructure. furthermore, time delays between images alsochange; fitting a bulge-only model to early-type lenses that in fact contain adisc would yield a value of the hubble constant h_0 that is systematically toolow by about 25 per cent.

astro-ph;0303128	a vigorous starburst in the scuba galaxy n2 850.4	we present optical and near-ir spectroscopy of a z=2.38 hyperluminous irgalaxy, covering the restframe wavelength range from 1000-5000a. it appears tocomprise two components separated by less than 1" on the sky (&lt;8kpc); onecomponent (b) is blue, the other (p) is red in restframe uv-optical colours.the combined system has an optical luminosity of ~8l* and its restframe opticalspectrum is characteristic of a seyfert agn. however, its restframe uv spectrumexhibits striking features associated with young stars, including p-cygni linesfrom stellar winds and blue-shifted interstellar absorption lines indicative ofa galactic outflow. redshifts are derived from stellar photospheric lines inthe uv and from narrow emission lines in the restframe optical, and these arecompared to that measured for the molecular gas recently detected with the iraminterferometer. the offsets indicate that the far-ir emission is most likelyassociated with the near-ir source p, which hosts the seyfert nucleus, whilethe uv-bright component b is blueshifted by 400km/s. this suggests that the twocomponents are probably merging and the resulting gravitational interactionshave triggered the hyperluminous activity. modelling of the uv spectralfeatures implies that the starburst within the uv component of this system hasbeen going on for at least ~10myrs. assuming that the bolometrically-dominantobscured component has a similar lifetime, we estimate that it has so farformed a total stellar mass of ~10^11 mo. if this star formation continues atits present level for substantially longer, or if this activity is repeated,then the present-day descendant of n2 850.4 will be a very luminous galaxy.

astro-ph;0304235	a median redshift of 2.4 for galaxies bright at submillimetre  wavelengths	a significant fraction of the energy emitted in the early universe came fromvery luminous galaxies that are largely hidden at optical wavelengths (becauseof interstellar dust grains); this energy now forms part of the cosmicbackground radiation at wavelengths near 1mm. these submillimetre (submm)galaxies were resolved from the background in 1997 but have been difficult toidentify and study due to the poor spatial resolution of submm instruments.this has impeded the determination of their distances (or redshifts, z), acrucial element in understanding their nature and evolution. here we reportspectroscopic redshifts for ten representative submm galaxies that weidentified reliably using high resolution radio observations. the medianredshift for our sample is 2.4, with a quartile range of z = 1.9-2.8. the submmpopulation therefore coexists with the peak activity of quasars, which arethought to be massive black holes in the process of accreting matter,suggesting a close relationship between the growth of massive black holes andluminous dusty galaxies. the space density of submm galaxies at z&gt;2 is about1000 times greater than that of similarly luminous galaxies in the present-dayuniverse, so they represent an important component of star formation at highredshifts.

astro-ph;0309419	the bright optical afterglow of the nearby gamma-ray burst of 29 march  2003	many past studies of cosmological gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been limitedbecause of the large distance to typical grbs, resulting in faint afterglows.there has long been a recognition that a nearby grb would shed light on theorigin of these mysterious cosmic explosions, as well as the physics of theirfireballs. however, grbs nearer than z=0.2 are extremely rare, with anestimated rate of localisation of one every decade. here, we report thediscovery of bright optical afterglow emission from grb 030329. our promptdissemination and the brilliance of the afterglow resulted in extensivefollowup (more than 65 telescopes) from radio through x-ray bands, as well asmeasurement of the redshift, z=0.169. the gamma-ray and afterglow properties ofgrb 030329 are similar to those of cosmological grbs (after accounting for thesmall distance), making this the nearest known cosmological grb. observationshave already securely identified the progenitor as a massive star that explodedas a supernova, and we anticipate futher revelations of the grb phenomenon fromstudies of this source.

astro-ph;0406233	the submm properties of grb host galaxies	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) accompany the deaths of some massivestars and hence, since massive stars are short lived, are a tracer of starformation activity. given that grbs are bright enough to be seen to very highredshifts, and detected even in dusty environments, they should thereforeprovide a powerful probe of the global star formation history of the universe.the potential of this approach can be investigated via submm photometry of grbhost galaxies. submm luminosity also correlates with star formation rate, sothe distribution of host galaxy submm fluxes should allow us to test the twomethods for consistency. here, we report new jcmt/scuba 850 micron measurementsfor 15 grb hosts. combining these data with results from previous studies weconstruct a sample of 21 hosts with &lt;1.4 mjy errors. we show that thedistribution of apparent 850 micron flux densities of this sample is reasonablyconsistent with model predictions, but there is tentative evidence of a dearthof submm bright (&gt;4 mjy) galaxies. furthermore, the optical/infrared propertiesof the submm brightest grb hosts are not typical of the galaxy populationselected in submm surveys, although the sample size is still small. possibleselection effects and physical mechanisms which may explain these discrepanciesare discussed.

astro-ph;0503453	rapid growth of black holes in massive star-forming galaxies	the tight relationship between the masses of black holes and galaxy spheroidsin nearby galaxies implies a causal connection between the growth of these twocomponents. optically luminous quasars host the most prodigious accreting blackholes in the universe and can account for &gt;30% of the total cosmologicalblack-hole growth. as typical quasars are not, however, undergoing intense starformation and already host massive black holes [&gt;10^(8) m(sun)], there musthave been an earlier pre-quasar phase when these black holes grew [mass range  ~10^(6)-10^(8) m(sun)]. the likely signature of this earlier stage issimultaneous black-hole growth and star formation in distant (i.e., z&gt;1; &gt;8billion light years away) luminous galaxies. here we report ultra-deep x-rayobservations of distant star-forming galaxies that are bright at submillimetrewavelengths. we find that the black holes in these galaxies are growing almostcontinuously throughout periods of intense star formation. this activityappears to be more tightly associated with these galaxies than any other coevalgalaxy populations. we show that the black-hole growth from these galaxies isconsistent with that expected for the pre-quasar phase.

astro-ph;0506608	the x-ray spectral properties of scuba galaxies	deep scuba surveys have uncovered a large population of massive submmgalaxies (smgs) at z&gt;~1. although it is generally believed that these galaxieshost intense star-formation activity, there is growing evidence that asubstantial fraction also harbor an agn. we present here possibly the strongestevidence for this viewpoint to date: the combination of ultra-deep x-rayobservations (the 2 ms cdf-n) and deep keck spectroscopic data. we find thatthe majority (~75%) of the spectroscopically identified smgs host agn activity;the other ~25% have x-ray properties consistent with star formation (x-rayderived sfrs of ~1300-2700 solars/yr). the agns have properties generallyconsistent with those of nearby luminous agns (l_x~1e43-3e44) and the majority(~80%) are heavily obscured. we construct composite rest-frame 2-20 kev spectrafor three different obscuration classes. an ~1 kev equivalent width fek-alphaemission line is seen in the composite x-ray spectrum of the most heavilyobscured agns (n_h&gt;5x10^{23}), suggesting compton-thick or near compton-thickabsorption. even taking into account the effects of absorption, we find thatthe average x-ray-fir ratio of the agn-classified smgs is approximately oneorder of magnitude below that found for typical quasars. this result suggeststhat intense star-formation activity dominates the bolometric output; however,we also explore whether the x-ray-fir ratio is intrinsically less than thatfound for typical quasars and postulate that some smgs may be agn dominated. weinvestigate the growth of massive black holes, discuss prospects for deeperobservations, and explore the potential of the next generation of x-rayobservatories.

astro-ph;0507610	the relationship between stellar and black-hole mass in submillimeter  galaxies	we analyze deep x-ray, optical and mid-infrared spitzer observations of thecdf-n/goods-n region to study 13 submillimeter-detected galaxies (smgs) withspectroscopic redshifts (median z=2.2). we find a correlation between theestimated stellar and x-ray luminosity, implying that masses of the black holesmay be related to the stellar masses of their host galaxies. although thesubmillimeter emission implies that these galaxies are undergoing an epoch ofintense star-formation, the spitzer data reveal a massive stellar populationalready in place. these stellar masses are then compared to previouslypublished black hole mass estimates derived from the x-ray luminosities underthe assumption of eddington-limit accretion. we find that the black hole massesfor our high-redshift sample are approximately 1-2 orders of magnitude smallerthan galaxies of comparable stellar mass in the local universe. although ourestimates of black hole masses will increase if the accretion is sub-eddington,and our stellar masses will decrease if we assume a much younger stellarpopulation or a different initial mass function, we find that only through acombination of effects is it possible to shift the high redshift galaxies suchthat they lie on the local relation. this suggests that the black holes need togrow substantially between z=2.2 and the present-day, with much of the blackhole growth occurring after the current obscured, far-infrared luminous phaseof activity which is likely associated with the formation of the spheroid. thisinterpretation supports a scenario where smgs pass through a subsequentaccretion-dominated phase, where they would appear as optically bright quasars.(abridged)

astro-ph;0509898	a robust sample of submillimetre galaxies: constraints on the prevalence  of dusty, high-redshift starbursts	the modest significance of most sources detected in current submm surveys canpotentially compromise some analyses due to the inclusion of spurious sourcesin catalogues typically selected at &gt;3.0-3.5sigma. here, we develop and apply adual-survey extraction technique to scuba and mambo images of the lockman hole.cut above 5sigma, our catalogue of smgs is more robust than previous samples,with a reduced likelihood of real, but faint smgs (beneath and around theconfusion limit) entering via superposition with noise. the effective fluxlimit of the survey is well matched to our deep 1.4-ghz image. the former issensitive to luminous, dusty galaxies at extreme redshifts whilst the latterprobes the z&lt;3 regime. a high fraction of our robust smgs (~80%) have radiocounterparts which, given the ~10% contamination by spurious sources, suggeststhat very distant smgs (z&gt;&gt;3) are unlikely to make up more than ~10% of thebright smg population. this implies that almost all of the bright smgpopulation is amenable to study via the deepest current radio imaging. we usethese radio counterparts to provide an empirical calibration of the positionaluncertainty in smg catalogues. we then go on to outline the acquisition ofredshifts for radio-identified smgs, from sample selection in the submm, tocounterpart selection in the radio and optical/ir, to slit placement onspectrograph masks. we determine a median of z=2.05 +/- 0.41 from a sample ofsix secure redshifts for unambigious radio-identified submm sources and z=2.14+/- 0.27 when we include submm sources with multiple radio counterparts and/orless reliable redshifts. these figures are consistent with previous estimates,suggesting that our knowledge of the median redshift of bright smgs populationhas not been biased by the low significance of the source catalogues employed.

astro-ph;0607089	observing cold gas in submillimeter galaxies: detection of co(1-0)  emission in smm j13120+4242 with the green bank telescope	we report the first detection of co(1-0) emission from asubmillimeter-selected galaxy, using the green bank telescope. we identify theline in the spectrum of smm j13120+4242 as a broad emission feature at z=3.408,with delta(v_fwhm)=1040 +/- 190 km/s. if the observed co(1-0) line profilearises from a single object and not several merging objects, then theco(4-3)/co(1-0) brightness temperature ratio of ~0.26 suggests n(h_2) &gt; 3-10 x10^2 cm^-3 and the presence of sub-thermally excited gas. the integrated lineflux implies a cold molecular gas mass m(h_2)=1.6 x 10^11 m_sun, comparable tothe dynamical mass estimate and 4 times larger than the h_2 mass predicted fromthe co(4-3) line assuming a brightness temperature ratio of 1.0. while ourobservations confirm that this submillimeter galaxy is massive and gas-rich,they also suggest that extrapolating gas masses from j_upper &gt;= 3 transitionsof co leads to considerable uncertainties. we also report an upper limit to themass of cold molecular gas in a second submillimeter galaxy, smm j09431+4700,of m(h_2)&lt; 4 x 10^10 m_sun.

astro-ph;0702544	the scuba half degree extragalactic survey (shades) - iii.  identification of radio and mid-infrared counterparts to submillimetre  galaxies	determining an accurate position for a submm galaxy (smg) is the crucial stepthat enables us to move from the basic properties of an smg sample - sourcecounts and 2-d clustering - to an assessment of their detailed,multi-wavelength properties, their contribution to the history of cosmic starformation and their links with present-day galaxy populations. in this paper,we identify robust radio and/or ir counterparts, and hence accurate positions,for over two thirds of the scuba half-degree extragalactic survey (shades)source catalogue, presenting optical, 24-um and radio images of each smg.observed trends in identification rate have given no strong rationale forpruning the sample. uncertainties in submm position are found to be consistentwith theoretical expectations, with no evidence for significant additionalsources of error. employing the submm/radio redshift indicator, via aparameterisation appropriate for radio-identified smgs with spectroscopicredshifts, yields a median redshift of 2.8 for the radio-identified subset ofshades, somewhat higher than the median spectroscopic redshift. we present adiagnostic colour-colour plot, exploiting spitzer photometry, in which weidentify regions commensurate with smgs at very high redshift. finally, we findthat significantly more smgs have multiple robust counterparts than would beexpected by chance, indicative of physical associations. these multiple systemsare most common amongst the brightest smgs and are typically separated by 2-6",or 15-50/(sin i) kpc at z ~ 2, consistent with early bursts seen in mergersimulations.

astro-ph;9708135	a deep sub-millimeter survey of lensing clusters: a new window on galaxy  formation and evolution	we present the first results of a sub-millimeter survey of distant clustersusing the new sub-mm common-user bolometer array (scuba) on the james clerkmaxwell telescope. we have mapped fields in two massive, concentrated clusters,a370 at z=0.37 and cl2244-02 at z=0.33, at wavelengths of 450 and 850-um. theresulting continuum maps cover a total area of about 10 sq. arcmin to 1 sigmanoise levels less than 14 and 2 mjy per beam at the two wavelengths, 2-3 ordersof magnitude deeper than was previously possible. we have concentrated onlensing clusters to exploit the amplification of all background sources by thecluster, improving the sensitivity by a factor of 1.3--2 as compared with ablank-field survey. a cumulative source surface density of (2.4+/-1.0) x 10^3per sq. degree is found to a 50% completeness limit of ~4 mjy at 850-um. thesub-mm spectral properties of these sources indicate that the majority lie athigh redshift, z&gt;1. without correcting for lens amplification, our observationslimit the blank-field counts at this depth. the surface density is 3 orders ofmagnitude greater than the expectation of a non-evolving ber density ofstrongly star-forming galaxies in the high-redshift universe and suggest thatoptical surveys may have substantial underestimated the star formation densityin the distant universe. deeper sub-mm surveys with scuba should detect largenumbers of star-forming galaxies at high redshift, and so provide strongconstraints on the formation of normal galaxies.

astro-ph;9712161	a hyperluminous galaxy at z = 2.8 found in a deep submillimetre survey	we present a detailed study of smm 02399-0136, a hyperluminous, active galaxyselected from a sub-mm survey of the distant universe. this galaxy is thebrightest source in the fields of seven rich, lensing clusters - total area0.01 deg^2 - that we have mapped with a sensitivity of ~2 mjy/bm at 850um. weidentify a compact optical counterpart with b ~ 23 and a lsb companion 3" away.our spectroscopy shows that components have the same redshift; z = 2.803 +/-0.003. the emission lines widths, fwhm ~ 1000-1500 km/s, and line ratios, alongwith the compact morphology and high luminosity (m_b ~ -24.0) of the galaxyindicate that smm 02399-0136 contains a rare dust-embedded, narrow-line ortype-2 agn. the source is lensed by the foreground cluster, amplifying itsapparent luminosity by a factor of 2.5. taking this into account, we estimatethat smm 02399-0136 is five times more luminous than f10214+4724. its far-irand h-alpha luminosities and lsb radio emission are indicative of an extremelyhigh sfr - several thousand mo/yr. this assumes that a starburst is thedominant source of energy, but we cannot yet determine the relativecontributions of the starburst and the buried agn. a dust mass of 5-7 x 10^8 mois indicated by our data for t(dust) ~ 40-50k, independent of whether thedominant energy source is an agn or a starburst. we estimate the possible spacedensity of such luminous sub-mm sources and find that while a very largepopulation of these obscured sources could be detected in future wide-fieldsub-mm surveys, they are unlikely to dominate the faint counts in thiswaveband. galaxies such as smm 02399-0136 and f10214+4724 cannot be easilydetected in conventional agn/qso surveys, and so estimates of the prevalence ofagn in the early universe may require significant revision.

astro-ph;9806061	the faint sub-mm galaxy population: hst morphologies and colors	we present optical morphologies obtained from deep hst and ground-basedimages for galaxies selected from the first sub-millimeter survey of thedistant universe. our sample comprises galaxies detected in deep 850-microncontinuum maps of seven massive clusters, obtained using scuba, the newbolometer camera on the jcmt. the survey covers a total area of 0.01 squaredegrees to 1-sigma noise levels of about 2 mjy/beam. we detect a total of 25sources at 850 microns, of which 17 and 10 are brighter than the respective 50%and 80% completeness limits. optical counterparts are identified for 14 of the16 sources in the f(50%) sample and for 9 of the 10 sources in the f(80%)sample that lie within our optical fields. the morphologies of those galaxiesfor which we have hst imaging fall into three broad categories: faint disturbedgalaxies and interactions; faint galaxies too compact to classify reliably; anddusty, star-forming galaxies at intermediate redshifts. the disturbed andinteracting galaxies constitute the largest class, which suggests thatinteractions remain an important mechanism for triggering star formation andthe formation of ultraluminous galaxies in the distant universe. the faint,compact galaxies may represent a later evolutionary stage in these mergers, ormore centrally-concentrated starbursts. it is likely that some of these willhost agn. analysis of the colors of our sample allow us to estimate a cruderedshift distribution: &gt;75% have z&lt;5.5 whilst &gt;50% lie at z&lt;4.5, suggestingthat the luminous sub-mm population is coeval with the more modestlystar-forming galaxies selected by uv/optical surveys of the distant universe.this imposes important constraints on models of galaxy formation and evolution.

astro-ph;9806062	the history of star formation in dusty galaxies	a population of distant dusty galaxies emitting in the submillimetre wavebandhas recently been detected using the submillimetre common-user bolometer array(scuba) camera on the james clerk maxwell telescope (jcmt). this population canbe used to trace the amount of high-redshift star-formation activity that isobscured from view in the optical waveband by dust, and so is missing fromexisting inventories of star formation in the distant universe. by includingthis population we can construct a complete and consistent picture of thehistory of star formation. the evolution of obscured star formation atredshifts less than unity is constrained by mid- and far-infrared counts ofdusty galaxies. activity increases with redshift z as (1+z) to a power of about4, consistent with the form of evolution found in the optical waveband by thecanada-france redshift survey (cfrs) to redshifts less than about 1. the formof evolution at higher redshifts is constrained by both our faint scuba countsand the intensity of background radiation in the millimetre/submillimetrewaveband. we find that the total amount of energy emitted by dusty galaxies isabout five times greater than that inferred from restframe ultravioletobservations, and that a larger fraction of this energy is emitted at highredshifts. the simplest explanation for these results is that a largepopulation of luminous strongly-obscured sources at redshifts less than about 5is missing from optical surveys. we discuss the possible contribution ofobscured active galactic nuclei to the submillimetre-wave background andcounts. more accurate constraints on the history of star formation will beprovided by determinations of the counts in several submillimetre wavebands andcrucially, by a reliable redshift distribution of the detected galaxies.

astro-ph;9806067	strong gravitational lensing by spiral galaxies	we investigate gravitational lensing by a realistic model of disk galaxies.most of the mass is contained in a large spherical isothermal dark matter halo,but the potential is modified significantly in the core by agravitationally-dominant exponential disk. the method used is adapted from avery general multi-lens ray-tracing technique developed by moeller. weinvestigate the effects of the disk-to-halo mass ratio, the disk scale length,the disk inclination to the line of sight and the lens redshift on twostrong-lensing cross sections: the cross section for multiple imaging, and thecross section for large magnifications, in excess of a factor of 10. we findthat the multiple-imaging cross section can be enhanced significantly by analmost edge-on milky way disk as compared with a singular isothermal sphere(sis) in individual cases; however, when averaged over all disk inclinations,the cross section is only increased by about fifty per cent. these results areconsistent with other recent work. the presence of a disk, however, increasesthe inclination-averaged high-magnification cross section by an order ofmagnitude as compared with a sis. this result has important implications formagnification bias in future lens surveys, particularly those in thesubmillimetre waveband, where dust extinction in the lensing galaxy has noeffect on the brightness of the images.

astro-ph;9812081	ultraluminous infrared galaxies at high redshift: their position on the  madau plot and their fate	a major recent development in extragalactic astronomy has been the discoveryof a population of galaxies that are luminous at submillimetre wavelengths.estimates of their spectral energy distributions suggest that these galaxiesare the high-redshift analogues of the ultraluminous infrared galaxies (uligs)observed locally. we identify plausible (but non-unique) redshift-dependentgalaxy luminosity functions that are consistent with both source counts at2800, 850, 450 and and 175 microns, and far-infrared background radiationintensities at 850, 240 and 140 microns. in all our models, most of thesubmillimetre-luminous sources are distant galaxies with high bolometricluminosities &gt;= 10^12 l_sun. as for many local uligs it is not possible todetermine whether these luminous galaxies are powered by starbursts, like thelocal galaxy arp 220, or by active galactic nuclei (agn), like the local galaxymarkarian 231. if the submillimetre-luminous galaxies are all starbursts, thenwe predict that the fraction of the cosmic star-formation rate in these objectsis large, but but does not necessarily dominate the star-formation rate of theuniverse at any redshift. only a few per cent by mass of the present-epochspheroidal stellar population would have been formed in such a population ofstar-forming galaxies, consistent with constraints on the number of galaxieswith old stellar populations in the field at low and intermediate redshiftderived from k-band surves. if the submillimetre-luminous galaxies are allpowered by agn, then the comoving density of supermassive black holes ontowhich material is accreting at high redshift probably equals no more than a fewper cent of the local density of massive dark objects.

astro-ph;9905246	the discovery of ero counterparts to faint submm galaxies	we use deep ground-based imaging in the near-ir to search for counterparts tothe luminous submm sources in the catalog of smail et al (1998). for themajority of the submm sources the near-ir imaging supports the counterpartsoriginally selected from deep optical images. however, in two cases (10% of thesample) we find a relatively bright near-ir source close to the submm position,sources that were unidentified in the deep hst and ground-based r-band imagesused in smail et al (1998). we place limits on colours of these sources fromdeep high-resolution keck ii imaging and find they have 2-sigma limits of(i-k)&gt;6.8 and (i-k)&gt;6.0 respectively. both sources thus class as eros. usingthe spectral properties of the submm source in the radio and submm we arguethat these eros are probably the source of the submm emission, rather than thebright spiral galaxies previously identified by smail et al. (1998). from thesurface density of these submm-bright eros we suggest that this class accountsfor the majority of the reddest members of the ero population, in goodagreement with the preliminary conclusions of pointed submm observations ofindividual eros. we conclude that the most extreme eros represent a populationof dusty, ultraluminous galaxies at high redshifts; further study of these willprovide insights into the nature of star formation in obscured galaxies in theearly universe. the identification of similar counterparts in blank field submmsurveys will be extremely difficult owing to their faintness (k~20.5, i&gt;26.5).finally, we discuss the radio and submm properties of the two submm-bright erosdiscovered here and suggest that both galaxies lie at z&gt;2.

astro-ph;9912231	starburst galaxies and structure in the submillimetre background towards  the hubble deep field	we use an 850-micron scuba map of the hdf to study the dust properties ofoptically-selected starburst galaxies at high redshift. although the 850-micronmap does not allow detection of the majority of individual sources, we showthat the galaxies with the highest uv star-formation rates are detectedstatistically, with a flux density of about s_{850}=0.2 mjy for an apparent uvstar-formation rate of 1 h^{-2} msun yr^{-1}. this level of submillimetreoutput indicates that the total star-forming activity is on average a factor ofapproximately 6 times larger than the rate inferred from the uv output of thesegalaxies. the general population of optical starbursts is then predicted tocontribute at least 25 per cent of the 850-micron background. we carry out apower-spectrum analysis of the map, which yields some evidence for angularclustering of the background source population, but at a level lower than thatseen in lyman-break galaxies. together with other lines of argument,particularly from the nicmos hdf data, this suggests that the 850-micronbackground originates over an extremely wide range of redshifts -- perhaps 1 &lt;z &lt; 6.
