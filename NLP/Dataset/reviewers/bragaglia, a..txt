0903.1948	membership and lithium in the old, metal-poor open cluster berkeley 32	measurements of lithium (li) abundances in open clusters provide a uniquetool for following the evolution of this element with age, metallicity, andstellar mass. using flames/giraffe on the vlt, we obtained spectra of 157candidate members of the old, metal-poor cluster berkeley 32, to determinemembership and to study the li behavior of confirmed members. radial velocitieswere measured, allowing us to derive both the cluster velocity and membershipinformation for the sample stars. the li abundances were obtained from theequivalent width of the li i 670.8 nm feature, using curves of growth.weobtained an average radial velocity of 105.2 +/- 0.86 km/s; 53 % of the starsare confirmed as members.the li - effective temperature distribution ofunevolved members matches the upper envelope of m 67, as well as that of theslightly older and more metal-rich ngc 188.no major dispersion in li isdetected. when considering the li distribution as a function of mass, however,be 32 members with solar-like temperature are less massive and less li-depletedthan their counterparts in the other clusters. the mean li of stars in thetemperature interval 5750 &lt; teff &lt; 6050 k is log n(li)=2.47 +/- 0.16, less thana factor of two below the average li of the 600 myr old hyades, and slightlyabove the average of intermediate age (1-2 gyr) clusters, the upper envelope ofm67, and ngc 188. this value is comparable to or slightly higher than theplateau of pop. ii stars. the similarity of the average li abundance ofclusters of different age and metallicity, along with its closeness to the halodwarf plateau, is very intriguing and suggests that, whatever the initial liabundance and the li depletion histories, old stars converge to almost the samefinal li abundance.

0909.2938	na-o anticorrelation and hb. vii. the chemical composition of first and  second-generation stars in 15 globular clusters from giraffe spectra	we present abundances of fe, na, and o for 1409 red giant stars in 15galactic globular clusters, derived from the homogeneous analysis of highresolution flames/giraffe spectra. combining the present data with previousresults, we obtained a total sample of 1958 stars in 19 clusters, the largestand most homogeneous database of this kind to date. our gcs have [fe/h] from-2.4 to -0.4, with a wide variety of global parameters (morphology of thehorizontal branch, mass, concentration, etc). for all clusters we find the na-oanticorrelation, the classical signature of proton-capture reactions inh-burning at high temperature in a previous generation of more massive stars,now extinct. using quantitative criteria (from the morphology and extension ofthe na-o anticorrelation), we can define 3 components of the stellar populationin gcs: a primordial component (p) of first-generation stars, and 2 componentsof second-generation stars (intermediate i and extreme e populations from theirdifferent chemical composition). the p component is present in all gcs, and itsfraction is almost constant at about one third. the i component represents thebulk of the cluster population. the e component is not present in all gcs, andit is more conspicuous in some (but not in all) of the most massive ones. wediscuss the fractions and spatial distributions of these components in oursample and in two additional clusters (m3 and m13) from the literature. we alsofind that the slope of the anti-correlation (defined by the minimum o andmaximum na abundances) changes from cluster-to-cluster, a change that isrepresented well by a bilinear relation on cluster metallicity and luminosity.this second dependence suggests a correlation between average mass of pollutersand cluster mass.

1002.1963	m 54 + sagittarius = omega centauri	we derive homogeneous abundances of fe, o, na and alpha-elements from highresolution flames spectra for 76 red giant stars in ngc 6715 (m 54) and for 25red giants in the surrounding nucleus of the sagittarius (sgr) dwarf galaxy.our main findings are that: (i) we confirm that m 54 shows intrinsicmetallicity dispersion, ~0.19 dex r.m.s.; (ii) when the stars of the sgrnucleus are included, the metallicity distribution strongly resembles that inomega cen; the relative contribution of the most metal-rich stars is howeverdifferent in these two objects; (iii) in both gcs there is a very extended na-oanticorrelation, signature of different stellar generations born within thecluster, and (iv) the metal-poor and metal-rich components in m 54 (and omegacen) show clearly distinct extension of the na-o anticorrelation, the mostheavily polluted stars being those of the metal-rich component. we propose atentative scenario for cluster formation that could explain these features.finally, similarities and differences found in the two most massive gcs in ourgalaxy can be easily explained if they are similar objects (nuclear clusters indwarf galaxies) observed at different stages of their dynamical evolution.

1006.5866	detailed abundances of a large sample of giant stars in m 54 and in the  sagittarius nucleus	homogeneous abundances of light elements, alpha and fe-group elements fromhigh-resolution flames spectra are presented for 76 red giant stars in m54, amassive globular cluster (gc) lying in the nucleus of the sagittarius dwarfgalaxy. we also derived detailed abundances for 27 red giants belonging to thesgr nucleus. our abundances assess the intrinsic metallicity dispersion (~0.19dex, rms scatter) of m54, with the bulk of stars peaking at [fe/h]~-1.6 and along tail extending to higher metallicities, similar to omega cen. the spreadin these probable nuclear star clusters exceeds those of most gcs: thesemassive clusters are located in a region intermediate between normal gcs anddwarf galaxies. m54 shows the na-o anticorrelation, typical signature of gcs,which is instead absent in the sgr nucleus. the light elements (mg, al, si)participating to the high temperature mg-al cycle show that the pattern of(anti)correlations produced by proton-capture reactions in h-burning is clearlydifferent between the most metal-rich and most metal-poor components in the twomost massive gcs in the galaxy, confirming early result based on the na-oanticorrelation. as in omega cen, stars affected by most extreme processing,i.e. showing the signature of more massive polluters, are those of themetal-rich component. this can be understood if the burst of star formationgiving birth to the metal-rich component was delayed by as much as 10-30 myrwith respect to the metal-poor one. the evolution of these massive gcs can bereconciled in the general scenario for the formation of gcs sketched incarretta et al.(2010a) taking into account that omega cen could have alreadyincorporated the surrounding nucleus of its progenitor and lost the rest of thehosting galaxy while the two are still observable as distinct components in m54and the surrounding field.

1007.5299	x-shooter observations of main sequence stars in the globular cluster  ngc 2808: first chemical tagging of a he-normal and a he-rich dwarf	we present the first chemical composition study of two unevolved stars in theglobular cluster ngc 2808, obtained with the spectrograph x-shooter@vlt. ngc2808 shows three discrete, well separated main sequences. the most acceptedexplanation for this phenomenon is that their stars have different heliumcontents. we observed one star on the bluest main sequence, (bms, claimed tohave high helium content, y~0.4), and one on the reddest main sequence (rms,consistent with a canonical helium content, y=0.245). we analyzed features ofnh, ch, na, mg, al, and fe. while fe, ca, and other elements have the sameabundances in the two stars, the bms star shows a huge enhancement of n, adepletion of c, an enhancement of na and al, and small depletion of mg withrespect to the rms star. this is exactly what is expected if stars on the bmsformed from the ejecta produced by an earlier stellar generation in thecomplete cno and mgal cycles whose main product is helium. the elementalabundance pattern differences in these two stars are consistent with thedifferences in helium content suggested by the color-magnitude diagrampositions of the stars.

1007.5301	abundances for a large sample of red giants in ngc 1851: hints for a  merger of two clusters?	we present the abundance analysis of a sample of more than 120 red giants inthe globular cluster (gc) ngc 1851, based on flames spectra. we find a smallbut detectable metallicity spread. this spread is compatible with the presenceof two different groups of stars with a metallicity difference of 0.06-0.08dex, in agreement with earlier photometric studies. if stars are divided intothese two groups according to their metallicity, both components show a na-oanticorrelation (signature of a genuine gc nature) of moderate extension. themetal-poor stars are more concentrated than the metal-rich ones. we tentativelypropose the hypothesis that ngc 1851 formed from a merger of two individual gcswith a slightly different fe and alpha-element content, and possibly an agedifference up to 1 gyr. this is supported also by number ratios of stars on thesplit subgiant and on the bimodal horizontal branches. the distribution ofn-capture process elements in the two components also supports the idea thatthe enrichment must have occurred in each of the structures separately, and notas a continuum of events in a single gc. the most probable explanation is thatthe proto-clusters formed into a (now dissolved) dwarf galaxy and later mergedto produce the present gc.

1010.5913	the connection between missing agb stars and extended horizontal  branches	recent surveys confirm early results about a deficiency or even absence ofcn-strong stars on the asymptotic giant branch (agb) of globular clusters(gcs), although with quite large cluster-to-cluster variations. in general,this is at odds with the distribution of cn band strengths among first ascentred giant branch (rgb) stars. norris et al. proposed that the lack of cn-strongstars in some clusters is a consequence of a smaller mass of these stars thatcannot evolve through the full agb phase. in this short paper we found that therelative frequency of agb stars can change by a factor of two between differentclusters. we also find a very good correlation between the minimum mass ofstars along the horizontal branch (gratton et al. 2010) and the relativefrequency of agb stars, with a further dependence on metallicity. we concludethat indeed the stars with the smallest mass on the hb cannot evolve throughthe full agb phase, being agb-manque'. these stars likely had large he and ncontent, and large o-depletion. we then argue that there should not be agbstars with extreme o depletion, and few of them with a moderate one.

1106.3174	multiple stellar populations in the globular cluster ngc 1851	[abridged] detailed chemical tagging of individual stellar populations in thegalactic globular cluster (gc) ngc 1851 is presented. abundances are derivedfrom flames spectra for the largest sample of giants (124) ever analysed inthis peculiar gc using o, na, mg, al, si, ca, ti, sc, v, mn, co, ni, cu, y, zr,ba, la, ce, nd, eu, dy. we confirm a [fe/h] spread in this gc, but too small toclearly separate different sub-populations. we instead propose a classificationusing a combination of fe and ba (much more abundant in the more metal-richgroup) through a cluster analysis: we separated stars into a metal-rich (mr)and a metal-poor (mp) populations, each of them showing a na-o anticorrelation,signature of genuine gc, although with different ratios of primordial topolluted stars. the ratio [alpha/h] tracks iron and is higher in the mrpopulation, suggesting an additional contribution by core-collapse supernovae.the mr population shows a larger enrichment in s-process elements compared tothe mp one. this is probably due to the contribution by intermediate-low massstars, because we find that the level of heavy s-process elements is largerthan the level of light s-process nuclei in the mr stars; however, a largecontribution by low mass stars is unlikely, because it would likely cancel theo-na anticorrelation. we also confirm the presence of correlations betweenp-capture and s-process elements previously found by other studies, at leastfor the mr population. this finding apparently requires a quite long delay forthe second generation of the mr component. a merger of two distinct gcs in aparent dwarf galaxy, each one with a different ba level and an age differenceof ~1 gyr, might explain (i) the double sgb, (ii) a possible difference in ccontent between the two original gcs, and (iii) the stromgren photometry ofthis peculiar gc.

1109.0900	multiple stellar populations in 47 tucanae	we use hubble space telescope (hst) and ground-based imaging to study themultiple populations of 47 tuc, combining high-precision photometry withcalculations of synthetic spectra. using filters covering a wide range ofwavelengths, our hst photometry splits the main sequence (ms) into twobranches, and we find that this duality is repeated in the subgiant andred-giant regions (sgb, rgb), and on the horizontal branch (hb). we calculatetheoretical stellar atmospheres for ms stars, assuming different chemicalcomposition mixtures, and we compare their predicted colors through the hstfilters with our observed colors. we find that we can match the complex ofobserved colors with a pair of populations, one with primeval abundance andanother with enhanced nitrogen and a small helium enhancement, but withdepleted c and o. we confirm that models of rgb and red hb stars with that pairof compositions also give colors that fit our observations. we suggest that thedifferent strengths of molecular bands of oh, cn, ch and nh, falling indifferent photometric bands, are responsible for the color splits of the twopopulations. near the cluster center, in each portion of the color-magnitudediagram (cmd) the population with primeval abundances makes up only ~20% of thestars, a fraction that increases outwards, approachng equality in the outskirtsof the cluster, with a fraction ~30% averaged over the whole cluster. thus thesecond, he/n-enriched population is more concentrated and contributes themajority of the present-day stellar content of the cluster. we present evidencethat the cmd of 47 tuc consists of intertwined sequences of the twopopulations, whose separate identities can be followed continuously from the msup to the rgb, and thence to the hb. a third population is visible only in thesgb, where it includes ~8% of the stars.

1111.2688	na-o anticorrelation and hb. ix. kinematics of the program clusters. a  link between systemic rotation and hb morphology?	we use accurate radial velocities for 1981 member stars in 20 galacticglobular clusters, collected within our large survey aimed at the analysis ofthe na-o anti-correlation, to study the internal kinematics of the clusters. weperformed the first systematic exploration of the possible connections betweencluster kinematics and the multiple populations phenomenon in gcs. we did notfind any significant correlation between na abundance and either velocitydispersion or systemic rotation. we searched for systemic rotation in the eightclusters of our sample that lack such analysis from previous works in theliterature (ngc2808, ngc5904, ngc6171, ngc6254, ngc6397, ngc6388, ngc6441, andngc6838). these clusters are found to span a large range of rotationalamplitudes, from ~0.0 km/s (ngc6397) to ~13.0 km/s (ngc6441). we found asignificant correlation between the ratio of rotational velocity to centralvelocity dispersion (v_{rot}/sigma_0) and the horizontal branch morphologyparameter (b-r)/(b+r+v). v_{rot}/sigma_0 is found to correlate also withmetallicity, possibly hinting to a significant role of dissipation in theprocess of formation of globular clusters. v_{rot} is found to correlate wellwith (b-r)/(b+r+v), m_v, sigma_0 and [fe/h]. all these correlations stronglysuggest that systemic rotation may be intimately linked with the processes thatled to the formation of globular clusters and the stellar populations theyhost.

1201.1772	the na-o anticorrelation in horizontal branch stars. ii. ngc1851	we studied the na-o anti-correlation from moderately high resolution spectrafor 35 stars on the blue hb (bhb), one rr lyrae, and 55 stars are on the red hb(rhb) of ngc1851. we also derived abundances for he and n in bhb stars, and baand upper limits for n in rhb stars. the rhb stars clearly separate into twogroups: the vast majority are o-rich and na-poor, while about 10-15% arena-rich and moderately o-poor. most na-rich rhb stars are also ba-rich andthere is an overall correlation between na and ba abundances within the rhb.the group of ba-rich rhb stars resides on the warmer edge and includes ~10% ofthe rhb stars. we propose that they are the descendant of the stars on the rgbsequence with very red v-y colour. this sequence is known also to consist of baand perhaps cno-rich stars. however, the upper limit we obtain for n([n/fe]&lt;1.55) for one of the ba-rich stars coupled with the low c-abundancesfor rgb ba-rich stars from the literature suggests that the total cno might notbe particularly high ([(c+n+o)/fe]&lt;=0.15). the other na-rich rhb stars are alsoat the warm edge of the rhb and the only rr lyrae is na-rich and moderatelyo-poor. we also find a na-o anticorrelation among bhb stars, partiallyoverlapping that found among rhb stars, though generally bhb stars are morena-rich and o-poor. however, there is no clear correlation between temperatureand na and o abundances within the bhb. the average he abundance in bhb starsis y=0.29+/-0.05. n abundances are quite uniform at [n/fe]=1.16+/-0.14 amongbhb stars, with a small trend with temperature. this value is consistent withnormal cno abundance and excludes that bhb stars are very cno-rich: this leavesan age spread of ~1.5 gyr as the only viable explanation for the split of thesgb.

1203.2146	the kinematic properties of bhb and rr lyrae stars towards the  anticentre and the north galactic pole: the transition between the inner and  the outer halo	we identify 51 blue horizontal branch (bhb) stars, 12 possible bhb stars and58 rr lyrae stars in anticentre fields. their selection does not depend ontheir kinematics. light curves and ephemerides are given for 7 previouslyunknown rr lyrae stars. all but 4 of the rr lyrae stars are of oosterhoff typei. our selection criteria for bhb stars give results that agree with those usedby smith et al. (2010) and ruhland et al. (2011). we use 5 methods to determinedistances for the bhb stars and 3 methods for the rr lyrae stars to getdistances on a uniform scale. absolute proper motions (largely derived from thegscii and sdss (dr7) databases) are given for these stars; radial velocitiesare given for 31 of the bhb stars and 37 of the rr lyrae stars. combining thesedata for bhb and rr lyrae stars with those previously found in fields at thenorth galactic pole, we find that retrograde orbits dominate for galactocentricdistances greater than 12.5 kpc. the majority of metal-poor stars in the solarneighbourhood are known to be concentrated in a lperp vs. lz angular momentumplot. we show that the ratio of the number of outliers to the number in themain concentration increases with galactocentric distance. the location ofthese outliers with lperp and lz shows that the halo bhb and rr lyrae starshave more retrograde orbits and a more spherical distribution with increasinggalactocentric distance. six rr lyrae stars are identified in the h99 group ofoutliers; the small spread in their [fe/h] suggests that they could have comefrom a single globular cluster. another group of outliers contains two pairs ofrr lyrae stars; the stars in each pair have similar properties.

1205.5719	spectroscopic analysis of the two subgiant branches of the globular  cluster ngc1851	ngc1851 possibly shows a spread in [fe/h], but the relation between thisspread and the division in the sgb is unknown. we obtained blue (3950-4600 a)intermediate resolution (r~8,000) spectra for 47 stars on the bright and 30 onthe faint sgb of ngc 1851 (b-sgb and f-sgb, respectively). the determination ofthe atmospheric parameters to extremely high internal accuracy leads to smallerrors when comparing different stars in the cluster. we found that the b-sgbis slightly more metal-poor than the f-sgb, with [fe/h]=-1.227+/-0.009 and[fe/h]=-1.162+/- 0.012, respectively. this implies that the f-sgb is onlyslightly older by ~0.6 gyr than the b-sgb if the total cno abundance isconstant. there are more c-normal stars in the b-sgb than in the f-sgb. this isconsistent with what is found for hb stars, if b-sgb are the progenitors of redhb stars, and f-sgb those of blue hb ones. the abundances of the n-captureelements sr and ba have a bimodal distribution, reflecting the separationbetween f-sgb (sr and ba-rich) and b-sgb stars (sr and ba-poor). in bothgroups, there is a clear correlation between [sr/fe] and [ba/fe], suggestingthat there is a real spread in the abundances of n-capture elements. there issome correlation between c and ba abundances, while the same correlation for sris much more dubious. we identified six c-rich stars, which have a moderateoverabundance of sr and ba and rather low n abundances. this group of starsmight be the progenitors of these on the anomalous rgb in the (v, v-y) diagram.these results are discussed within different scenarios for the formation ofngc1851. it is possible that the two populations originated in differentregions of an inhomogeneous parent object. however, the striking similaritywith m22 calls for a similar evolution for these two clusters. derivingreliable cno abundances for the two sequences would be crucial.

1211.1142	searching for multiple stellar populations in the massive, old open  cluster berkeley 39	the most massive star clusters include several generations of stars with adifferent chemical composition (mainly revealed by an na-o anti-correlation)while low-mass star clusters appear to be chemically homogeneous. we areinvestigating the chemical composition of several clusters with masses of a few10^4 msun to establish the lower mass limit for the multiple stellar populationphenomenon. using flames@vlt spectra we determine abundances of fe, o, na, andseveral other elements (alpha, fe-peak, and neutron-capture elements) in theold open cluster berkeley 39. this is a massive open cluster: m~10^4 msun,approximately at the border between small globular clusters and large openclusters. our sample size of about 30 stars is one of the largest studied forabundances in any open cluster to date, and will be useful to determineimproved cluster parameters, such as age, distance, and reddening when coupledwith precise, well-calibrated photometry. we find that berkeley 39 is slightlymetal-poor, &lt;[fe/h]&gt;=-0.20, in agreement with previous studies of this cluster.more importantly, we do not detect any star-to-star variation in the abundancesof fe, o, and na within quite stringent upper limits. the r.m.s. scatter is0.04, 0.10, and 0.05 dex for fe, o, and na, respectively. this small spread canbe entirely explained by the noise in the spectra and by uncertainties in theatmospheric parameters. we conclude that berkeley 39 is a single-populationcluster.

1312.3925	the gaia-eso survey: reevaluation of the parameters of the open cluster  trumpler 20 using photometry and spectroscopy	trumpler 20 is an old open cluster (oc) located toward the galactic centre,at about 3 kpc from the sun and $\sim$7 kpc from the galactic centre. itsposition makes this cluster particularly interesting in the framework of thechemical properties of the galactic disc because very few old ocs reside in theinner part of the disc. for this reason it has been selected as a clustertarget of the gaia-eso survey, and spectra of many stars in the main sequenceand red clump phases are now available. moreover, although it has been studiedby several authors in the past, no consensus on the evolutionary status of tr20 has been reached. the heavy contamination of field stars (the line of sightof tr 20 crosses the carina spiral arm) complicates a correct interpretation.another interesting aspect of the cluster is that it shows a broadenedmain-sequence turn-off and a prominent and extended red-clump, characteristicsthat are not easily explained by classical evolutionary models. exploiting bothspectroscopic information from the gaia-eso survey (and the eso archive) andliterature photometry, we obtain a detailed and accurate analysis of theproperties of the cluster. we make use of the first accurate metallicitymeasurement ever obtained from several spectra of red clump stars, and ofcluster membership determination using radial velocities. according to theevolutionary models adopted, we find that tr 20 has an age in the range1.35-1.66 gyr, an average reddening $e(b-v)$ in the range 0.31-0.35 mag, and adistance modulus $(m-m)_0$ between 12.64 and 12.72 mag. the spectroscopicmetallicity is [fe/h]=+0.17 dex. we discuss the structural properties of theobject and constrain possible hypotheses for its broadened upper main sequenceby estimating the effect of differential reddening and its extended red clump.

1312.6472	the gaia-eso survey: abundance ratios in the inner-disk open clusters  trumpler 20, ngc 4815, ngc 6705	open clusters are key tools to study the spatial distribution of abundancesin the disk and their evolution with time. using the first release of stellarparameters and abundances of the gaia-eso survey, we analyse the chemicalproperties of stars in three old/intermediate-age open clusters, namely ngc6705, ngc 4815, and trumpler 20, all located in the inner part of the galacticdisk at galactocentric radius r$_{gc}\sim$7 kpc, aiming at proving theirhomogeneity and at comparing them with the field population. we study theabundance ratios of elements belonging to two different nucleosyntheticchannels: $\alpha$-elements and iron-peak elements. the main results can besummarised as follows: i) cluster members are chemically homogeneous within3-$\sigma$ in all analysed elements; ii) the three clusters have comparable[el/fe] patters within $\sim$1-$\sigma$, but they differ in their global metalcontent [el/h], with ngc 4815 having the lowest metallicity. their [el/fe]ratios show differences and analogies with those of the field population, bothin the solar neighbourhood and in the bulge/inner disk; iii) comparing theabundance ratios with the results of two chemical evolution models and withfield star abundance distributions, we find that the abundance ratios of mg,ni, ca in ngc 6705 might require an inner birthplace, implying a subsequentvariation of its r$_{gc}$ during its lifetime, consistent with previous orbitdetermination. the full dataset of the gaia-eso survey will be a superlativetool to constrain the chemical evolution of our galaxy by disentanglingdifferent formation and evolution scenarios.

1401.4437	the gaia-eso survey: radial metallicity gradients and age-metallicity  relation of stars in the milky way disk	we study the relationship between age, metallicity, and alpha-enhancement offgk stars in the galactic disk. the results are based upon the analysis ofhigh-resolution uves spectra from the gaia-eso large stellar survey. we explorethe limitations of the observed dataset, i.e. the accuracy of stellarparameters and the selection effects that are caused by the photometric targetpreselection. we find that the colour and magnitude cuts in the survey suppressold metal-rich stars and young metal-poor stars. this suppression may be ashigh as 97% in some regions of the age-metallicity relationship. the datasetconsists of 144 stars with a wide range of ages from 0.5 gyr to 13.5 gyr,galactocentric distances from 6 kpc to 9.5 kpc, and vertical distances from theplane 0 &lt; |z| &lt; 1.5 kpc. on this basis, we find that i) the observedage-metallicity relation is nearly flat in the range of ages between 0 gyr and8 gyr; ii) at ages older than 9 gyr, we see a decrease in [fe/h] and a clearabsence of metal-rich stars; this cannot be explained by the survey selectionfunctions; iii) there is a significant scatter of [fe/h] at any age; and iv)[mg/fe] increases with age, but the dispersion of [mg/fe] at ages &gt; 9 gyr isnot as small as advocated by some other studies. in agreement with earlierwork, we find that radial abundance gradients change as a function of verticaldistance from the plane. the [mg/fe] gradient steepens and becomes negative. inaddition, we show that the inner disk is not only more alpha-rich compared tothe outer disk, but also older, as traced independently by the ages and mgabundances of stars.

1403.4865	the gaia-eso survey: processing of the flames-uves spectra	the gaia-eso survey is a large public spectroscopic survey that aims toderive radial velocities and fundamental parameters of about 10^5 milky waystars in the field and in clusters. observations are carried out with themulti-object optical spectrograph flames, using simultaneously the mediumresolution (r~20,000) giraffe spectrograph and the high resolution (r~47,000)uves spectrograph. in this paper, we describe the methods and the software usedfor the data reduction, the derivation of the radial velocities, and thequality control of the flames-uves spectra. data reduction has been performedusing a workflow specifically developed for this project. this workflow runsthe eso public pipeline optimizing the data reduction for the gaia-eso survey,performs automatically sky subtraction, barycentric correction andnormalisation, and calculates radial velocities and a first guess of therotational velocities. the quality control is performed using the outputparameters from the eso pipeline, by a visual inspection of the spectra and bythe analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra.  using the observations of the first 18 months, specifically targets observedmultiple times at different epochs, stars observed with both giraffe and uves,and observations of radial velocity standards, we estimated the precision andthe accuracy of the radial velocities. the statistical error on the radialvelocities is sigma~0.4 km s^-1 and is mainly due to uncertainties in the zeropoint of the wavelength calibration. however, we found a systematic bias withrespect to the giraffe spectra (~0.9 km s^-1) and to the radial velocities ofthe standard stars (~0.5 kms^-1) retrieved from the literature. this bias willbe corrected in the future data releases, when a common zero point for all thesetups and instruments used for the survey will be established.

1403.7451	the gaia-eso survey: properties of the intermediate age open cluster ngc  4815	ngc 4815 is a populous ~500 myr open cluster at a galactocentric radius of 7kpc observed in the first six months of the gaia-eso survey. located in theinner galactic disk, ngc 4815 is an important tracer of the abundance gradient,where few intermediate age open clusters are found. we use the survey derivedradial velocities, stellar atmospheric parameters, metallicity, and elementalabundances for stars targeted as potential members of this cluster to carry outan analysis of cluster properties. the radial velocity distribution of stars inthe cluster field is used to define the cluster systemic velocity and derivelikely cluster membership for stars observed by the gaia-eso survey. weinvestigate the distributions of fe and fe-peak elements, alpha-elements, andthe light elements na and al and characterize the cluster's internal chemicalhomogeneity comparing it to the properties of radial velocity non-member stars.utilizing these cluster properties, the cluster color-magnitude diagram isanalyzed and theoretical isochrones are fit to derive cluster reddening,distance, and age. ngc 4815 is found to have a mean [fe/h]=+0.03. elementalabundances of cluster members show typically small internal variation, withinternal dispersions of ~0.05 dex. [ca/fe] and [si/fe] show solar ratios, but[mg/fe] is moderately enhanced, while [ti/fe] appears slightly deficient. aswith many open clusters, [na/fe] and [al/fe] are enhanced, [na/fe]significantly so, although the role of internal mixing and the assumption oflte in the analysis remain to be investigated. from isochrone fits tocolor-magnitude diagrams, we find a cluster age of 0.5 to 0.63 gyr, a reddeningof e(b-v) = 0.59 to 0.65, and a true distance modulus (m-m) = 11.95 to 12.20,depending on the choice of theoretical models, leading to a galactocentricdistance of 6.9 kpc.

1403.7568	the gaia-eso survey: the galactic thick to thin disc transition	(abridged) we have used the atmospheric parameters, [alpha/fe] abundances andradial velocities, determined from the gaia-eso survey giraffe spectra offgk-type stars (idr1), to provide a chemo-kinematical characterisation of thedisc stellar populations. we focuss on a subsample of 1016 stars with highquality parameters, covering the volume |z|&lt;4.5kpc and r in the range 2-13kpc.we have identified a thin to thick disc separation in the [alpha/fe] vs [m/h]plane, thanks to the presence of a low-density region in the number densitydistribution. the thick disc stars seem to lie in progressively thinner layersabove the galactic plane, as metallicity increases and [alpha/fe] decreases.the thin disc population presents a constant value of the mean distance to theplane at all metallicities. our data confirm the already known correlationsbetween v_phi and [m/h] for the two discs. for the thick disc sequence, a studyof the possible contamination by thin disc stars suggests a gradient up to64km/s/dex. the distributions of v_phi, v_z, and orbital parameters areanalysed for the chemically separated samples. concerning the gradients withgalactocentric radius, we find for the thin disc a flat behaviour of v_phi, a[m/h] gradient of -0.058dex/kpc and a small positive [alpha/fe] gradient. forthe thick disc, flat gradients in [m/h] and [alpha/fe] are derived. ourchemo-kinematical analysis suggests a picture in which the thick disc seems tohave experienced a settling process, during which its rotation increasedprogressively, and, possibly, the v_phi dispersion decreased. at [m/h]-0.25dexand [alpha/fe]0.1dex, the mean characteristics of the thick disc in distance tothe galactic plane, v_phi, v_phi dispersion and eccentricity agree with thoseof the thin disc stars, suggesting a possible connection between thesepopulations at a certain epoch of the disc evolution.

1405.6586	the gaia-eso survey: the first abundance determination of the  pre-main-sequence cluster gamma velorum	knowledge of the abundance distribution of star forming regions and youngclusters is critical to investigate a variety of issues, from triggered starformation and chemical enrichment by nearby supernova explosions to the abilityto form planetary systems.in spite of this, detailed abundance studies arecurrently available for relatively few regions. in this context, we present theanalysis of the metallicity of the gamma velorum cluster, based on the productsdistributed in the first internal release of the gaia-eso survey. the gammavelorum candidate members have been observed with flames, using both uves andgiraffe, depending on the target brightness and spectral type. in order toderive a solid metallicity determination for the cluster, membership of theobserved stars must be first assessed. to this aim, we use several membershipcriteria including radial velocities, surface gravity estimates, and thedetection of the photospheric lithium line. out of the 80 targets observed withuves, we identify 14 high-probability members. we find that the metallicity ofthe cluster is slightly subsolar, with a mean [fe/h]=-0.057+/-0.018 dex.although j08095427-4721419 is one of the high-probability members, itsmetallicity is significantly larger than the cluster average. we speculateabout its origin as the result of recent accretion episodes of rocky bodies of~60 m_sun hydrogen-depleted material from the circumstellar disk.

(2014b), we further find that the thick-disc is more extended verticallyand is more centrally concentrated towards the inner galaxy than the thin-disc,which indicates a shorter scale-length. we derive the radial and verticalgradients in metallicity, iron, four alpha-element abundances, and al for thetwo populations, taking into account the identified correlation between r_gcand |z|. radial metallicity gradient is found in the thin disc. the positiveradial individual [alpha/m] gradients found are at variance from the gradientsobserved in the rave survey. the thin disc also hosts a negative verticalmetallicity gradient, accompanied by positive individual [alpha/m] and [al/m]gradients. the thick-disc, presents no radial metallicity gradient, a shallowervertical metallicity gradient than the thin-disc, an alpha-elements-to-ironradial gradient in the opposite sense than that of the thin disc, and positivevertical individual [alpha/m] and [al/m] gradients.

1411.4886	the gaia-eso survey: kinematics of seven galactic globular clusters	the gaia-eso survey is a large public spectroscopic survey aimed atinvestigating the origin and formation history of our galaxy by collectingspectroscopy of representative samples (about 10^5 milky way stars) of allgalactic stellar populations, in the field and in clusters. the survey usesglobular clusters as intra- and inter-survey calibrators, deriving stellaratmospheric parameters and abundances of a significant number of stars inclusters, along with radial velocity determinations. we used precise radialvelocities of a large number of stars in seven globular clusters (ngc 1851, ngc2808, ngc 4372, ngc 4833, ngc 5927, ngc 6752, and ngc 7078) to validatepipeline results and to preliminarily investigate the cluster internalkinematics. radial velocity measurements were extracted from flames/giraffespectra processed by the survey pipeline as part of the second internal datarelease of data products to eso. we complemented our sample with eso archivaldata obtained with different instrument configurations. reliable radialvelocity measurements for 1513 bona fide cluster star members were obtained intotal. we measured systemic rotation, estimated central velocity dispersions,and present velocity dispersion profiles of all the selected clusters,providing the first velocity dispersion curve and the first estimate of thecentral velocity dispersion for the cluster ngc~5927. finally, we explore thepossible link between cluster kinematics and other physical parameters. theanalysis we present here demonstrates that gaia-eso survey data aresufficiently accurate to be used in studies of kinematics of stellar systemsand stellar populations in the milky way.

1503.05925	lithium abundances in globular cluster giants: ngc 1904, ngc 2808, and  ngc 362	the presence of multiple populations in globular clusters has been wellestablished thanks to high-resolution spectroscopy. it is widely accepted thatdistinct populations are a consequence of different stellar generations:intra-cluster pollution episodes are required to produce the peculiar chemistryobserved in almost all clusters. unfortunately, the progenitors responsiblehave left an ambiguous signature and their nature remains unresolved. toconstrain the candidate polluters, we have measured lithium and aluminiumabundances in more than 180 giants across three systems: ngc~1904, ngc~2808,and ngc~362. the present investigation along with our previous analysis of m12and m5 affords us the largest database of simultaneous determinations of li andal abundances. our results indicate that li production has occurred in each ofthe three clusters. in ngc~362 we detected an m12-like behaviour, with firstand second-generation stars sharing very similar li abundances favouring aprogenitor that is able to produce li, such as agb stars. multiple progenitortypes are possible in ngc~1904 and ngc~2808, as they possess both anintermediate population comparable in lithium to the first generation stars andalso an extreme population, that is enriched in al but depleted in li. a simpledilution model fails in reproducing this complex pattern. finally, the internalli variation seems to suggest that the production efficiency of this element isa function of the cluster's mass and metallicity - low-mass or relativelymetal-rich clusters are more adept at producing li.

1509.00933	the gaia-eso survey: chemical signatures of rocky accretion in a young  solar-type star	it is well known that newly formed planetary systems undergo processes oforbital reconfiguration and planetary migration. as a result, planets orprotoplanetary objects may accrete onto the central star, being fused and mixedinto its external layers. if the accreted mass is sufficiently high and thestar has a sufficiently thin convective envelope, such events may result in amodification of the chemical composition of the stellar photosphere in anobservable way, enhancing it with elements that were abundant in the accretedmass. the recent gaia-eso survey observations of the 10-20 myr old gammavelorum cluster have enabled identifying a star that is significantly enrichedin iron with respect to other cluster members. in this letter we furtherinvestigate the abundance pattern of this star, showing that its abundanceanomaly is not limited to iron, but is also present in the refractory elements,whose overabundances are correlated with the condensation temperature. thisfinding strongly supports the hypothesis of a recent accretion of rockymaterial.

1509.05014	the incidence of binaries in globular cluster stellar populations	binary fraction and orbital characteristics provide indications on theconditions of star formation, as they shed light on the environment they wereborn in. multiple systems are more common in low density environments ratherthan in higher density ones. in the current debate about the formation ofglobular clusters and their multiple populations, studying the binary incidencein the populations they host offers a crucial piece of information on theenvironment of their birth and their subsequent dynamical evolution.  through a multi-year observational campaign using flames at vlt, we monitoredthe radial velocity of 968 red-giant branch stars located around the half-lightradii in a sample of 10 galactic globular clusters. we found a total of 21radial velocity variables identified as {\it bona fide} binary stars, for abinary fraction of 2.2%$\pm$0.5%. when separating the sample into firstgeneration and second generation stars, we find a binary fraction of4.9%$\pm$1.3% and 1.2%$\pm$0.4% respectively. through simulations that takeinto account possible sources of bias in detecting radial velocity variationsin the two populations, we show that the difference is significant and onlymarginally affected by such effects.  such a different binary fraction strongly suggests different conditions inthe environment of formation and evolution of first and second generationsstars, with the latter being born in a much denser environment. our resulthence strongly supports the idea that the second generation forms in a densesubsystem at the center of the loosely distributed first generation, where(loose) binaries are efficiently destroyed.

astro-ph;0103515	metallicities for double mode rr lyrae in the large magellanic cloud	metallicities for six double mode rr lyrae's (rrd's) in the large magellaniccloud have been estimated using the deltas method. the derived [fe/h] valuesare in the range [fe/h] = -1.09 to -1.78 (or -0.95 to -1.58, adopting adifferent calibration of [fe/h] vs deltas). two stars in our sample are at thevery metal rich limit of all rrd's for which metal abundance has beenestimated, either by direct measure (for field objects) or on the basis of thehosting system (for objects in globular clusters or external galaxies). thesemetal abundances, coupled with mass determinations from pulsational models andthe petersen diagram, are used to compare the mass-metallicity distribution offield and cluster rr lyrae variables. we find that field and cluster rrd's seemto follow the same mass-metallicity distribution, within the observationalerrors, strengthening the case for uniformity of properties between field andcluster variables at odds to what is usually assumed, we find no significativedifference in mass for rr lyrae's in globular clusters of different metallicityand oosterhoff types, or there may even be a difference contrary to thecommonly accepted one, depending on the metallicity scale adopted to derivemasses. this ``unusual'' result for the mass-metallicity relation is probablydue, at least in part, to the inclusion of updated opacity tables in thecomputation of metal-dependent pulsation models.

astro-ph;0204332	the lithium content of the globular cluster ngc 6397	we make use of high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra of 12turn-off stars in the metal-poor globular cluster ngc 6397 to measure itslithium content. we conclude that they all have the same lithium abundancea(li) = 2.34 with a standard deviation of 0.056 dex. we use this result,together with monte carlo simulations, to estimate that the maximum allowedintrinsic scatter is of the order of 0.035 dex. this is a new stringentconstraint to be fulfilled by stellar models which predict li depletion. weargue that although a mild depletion of 0.1 -- 0.2 dex, as predicted by recentmodels, cannot be ruled out, there is no compelling reason for it. this fact,together with the good agreement with the li abundance observed in field stars,supports the primordial origin of lithium in metal-poor stars. taking the abovevalue as the primordial lithium abundance implies a cosmic baryonic densitywhich is either omega_b h^2 = 0.016 +/- 0.004 or omega_b h^2 = 0.005^{+0.0026}_{-0.0006}, from the predictions of standard big bangnucleosynthesis. the high baryonic density solution is in agreement with recentresults on the primordial abundance of deuterium and 3he and on the estimatesderived from the fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background.

astro-ph;0506206	the metal abundance distribution of the oldest stellar component in the  sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy	(abridged): low resolution spectroscopy obtained with fors2 at the very largetelescope (vlt) has been used to measure individual metal abundances ([fe/h])for 107 rr lyrae stars, and trace the metal distribution of the oldest stellarcomponent in the sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. their metallicities have anaverage value of [fe/h]=-1.83 +/- 0.03 (r.m.s. 0.26 dex) and cover themetallicity range -2.40&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-0.85 (only 1 star with [fe/h]&gt;-1). thestar-to-star scatter is larger than typical errors on individual metallicities(+/- 0.15-0.16 dex), indicating a real spread in metal abundances. the radialvelocities have a dispersion of 12.9 km/s, consistent with the dispersionderived in sculptor by tolstoy et al. (2004). this along with the metallicitydistribution, suggests that most of the rr lyr's arise from the same burst ofstellar formation that produced the metal-poor component giving origin to thegalaxy blue horizontal branch, and only a few (if any) come from the centrallyconcentrated metal-rich red horizontal branch population. the spectroscopicmetallicities and the apparent luminosities were used to study theluminosity-metallicity relation, for which we derive a shallow slope of 0.09mag/dex. this result can be due to a high level of evolution off the zero agehorizontal branch of the rr lyrae stars in this galaxy, again in agreement withtheir origin from the blue horizontal branch population.

astro-ph;0701182	element abundances in the metal rich open cluster ngc6253	we have carried out a big flames survey of 10 galactic open clusters aimingat different goals. one of them is the determination of chemical abundances, inorder to put constraints on the radial metallicity gradient in the disk and itsevolution. one of the sample clusters is the very metal rich ngc 6253. we haveobtained uves high resolution spectra of seven candidate cluster members (fromthe turn off up to the red clump) with the goal of determining the chemicalcomposition of ngc 6253 and to investigate its origin and role in theinterpretation of the radial metallicity gradient in the disk. equivalent widthanalysis and spectral synthesis were performed using moog and kurucz modelatmospheres. we derived abundances of fe, alpha- and fe-peak elements, thelight element na and the s-process element ba. excluding two likely non-membersand the clump giant, whose metallicity from equivalent widths is overestimated,we find an average [fe/h]=+0.36+/-0.07 (rms) for the cluster. for most of theother elements we derive solar abundance ratios.

astro-ph;9504034	new pulsational properties of eight "anomalous" rr lyrae variables	ccd photometry in the v band is presented for 7 field rr lyrae stars selectedfrom a sample of eight variables which, according to data collected in theliterature, are expected to be {\it ab}-type pulsators, to have short periodsand hence high metallicity, and to be located at high {\it z} from the galacticplane. new periods and epochs are derived for them. the new periods are onlyslightly shorter than the values published on the last edition of the generalcatalog of variable stars (gcvs4). instead, in six cases our amplitude of thelight variation is significantly smaller than that published on the gcvs4, andin at least three cases the actual pulsation appears to be in the firstharmonic rather than in the fundamental mode. all the suggested {\it c}-typepulsators show variations in the amplitude and/or quite scattered light curves.possible explanations are given. from a spectro-photometric analysis of thesample, only dl com is confirmed to pulsate in the fundamental mode, to haveshort period, and to be located at relatively high {\it z}. a single objectcannot be taken as evidence for a significant metal rich population at largedistance from the galactic plane.

astro-ph;9704240	a detached double degenerate with a 1.4 hr orbital period	we have discovered that the detached double degenerate binary wd 0957-666 hasan orbital period of 1.46 hours, rather than the 1.15 day orbital periodreported earlier. this is the shortest period example of such a system yetdiscovered. we obtain a unique period, which fits both our and earlier data. atthis period the emission of gravitational radiation will cause the binary tomerge within approximately 2.0 x 10*8 years. this system represents apopulation of short orbital period binaries which will merge within a hubbletime, and so could account for type ia supernovae, although due to the low massof both stars (0.3 to 0.4 solar masses), it is unlikely to become a supernovaitself. we have detected the companion star and have measured a mass ratio of q= 1.15. this is the third double degenerate for which q has been measured andall three have q close to 1, which is in conflict with the predicted mass ratiodistribution which peaks at 0.7. this system is viewed close to edge on, and weestimate that the probability of this system undergoing eclipses is 15 %.

astro-ph;9909332	light curves and metal abundances of rr lyrae variables in the bar of  the large magellanic cloud	the large magellanic cloud (lmc) is widely considered a corner-stone of theastronomical distance scale, however a difference of 0.2-0.3 mag exists in itsdistance as predicted by the "short" and "long" distance scales. distances tothe lmc from population ii objects are founded on the rr lyrae variables. wehave undertaken an observational campaign devoted to the definition of theaverage apparent luminosity and to the study of the mass-metallicity relationfor rr lyraes in the bar of the lmc. these are compared with analogousquantities for cluster rr lyraes. the purpose is to see whether an intrinsicdifference in luminosity, possibly due to a difference in mass, might existbetween field and cluster rr lyraes, which could be responsible for thewell-known dichotomy between "short" and "long" distance scales. preliminaryresults are presented on the v and b-v light curves, the average apparentvisual magnitude, and the pulsational properties of 102 rr lyrae in the bar ofthe lmc, observed at eso in january 1999. the photometric data are accuratelytied to the johnson photometric system. comparison is presented with thephotometry of rr lyraes in the bar of the lmc obtained by the machocollaboration (alcock et al. 1996). our sample includes 9 double-mode rr lyraesselected from alcock et al. (1997) for which an estimate of the metal abundancefrom the deltas method is presented.
