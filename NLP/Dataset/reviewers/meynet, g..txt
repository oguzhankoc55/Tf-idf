0907.5200	cno enrichment by rotating agb stars in globular clusters	agb stars have long been held responsible for the important star-to-starvariations in light elements observed in galactic globular clusters. we analysethe main impacts of a first generation of rotating intermediate-mass stars onthe chemical properties of second-generation globular cluster stars. therotating models were computed without magnetic fields and without the effectsof internal gravity waves. they account for the transports by meridionalcurrents and turbulence. we computed the evolution of both standard androtating stellar models with initial masses between 2.5 and 8 msun within themetallicity range covered by galactic globular clusters. during centralhe-burning, rotational mixing transports fresh co-rich material from the coretowards the hydrogen-burning shell, leading to the production of primary 14n.in stars more massive than m &gt; 4 msun, the convective envelope reaches thisreservoir during the second dredge-up episode, resulting in a large increase inthe total c+n+o content at the stellar surface and in the stellar wind. thecorresponding pollution depends on the initial metallicity. at low- andintermediate-metallicity, it is at odds with the constancy of c+n+o observedamong globular cluster low-mass stars. with the given input physics, our modelssuggest that massive rotating agb stars have not shaped the abundance patternsobserved in low- and intermediate-metallicity globular clusters. ournon-rotating models, on the other hands, do not predict surface c+n+oenhancements, hence are in a better position as sources of the chemicalanomalies in globular clusters showing the constancy of the c+n+o. however atthe moment, there is no reason to think that intermediate mass stars were notrotating.

0907.5209	using population synthesis of massive stars to study the interstellar  medium near ob associations	we developed a new population synthesis code for groups of massive stars,where we model the emission of different forms of energy and matter from thestars of the association. in particular, the ejection of the two radioactiveisotopes 26al and 60fe is followed, as well as the emission of hydrogenionizing photons, and the kinetic energy of the stellar winds and supernovaexplosions. we investigate various alternative astrophysical inputs and theresulting output sensitivities, especially effects due to the inclusion ofrotation in stellar models. as the aim of the code is the application torelatively small populations of massive stars, special care is taken to addresstheir statistical properties. our code incorporates both analytical statisticalmethods applicable to small populations, as well as extensive monte carlosimulations. we find that the inclusion of rotation in the stellar models has alarge impact on the interactions between ob associations and their surroundinginterstellar medium. the emission of 26al in the stellar winds is stronglyenhanced, compared to non-rotating models with the same mass-loss prescription.this compensates the recent reductions in the estimates of mass-loss rates ofmassive stars due to the effects of clumping. despite the lower mass-lossrates, the power of the winds is actually enhanced for rotating stellar models.the supernova power (kinetic energy of their ejecta) is decreased due to longerlifetimes of rotating stars, and therefore the wind power dominates oversupernova power for the first 6 myr after a burst of star-formation. forpopulations typical of nearby star-forming regions, the statisticaluncertainties are large and clearly non-gaussian.

0911.5307	effects of rotation on the evolution and asteroseismic properties of red  giants	the influence of rotation on the properties of red giants is studied in thecontext of the asteroseismic modelling of these stars. while red giants exhibitlow surface rotational velocities, we find that the rotational history of thestar has a large impact on its properties during the red giant phase. inparticular, for stars massive enough to ignite he burning in non-degenerateconditions, rotational mixing induces a significant increase of the stellarluminosity and shifts the location of the core helium burning phase to a higherluminosity in the hr diagram. this of course results in a change of the seismicproperties of red giants at the same evolutionary state. as a consequence theinclusion of rotation significantly changes the fundamental parameters of a redgiant star as determined by performing an asteroseismic calibration. inparticular rotation decreases the derived stellar mass and increases the age.depending on the rotation law assumed in the convective envelope and on theinitial velocity of the star, non-negligible values of rotational splitting canbe reached, which may complicate the observation and identification ofnon-radial oscillation modes for red giants exhibiting moderate surfacerotational velocities. by comparing the effects of rotation and overshooting,we find that the main-sequence widening and the increase of the h-burninglifetime induced by rotation (vini=150 km/s) are well reproduced bynon-rotating models with an overshooting parameter of 0.1, while the increaseof luminosity during the post-main sequence evolution is better reproduced bynon-rotating models with overshooting parameters twice as large. this is due tothe fact that rotation not only increases the size of the convective core butalso changes the chemical composition of the radiative zone.

0707.4645	ob associations, wolf-rayet stars, and the origin of galactic cosmic  rays	we have measured the isotopic abundances of neon and a number of otherspecies in the galactic cosmic rays (gcrs) using the cosmic ray isotopespectrometer (cris) aboard the ace spacecraft. our data are compared to recentresults from two-component wolf-rayet (wr) models. the three largest deviationsof galactic cosmic ray isotope ratios from solar-system ratios predicted bythese models, 12c/16o, 22ne/20ne, and 58fe/56fe, are very close to thoseobserved. all of the isotopic ratios that we have measured are consistent witha gcr source consisting of ~20% of wr material mixed with ~80% material withsolar-system composition. since wr stars are evolutionary products of ob stars,and most ob stars exist in ob associations that form superbubbles, the goodagreement of our data with wr models suggests that ob associations withinsuperbubbles are the likely source of at least a substantial fraction of gcrs.in previous work it has been shown that the primary 59ni (which decays only byelectron-capture) in gcrs has decayed, indicating a time interval betweennucleosynthesis and acceleration of &gt;10^5 yr.in this paper we suggest ascenario that should allow much of the 59ni to decay in the ob associationenvironment and conclude that the hypothesis of the ob association origin ofcosmic rays appears to be viable.

1009.4541	effects of rotational mixing on the asteroseismic properties of  solar-type stars	the influence of rotational mixing on the evolution and asteroseismicproperties of solar-type stars is studied. rotational mixing changes the globalproperties of a solar-type star with a significant increase of the effectivetemperature resulting in a shift of the evolutionary track to the blue part ofthe hr diagram. these differences are related to changes of the chemicalcomposition, because rotational mixing counteracts the effects of atomicdiffusion leading to larger helium surface abundances for rotating models thanfor non-rotating ones. higher values of the large frequency separation are thenfound for rotating models than for non-rotating ones at the same evolutionarystage, because the increase of the effective temperature leads to a smallerradius and hence to an increase of the stellar mean density. rotational mixingalso has a considerable impact on the structure and chemical composition of thecentral stellar layers by bringing fresh hydrogen fuel to the core, therebyenhancing the main-sequence lifetime. the increase of the central hydrogenabundance together with the change of the chemical profiles in the centrallayers result in a significant increase of the values of the small frequencyseparations and of the ratio of the small to large separations for modelsincluding shellular rotation. this increase is clearly seen for models with thesame age sharing the same initial parameters except for the inclusion ofrotation as well as for models with the same global stellar parameters and inparticular the same location in the hr diagram. by computing rotating models ofsolar-type stars including the effects of a dynamo that possibly occurs in theradiative zone, we find that the efficiency of rotational mixing is stronglyreduced when the effects of magnetic fields are taken into account, in contrastto what happens in massive stars.

1010.5385	effects of rotation and magnetic fields on the lithium abundance and  asteroseismic properties of exoplanet-host stars	aims: the effects of rotation and magnetic fields on the surface abundancesof solar-type stars are studied in order to investigate whether the reporteddifference in lithium content of exoplanet-host stars can be related to theirrotational history. moreover, the asteroseismic properties predicted for starswith and without exoplanets are compared to determine how such a scenario,which relates the lithium abundances and the rotational history of the star,can be further challenged by observations of solar-like oscillations. methods:based on observations of rotational periods of solar-type stars, slow rotatorson the zero age main sequence (zams) are modelled with a comprehensivetreatment of only the shellular rotation, while fast rotators are modelledincluding both shellular rotation and magnetic fields. assuming a possible linkbetween low rotation rates on the zams and the presence of planets as a resultof a longer disc-locking phase during the pre-main sequence (pms), we comparethe surface abundances and asteroseismic properties of slow and fast rotatingmodels, which correspond to exoplanet-host stars and stars without detectedplanets, respectively. results: we confirm previous suggestions that thedifference in the lithium content of stars with and without detected planetscan be related to their different rotational history. the larger efficiency ofrotational mixing predicted in exoplanet-host stars explains their lithiumdepletion and also leads to changes in the structure and chemical compositionof the central stellar layers. asteroseismic observations can reveal thesechanges and can help us distinguish between different possible explanations forthe lower lithium content of exoplanet-host stars.

1101.1732	mass and angular momentum loss via decretion disks	we examine the nature and role of mass loss via an equatorial decretion diskin massive stars with near-critical rotation induced by evolution of thestellar interior. in contrast to the usual stellar wind mass loss set byexterior driving from the stellar luminosity, such decretion-disk mass lossstems from the angular momentum loss needed to keep the star near and belowcritical rotation, given the interior evolution and decline in the star'smoment of inertia. because the specific angular momentum in a keplerian diskincreases with the square root of the radius, the decretion mass lossassociated with a required level of angular momentum loss depends crucially onthe outer radius for viscous coupling of the disk, and can be significantlyless than the spherical mass loss the spherical, wind-like mass loss commonlyassumed in evolutionary calculations. we discuss the physical processes thataffect the outer disk radius, including thermal disk outflow, and ablation ofthe disk material via a line-driven wind induced by the star's radiation. wepresent parameterized scaling laws for taking account of decretion-disk massloss in stellar evolution codes, including how these are affected bymetallicity, or by presence within a close binary and/or a dense cluster.effects similar to those discussed here should also be present in accretiondisks during star formation, and may play an important role in shaping thedistribution of rotation speeds on the zams.

1104.2928	blue luminous stars in nearby galaxies - uit005: a possible link to the  luminous blue variable stage	(abridged) a detailed study of the blue supergiant uit005 (b2-2.5ia+) in m33is presented. the results of our quantitative spectral analysis indicate thatthe star is a very luminous, log(l/lsun)~5.9 dex, and massive, m~50 msun,object, showing a very high nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio in its surface (n/o~8, bymass). based on the derived mg and si abundances, we argue that this high n/oratio cannot be the result of an initial low o content due to its location onthe disk of m33, known to present a steep metallicity gradient. in combinationwith the he abundance, the most plausible interpretation is that uit005 is inan advanced stage of evolution, showing in its surface n enrichment and odepletion resulting from mixing with cno processed material from the stellarinterior. a comparison with the predictions of current stellar evolutionarymodels indicates that there are significant discrepancies, in particular withregard to the degree of chemical processing, with the models predicting a muchlower degree of o depletion than observed. at the same time, the mass-loss ratederived in our analysis is an order of magnitude lower than the valuesconsidered in the evolutionary calculations. based on a study of thesurrounding stellar population and the nearby cluster ngc588, using wfpc2photometry, we suggest that uit005 could be in fact a runaway star from thiscluster.

0709.4160	origin of the abundance patterns in galactic globular clusters:  constraints on dynamical and chemical properties of globular clusters	aims. we analyse the effects of a first generation of fast rotating massivestars on the dynamical and chemical properties of globular clusters. methods.we use stellar models of fast rotating massive stars, losing mass through aslow mechanical equatorial winds to produce material rich in h-burningproducts. we propose that stars with high na and low o abundances (hereafteranomalous stars) are formed from matter made of slow winds of individualmassive stars and of interstellar matter. the proportion of slow wind and ofinterstellar material is fixed in order to reproduce the observed li-naanticorrelation in ngc 6752. results. in the case that globular clusters,during their lifetime, did not lose any stars, we found that to reproduce theobserved ratio of normal to anomalous stars, a flat initial mass function (imf)is needed, with typically a slope x=0.55 (a salpeter's imf has x=1.35). in thecase that globular clusters suffer from an evaporation of normal stars, the imfslope can be steeper: to have x=1.35, about 96% of the normal stars would belost. we make predictions for the distribution of stars as a function of their[o/na] and obtain quite reasonable agreement with that one observed for ngc6752. predictions for the number fraction of stars with different values ofhelium, of the 12c/13c and 16o/17o ratios are discussed, as well as theexpected relations between values of [o/na] and those of helium, of [c/n], of12c/13c and of 16o/17o. future observations might test these predictions. wealso provide predictions for the present day mass of the clusters expressed inunits of mass of the gas used to form stars, and for the way the present daymass is distributed between the first and second generation of stars and thestellar remnants.

0711.1735	evolution towards the critical limit and the origin of be stars	we determine which are the mechanisms accelerating the surface of singlestars during the main sequence evolution. we have computed 112 stellar modelsof four different initial masses between 3 and 60 m_sun, at four differentmetallicities between 0 and 0.020, and with seven different values of the ratioomega/omega_crit between 0.1 and 0.99. for all the models, computations wereperformed until either the end of the main sequence evolution or the reachingof the critical limit. the evolution of surface velocities during the mainsequence lifetime results from an interplay between meridional circulation(bringing angular momentum to the surface) and mass loss by stellar winds(removing it). the dependence on metallicity of these two mechanisms plays akey role in determining for each metallicity, a limiting range of initialmasses (spectral types) for stars able to reach or at least approach thecritical limit. present models predict a higher frequency of fast rotatingstars in clusters with ages between 10 and 25 myr. this is the range of ageswhere most of be stars are observed.

1207.0372	impact of rotation and disc lifetime on pre-main sequence lithium  depletion of solar-type stars	aims: we study the influence of rotation and disc lifetime on lithiumdepletion of pre-main sequence (pms) solar-type stars. methods: the impact ofrotational mixing and of the hydrostatic effects of rotation on lithiumabundances are investigated by computing non-rotating and rotating pms modelsthat include a comprehensive treatment of shellular rotation. the influence ofthe disc lifetime is then studied by comparing the lithium content of pmsrotating models experiencing different durations of the disc-locking phasebetween 3 and 9 myr. results: the surface lithium abundance at the end of thepms is decreased when rotational effects are included. during the beginning ofthe lithium depletion phase, only hydrostatic effects of rotation are at work.this results in a decrease in the lithium depletion rate for rotating modelscompared to non-rotating ones. when the convective envelope recedes from thestellar centre, rotational mixing begins to play an important role due todifferential rotation near the bottom of the convective envelope. this mixingresults in a decrease in the surface lithium abundance with a limitedcontribution from hydrostatic effects of rotation, which favours lithiumdepletion during the second part of the pms evolution. the impact of rotationon pms lithium depletion is also found to be sensitive to the duration of thedisc-locking phase. when the disc lifetime increases, the pms lithium abundanceof a solar-type star decreases owing to the higher efficiency of rotationalmixing in the radiative zone. a relationship between the surface rotation andlithium abundance at the end of the pms is then obtained: slow rotators on thezero-age main sequence are predicted to be more lithium-depleted than fastrotators due to the increase in the disc lifetime.

1301.5016	the role of massive stars in the turbulent infancy of galactic globular  clusters: feedback on the intracluster medium, and detailed timeline	a major paradigm shift has recently revolutionized our picture of globularclusters (gc) that were long thought to be simple systems of coeval stars bornout of homogeneous material. indeed, detailed abundance studies of gclong-lived low-mass stars performed with 8-10m class telescopes, together withhigh-precision photometry of galactic gcs obtained with hst,have broughtcompelling clues on the presence of multiple stellar populations in individualgcs. these stellar subgroups can be recognized thanks to their differentchemical properties (more precisely by abundance differences in light elementsfrom carbon to aluminium; see bragaglia, this volume) and by the appearance ofmultimodal sequences in the colour-magnitude diagrams (see piotto, thisvolume). this has a severe impact on our understanding of the early evolutionof gcs, and in particular of the possible role that massive stars played inshaping the intra-cluster medium (icm) and in inducing secondary starformation. here we summarize the detailed timeline we have recently proposedfor the first 40 myrs in the lifetime of a typical gc following the generalideas of our so-called "fast rotating massive stars scenario" (frms, decressinet al. 2007b) and taking into account the dynamics of interstellar bubblesproduced by stellar winds and supernovae. more details can be found in krauseet al.

0712.3434	a new imprint of fast rotators: low 12c/13c ratios in extremely  metal-poor halo stars	(abridged) fast stellar rotation is currently the most promising mechanismfor producing primary nitrogen in metal-poor massive stars. chemical evolutionmodels computed with the inclusion of the yields of fast rotating models at ametallicity $z=10^{-8}$ can account for the high n/o abundances observed innormal metal-poor halo stars. if, as believed, intermediate mass stars did nothave enough time to contribute to the interstellar medium enrichment at suchlow metallicities, the above result constitutes a strong case for the existenceof fast rotators in the primordial universe. an important result of stellarmodels of fast rotators is that large quantities of primary 13c are produced.hence, our goal is to investigate the consequence of fast rotation on theevolution of the 12c/13c ratio in the interstellar medium at low metallicity.we predict that, if fast rotating massive stars were common phenomena in theearly universe, the primordial interstellar medium of galaxies with a starformation history similar to the one inferred for our galactic halo should have12c/13c ratios between 30-300. without fast rotators, the predicted 12c/13cratios would be $\sim$ 4500 at [fe/h]=-3.5, increasing to $\sim$ 31000 ataround [fe/h]=-5.0. current data on very metal-poor giant normal stars in thegalactic halo agree better with chemical evolution models including fastrotators. to test our predictions, challenging measurements of the 12c/13c inmore extremely metal-poor giants and turnoff stars are required.

1303.2393	populations of rotating stars ii. rapid rotators and their link to  be-type stars	even though it is broadly accepted that single be stars are rapidly rotatingstars surrounded by a flat rotating circumstellar disk, there is still a debateabout how fast these stars rotate and also about the mechanisms involved in theangular-momentum and mass input in the disk. we study the properties of starsthat rotate near their critical-rotation rate and investigate the properties ofthe disks formed by equatorial mass ejections. we used the most recent genevastellar evolutionary tracks for rapidly rotating stars that reach the criticallimit and used a simple model for the disk structure. we obtain that for a 9msun star at solar metallicity, the minimum average velocity during the mainsequence phase to reach the critical velocity is around 330 km/s, whereas itwould be 390 km/s at the metallicity of the small magellanic cloud (smc). redgiants or supergiants originating from very rapid rotators rotate six timesfaster and show n/c ratios three times higher than those originating fromslowly rotating stars. this difference becomes stronger at lower metallicity.it might therefore be very interesting to study the red giants in clusters thatshow a large number of be stars on the ms band. on the basis of our single-starmodels, we show that the observed be-star fraction with cluster age iscompatible with the existence of a temperature-dependent lower limit in thevelocity rate required for a star to become a be star. the mass, extension, anddiffusion time of the disks produced when the star is losing mass at thecritical velocity, obtained from simple parametrized expressions, are not toofar from those estimated for disks around be-type stars. at a givenmetallicity, the mass and the extension of the disk increase with the initialmass and with age on the ms phase. denser disks are expected in low-metallicityregions.

1306.5871	star formation with disc accretion and rotation i. stars between 2 and  22 msol at solar metallicity	the way angular momentum is built up in stars during their formation processmay have an impact on their further evolution. in the frame of the cold discaccretion scenario, we study for the first time how angular momentum builds upinside the star during its formation and what are the consequences for itsevolution on the main sequence (ms). computation begins from a hydrostatic coreon the hayashi line of 0.7 msol at solar metallicity (z=0.014) rotating as asolid body. accretion rates depending on the luminosity of the accreting objectare considered varying between 1.5e-5 and 1.7e-3 msol/yr. the accreted matteris assumed to have an angular velocity equal to that of the outer layer of theaccreting star. models are computed for a mass-range on the zero-age mainsequence (zams) between 2 and 22 msol. we study how the internal and surfacevelocities vary as a function of time during the accretion phase and theevolution towards the zams. stellar models, whose evolution has been followedalong the pre-ms phase, are found to exhibit a shallow gradient of angularvelocity on the zams. interestingly, for masses on the zams larger than 8 msol,there exists a maximum surface velocity that can be reached through the presentscenario of formation. typically, for 14 msol models, only stars with surfacevelocities on the zams lower than about 45% of the critical velocity can beformed. to reach higher velocities would require to start from cores rotatingabove the critical limit. we find that this upper velocity limit is smaller forhigher masses. in contrast, below 8 msol, there is no restriction and the wholedomain of velocities, up to the critical one, can be reached.

1306.6731	close binary evolution i. the tidally induced shear mixing in rotating  binaries	we study how tides in a binary system induce some specific internal shearmixing, able to substantially modify the evolution of close binaries prior tomass transfer. we construct numerical models accounting for tidal interactions,meridional circulation, transport of angular momentum, shears and horizontalturbulence and consider a variety of orbital periods and initial rotationvelocities. depending on orbital periods and rotation velocities, tidal effectsmay spin down (spin down case) or spin up (spin up case) the axial rotation. inboth cases, tides may induce a large internal differential rotation. theresulting tidally induced shear mixing (tism) is so efficient that the internaldistributions of angular velocity and chemical elements are greatly influenced.the evolutionary tracks are modified, and in both cases of spin down and spinup, large amounts of nitrogen can be transported to the stellar surfaces beforeany binary mass transfer. meridional circulation, when properly treated as anadvection, always tends to counteract the tidal interaction, tending to spin upthe surface when it is braked down and vice versa. as a consequence, the timesneeded for the axial angular velocity to become equal to the orbital angularvelocity may be larger than given by typical synchronization timescales. also,due to meridional circulation some differential rotation remains in tidallylocked binary systems.

1403.0809	on the effect of rotation on populations of classical cepheids i.  predictions at solar metallicity	[abridged] we aim to improve the understanding of cepheids from anevolutionary perspective and establish the role of rotation in the cepheidparadigm. in particular, we are interested in the contribution of rotation tothe problem of cepheid masses, and explore testable predictions of quantitiesthat can be confronted with observations. evolutionary models including ahomogeneous and self-consistent treatment of rotation are studied in detailduring the crossings of the classical instability strip (is). the dependence ofseveral parameters on initial rotation is studied. these parameters includemass, luminosity, temperature, lifetimes, equatorial velocity, surfaceabundances, and rates of period change. several key results are obtained: i)mass-luminosity (m-l) relations depend on rotation, particularly during theblue loop phase; ii) luminosity increases between crossings of the is. hence,cepheid m-l relations at fixed initial rotation rate depend on crossing number(faster rotation yields greater luminosity difference between crossings); iii)the cepheid mass discrepancy problem vanishes when rotation and crossing numberare taken into account, without a need for high core overshooting values orenhanced mass loss; iv) rotation creates dispersion around average parameterspredicted at fixed mass and metallicity. this is of particular importance forthe period-luminosity-relation, for which rotation is a source of intrinsicdispersion; v) enhanced surface abundances do not unambiguously distinguishcepheids occupying the hertzsprung gap from ones on blue loops (afterdredge-up), since rotational mixing can lead to significantly enhanced mainsequence (ms) abundances; vi) rotating models predict greater cepheid ages thannon-rotating models due to longer ms lifetimes. rotation has a significantevolutionary impact on classical cepheids and should no longer be neglected intheir study.

1408.5624	combining observational techniques to constrain convection in evolved  massive star models	recent stellar evolution computations indicate that massive stars in therange ~ 20 - 30 msun are located in the blue supergiant (bsg) region of thehertzsprung-russell diagram at two different stages of their life: immediatelyafter the main sequence (ms, group 1) and during a blueward evolution after thered supergiant phase (group 2). from the observation of the pulsationnalproperties of a subgroup of variable bsgs (alpha cyg variables), one can deducethat these stars belongs to group 2. it is however difficult to simultaneouslyfit the observed surface abundances and gravity for these stars, and thisallows to constrain the physical processes of chemical species transport inmassive stars. we will show here that the surface abundances are extremelysensitive to the physics of convection, particularly the location of theintermediate convective shell that appears at the ignition of the hydrogenshell burning after the ms. our results show that the use of the ledouxcriterion to determine the convective regions in the stellar models leads to abetter fit of the surface abundances for alpha cyg variables than theschwarzschild one.

1410.8721	the impact of mass-loss on the evolution and pre-supernova properties of  red supergiants	the post main-sequence evolution of massive stars is very sensitive to manyparameters of the stellar models. key parameters are the mixing processes, themetallicity, the mass-loss rate and the effect of a close companion. we studyhow the red supergiant lifetimes, the tracks in the hertzsprung-russel diagram(hrd), the positions in this diagram of the pre-supernova progenitor as well asthe structure of the stars at that time change for various mass-loss ratesduring the red supergiant phase (rsg), and for two different initial rotationvelocities. the surface abundances of rsgs are much more sensitive to rotationthan to the mass-loss rates during that phase. a change of the rsg mass-lossrate has a strong impact on the rsg lifetimes and therefore on the luminosityfunction of rsgs. at solar metallicity, the enhanced mass-loss rate models doproduce significant changes on the populations of blue, yellow and redsupergiants. when extended blue loops or blue ward excursions are produced byenhanced mass-loss, the models predict that a majority of blue (yellow)supergiants are post rsg objects. these post rsg stars are predicted to showmuch smaller surface rotational velocities than similar blue supergiants ontheir first crossing of the hr gap. the position in the hrd of the end point ofthe evolution depends on the mass of the hydrogen envelope. more precisely,whenever, at the pre-supernova stage, the h-rich envelope contains more thanabout 5\% of the initial mass, the star is a red supergiant, and whenever theh-rich envelope contains less than 1\% of the total mass the star is a bluesupergiant. for intermediate situations, intermediate colors/effectivetemperatures are obtained. yellow progenitors for core collapse supernovae canbe explained by the enhanced mass-loss rate models, while the red progenitorsare better fitted by the standard mass-loss rate models.

1508.06094	massive star evolution in close binaries:conditions for homogeneous  chemical evolution	we investigate the impact of tidal interactions, before any mass transfer, onvarious properties of the stellar models. we study the conditions for obtaininghomogeneous evolution triggered by tidal interactions, and for avoiding anyroche lobe overflow during the main-sequence phase. we consider the case ofrotating stars computed with a strong coupling mediated by an interior magneticfield. in models without any tidal interaction (single stars and widebinaries), homogeneous evolution in solid body rotating models is obtained whentwo conditions are realized: the initial rotation must be high enough, the lossof angular momentum by stellar winds should be modest. this last point favorsmetal-poor fast rotating stars. in models with tidal interactions, homogeneousevolution is obtained when rotation imposed by synchronization is high enough(typically a time-averaged surface velocities during the main-sequence phaseabove 250 km s$^{-1}$), whatever the mass losses. in close binaries, mixing isstronger at higher than at lower metallicities. homogeneous evolution is thusfavored at higher metallicities. roche lobe overflow avoidance is favored atlower metallicities due to the fact that stars with less metals remain morecompact. we study also the impact of different processes for the angularmomentum transport on the surface abundances and velocities in single and closebinaries. in models where strong internal coupling is assumed, strong surfaceenrichments are always associated to high surface velocities in binary orsingle star models. in contrast, models computed with mild coupling may producestrong surface enrichments associated to low surface velocities. close binarymodels may be of interest for explaining homogeneous massive stars, fastrotating wolf-rayet stars, and progenitors of long soft gamma ray bursts, evenat high metallicities.

0807.0573	effects of rotation on the evolution of primordial stars	(abridged) rotation has been shown to play a determinant role at very lowmetallicity, bringing heavy mass loss where almost none was expected. is thisstill true when the metallicity strictly equals zero? the aim of our study isto get an answer to this question, and to determine how rotation changes theevolution and the chemical signature of the primordial stars. we havecalculated 14 differentially-rotating and non-rotating stellar models at zerometallicity, with masses between 9 and 200 msol. the evolution has beenfollowed up to the pre-supernova stage. we find that z=0 models rotate with aninternal profile omega(r) close to local angular momentum conservation, becauseof a very weak core-envelope coupling. rotational mixing drives a h-shell boostdue to a sudden onset of cno cycle in the shell. this boost leads to a high 14nproduction. generally, the rotating models produce much more metals than theirnon-rotating counterparts. the mass loss is very low, even for the models thatreach the critical velocity during the main sequence. due to the low mass lossand the weak coupling, the core retains a high angular momentum at the end ofthe evolution. the high rotation rate at death probably leads to a muchstronger explosion than previously expected, changing the fate of the models.the inclusion of our yields in a chemical evolution model of the galactic halopredicts log values of n/o, c/o and 12c/13c ratios of -2.2, -0.95 and 50respectively at log o/h +12 = 4.2.

0807.5050	powerful explosions at z=0 ?	metal-free stars are assumed to evolve at constant mass because of the verylow stellar winds. this leads to large co-core mass at the end of theevolution, so primordial stars with an initial mass between 25 and 85 msol areexpected to end as direct black holes, the explosion energy being too weak toremove the full envelope.  we show that when rotation enters into play, some mass is lost because thestars are prone to reach the critical velocity during the main sequenceevolution. contrarily to what happens in the case of very low- but nonzero-metallicity stars, the enrichment of the envelope by rotational mixing isvery small and the total mass lost remains modest. the compactness of theprimordial stars lead to a very inefficient transport of the angular momentuminside the star, so the profile of omega(r) is close to omega r^2 = const. asthe core contracts, the rotation rate increases, and the star ends its lifewith a fast spinning core. such a configuration has been shown to modifysubstantially the dynamics of the explosion. where one expected a weakexplosion or none at all, rotation might boost the explosion energy and drive arobust supernova. this will have important consequences in the way primordialstars enriched the early universe.

astro-ph;0001170	synthesis of 19f in wolf-rayet stars	meynet and arnould (1993) have suggested that wolf-rayet (wr) stars couldsignificantly contaminate the galaxy with 19f. in their scenario, 19f issynthesized at the beginning of the he-burning phase from the 14n left over bythe previous cno-burning core, and is ejected in the interstellar medium whenthe star enters its wc phase. recourse to cno seeds makes the 19f yieldsmetallicity-dependent. these yields are calculated on grounds of detailedstellar evolutionary sequences for an extended range of initial masses (from 25to 120 msol) and metallicities (z = 0.008, 0.02 and 0.04). the adopted massloss rate prescription enables to account for the observed variations of wrpopulations in different environments. the 19f abundance in the wr winds of 60msol model stars is found to be about 10 to 70 times higher than its initialvalue, depending on the metallicity. this prediction is used in conjunctionwith a very simple model for the chemical evolution of the galaxy to predictthat wr stars could be significant (dominant?) contributors to the solar systemfluorine content. we also briefly discuss the implications of our model on thepossible detection of fluorine at high redshift.

astro-ph;0104074	the cygnus x region: a nucleosynthesis laboratory for integral	the detection of 1.809 mev gamma-ray line emission from the cygnus x complexby the comptel telescope is one of the most convincing proves of massive starnucleosynthesis in our galaxy. the cygnus x complex is an extremely activenearby region, containing several star forming regions, ob associations andyoung open star clusters. it houses some of the most massive stars known in ourgalaxy and concentrates a large number of wolf-rayet stars. thermal radiocontinuum emission and intense [c ii] line emission reveals widespreadionisation, and at least 60 individual h ii regions have been identified. inorder to understand the 1.809 mev gamma-ray line emission from the cygnus xcomplex, and to compare the observations to theoretical nucleosynthesiscalculations, we modelled the multi-wavelength spectrum of the region by meansof an evolutionary synthesis model. our investigation leads us to the followingconclusions: 1. stellar wind ejection is the dominant mechanism for theobserved 26al enrichment in the cygnus x region. 2. cyg ob2 is by far thedominating massive star association in cygnus x and 1.809 mev line emissionfrom 26al produced in this association should be detectable by the spectrometerspi on integral. 3. there is only low supernova activity in the cygnus xcomplex and the 60fe lines should be below integral's detection sensitivity.the detectability of an individual massive star cluster (cyg ob2) by integralprovides a fantastic opportunity for future nucleosynthesis studies usinggamma-ray line spectroscopy. we will explore the scientific potential of suchobservations, and provide estimates for gamma-ray line intensity distributionsbased on the massive star census of the cygnus x region.

astro-ph;0105051	stellar evolution with rotation vii: low metallicity models and the blue  to red supergiant ratio in the smc	we calculate a grid of models with and without the effects of axial rotationfor massive stars in the range of 9 to 60 m$_{\odot}$ and metallicity $z$ =0.004 appropriate for the smc. remarkably, the ratios$\omega/\omega_{\mathrm{crit}}$ of the angular velocity to the break-up angularvelocity grow strongly during the evolution of high mass stars, contrary to thesituation at $z$ = 0.020. the reason is that at low $z$, mass loss is smallerand the removal of angular momentum during evolution much weaker, also there isan efficient outward transport of angular momentum by meridional circulation.thus, a much larger fraction of the stars at lower $z$ reach break-upvelocities and rotation may thus be a dominant effect at low $z$. the modelswith rotation well account for the long standing problem of the large numbersof red supergiants observed in low $z$ galaxies, while current models with massloss were predicting no red supergiants. we discuss in detail the physicaleffects of rotation which favour a redwards evolution in the hr diagram. themodels also predict large n enrichments during the evolution of high massstars. the predicted relative n-enrichments are larger at $z$ lower than solarand this is in very good agreement with the observations for a-type supergiantsin the smc.

astro-ph;0304069	stellar evolution with rotation x: wolf-rayet star populations at solar  metallicity	we examine the properties of wolf--rayet (wr) stars predicted by models ofrotating stars taking account of the new mass loss rates for o--type stars andwr stars (vink et al. \cite{vink00}, \cite{vink01}; nugis &amp; lamers\cite{nula00}) and of the wind anisotropies induced by rotation. we find thatthe rotation velocities $v$ of wr stars are modest, i.e. about 50 km s$^{-1}$,not very dependant on the initial $v$ and masses. for the most massive stars,the evolution of $v$ is very strongly influenced by the values of the mass lossrates; below $\sim$12 m$_\odot$ the evolution of rotation during the ms phaseand later phases is dominated by the internal coupling. massive stars withextreme rotation may skip the lbv phase.  models having a typical $v$ for the o--type stars have wr lifetimes on theaverage two times longer than for non--rotating models. the increase of the wrlifetimes is mainly due to that of the h--rich ewnl phase. rotation allows atransition wn/wc phase to be present for initial masses lower than 60m$_\odot$. the durations of the other wr subphases are less affected byrotation. the mass threshold for forming wr stars is lowered from 37 to 22m$_\odot$ for typical rotation. the comparisons of the predicted number ratioswr/o, wn/wc and of the number of transition wn/wc stars show very goodagreement with models with rotation, while this is not the case for models withthe present--day mass loss rates and no rotation. as to the chemical abundancesin wr stars, rotation brings only very small changes for wn stars, since theyhave equilibrium cno values. however, wc stars with rotation have on averagelower c/he and o/he ratios. the luminosity distribution of wc stars is alsoinfluenced by rotation.

astro-ph;0406552	stellar evolution with rotation xii: pre-supernova models	we describe the latest developments of the geneva stellar evolution code inorder to model the pre-supernova evolution of rotating massive stars. rotatingand non-rotating stellar models at solar metallicity with masses equal to 12,15, 20, 25, 40 and 60 solar masses were computed from the zams until the end ofthe core silicon burning phase. we took into account meridional circulation,secular shear instabilities, horizontal turbulence and dynamical shearinstabilities.  most of the differences between the pre-supernova structures obtained fromrotating and non-rotating stellar models have their origin in the effects ofrotation during the core hydrogen and helium burning phases.  the effects of rotation on pre-supernova models are significant between 15and 30 solar masses. indeed, rotation increases the core sizes (and the yields)by a factor ~ 1.5. above 20 solar masses, rotation may change the colour of thesupernova progenitors (blue instead of red supergiant) and the supernova type(ib instead of ii). rotation affects the lower mass limits for radiative corecarbon burning, for iron core collapse and for black hole formation. forwolf-rayet stars (m &gt; 30 solar masses), the pre-supernova structures are mostlyaffected by the intensities of the stellar winds and less by rotational mixing.finally, the core of our rotating wr stars contain enough angular momentum toproduce grbs.

astro-ph;0609410	the impact of stellar rotation on the cno abundance patterns in the  milky way at low metallicities	we investigate the effect of new stellar models, which take rotation intoaccount, computed for very low metallicities on the chemical evolution of theearliest phases of the milky way. we check the impact of these new stellaryields on a model for the halo of the milky way that can reproduce the observedhalo metallicity distribution. in this way we try to better constrain the ismenrichment timescale, which was not done in our previous work. the stellarmodels adopted in this work were computed under the assumption that the ratioof the initial rotation velocity to the critical velocity of stars is roughlyconstant with metallicity. this naturally leads to faster rotation at lowermetallicity, as metal poor stars are more compact than metal rich ones. we findthat the new z = 10-8 stellar yields computed for large rotational velocitieshave a tremendous impact on the interstellar medium nitrogen enrichment forlog(o/h)+12 &lt; 7 (or [fe/h]&lt; -3). we show that upon the inclusion of the newstellar calculations in a chemical evolution model for the galactic halo withinfall and outflow, both high n/o and c/o ratios are obtained in the very-metalpoor metallicity range in agreement with observations. our results give furthersupport to the idea that stars at very low metallicities could have initialrotational velocities of the order of 600-800kms-1. an important contributionto n from agb stars is still needed in order to explain the observations atintermediate metallicities. one possibility is that agb stars at very lowmetallicities also rotate fast. this could be tested in the future, oncestellar evolution models for fast rotating agb stars will be available.

astro-ph;0610741	evolution of the first stellar generations	although the theoretical study of very low metallicity (z) and metal-freestars is not new, their importance has recently greatly increased since tworelated fields have been developing rapidly. the first is cosmologicalsimulations of the formation of the first stars and of the reionisation period.the second is the observations of extremely metal poor stars. in this paper, wepresent pre-supernova evolution models of massive rotating stars at very low z(z=1e-8) and at z=0. rotation has a strong impact on mass loss andnucleosynthesis. models reaching break-up velocities lose up to ten percents oftheir initial mass. in very low z models, rotational and convective mixingenhances significantly the surface content in carbon, nitrogen and oxygen (cno)when the star becomes a red supergiant. this induces a strong mass loss forstars more massive than about 60 solar masses. our models predict type ib,csupernovae and gamma-ray bursts at very low z. rotational mixing also induces alarge production of cno elements, in particular of primary nitrogen. thestellar wind chemical composition is compatible with the most metal-poor starknow to date, he 1327-2326, for cno elements. our models reproduce the earlyevolution of nitrogen in the milky way.

astro-ph;0611379	fast rotating massive stars and the origin of the abundance patterns in  galactic globular clusters	we propose the wind of fast rotating massive stars scenario to explain theorigin of the abundance anomalies observed in globular clusters. we compute andpresent models of fast rotating stars with initial masses between 20 and 120msun for an initial metallicity z=0.0005 ([fe/h]=-1.5). we discuss thenucleosynthesis in the h-burning core of these objects and present the chemicalcomposition of their ejecta. we consider the impact of uncertainties in therelevant nuclear reaction rates. fast rotating stars reach the criticalvelocity at the beginning of their evolution and remain near the critical limitduring the rest of the main sequence and part of the he-burning phase. as aconsequence they lose large amounts of material through a mechanical wind whichprobably leads to the formation of a slow outflowing disk. the material in thisslow wind is enriched in h-burning products and presents abundance patternssimilar to the chemical anomalies observed in globular cluster stars. inparticular, the c, n, o, na and li variations are well reproduced by our model.however the rate of the 24mg(p,gamma) has to be increased by a factor 1000around 50 mk in order to reproduce the whole amplitude of the observed mg-alanticorrelation. we discuss how the long-lived low-mass stars currentlyobserved in globular clusters could have formed out of the slow wind materialejected by massive stars.

astro-ph;9804155	on some properties of very metal-rich stars	an analysis of some properties of stellar models as a function of metallicityz (and helium content y) is presented, with special attention to those starswith metallicities higher than twice or three times solar. it is shown that thestellar properties as a function of z are mainly determined by the effects ofthe opacities at sub-solar metallicities, and by the effects of the meanmolecular weight and stellar mass loss at higher metallicities. as a result,very metal-rich stars (z &gt;~0.05) exhibit properties that deviate from what isexpected from the known characteristics at lower metallicities.  in particular, they are more luminous and hotter than those at z &lt;~ 0.05 dueto the effect of the mean molecular weight. they have main sequence lifetimesmuch shorter (60 % shorter at z=0.1 than at z=0.02) than those at solarmetallicity due to their lower initial hydrogen content. finally, the high massloss rates at high metallicities affect significantly the population synthesisof massive stars in very metal-rich regions. an analysis of expected wolf-rayetand supernovae populations in such conditions is briefly presented.

astro-ph;9807088	the pulsating yellow supergiant v810 centauri	the f8ia supergiant v810 centauri is part of a long-term high-precisionphotometric monitoring program on long period variables started twenty yearsago. time series analysis of this unique set of 500 data points, spanningalmost fifteen years in the homogeneous geneva photometric system, ispresented. cluster membership, physical parameters and evolutionary status ofthe star are reinvestigated. radial velocity data do not support the clustermembership to stock 14}. ultraviolet and optical spectrophotometry is combinedwith optical and infrared photometry to evaluate the physical parameters of theyellow supergiant (teff = 5970 k, m_bol = -8.5, r = 420 r_sun) and of its b0iiicompanion. from theoretical stellar evolutionary tracks, an initial mass of 25m_sun is estimated for v810 cen, which is actually at the end of its firstredward evolution.  v810 cen is a multi-periodic small amplitude variable star, whose amplitudesare variable with time. the period of the main mode, 156 d, is in agreementwith the period--luminosity--colour relation for supergiants. this mode is mostprobably the fundamental radial one. according to the theoretical pulsationperiods for the radial modes, calculated from a linear non-adiabatic analysis,the period of the observed second mode, 107 d, is much too long to correspondto the first radial overtone . thus, this second mode could be a non-radialp-mode. other transient periods are observed, in particular at 187 d. the length of this period suggests a non-radial g-mode. then, the complexvariability of v810 cen could be due to a mixing of unstable radial andnon-radial p- and g-modes.

astro-ph;9902211	no increase of the red-giant-branch tip luminosity toward the center of  m31	we present observations with the hubble space telescope wide field planetarycamera 2 of three fields centered on super-metal-rich globular clusters in thebulge of m31. our (i,v-i) color-magnitude diagrams reach as faint as i ~ 26.5mag and clearly reveal the magnitude of the first ascent red giant branch (rgb)tip. we find that the apparent i magnitude of the rgb tip does not becomebrighter near the center of m31 as concluded by previous investigators. ourobservations and artificial star experiments presented in this study stronglysupport the idea that previous very bright stars were likely the result ofspurious detections of blended stars due to crowding in lower resolutionimages. on the contrary, our observations indicate that, at a mean projectedgalactocentric distance of 1.1 kpc, the rgb tip is some 1.3 magnitudes fainterthan it is at 7 kpc. an analysis of this difference in rgb tip magnitudesuggests that the m31 bulge stellar population has a mean metallicity close tothat of the sun.

0810.0182	the s process in massive stars at low metallicity. effect of primary n14  from fast rotating stars	the goal of this paper is to analyze the impact of a primary neutron sourceon the s-process nucleosynthesis in massive stars at halo metallicity. recentstellar models including rotation at very low metallicity predict a strongproduction of primary n14. part of the nitrogen produced in the h-burning shelldiffuses by rotational mixing into the he core where it is converted to ne22providing additional neutrons for the s process. we present nucleosynthesiscalculations for a 25 msun star at [fe/h] = -3, -4, where in the convectivecore he-burning about 0.8 % in mass is made of primary ne22. the usual weaks-process shape is changed by the additional neutron source with a peak betweensr and ba, where the s-process yields increase by orders of magnitude withrespect to the yields obtained without rotation. iron seeds are fully consumedand the maximum production of sr, y and zr is reached. on the other hand, thes-process efficiency beyond sr and the ratio sr/ba are strongly affected by theamount of ne22 and by nuclear uncertainties, first of all by thene22(alpha,n)mg25 reaction. finally, assuming that ne22 is primary in theconsidered metallicity range, the s-process efficiency decreases withmetallicity due to the effect of the major neutron poisons mg25 and ne22. thiswork represents a first step towards the study of primary neutron source effectin fast rotating massive stars, and its implications are discussed in the lightof spectroscopic observations of heavy elements at halo metallicity.

0812.2912	the ages of galactic globular clusters in the context of self-enrichment	a significant fraction of stars in globular clusters (about 70%-85%) exhibitpeculiar chemical patterns with strong abundance variations in light elementsalong with constant abundances in heavy elements. these abundance anomalies canbe created in the h-burning core of a first generation of fast rotating massivestars and the corresponding elements are convoyed to the stellar surface thanksto rotational induced mixing. if the rotation of the stars is fast enough thismatter is ejected at low velocity through a mechanical wind at the equator. itthen pollutes the ism from which a second generation of chemically anomalousstars can be formed. the proportion of anomalous to normal star observed todaydepends on at least two quantities : (1) the number of polluter stars; (2) thedynamical history of the cluster which may lose during its lifetime first andsecond generation stars in different proportions. here we estimate theseproportions based on dynamical models for globular clusters. when internaldynamical evolution and dissolution due to tidal forces are accounted for,starting from an initial fraction of anomalous stars of 10% produces a presentday fraction of about 25%, still too small with respect to the observed 70-85%.in case gas expulsion by supernovae is accounted for, much higher fraction isexpected to be produced. in this paper we also address the question of theevolution of the second generation stars that are he-rich, and deduceconsequences for the age determination of globular clusters.
