0905.2443	12 new galactic wolf-rayet stars identified via 2mass+spitzer/glimpse	we report new results from our effort to identify obscured wolf-rayet starsin the galaxy. candidates were selected by their near-infrared (2mass) andmid-infrared (spitzer/glimpse) color excesses, which are consistent withfree-free emission from ionized stellar winds and thermal excess from hot dust.we have confirmed 12 new wolf-rayet stars in the galactic disk, including 9 ofthe nitrogen subtype (wn), and 3 of the carbon subtype (wc); this raises thetotal number of wolf-rayet stars discovered with our approach to 27. weclassify one of the new stars as a possible dust-producing wc9d+obicolliding-wind binary, as evidenced by an infrared excess resembling that ofknown wc9d stars, the detection of obi features superimposed on the wc9spectrum, and hard x-ray emission detected by xmm-newton. a wc8 star in oursample appears to be a member of the stellar cluster danks 1, in contrast tothe rest of the confirmed wolf-rayet stars that generally do not appear toreside within dense stellar clusters. either the majority of the stars arerunaways from clusters, or they formed in relative isolation. we brieflydiscuss prospects for the expansion and improvement of the search forwolf-rayet stars throughout the milky way galaxy.

0708.1026	the radio evolution of sn 2001gd	we present the results of observations of the radio emission from supernova2001gd in ngc 5033 from 2002 february 8 through 2006 september 25. the datawere obtained using the very large array at wavelengths of 1.3 cm (22.4 ghz), 2cm (14.9 ghz), 3.6 cm (8.4 ghz), 6 cm (4.9 ghz), and 20 cm (1.5 ghz), with oneupper limit at 90 cm (0.3 ghz). in addition, one detection has been provided bythe giant metrewave radio telescope at 21 cm (1.4 ghz). sn 2001gd wasdiscovered in the optical well past maximum light, so that it was not possibleto obtain many of the early radio "turn-on" measurements which are importantfor estimating the local circumstellar medium (csm) properties. only at 20 cmwere turn-on data available. however, our analysis and fitting of the radiolight curves, and the assumption that the type iib sn 2001gd resembles the muchbetter studied type iib sn 1993j, enables us to describe the radio evolution asbeing very regular through day ~550 and consistent with a nonthermal-emittingmodel with a thermal absorbing csm. the presence of synchrotron-self absorption(ssa) at early times is implied by the data, but determination of the exactrelationship between the ssa component from the emitting region and thefree-free absorption component from the csm is not possible as there areinsufficient early measurements to distinguish between models. after day ~550,the radio emission exhibits a dramatically steeper decline rate which, assumingsimilarity to sn 1993j, can be described as an exponential decrease with ane-folding time of 500 days. we interpret this abrupt change in the radio fluxdensity decline rate as implying a transition of the shock front into a moretenuous region of circumstellar material. a similar change in radio evolutionhas been seen earlier in other sne such as sn 1988z, sn 1980k, and sn 1993j.

1011.4150	a massive progenitor of the luminous type iin supernova 2010jl	the bright, nearby, recently discovered supernova sn2010jl is a member of therare class of relatively luminous type~iin events. here we report archival hstobservations of its host galaxy ugc5189a taken roughly 10yr prior to explosion,as well as early-time optical spectra of the sn. the hst images reveal abright, blue point source at the position of the sn, with an absolute magnitudeof -12.0 in the f300w filter. if it is not just a chance alignment, the sourceat the sn position could be (1) a massive young (less than 6 myr) star clusterin which the sn resided, (2) a quiescent, luminous blue star with an apparenttemperature around 14,000k, (3) a star caught during a bright outburst akin tothose of lbvs, or (4) a combination of option 1 and options 2 or 3. although wecannot confidently choose between these possibilities with the present data,any of them imply that the progenitor of sn2010jl had an initial mass above30msun. this reinforces mounting evidence that many sne iin result from verymassive stars, that massive stars can produce visible sne without collapsingquietly to black holes, and that massive stars can retain their h envelopesuntil shortly before explosion. standard stellar evolution models fail toaccount for these observed properties.

1011.5873	supernova 2008bk and its red supergiant progenitor	we have obtained limited photometric and spectroscopic data for supernova(sn) 2008bk in ngc 7793, primarily at &gt;~ 150 d after explosion. we find that itis a type ii-plateau (ii-p) sn which most closely resembles the low-luminositysn 1999br in ngc 4900. given the overall similarity between the observed lightcurves and colors of sne 2008bk and 1999br, we infer that the total visualextinction to sn 2008bk (a_v=0.065 mag) must be almost entirely due to thegalactic foreground, similar to what has been assumed for sn 1999br. we confirmthe identification of the putative red supergiant (rsg) progenitor star of thesn in high-quality g'r'i' images we had obtained in 2007 at the gemini-south 8m telescope. little ambiguity exists in this progenitor identification,qualifying it as the best example to date, next to the identification of thestar sk -69 202 as the progenitor of sn 1987a. from a combination of photometryof the gemini images with that of archival, pre-sn, very large telescope jhk_simages, we derive an accurate observed spectral energy distribution (sed) forthe progenitor. we find from nebular strong-intensity emission-line indices forseveral hii regions near the sn that the metallicity in the environment islikely subsolar (z~0.6 z_sun). the observed sed of the star agrees quite wellwith synthetic seds obtained from model red supergiant atmospheres witheffective temperature t_eff=3600+/-50 k. we find, therefore, that the star hada bolometric luminosity with respect to the sun of log(l_bol/l_sun)=4.57+/-0.06and radius r_star=496+/-34 r_sun at ~6 months prior to explosion. comparing theprogenitor's properties with theoretical massive-star evolutionary models, weconclude that the rsg progenitor had an initial mass in the range of 8--8.5m_sun.

0709.1136	long term radio monitoring of sn 1993j	we present our observations of the radio emission from supernova (sn) 1993j,in m 81 (ngc 3031), made with the vla, from 90 to 0.7 cm, as well as numerousmeasurements from other telescopes. the combined data set constitutes probablythe most detailed set of measurements ever established for any sn outside ofthe local group in any wavelength range. only sn 1987a in the lmc has been thesubject of such an intensive observational program. the radio emission evolvesregularly in both time and frequency, and the usual interpretation in terms ofshock interaction with a circumstellar medium (csm) formed by a pre-sn stellarwind describes the observations rather well considering the complexity of thephenomenon. however: 1) the 85 - 110 ghz measurements at early times are notwell fitted by the parameterization, unlike the cm wavelength measurements. 2)at mid-cm wavelengths there is some deviation from the fitted radio lightcurves. 3) at a time ~3100 days after shock breakout, the decline rate of theradio emission steepens without change in the spectral index. this decline isbest described as an exponential decay starting at day 3100 with an e-foldingtime of ~1100 days. 4) the best overall fit to all of the data is a modelincluding both non-thermal synchrotron self-absorption (ssa) and a thermalfree-free absorbing (ffa) components at early times, evolving to a constantspectral index, optically thin decline rate, until the break in that declinerate. moreover, neither a purely ssa nor a purely ffa absorbing models canprovide a fit that simultaneously reproduces the light curves, the spectralindex evolution, and the brightness temperature evolution. 5) the radio andx-ray light curves exhibit similar behavior and suggest a sudden drop in the snprogenitor mass-loss rate at ~8000 years prior to shock breakout.

1105.4117	the formation of kiloparsec-scale hi holes in dwarf galaxies	the origin of kpc-scale holes in the atomic hydrogen (h i) distributions ofsome nearby dwarf irregular galaxies presents an intriguing problem. starformation histories (sfhs) derived from resolved stars give us the uniqueopportunity to study past star forming events that may have helped shape thecurrently visible h i distribution. our sample of five nearby dwarf irregulargalaxies spans over an order of magnitude in both total h i mass and absoluteb-band magnitude and is at the low mass end of previously studied systems. weuse very large array h i line data to estimate the energy required to createthe centrally dominant hole in each galaxy. we compare this energy estimate tothe past energy released by the underlying stellar populations computed fromsfhs derived from data taken with the hubble space telescope. the inferredintegrated stellar energy released within the characteristic ages exceeds ourenergy estimates for creating the holes in all cases, assuming expectedefficiencies. therefore, it appears that stellar feedback provides sufficientenergy to produce the observed holes. however, we find no obvious signature ofsingle star forming events responsible for the observed structures whencomparing the global sfhs of each galaxy in our sample to each other or tothose of dwarf irregular galaxies reported in the literature. we also fail tofind evidence of a central star cluster in fuv or halpha imaging. we concludethat large h i holes are likely formed from multiple generations of starformation and only under suitable interstellar medium conditions.

1106.2897	the progenitor of supernova 2011dh/ptf11eon in messier 51	we have identified a luminous star at the position of supernova (sn)2011dh/ptf11eon, in pre-sn archival, multi-band images of the nearby, nearlyface-on galaxy messier 51 (m51) obtained by the hubble space telescope with theadvanced camera for surveys. this identification has been confirmed, to thehighest available astrometric precision, using a keck-ii adaptive-optics image.the available early-time spectra and photometry indicate that the sn is astripped-envelope, core-collapse type iib, with a more compact progenitor(radius ~1e11 cm) than was the case for the well-studied sn iib 1993j. we inferthat the extinction to sn 2011dh and its progenitor arises from a low galacticforeground contribution, and that the sn environment is of roughly solarmetallicity. the detected object has absolute magnitude m_v^0 ~ -7.7 andeffective temperature ~6000 k. the star's radius, ~1e13 cm, is more extendedthan what has been inferred for the sn progenitor. we speculate that thedetected star is either an unrelated star very near the position of the actualprogenitor, or, more likely, the progenitor's companion in a mass-transferbinary system. the position of the detected star in a hertzsprung-russelldiagram is consistent with an initial mass of 17--19 msun. the light of thisstar could easily conceal, even in the ultraviolet, the presence of a stripped,compact, very hot (~1e5 k), nitrogen-rich wolf-rayet star progenitor.

1312.3984	the type iib supernova 2013df and its cool supergiant progenitor	we have obtained early-time photometry and spectroscopy of supernova (sn)2013df in ngc 4414. the sn is clearly of type iib, with notable similarities tosn 1993j. from its luminosity at secondary maximum light, it appears that less$^{56}$ni ($\lesssim 0.06\ m_{\odot}$) was synthesized in the sn 2013dfexplosion than was the case for the sne iib 1993j, 2008ax, and 2011dh. based ona comparison of the light curves, the sn 2013df progenitor must have been moreextended in radius prior to explosion than the progenitor of sn 1993j. thetotal extinction for sn 2013df is estimated to be $a_v=0.30$ mag. themetallicity at the sn location is likely to be solar. we have conducted hubblespace telescope (hst) target of opportunity observations of the sn with thewide field camera 3, and from a precise comparison of these new observations toarchival hst observations of the host galaxy obtained 14 years prior toexplosion, we have identified the progenitor of sn 2013df to be a yellowsupergiant, somewhat hotter than a red supergiant progenitor for a normal typeii-plateau sn. from its observed spectral energy distribution, assuming thatthe light is dominated by one star, the progenitor had effective temperature$t_{\rm eff} = 4250 \pm 100$ k and a bolometric luminosity $l_{\rmbol}=10^{4.94 \pm 0.06}\ l_{\odot}$. this leads to an effective radius $r_{\rmeff} = 545 \pm 65\ r_{\odot}$. the star likely had an initial mass in the rangeof 13 to 17 $m_{\odot}$; however, if it was a member of an interacting binarysystem, detailed modeling of the system is required to estimate this mass moreaccurately. the progenitor star of sn 2013df appears to have been relativelysimilar to the progenitor of sn 1993j.

1407.4681	sn hunt 248: a super-eddington outburst from a massive cool hypergiant	we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of sn hunt 248, a newsupernova (sn) impostor in ngc 5806, which began a multi-stage outburst in 2014may. the initial '2014a' discovery brightening exhibited an absolute magnitudeof m~-12 and the spectral characteristics of a cool dense outflow, includingp-cygni lines of fe ii, h i, na i, and strong line blanketing from metals. thesource rapidly climbed and peaked near m~-15 mag after two additional weeks.during this bright '2014b' phase the spectrum became dominated by balmeremission and a stronger blue continuum, similar to the sn impostor sn 1997bs.archival images from the hubble space telescope between 1997 and 2005 reveal aluminous (4e5 lsun) variable precursor star. its location on thehertzsprung-russell diagram is consistent with a massive (m_init~30 msun) coolhypergiant having an extremely dense wind and an eddington ratio just belowunity. at the onset of the recent 2014a brightening, however, the object becamesuper-eddington. the subsequent boost in luminosity during the 2014b phaseprobably resulted from circumstellar interaction. sn hunt 248 provides thefirst case of a cool hypergiant undergoing a giant eruption reminiscent ofoutbursts from luminous blue variable (lbv) stars. this lends support to thehypothesis that some cool hypergiants, such as rho cas, could be lbvsmasquerading under a pseudo-photosphere created by their extremely dense winds.moreover, sn hunt 248 demonstrates that eruptions stemming from such stars canrival in peak luminosity the giant outbursts of much more massive systems likeeta car.

1502.01794	multiwavelength observations of nast1 (wr 122): equatorial mass loss and  x-rays from an interacting wolf-rayet binary	nast1 (aka wolf-rayet 122) is a peculiar emission-line star embedded in anextended nebula of [n ii] emission with a compact dusty core. this object wascharacterized by crowther &amp; smith (1999) as a wolf-rayet (wr) star cloaked inan opaque nebula of cno-processed material, perhaps analogous to eta car andits homunculus nebula, albeit with a hotter central source. to discern themorphology of the [n ii] nebula we performed narrowband imaging using thehubble space telescope and wide-field camera 3. the images reveal that thenebula has a disk-like geometry tilted 12 degrees from edge-on, composed of abright central ellipsoid surrounded by a larger clumpy ring. ground-basedspectroscopy reveals radial velocity structure (~10 km/s) near the outerportions of the nebula's major axis, which is likely to be the imprint ofoutflowing gas. near-infrared adaptive-optics imaging with magellan ao hasresolved a compact ellipsoid of ks-band emission aligned with the larger [n ii]nebula, which we suspect is the result of scattered he i line emission (2.06um). observations with the chandra x-ray observatory have revealed an x-raypoint source at the core of the nebula that is heavily absorbed at energies &lt;1kev and has properties consistent with wr stars and colliding-wind binaries. wesuggest that nast1 is a wr binary embedded in an equatorial outflow that formedas the result of non-conservative mass transfer. nast1 thus appears to be arare and important example of a stripped-envelope wr forming through binaryinteraction, caught in the brief roche-lobe overflow phase.

1509.06407	what powers the 3000-day light curve of sn 2006gy?	sn 2006gy was the most luminous sn ever observed at the time of its discoveryand the first of the newly defined class of superluminous supernovae (slsne).the extraordinary energetics of sn 2006gy and all slsne (&gt;10^51 erg) requireeither atypically large explosion energies (e.g., pair-instability explosion)or the efficient conversion of kinetic into radiative energy (e.g., shockinteraction). the mass-loss characteristics can therefore offer important cluesregarding the progenitor system. for the case of sn 2006gy, both a scatteredand thermal light echo from circumstellar material (csm) have been reported atlater epochs (day ~800), ruling out the likelihood of a pair-instability eventand leading to constraints on the characteristics of the csm. owing to theproximity of the sn to the bright host-galaxy nucleus, continued monitoring ofthe light echo has not been trivial, requiring the high resolution offered bythe hubble space telescope (hst) or ground-based adaptive optics (ao). here wereport detections of sn 2006gy using hst and keck ao at ~3000 dayspost-explosion and consider the emission mechanism for the very late-time lightcurve. while the optical light curve and optical spectral energy distributionare consistent with a continued scattered-light echo, a thermal echo isinsufficient to power the k'-band emission by day 3000. instead, we presentevidence for late-time infrared emission from dust that is radiatively heatedby csm interaction within an extremely dense dust shell, and we consider theimplications on the csm characteristics and progenitor system.

1510.08070	an excess of mid-infrared emission from the type iax sn 2014dt	supernovae type iax (sne iax) are less energetic and less luminous thantypical thermonuclear explosions. a suggested explanation for the observedcharacteristics of this subclass is a binary progenitor system consisting of aco white dwarf primary accreting from a helium star companion. asingle-degenerate explosion channel might be expected to result in a densecircumstellar medium (csm), although no evidence for such a csm has yet beenobserved for this subclass. here we present recent spitzer observations of thesn iax 2014dt obtained by the spirits program nearly one year post-explosionthat reveal a strong mid-ir excess over the expected fluxes of more normal sneia. this excess is consistent with 1e-5 m_solar of newly formed dust, whichwould be the first time that newly formed dust has been observed to form in anormal type ia. the excess, however, is also consistent with a dusty csm thatwas likely formed in pre-explosion mass-loss, thereby suggesting a singledegenerate progenitor system. compared to other sne ia that show significantshock interaction (sne ia-csm) and interacting core-collapse events (sne iin),this dust shell in sn 2014dt is less massive. we consider the implications thatsuch a pre-existing dust shell has for the progenitor system, including abinary system with a mass donor that is a red giant, a red supergiant, and anasymptotic giant branch star.

1601.00002	constraints on the binary companion to the sn ic 1994i progenitor	core-collapse supernovae (sne), marking the deaths of massive stars, areamong the most powerful explosions in the universe, responsible, e.g., for apredominant synthesis of chemical elements in their host galaxies. the majorityof massive stars are thought to be born in close binary systems. to date,putative binary companions to the progenitors of sne may have been detected inonly two cases, sne 1993j and 2011dh. we report on the search for a companionof the progenitor of the type ic sn 1994i, long considered to have been theresult of binary interaction. twenty years after explosion, we used the hubblespace telescope to observe the sn site in the ultraviolet (f275w and f336wbands), resulting in deep upper limits on the expected companion: f275w &gt; 26.1mag and f336w &gt; 24.7 mag. these allows us to exclude the presence of a mainsequence companion with a mass &gt;~ 10 msun. through comparison with theoreticalsimulations of possible progenitor populations, we show that the upper limitsto a companion detection exclude interacting binaries with semi-conservative(late case a or early case b) mass transfer. the limits tend to favor systemswith non-conservative, late case b mass transfer with intermediate initialorbital periods and mass ratios. the most likely mass range for a putative mainsequence companion would be ~5--12 msun, the upper end of which corresponds tothe inferred upper detection limit.

astro-ph;0503678	late-time x-ray, uv and optical monitoring of supernova 1979c	we present results from observations of sn 1979c with xmm-newton in x-raysand in the uv, archival x-ray and hst data, and follow-up ground-based opticalimaging. the xmm-newton mos spectrum shows two-temperature thermal plasmaemission characteristics of both the forward (4.1 kev) and reverse shock (0.78kev) with no intrinsic absorption. the long-term x-ray lightcurve of sn 1979cshows no sign of a decline over 16-23 yrs after its outburst. the high x-rayluminosity (8 x 10^38 ergs/s) is caused by the interaction of the shock withdense circumstellar matter, likely deposited by a strong stellar wind from theprogenitor with a high mass-loss rate of 1.5 x 10^-4 m_sun/yr. the x-ray datasupport a strongly decelerated shock and show a mass-loss rate history which isconsistent with a constant progenitor mass-loss rate and wind velocity over thepast &gt;16,000 yrs in the evolution of the progenitor. we find a csm densityprofile of rho_csm \propto r^-s with index s&lt;1.7 and high csm densities (&gt;10^4cm^-3) out to large radii from the site of the explosion (&gt; 4 x 10^17 cm).using xmm-newton optical monitor data we further detect optical/uv emissionfrom sn 1979c, with b, u, and uvw1-band lum. of 5,7, and 9 x 10^36 ergs/s. theyoung stellar cluster in the vicinity of the sn, as imaged by the hst andfollow-up ground-based optical imaging, can only provide a fraction of thetotal observed flux, so that a significant contribution to the output likelyarises from the strong interaction of sn 1979c with dense csm.

astro-ph;0507394	identification of the red supergiant progenitor of supernova 2005cs: do  the progenitors of type ii-p supernovae have low mass?	the stars that end their lives as supernovae (sne) have been directlyobserved in only a handful of cases, due mainly to the extreme difficulty inidentifying them in images obtained prior to the sn explosions. here we reportthe identification of the progenitor for the recent type ii-plateau(core-collapse) sn 2005cs in pre-explosion archival images of the whirlpoolgalaxy (m51) obtained with the hubble space telescope (hst) advanced camera forsurveys (acs). from high-quality ground-based images of the sn from thecanada-france-hawaii telescope, we precisely determine the position of the snand are able to isolate the sn progenitor to within 0".04 in the hst/acsoptical images. we further pinpoint the sn location to within 0".005 fromhst/acs ultraviolet images of the sn, confirming our progenitor identification.  from photometry of the sn progenitor obtained with the pre-sn acs images, andalso limits to its brightness in pre-sn hst/nicmos images, we infer that theprogenitor is a red supergiant star of spectral type k0--m3, with initial mass7--9 msun. we also discuss the implications of the sn 2005cs progenitoridentification and its mass estimate. there is an emerging trend that the mostcommon type ii-plateau sne originate from low-mass supergiants 8--15 msun.

astro-ph;0508684	the light echo around supernova 2003gd in messier 74	we confirm the discovery of a light echo around the type ii-plateau supernova2003gd in messier 74 (ngc 628), seen in images obtained with the highresolution channel of the advanced camera for surveys on-board the hubble spacetelescope (hst), as part of a larger snapshot program on the late-time emissionfrom supernovae. the analysis of the echo we present suggests that it is due tothe sn light pulse scattered by a sheet of dust grains located about 113 pc infront of the sn, and that these grains are not unlike those assumed to be inthe diffuse galactic interstellar medium, both in composition and in sizedistribution. the echo is less consistent with scattering off carbon-richgrains, and, if anything, the grains may be somewhat more silicate-rich thanthe galactic dust composition. the echo also appears to be more consistent witha sn distance closer to 7 mpc than 9 mpc. this further supports the conclusionwe reached elsewhere that the initial mass for the sn progenitor was relativelylow (about 8--9 m_suns). hst should be used to continue to monitor the echo inseveral bands, particularly in the blue, to better constrain its origin.

astro-ph;0603025	the type iin supernova 2002kg: the outburst of a luminous blue variable  star in ngc 2403	we show that supernova (sn) 2002kg in ngc 2403, initially classified as typeii-narrow (iin), has photometric and spectroscopic properties unlike those ofnormal sne. its behavior, instead, is more typical of highly massive starswhich experience the short-lived luminous blue variable (lbv) phase toward theend of their lives. the star, in fact, most resembles the lbv s doradus inoutburst. the precursor of sn 2002kg is the irregular, bright blue variablestar 37 (v37), catalogued by tammann &amp; sandage in 1968. using high-qualityground-based, multi-band images we can constrain the initial mass of v37 to bem_ini &gt;~ 40 m_sun. we find that, although the spectra indicate a nitrogenenhancement, possibly revealing the products of cno processing by v37 in theejecta, the star lacks a substantial lbv nebula. the outburst from sn2002kg/v37 is not nearly as energetic as the giant eruptions of the etacarinae-like variables, such as sn 1954j/v12, also in ngc 2403. sn 2002kg/v37,however, is among a growing number of ``sn impostors'' exhibiting a broad rangeof outburst energetics during a pre-sn phase of massive-star evolution.

astro-ph;0701049	on the progenitors of two type ii-p supernovae in the virgo cluster	direct identification of the progenitors of supernovae (sne) is rare becauseof the required spatial resolution and depth of the archival data prior to thesn explosions. here we report on the identification of the progenitors of twonearby sne in the virgo cluster: sn 2006my in ngc 4651 and sn 2006ov in m61. weobtained high-quality ground-based images of sn 2006my with thecanada-france-hawaii telescope, and are able to locate the site of the sn onpre-sn {\it hubble space telescope} ({\it hst}) wide field planetary camera 2images to a high precision (1$\sigma$ uncertainty of $\pm0\farcs$05). wepinpoint the site of sn 2006ov to within 0$\farcs$02 from {\it hst} advancedcamera for surveys images of the sn. we detected a red supergiant progenitorfor each sn within the error circles, with an inferred zero-age main-sequencemass ($m_{\rm zams}$) of $10^{+5}_{-3}$ $m_\odot$ and $15^{+5}_{-3}$ $m_\odot$for the progenitors of sne 2006my and 2006ov, respectively. the mass estimatesfor the progenitors of both sne confirm a suggested trend that the most commontype ii-plateau sne originate from low-mass supergiants with $m_{\rm zams}\approx 8$--20 $m_\odot$.

astro-ph;0702117	signatures of delayed detonation, asymmetry, and electron capture in the  mid-infrared spectra of supernovae 2003hv and 2005df	we present the first mid-infrared (5.2-15.2 micron) spectra of type iasupernovae (sne 2003hv and 2005df). the detection of ni emission in sn 2005df135 days after the explosion provides direct observational evidence ofhigh-density nuclear burning forming a significant amount of stable ni in atype ia supernova. the observed emission line profiles in the sn 2005dfspectrum indicate a chemically stratified ejecta structure. the sn 2005df arlines also exhibit a two-pronged emission profile implying that the ar emissiondeviates significantly from spherical symmetry. the spectrum of sn 2003hv alsoshows signs of asymmetry, exhibiting blueshifted [co iii] which matches theblueshift of [fe ii] lines in nearly coeval nir spectra. finally, localthermodynamic equilibrium abundance estimates for the yield of radioactive 56nigive ~0.5 msun, for sn 2003hv, but only ~0.13-0.22 msun for the apparentlysubluminous sn 2005df, supporting the notion that the luminosity of sne ia isprimarily a function of the radioactive 56ni yield.  the chemically stratified ejecta structure observed in sn 2005df matches thepredictions of delayed-detonation (dd) models, but is entirely incompatiblewith current three-dimensional deflagration models. furthermore the degree thatthis layering persists to the innermost regions of the supernova is difficultto explain even in a dd scenario, where the innermost ejecta are still theproduct of deflagration burning. thus, while these results are roughlyconsistent with a delayed detonation, it is clear that a key piece of physicsis still missing from our understanding of the earliest phases of sn iaexplosions.

astro-ph;9802296	radio observations of sn 1980k: evidence for rapid presupernova  evolution	new observations of sn 1980k made with the vla at 20 and 6 cm from 1994 aprilthrough 1996 october show that the supernova (sn) has undergone a significantchange in its radio emission evolution, dropping by a factor of ~2 below theflux density s \propto t^{-0.73} power-law decline with time t observedearlier. however, although s at all observed frequencies has decreasedsignificantly, its current spectral index of \alpha= -0.42\pm0.15 (s \propto\nu^{+\alpha}) is consistent with the previous spectral index of\alpha=-0.60_{-0.07}^{+0.04}.  it is suggested that this decrease in emission may be due to the sn shockentering a new region of the circumstellar material which has a lower densitythan that expected for a constant speed (w), constant mass-loss rate (mdot)wind from the progenitor. if such an interpretation is correct, the differencein wind and shock speeds appears to indicate a significant evolution in themass-loss history of the sn progenitor ~10^4 years before explosion, with achange in circumstellar density (\propto mdot/w) occurring over a time span of\lesssim 4 kyr. such features could be explained in terms of a fast``blue-loop'' evolutionary phase of a relatively massive pre-sn progenitorstar. if so, we may, for the first time, provide a stringent constraint on themass of the sn progenitor based solely on the sn's radio emission.

astro-ph;9808001	recent star formation in sextans a	we investigate the relationship between the spatial distributions of stellarpopulations and of neutral and ionized gas in the local group dwarf irregulargalaxy sextans a. this galaxy is currently experiencing a burst of localizedstar formation, the trigger of which is unknown. we have resolved variouspopulations of stars via deep ubv(ri)_c imaging over an area with diameter \sim5.'3. we have compared our photometry with theoretical isochrones appropriatefor sextans a, in order to determine the ages of these populations. we havemapped out the history of star formation, most accurately for times \lesssim100 myr. we find that star formation in sextans a is correlated both in timeand space, especially for the most recent (\lesssim 12 myr) times. the youngeststars in the galaxy are forming primarily along the inner edge of the large h ishell. somewhat older populations, \lesssim 50 myr, are found inward of theyoungest stars. progressively older star formation, from \sim 50--100 myr,appears to have some spatially coherent structure and is more centrallyconcentrated. the oldest stars we can accurately sample appear to haveapproximately a uniform spatial distribution, which extends beyond a surfacebrightness of \mu_b \simeq 25.9 mag arcsec^{-2} (or, a radius r \simeq 2.'3$).although other processes are also possible, our data provides support for amechanism of supernova-driven expansion of the neutral gas, resulting in coldgas pileup and compression along the h i shell and sequential star formation inrecent times.

astro-ph;9905077	discovery of radio outbursts in the active nucleus of m81	the low-luminosity active galactic nucleus of m81 has been monitored atcentimeter wavelengths since early 1993 as a by-product of radio programs tostudy the radio emission from supernova 1993j. the extensive data sets revealthat the nucleus experienced several radio outbursts during the monitoringperiod. at 2 and 3.6 cm, the main outburst occurred roughly in the beginning of1993 september and lasted for approximately three months; at longerwavelengths, the maximum flux density decreases, and the onset of the burst isdelayed. these characteristics qualitatively resemble the standard model foradiabatically expanding radio sources, although certain discrepancies betweenthe observations and the theoretical predictions suggest that the model is toosimplistic. in addition to the large-amplitude, prolonged variations, we alsodetected milder changes in the flux density at 3.6 cm and possibly at 6 cm onshort (less than 1 day) timescales. we discuss a possible association betweenthe radio activity and an optical flare observed during the period that thenucleus was monitored at radio wavelengths.
