0901.2127	protostellar disks formed from rigidly rotating cores	abridged: we use three-dimensional sph simulations to investigate thecollapse of low-mass prestellar cores and the formation and early evolution ofprotostellar discs. the initial conditions are slightly supercriticalbonnor-ebert spheres in rigid rotation. the core mass and initial radius areheld fixed at m_o=6.1 m_sun and r_o=17,000 au, and the only parameter that wevary is the initial angular speed \omega_o. protostellar discs forming fromcores with \omega_o&lt;1.35 10d-13 1/s have radii between 100 and 300 au and arequite centrally concentrated; due to heating by gas infall onto the disc andaccretion onto the central object, they are also quite warm, t&gt;100 k, andtherefore stable against gravitational fragmentation. in contrast, more rapidlyrotating cores form discs which are less concentrated and cooler, and haveradii between 400 and 1000 au; as a consequence they are prone to gravitationalfragmentation and the formation of multiple systems. we derive a criterion thatpredicts whether a rigidly rotating core having given m_o, r_o and \omega_owill produce a protostellar disc which fragments whilst material is stillinfalling from the core envelope. we then apply this criterion to core samplesfor which m_o, r_o and \omega_o have been estimated observationally. weconclude that the observed cores are stable against fragmentation at thisstage, due to their low angular speeds and the heat delivered at the accretionshock where the infalling material hits the disc.

0902.4701	the sins survey: modeling the dynamics of z~2 galaxies and the high-z  tully-fisher relation	we present the modeling of sinfoni integral field dynamics of 18 star forminggalaxies at z ~ 2 from halpha line emission. the galaxies are selected from thelarger sample of the sins survey, based on the prominence of ordered rotationalmotions with respect to more complex merger induced dynamics. the quality ofthe data allows us to carefully select systems with kinematics dominated byrotation, and to model the gas dynamics across the whole galaxy using suitableexponential disk models. we obtain a good correlation between the dynamicalmass and the stellar mass, finding that large gas fractions mgas~m*) arerequired to explain the difference between the two quantities. we use thederived stellar mass and maximum rotational velocity vmax from the modeling toconstruct for the first time the stellar mass tully-fisher relation at z ~ 2.2.the relation obtained shows a slope similar to what is observed at lowerredshift, but we detect an evolution of the zero point. we find that at z ~ 2.2there is an offset in log(m*) for a given rotational velocity of 0.41+-0.11with respect to the local universe. this result is consistent with thepredictions of the latest n-body/hydrodynamical simulations of disk formationand evolution, which invoke gas accretion onto the forming disk in filamentsand cooling flows. this scenario is in agreement with other dynamical evidencefrom sins, where gas accretion from the halo is required to reproduce theobserved properties of a large fraction of the z ~ 2 galaxies.

0906.3157	a deep hst h-band imaging survey of massive gas-rich mergers. ii. the  quest pg qsos	we report the results from a deep hst nicmos h-band imaging survey of 28 z &lt;0.3 qsos from the palomar-green (pg) sample. this program is part of quest(quasar / ulirg evolution study) and complements a similar set of data on 26highly-nucleated ulirgs presented in paper i. our analysis indicates that thefraction of qsos with elliptical hosts is higher among qsos with undetectedfar-infrared (fir) emission, small infrared excess, and luminous hosts. thehosts of fir-faint qsos show a tendency to have less pronounced merger-inducedmorphological anomalies and larger qso-to-host luminosity ratios on averagethan the hosts of fir-bright qsos, consistent with late-merger evolution fromfir-bright to fir-faint qsos. the spheroid sizes and total host luminosities ofthe radio-quiet pg qsos in our sample are statistically indistinguishable fromthe ulirg hosts presented in paper i, while those of radio-loud pg qsos aresystematically larger and more luminous. ulirgs and pg qsos with ellipticalhosts fall near, but not exactly on, the fundamental plane of inactivespheroids. we confirm the systematic trend noted in paper i for objects withsmall (&lt; 2 kpc) spheroids to be up to ~1 mag. brighter than inactive spheroids.the host colors and wavelength dependence of their sizes support the idea thatthese deviations are due at least in part to non-nuclear star formation.however, the amplitudes of these deviations does not depend on host r-h colors.taken at face value (i.e., no correction for extinction or the presence of ayoung stellar population), the h-band spheroid-host luminosities imply bhmasses ~5 -- 200 x 10^7 m_sun and sub-eddington mass accretion rates for bothqsos and ulirgs. these results are compared with published bh mass estimatesderived from other methods.

0707.0410	on gas drag in a circular binary system	we investigate both analytically and numerically the motion of masslessparticles orbiting primary star in a close circular binary system withparticular focus on the gas drag effects. these are the first calculations withparticles ranging in size from 1m to 10km, which account for the presence of atidally perturbed gaseous disk. we have found numerically that the radial masstransport by the tidal waves plays a crucial role in the orbital evolution ofparticles. numerical results are confirmed analytical calculations that do notassume anything about origin of the radial flow in the disk. we demonstratethat the migration rate of a particle in a disk out of radial equilibrium isenhanced due to the enhanced mass flux of gas colliding with the particle andthe migration is always directed inward regardless of the sign of the radialgas velocity. within the framework of the perturbation theory we derivegeneral, formulae for short-term variations of the particle semi-major axis,eccentricity and inclination in such disk. the formulae account for departuresfrom axial symmetry by introducing effective components of the gas velocity.they agree with numerical results within several percent. we have also found innumerical simulations that the tidal waves introduce coherence in periastronlongitude and eccentricity for particles on neighbouring orbits. the degree ofthe coherence depends on the particle size and on the distance from the primarystar, being most prominent for particles with 10m radius. the results areimportant mainly in the context of planetesimal formation and, to a lesserdegree, during the early planetesimal accretion stage.

0907.4777	high-redshift star-forming galaxies: angular momentum and baryon  fraction, turbulent pressure effects and the origin of turbulence	the structure of a sample of high-redshift (z=2), rotating galaxies with highstar formation rates and turbulent gas velocities of sigma=40-80 km/s isinvestigated. fitting the observed disk rotational velocities and radii with amo, mao, white (1998) (mmw) model requires unusually large disk spin parameterslambda_d&gt;0.1 and disk-to-dark halo mass fraction m_d=0.2, close to the cosmicbaryon fraction. the galaxies segregate into dispersion-dominated systems with1&lt;vmax/sigma&lt;3, maximum rotational velocities vmax&lt;200 km/s and disk half-lightradii rd=1-3 kpc and rotation-dominated systems with vmax&gt;200 km/s,vmax/sigma&gt;3 and rd=4-8 kpc. for the dispersion-dominated sample, radialpressure gradients partly compensate the gravitational force, reducing therotational velocities. including this pressure effect in the mmw model,dispersion-dominated galaxies can be fitted well with spin parameters lflambda_d=0.03-0.05 for high disk mass fractions of m_d=0.2 and withlambda_d=0.01-0.03 for m_d=0.05. these values are in good agreement withcosmological expectations. for the rotation-dominated sample however pressureeffects are small and better agreement with theoretically expected disk spinparameters can only be achieved if the dark halo mass contribution in thevisible disk regime (2-3*rd) is smaller than predicted by the mmw model. weargue that these galaxies can still be embedded in standard cold dark matterhalos if the halos did not contract adiabatically in response to diskformation. it is shown that the observed high turbulent gas motions of thegalaxies are consistent with a toomre instability parameter q=1 which is equalto the critical value, expected for gravitational disk instability to be themajor driver of turbulence. the dominant energy source of turbulence is thenthe potential energy of the gas in the disk.

0911.4355	[the impact of nuclear star formation on gas inflow to agn	our adaptive optics observations of nearby agn at spatial resolutions assmall as 0.085arcsec show strong evidence for recent, but no longer active,nuclear star formation. we begin by describing observations that highlight twocontrasting methods by which gas can flow into the central tens of parsecs. gasaccumulation in this region will inevitably lead to a starburst, and we discussthe evidence for such events. we then turn to the impact of stellar evolutionon the further inflow of gas by combining a phenomenological approach withanalytical modelling and hydrodynamic simulations. these complementaryperspectives paint a picture in which all the processes are ultimatelyregulated by the mass accretion rate into the central hundred parsecs, and theensuing starburst that occurs there. the resulting supernovae delay accretionby generating a starburst wind, which leaves behind a clumpy interstellarmedium. this provides an ideal environment for slower stellar outflows toaccrete inwards and form a dense turbulent disk on scales of a few parsecs.such a scenario may resolve the discrepancy between the larger scale structureseen with adaptive optics and the small scale structure seen with vlti.

0912.4677	gas dynamics of the central few parsec region of ngc 1068 fuelled by the  evolving nuclear star cluster	high resolution observations with the nir adaptive optics integral fieldspectrograph sinfoni at the vlt proved the existence of massive and youngnuclear star clusters in the centres of a sample of seyfert galaxies. with thehelp of three-dimensional high resolution hydrodynamical simulations with thepluto code, we follow the evolution of such clusters, focusing on stellar massloss. this leads to clumpy or filamentary inflow of gas on large scales (tensof parsec), whereas a turbulent and very dense disc builds up on the parsecscale. in order to capture the relevant physics in the inner region, we treatthis disc separately by viscously evolving the radial surface densitydistribution. this enables us to link the tens of parsec scale region(accessible via sinfoni observations) to the (sub-)parsec scale region(observable with the midi instrument and via water maser emission). in thiswork, we concentrate on the effects of a parametrised turbulent viscosity togenerate angular momentum and mass transfer in the disc and additionally takestar formation into account. input parameters are constrained by observationsof the nearby seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068. at the current age of its nuclearstarburst of 250 myr, our simulations yield disc sizes of the order of 0.8 to0.9 pc, gas masses of 1.0e6 solar masses and mass transfer rates of 0.025 solarmasses per year through the inner rim of the disc. this shows that our largescale torus model is able to approximately account for the disc size asinferred from interferometric observations in the mid-infrared and compareswell to the extent and mass of a rotating disc structure as inferred from watermaser observations. several other observational constraints are discussed aswell.

1002.2149	high molecular gas fractions in normal massive star forming galaxies in  the young universe	stars form from cold molecular interstellar gas. since this is relativelyrare in the local universe, galaxies like the milky way form only a few newstars per year. typical massive galaxies in the distant universe formed starsan order of magnitude more rapidly. unless star formation was significantlymore efficient, this difference suggests that young galaxies were much more gasrich. molecular gas observations in the distant universe have so far beenlargely restricted to very luminous, rare objects, including mergers andquasars. here we report the results of a systematic survey of molecular gas insamples of typical massive star forming galaxies at &lt;z&gt;~1.2 and 2.3, when theuniverse was 40% and 24% of its current age. our measurements provide empiricalevidence that distant star forming galaxies indeed were gas rich, and that thestar formation efficiency is not strongly dependent on cosmic epoch. theaverage fraction of cold gas relative to total galaxy baryonic mass at z= 2.3and z=1.2 is ~44% and 34%, three to ten times higher than in today's massivespiral galaxies. the slow decrease between z~2 and 1 probably requires amechanism of semi-continuous replenishment of fresh gas to the young galaxies.

1003.5180	a study of the gas-star formation relation over cosmic time	we use the first systematic data sets of co molecular line emission in z~1-3normal star forming galaxies for a comparison of the dependence ofgalaxy-averaged star formation rates on molecular gas masses at low and highredshifts, and in different galactic environments. although the current high-zsamples are still small and biased toward the luminous and massive tail of theactively star-forming 'main-sequence', a fairly clear picture is emerging.independent of whether galaxy integrated quantities or surface densities areconsidered, low- and high-z sfg galaxy populations appear to follow similarmolecular gas-star formation relations with slopes 1.1 to 1.2. thegas-depletion time scale in these sfgs grows from 0.5 gyrs at z~2 to 1.5 gyrsat z~0. because star formation depletion times are significantly smaller thanthe hubble time at all redshifts sampled, star formation rates and gasfractions are set by the balance between gas accretion from the halo andstellar feedback. in contrast, very luminous gas rich major mergers at bothlow-z and high-z produce on average 4 to10 times more far-infrared luminosityper unit gas mass. only some fraction of this difference can be explained byuncertainties in gas-mass or luminosity estimators; much of it must beintrinsic. the most likely interpretation is that the star formation relationis driven by global dynamical effects. for a given mass, the more compactmerger systems produce stars more rapidly because their gas clouds are morecompressed with shorter dynamical times, so that they churn more quicklythrough the available gas reservoir than the typical normal disk galaxies. whenthe dependence on galactic dynamical time scale is explicitly included, diskgalaxies and mergers appear to follow similar gas to star-formation relations.the mergers may be forming stars at slightly higher efficiencies than thedisks.

1005.2100	on the evolution of the intrinsic scatter in black hole versus galaxy  mass relations	we present results on the evolution of the intrinsic scatter of black holemasses considering different implementations of a model in which black holesonly grow via mergers. we demonstrate how merger driven growth affects thecorrelations between black hole mass and host bulge mass. the simple case of aninitially log-normal distributed scatter in black hole and bulge massescombined with random merging within the galaxy population results in adecreasing scatter with merging generation/number as predicted by thecentral-limit theorem. in general we find that the decrease in scatter {\sigma}is well approximated by {\sigma}merg(m) = {\sigma}ini \times (m + 1)^(-a/2)with a = 0.42 for a range of mean number of mergers m &lt; 50. for a large meannumber of mergers (m &gt; 100) we find a convergence to a = 0.61. this is validfor a wide range of different initial distributions, refill-scenarios or mergermass-ratios. growth scenarios based on halo merger trees of a (100 mpc)^3 darkmatter lambdacdm-simulation show a similar behaviour with a scatter decrease ofa = 0.30 with typical number of mergers m &lt; 50 consistent with random merging(best matching model: a = 0.34). assuming a present day scatter of 0.3 dex inblack hole mass and a mean number of mergers not exceeding m = 50 our resultsimply a scatter of 0.6 dex at z = 3 and thus a possible scenario in whichovermassive (and undermassive) black holes at high redshift are a consequenceof a larger intrinsic scatter in black hole mass. a simple toy model connectingthe growth of black holes to the growth of lambdacdm dark matter halos viamergers, neglecting any contribution from accretion, yields a consistent m\cdot-mbulge relation at z = 0 - if we assume the correct initial relation.

0708.2205	axisymmetric orbit models of n-body merger remnants: a dependency of  reconstructed mass on viewing angle	we model mock observations of collisionless n-body disc-disc mergers with anaxisymmetric orbit superposition program that has been used to model comaellipticals. the remnants sample representatively the shapes of disc-discmergers including prolate, triaxial and oblate objects. the aim is to betterunderstand how the assumption of axial symmetry affects reconstructed massesand stellar motions of systems which are intrinsically not axisymmetric,whether it leads to a bias and how such a potential bias can be recognised inmodels of real galaxies. the mass recovery at the half-light radius depends onviewing-angle and intrinsic shape: edge-on views allow to reconstruct totalmasses with an accuracy between 20% (triaxial/prolate remnants) and 3% (oblateremnant). masses of highly flattened, face-on systems are underestimated by upto 50%. deviations in local mass densities can be larger where remnants arestrongly triaxial or prolate. luminous m/l are sensitive to box orbits in theremnants. box orbits cause the central kinematics to vary with viewing-angle.reconstructed luminous m/l and central masses follow this variation. luminousm/l are always underestimated (up to a factor of 2.5). respective dark halos inthe models can be overestimated by about the same amount, depending again onviewing angle. reconstructed velocity anisotropies depend on viewing angle andon the orbital composition of the remnant. we construct n-body realisations ofthe schwarzschild models to discuss chaotic orbits and the virial equilibriumin our models. apparently flattened, rotating ellipticals of intermediate massare likely close to both, axial symmetry and edge-on orientation. our resultsimply that schwarzschild models allow a reconstruction of their masses andstellar anisotropies with high accuracy.

1011.5360	the sins survey of z~2 galaxy kinematics: properties of the giant star  forming clumps	we have studied the properties of giant star forming clumps in five z~2star-forming disks with deep sinfoni ao spectroscopy at the eso vlt. the clumpsreside in disk regions where the toomre q-parameter is below unity, consistentwith their being bound and having formed from gravitational instability. broadh{\alpha}/[nii] line wings demonstrate that the clumps are launching sites ofpowerful outflows. the inferred outflow rates are comparable to or exceed thestar formation rates, in one case by a factor of eight. typical clumps may losea fraction of their original gas by feedback in a few hundred million years,allowing them to migrate into the center. the most active clumps may lose muchof their mass and disrupt in the disk. the clumps leave a modest imprint on thegas kinematics. velocity gradients across the clumps are 10-40 km/s/kpc,similar to the galactic rotation gradients. given beam smearing and clumpsizes, these gradients may be consistent with significant rotational support intypical clumps. extreme clumps may not be rotationally supported; either theyare not virialized, or they are predominantly pressure supported. the velocitydispersion is spatially rather constant and increases only weakly with starformation surface density. the large velocity dispersions may be driven by therelease of gravitational energy, either at the outer disk/accreting streamsinterface, and/or by the clump migration within the disk. spatial variations inthe inferred gas phase oxygen abundance are broadly consistent with inside-outgrowing disks, and/or with inward migration of the clumps.

1101.2894	the turbulent fragmentation of the interstellar medium: the impact of  metallicity on global star formation	we study the influence of gas metallicity, turbulence, and non-equilibriumchemistry on the evolution of the two-phase interstellar medium (warm and coldatomic phases), and thereby constrain the initial conditions for star formationprevailing in turbulent gas. we perform high-resolution simulations in threedimensions, including a realistic non-equilibrium treatment of the ionizationstate of the gas, and examine both driven and decaying turbulence. this allowsus to explore variations in the metallicity z. in this paper, we study solarmetallicity, z=z_sun, and low metallicity, z=1d-3 z_sun, gas. for driven,large-scale turbulence, we find that the influence of the metallicity on theamount of mass in the cold gas component is small. however, in decayingturbulent conditions this picture is much changed. while cold regions survivein the case of solar metallicity, they are quickly heated and dispersed inlow-metallicity gas. this result suggests that star formation can be suppressedin environments of low metallicity, unless a strong turbulent driver is actingon time scales shorter than a few turbulent crossing times. inter alia thisfinding could explain the overall inefficient star formation as well as theburst-like mode of star formation found in metal-poor, gas-rich systems likedwarf galaxies.

1104.1626	galaxy formation in semi-analytic models and cosmological hydrodynamic  zoom simulations	we present a detailed comparison between numerical cosmological hydrodynamiczoom simulations and semi-analytic models (sams) run within merger treesextracted from the simulations. the high-resolution simulations represent 48individual halos with virial masses in the range 2.4*10^11m_sun &lt; m_halo &lt;3.3*10^13m_sun. they include radiative h &amp; he cooling, photo-ionization, starformation and thermal sn feedback. we compare with different sam versionsincluding only this complement of physical processes, and also ones includingsupernova driven winds, metal cooling, and feedback from agn. our analysis isfocused on the cosmic evolution of the baryon content in galaxies and itsdivision into various components (stars, cold gas, and hot gas). both the samsand simulations are compared with observational relations between halo mass andstellar mass, and between stellar mass and star formation rate, at low and highredshift. the simulations turn out to have much higher star formationefficiencies (by about a factor of ten) than the sams. therefore the cold gasis consumed much more rapidly in the simulations and stars form much earlier.also, simulations show a transition between stellar mass growth that isdominated by in situ formation of stars to growth that is predominantly throughaccretion of stars formed in external galaxies. in sams, stellar growth isalways dominated by in situ star formation. in addition, sams overpredict theoverall gas accretion rates relative to the simulations, and overestimate thefraction of "hot" relative to "cold" accretion. we discuss the reasons forthese discrepancies, and identify several physical processes that are missingin our sam. we also highlight physical processes that are neglected in thesimulations studied here, but which appear to be crucial in order to understandthe properties of real galaxies.

1106.2098	the metallicity dependence of the co {\rightarrow} h_2 conversion factor  in z&gt;1 star forming galaxies	we use the first systematic samples of co millimeter emission in z&gt;1'main-sequence' star forming galaxies (sfgs) to study the metallicitydependence of the conversion factor {\alpha}co, from co line luminosity tomolecular gas mass. the molecular gas depletion rate inferred from the ratio ofthe star formation rate (sfr) to co luminosity, is ~1 gyr-1 for near-solarmetallicity galaxies with stellar masses above m_s~1e11 m_sun. in this regimethe depletion rate does not vary more than a factor of two to three as afunction of molecular gas surface density, or redshift between z~0 and 2. belowm_s the depletion rate increases rapidly with decreasing metallicity. we arguethat this trend is not caused by starburst events, by changes in the physicalparameters of the molecular clouds, or by the impact of the fundamentalmetallicity-sfr-stellar mass relation. a more probable explanation is that theconversion factor is metallicity dependent and that star formation can occur in'co-dark' gas. the trend is also expected theoretically from the effect ofenhanced photodissociation of co by ultraviolet radiation at low metallicity.from the available z~0 and z~1-3 samples we constrain the slope of thelog({\alpha}co) -log (metallicity) relation to range between -1 and -2, fairlyinsensitive to the assumed slope of the gas-star formation rate relation.because of the lower metallicities near the peak of the galaxy formationactivity at z~1-2 compared to z~0, we suggest that molecular gas massesestimated from co luminosities have to be substantially corrected upward forgalaxies below m_s.

1107.0154	the properties of the ism in disc galaxies with stellar feedback	we perform calculations of isolated disc galaxies to investigate how theproperties of the ism, the nature of molecular clouds, and the global starformation rate depend on the level of stellar feedback. we adopt a simplephysical model, which includes a galactic potential, a standard cooling andheating prescription of the ism, and self gravity of the gas. stellar feedbackis implemented by injecting energy into dense, gravitationally collapsing gas,but is independent of the schmidt-kennicutt relation. we obtain fractions ofgas, and filling factors for different phases of the ism in reasonable ageementwith observations. supernovae are found to be vital to reproduce the scaleheights of the different components of the ism, and velocity dispersions. thegmcs formed in the simulations display mass spectra similar to theobservations, their normalisation dependent on the level of feedback. we find~40 per cent of the clouds exhibit retrograde rotation, induced by cloud-cloudcollisions. the star formation rates we obtain are in good agreement with theobserved schmidt-kennicutt relation, and are not strongly dependent on the starformation efficiency we assume, being largely self regulated by the feedback.we also investigate the effect of spiral structure by comparing calculationswith and without the spiral component of the potential. the main differencewith a spiral potential is that more massive gmcs are able to accumulate in thespiral arms. thus we are able to reproduce massive gmcs, and the spurs seen inmany grand design galaxies, even with stellar feedback. the presence of thespiral potential does not have an explicit effect on the star formation rate,but can increase the star formation rate indirectly by enabling the formationof long-lived, strongly bound clouds.

1108.0285	how well can we measure the intrinsic velocity dispersion of distant  disk galaxies?	the kinematics of distant galaxies, from z=0.1 to z&gt;2, play a key role in ourunderstanding of galaxy evolution from early times to the present. one of theimportant parameters is the intrinsic, or local, velocity dispersion of agalaxy, which allows one to quantify the degree of non-circular motions such aspressure support. however, this is difficult to measure because the observeddispersion includes the effects of (often severe) beam smearing on the velocitygradient. here we investigate four methods of measuring the dispersion thathave been used in the literature, to assess their effectiveness at recoveringthe intrinsic dispersion. we discuss the biasses inherent in each method, andapply them to model disk galaxies in order to determine which methods yieldmeaningful quantities, and under what conditions. all the mean weighteddispersion estimators are affected by (residual) beam smearing. in contrast,the dispersion recovered by fitting a spatially and spectrally convolved diskmodel to the data is unbiassed by the beam smearing it is trying to compensate.because of this, and because the bias it does exhibit depends only on thesignal-to-noise, it can be considered reliable. however, at very lowsignal-to-noise, all methods should be used with caution.

1112.3264	a gas cloud on its way towards the super-massive black hole in the  galactic centre	measurements of stellar orbits provide compelling evidence that the compactradio source sagittarius a* at the galactic centre is a black hole four milliontimes the mass of the sun. with the exception of modest x-ray and infraredflares, sgr a* is surprisingly faint, suggesting that the accretion rate andradiation efficiency near the event horizon are currently very low. here wereport the presence of a dense gas cloud approximately three times the mass ofearth that is falling into the accretion zone of sgr a*. our observationstightly constrain the cloud's orbit to be highly eccentric, with an innermostradius of approach of only ~3,100 times the event horizon that will be reachedin 2013. over the past three years the cloud has begun to disrupt, probablymainly through tidal shearing arising from the black hole's gravitationalforce. the cloud's dynamic evolution and radiation in the next few years willprobe the properties of the accretion flow and the feeding processes of thesuper-massive black hole. the kilo-electronvolt x-ray emission of sgr a* maybrighten significantly when the cloud reaches pericentre. there may also be agiant radiation flare several years from now if the cloud breaks up and itsfragments feed gas into the central accretion zone.

1201.1775	the myth of the molecular ring	we investigate the structure of the milky way by determining how features ina spatial map correspond to co features in a velocity map. we examinestructures including logarithmic spiral arms, a ring and a bar. we explore theavailable parameter space, including the pitch angle of the spiral arms, radiusof a ring, and rotation curve. we show that surprisingly, a spiral arm providesa better fit to the observed molecular ring than a true ring feature. this isbecause both a spiral arm, and the observed feature known as the molecularring, are curved in velocity longitude space. we find that much of the coemission in the velocity longitude map can be fitted by a nearly symmetric 2armed spiral pattern. one of the arms corresponds to the molecular ring, whilstthe opposite arm naturally reproduces the perseus arm. multiple arms alsocontribute to further emission in the vicinity of the molecular ring and matchother observed spiral arms. whether the galactic structure consists primarilyof two, or several spiral arms, the presence of 2 symmetric logarithmicspirals, which begin in the vicinity of the ends of the bar, suggest a spiraldensity wave associated with the bar.

1203.6356	simulations of the origin and fate of the galactic center cloud g2	we investigate the origin and fate of the recently discovered gas cloud g2close to the galactic center. our hydrodynamical simulations focussing on thedynamical evolution of the cloud in combination with currently availableobservations favor two scenarios: a compact cloud which started around the year1995 and a spherical shell of gas, with an apocenter distance within thedisk(s) of young stars and a radius of a few times the size of the compactcloud. the former is able to explain the detected signal of g2 in theposition-velocity diagram of the br gamma emission of the year 2008.5 and2011.5 data. the latter can account for both, g2's signal as well as thefainter extended tail-like structure g2t seen at larger distances from theblack hole and smaller velocities. in contrast, gas stripped from a compactcloud by hydrodynamical interactions is not able to explain the location of thedetected g2t emission in the observed position-velocity diagrams. this favorsthe spherical shell scenario and might be a severe problem for the compactcloud as well as the so-called compact source scenario. from these firstidealized simulations we expect a roughly constant feeding of the supermassiveblack hole through a nozzle-like structure over a long period, starting shortlyafter the closest approach in 2013.51 for the compact cloud. if the matteraccretes in the hot accretion mode, we do not expect a significant boost of thecurrent activity of sgr a* for the compact cloud model, but a boost of theaverage infrared and x-ray luminosity by roughly a factor of 80 for thespherical shell scenario with order of magnitude variations on a timescale of afew months. the near-future evolution of the cloud will be a sensitive probe ofthe conditions of the gas distribution in the milli-parsec environment of themassive black hole in the galactic center.

1206.4904	giant molecular clouds: what are they made from, and how do they get  there?	we analyse the results of four simulations of isolated galaxies: two with arigid spiral potential of fixed pattern speed, but with different degrees ofstar-formation induced feedback, one with an axisymmetric galactic potentialand one with a `live' self-gravitating stellar component. since we use alagrangian method we are able to select gas that lies within giant molecularclouds (gmcs) at a particular timeframe, and to then study the properties ofthis gas at earlier and later times. we find that gas which forms gmcs is nottypical of the interstellar medium at least 50 myr before the clouds form andreaches mean densities within an order of magnitude of mean cloud densities byaround 10 myr before. the gas in gmcs takes at least 50 myr to return totypical ism gas after dispersal by stellar feedback, and in some cases the gasis never fully recycled. we also present a study of the two-dimensional,vertically-averaged velocity fields within the ism. we show that the velocityfields corresponding to the shortest timescales (that is, those timescalesclosest to the immediate formation and dissipation of the clouds) can bereadily understood in terms of the various cloud formation and dissipationmechanisms. properties of the flow patterns can be used to distinguish theprocesses which drive converging flows (e.g.\ spiral shocks, supernovae) andthus molecular cloud formation, and we note that such properties may bedetectable with future observations of nearby galaxies.

1209.2272	new observations of the gas cloud g2 in the galactic center	we present new observations of the recently discovered gas cloud g2 currentlyfalling towards the massive black hole in the galactic center. the new dataconfirm that g2 is on a highly elliptical orbit with a predicted pericenterpassage mid 2013. the updated orbit has an even larger eccentricity of 0.966,an epoch of pericenter two months later than estimated before, and a nominalminimum distance of 2200 schwarzschild radii only. the velocity gradient of g2has developed further to 600 km/s fwhm in summer 2012. we also detect the tailof similar total flux and on the same orbit as g2 along the trajectory at highsignificance. no hydrodynamic effects are detected yet, since the simple modelof a tidally shearing gas cloud still describes the data very well. the flux ofg2 has not changed by more than 10% between 2008 and 2012, disfavoring modelswhere additional gas from a reservoir is released to the disrupting diffuse gascomponent.

1211.5743	phibss: molecular gas content and scaling relations in z~1-3 normal star  forming galaxies	we present phibss, the iram plateau de bure high-z blue sequence co 3-2survey of the molecular gas properties in normal star forming galaxies (sfgs)near the cosmic star formation peak. phibss provides 52 co detections in tworedshift slices at z~1.2 and 2.2, with log(m*(m_solar))&gt;10.4 andlog(sfr(m_solar/yr))&gt;1.5. including a correction for the incomplete coverage ofthe m*-sfr plane, we infer average gas fractions of ~0.33 at z~1.2 and ~0.47 atz~2.2. gas fractions drop with stellar mass, in agreement with cosmologicalsimulations including strong star formation feedback. most of the z~1-3 sfgsare rotationally supported turbulent disks. the sizes of co and uv/opticalemission are comparable. the molecular gas - star formation relation for thez=1-3 sfgs is near-linear, with a ~0.7 gyrs gas depletion timescale; changes indepletion time are only a secondary effect. since this timescale is much lessthan the hubble time in all sfgs between z~0 and 2, fresh gas must be suppliedwith a fairly high duty cycle over several billion years. at given z and m*,gas fractions correlate strongly with the specific star formation rate. thevariation of specific star formation rate between z~0 and 3 is mainlycontrolled by the fraction of baryonic mass that resides in cold gas.

1301.0628	towards a resolved kennicutt-schmidt law at high redshift	massive galaxies in the distant universe form stars at much higher rates thantoday. although direct resolution of the star forming regions of these galaxiesis still a challenge, recent molecular gas observations at the iram plateau debure interferometer enable us to study the star formation efficiency onsubgalactic scales around redshift z = 1.2. we present a method for obtainingthe gas and star formation rate (sfr) surface densities of ensembles of clumpscomposing galaxies at this redshift, even though the corresponding scales arenot resolved. this method is based on identifying these structures inposition-velocity diagrams corresponding to slices within the galaxies. we useunique iram observations of the co(3-2) rotational line and deep2 spectra offour massive star forming distant galaxies - egs13003805, egs13004291,egs12007881, and egs13019128 in the aegis terminology - to determine the gasand sfr surface densities of the identifiable ensembles of clumps thatconstitute them. the integrated co line luminosity is assumed to be directlyproportional to the total gas mass, and the sfr is deduced from the [oii] line.we identify the ensembles of clumps with the angular resolution available inboth co and [oii] spectroscopy; i.e., 1-1.5". sfr and gas surface densities areaveraged in areas of this size, which is also the thickness of the deep2 slitsand of the extracted iram slices, and we derive a spatially resolvedkennicutt-schmidt (ks) relation on a scale of ~8 kpc. the data generallyindicates an average depletion time of 1.9 gyr, but with significant variationsfrom point to point within the galaxies.

1302.0124	simulations of the origin and fate of the galactic center cloud g2	we investigate the origin and fate of the recently discovered gas cloud g2close to the galactic center. our hydrodynamical simulations focussing on thedynamical evolution of the cloud in combination with currently availableobservations favour two scenarios: a compact cloud which started around theyear 1995 and an extended spherical shell of gas, with an apocenter distancewithin the disk(s) of young stars. the former is able to explain the detectedsignal of g2 in the position-velocity-diagram of the year 2008.5 and 2011.5data. the latter can account for both, g2's signal as well as the fainterextended tail-like structure g2t seen at larger distances to the black hole andsmaller velocities. from these first idealised simulations we expect a rise ofthe current activity of sgr a* shortly after the closest approach and aconstant feeding through a nozzle-like structure over a long period. the nearfuture evolution of the cloud will be a sensitive probe of the conditions ofthe gas distribution in the milli-parsec environment of the massive black holein the galactic center and will also give us invaluable information of thefeeding of black holes and the activation of the central source.

1305.2953	numerical simulations of the possible origin of the two sub-parsec scale  and counter-rotating stellar disks around sgra*	we present a high resolution simulation of an idealized model to explain theorigin of the two young, counter-rotating, sub-parsec scale stellar disksaround the supermassive black hole sgra* at the center of the milky way. in ourmodel, the collision of a single molecular cloud with a circum-nuclear gas disk(similar to the one observed presently) leads to multiple streams of gasflowing towards the black hole and creating accretion disks with angularmomentum depending on the ratio of cloud and circum-nuclear disk material. theinfalling gas creates two inclined, counter-rotating sub-parsec scale accretiondisks around the supermassive black hole with the first disk forming roughly 1myr earlier, allowing it to fragment into stars and get dispersed before thesecond, counter-rotating disk forms. fragmentation of the second disk wouldlead to the two inclined, counter-rotating stellar disks which are observed atthe galactic center. a similar event might be happening again right now at themilky way galactic center. our model predicts that the collision eventgenerates spiral-like filaments of gas, feeding the galactic center prior todisk formation with a geometry and inflow pattern that is in agreement with thestructure of the so called mini-spiral that has been detected in the galacticcenter.

1305.7238	hydrodynamical simulations of a compact source scenario for the galactic  center cloud g2	the origin of the dense gas cloud g2 discovered in the galactic center(gillessen et al. 2012) is still a debated puzzle. g2 might be a diffuse cloudor the result of an outflow from an invisible star embedded in it. we presenthydrodynamical simulations of the evolution of different spherically symmetricwinds of a stellar object embedded in g2. we find that the interaction with theambient medium and with the extreme gravitational field of the supermassiveblack hole in the galactic center must be taken into account for such a sourcescenario. the thermal pressure of the hot and dense atmosphere confines thewind, while its ram pressure shapes it via stripping along the orbit, with thedetails depending on the wind parameters. tidal forces squeeze the wind nearpericenter, reducing it to a thin and elongated filament. we also find that inthis scenario most of the br\gamma\ luminosity is expected to come from thedensest part of the wind, which has a highly filamentary structure with lowfilling factor. the observations can be best matched by a mass outflow rate ofmdot,w=8.8 x 10^{-8} msun/yr and a wind velocity of vw = 50 km/s. these valuesare compatible with those of a young t tauri star wind, as already suggested by(scoville &amp; burkert 2013).

1310.3838	the sins/zc-sinf survey of z~2 galaxy kinematics: evidence for  gravitational quenching	as part of the sins/zc-sinf surveys of high-z galaxy kinematics, we derivethe radial distributions of h-alpha surface brightness, stellar mass surfacedensity, and dynamical mass at ~2 kpc resolution in 19 z~2 star-forming diskswith deep sinfoni ao spectroscopy at the eso vlt. from these data we infer theradial distribution of the toomre q-parameter for these main-sequence starforming galaxies (sfgs), covering almost two decades of stellar mass (10^9.6 to10^11.5 solar masses). in more than half of our sfgs, the h-alpha distributionscannot be fit by a centrally peaked distribution, such as an exponential, butare better described by a ring, or the combination of a ring and anexponential. at the same time the kinematic data indicate the presence of amass distribution more centrally concentrated than a single exponentialdistribution for 5 of the 19 galaxies. the resulting q-distributions arecentrally peaked for all, and significantly exceed unity there for threequarters of the sfgs. the occurrence of h-alpha rings and of large nuclearq-values is strongly correlated, and is more common for the more massive sfgs.while our sample is small and there remain substantial uncertainties andcaveats, our observations are consistent with a scenario in which cloudfragmentation and global star formation are secularly suppressed in gas richhigh-z disks from the inside out, as the central stellar mass density of thedisks grows.

1406.0183	evidence for wide-spread agn driven outflows in the most massive z~1-2  star forming galaxies	in this paper we follow up on our previous detection of nuclear ionizedoutflows in the most massive (log(m*/msun) &gt;= 10.9) z~1-3 star-forming galaxies(forster schreiber et al.), by increasing the sample size by a factor of six(to 44 galaxies above log(m*/msun) &gt;= 10.9) from a combination of thesins/zc-sinf, luci, gnirs, and kmos^3d spectroscopic surveys. we find a fairlysharp onset of the incidence of broad nuclear emission (fwhm in the ha, [nii],and [sii] lines ~ 450-5300 km/s), with large [nii]/ha ratios, abovelog(m*/msun) ~ 10.9, with about two thirds of the galaxies in this mass rangeexhibiting this component. broad nuclear components near and above theschechter mass are similarly prevalent above and below the main sequence ofstar-forming galaxies, and at z~1 and ~2. the line ratios of the nuclearcomponent are fit by excitation from active galactic nuclei (agn), or by acombination of shocks and photoionization. the incidence of the most massivegalaxies with broad nuclear components is at least as large as that of agnsidentified by x-ray, optical, infrared or radio indicators. the mass loading ofthe nuclear outflows is near unity. our findings provide compelling evidencefor powerful, high-duty cycle, agn-driven outflows near the schechter mass, andacting across the peak of cosmic galaxy formation.

1409.7404	time-resolved infrared emission from radiation-driven central obscuring  structures in active galactic nuclei	the central engines of seyfert galaxies are thought to be enshrouded bygeometrically thick gas and dust structures. in this article, we deriveobservable properties for a self-consistent model of such toroidal gas and dustdistributions, where the geometrical thickness is achieved and maintained withthe help of x-ray heating and radiation pressure due to the central engine.spectral energy distributions (seds) and images are obtained with the help ofdust continuum radiative transfer calculations with radmc-3d. for the firsttime, we are able to present time-resolved seds and images for a physical modelof the central obscurer. temporal changes are mostly visible at shorterwavelengths, close to the combined peak of the dust opacity as well as thecentral source spectrum and are caused by variations in the column densities ofthe generated outflow. due to the three-component morphology of thehydrodynamical models -- a thin disc with high density filaments, a surroundingfluffy component (the obscurer) and a low density outflow along the rotationaxis -- we find dramatic differences depending on wavelength: whereas themid-infrared images are dominated by the elongated appearance of the outflowcone, the long wavelength emission is mainly given by the cold and dense disccomponent. overall, we find good agreement with observed characteristics,especially for those models, which show clear outflow cones in combination witha geometrically thick distribution of gas and dust, as well as a geometricallythin, but high column density disc in the equatorial plane.

1503.03501	connecting angular momentum and galactic dynamics: the complex interplay  between spin, mass, and morphology	the evolution and distribution of the angular momentum of dark matter (dm)halos have been discussed in several studies over the past decades. inparticular, the idea arose that angular momentum conservation should allow toinfer the total angular momentum of the entire dm halo from measuring theangular momentum of the baryonic component, which is populating the center ofthe halo, especially for disk galaxies. to test this idea and to understand theconnection between the angular momentum of the dm halo and its galaxy, we usethe magneticum simulations. we successfully produce populations of spheroidaland disk galaxies self-consistently. thus, we are able to study the dependenceof galactic properties on their morphology. we find that (1) the specificangular momentum of stars in disk and spheroidal galaxies as a function oftheir stellar mass compares well with observational results; (2) the specificangular momentum of the stars in disk galaxies is slightly smaller compared tothe specific angular momentum of the cold gas, in good agreement withobservations; (3) simulations including the baryonic component show a dichotomyin the specific stellar angular momentum distribution when splitting thegalaxies according to their morphological type (this dichotomy can also be seenin the spin parameter, where disk galaxies populate halos with slightly largerspin compared to spheroidal galaxies); (4) disk galaxies preferentiallypopulate halos in which the angular momentum vector of the dm component in thecentral part shows a better alignment to the angular momentum vector of theentire halo; and (5) the specific angular momentum of the cold gas in diskgalaxies is approximately 40 percent smaller than the specific angular momentumof the total dm halo and shows a significant scatter.

0805.0801	fragmentation of shocked flows: gravity, turbulence and cooling	the observed rapid onset of star formation in molecular clouds requires rapidformation of dense fragments which can collapse individually before beingovertaken by global gravitationally-driven flows. many previous investigationshave suggested that supersonic turbulence produces the necessary fragmentation,without addressing however the source of this turbulence. motivated by ourprevious (numerical) work on the flow-driven formation of molecular clouds, weinvestigate the expected timescales of the dynamical and thermal instabilitiesleading to the rapid fragmentation of gas swept up by large-scale flows, andcompare them with global gravitational collapse timescales. we identifyparameter regimes in gas density, temperature and spatial scale within which agiven instability will dominate. we find that dynamical instabilities disruptlarge-scale coherent flows via generation of turbulence, while strong thermalfragmentation amplifies the resulting low-amplitude density perturbations, thusleading to small-scale, high-density fragments as seeds for {\em local} gravityto act upon. global gravity dominates only on the largest scales; large-scalegravitationally-driven flows promote the formation of groups and clusters ofstars formed by turbulence, thermal fragmentation, and rapid cooling.

astro-ph;0002106	thermal instability and the formation of clumpy gas clouds	the radiative cooling of optically thin gaseous regions and the formation ofa two-phase medium and of cold gas clouds with a clumpy substructure isinvestigated. in optically thin clouds, the growth rate of small isobaricdensity perturbations is independent of their length scale. however, the growthof a perturbation is limited by its transition from isobaric to isochoriccooling. the temperature at which this transition occurs decreases with thelength scale of the perturbation. consequently small scale perturbations havethe potential to reach higher amplitudes than large scale perturbations. whenthe amplitude becomes nonlinear, advection overtakes the pressure gradient inpromoting the compression resulting in an accelerated growth of thedisturbance. the critical temperature for transition depends on the initialamplitude. the fluctuations which can first reach nonlinearity before theirisobaric to isochoric transition will determine the characteristic size andmass of the cold dense clumps which would emerge from the cooling of aninitially nearly homogeneous region of gas. thermal conduction is in generalvery efficient in erasing isobaric, small-scale fluctuations, suppressing acooling instability. a weak, tangled magnetic field can however reduce theconductive heat flux enough for low-amplitude fluctuations to grow isobaricallyand become non-linear if their length scales are of order 0.01 pc. finally, wedemonstrate how a 2-phase medium, with cold clumps being pressure confined in adiffuse hot residual background component, would be sustained if there isadequate heating to compensate the energy loss.

astro-ph;0009132	the kinematics of 3:1-merger remnants and the formation of  low-luminosity elliptical galaxies	we test the formation of low-luminosity elliptical galaxies throughcollisionless mergers of unequal-mass disk galaxies. the kinematic propertiesof a small survey of simulated merger end-products with initial disk massratios of 3:1 is compared to a sample of seven low-luminosity galaxies observedby rix et al. that were chosen photometrically to be "ellipticals". in thispaper, we go beyond a comparison in terms of global properties (using onenumber to characterize a model or a galaxy e.g. &lt;a4&gt;, ellipticity at some fixedradius or central velocity dispersion) and examine the detailed kinematics asfunction of galactocentric distance. the merger remnants are ``observed''through a slit along the major and minor axis, using a pixel binning and slitwidth similar to the one used during the spectroscopic observations. we comparethe rotational support (v/sigma) of the merger remnants, the normalizedrotation on the minor axis and the major axis gauss-hermite moments h3, to thatof the observed galaxies. the n-body remnants are very flattened when viewededge-on (&lt;epsilon&gt; = 0.6) and should be inclined before making a faircomparison with the rix et al. data set (which has &lt;epsilon&gt; = 0.3). when themerger remnants are appropriately inclined, their v/sigma profiles rise slowerthan the observed ones. note that even when the remnants are viewed edge-on,the v/sigma profiles do not match the observations. the detailed comparison ofthe observations with purely collisionless 3:1-merger remnants suggests thatthis kind of dissipationless merger is not likely to be the dominant formationchannel for low-luminosity elliptical galaxies.

astro-ph;0101534	chemical evolution of the galaxy based on the oscillatory star formation  history	we model the star formation history (sfh) and the chemical evolution of thegalactic disk by combining an infall model and a limit-cycle model of theinterstellar medium (ism). recent observations have shown that the sfh of thegalactic disk violently variates or oscillates. we model the oscillatory sfhbased on the limit-cycle behavior of the fractional masses of three componentsof the ism. the observed period of the oscillation ($\sim 1$ gyr) is reproducedwithin the natural parameter range. this means that we can interpret theoscillatory sfh as the limit-cycle behavior of the ism. we then test thechemical evolution of stars and gas in the framework of the limit-cycle model,since the oscillatory behavior of the sfh may cause an oscillatory evolution ofthe metallicity. we find however that the oscillatory behavior of metallicityis not prominent because the metallicity reflects the past integrated sfh. thisindicates that the metallicity cannot be used to distinguish an oscillatory sfhfrom one without oscillations.

astro-ph;0106058	forming stars on a viscous timescale: the key to exponential stellar  profiles in disk galaxies?	we argue for implementing star formation on a viscous timescale inhydrodynamical simulations of disk galaxy formation and evolution. modellingtwo-dimensional isolated disk galaxies with the bhatnagar-gross-krook (bgk)hydrocode, we verify the analytic claim of various authors that if thecharacteristic timescale for star formation is equal to the viscous timescalein disks, the resulting stellar profile is exponential on several scale lengthswhatever the initial gas and dark matter profile. this casts new light on bothnumerical and semi-analytical disk formation simulations which either (a)commence star formation in an already exponential gaseous disk, (b) begin adisk simulation with conditions known to lead to an exponential, i.e. thecollapse of a spherically symmetric nearly uniform sphere of gas in solid bodyrotation under the assumption of specific angular momentum conservation, or (c)in simulations performed in a hierarchical context, tune their feedbackprocesses to delay disk formation until the dark matter halos are slowlyevolving and without much substructure so that the gas has the chance tocollapse under conditions known to give exponentials. in such models, starformation follows a schmidt-like law, which for lack of a suitable timescale,resorts to an efficiency parameter. with star formation prescribed on a viscoustimescale however, we find gas and star fractions after $\sim$ 12 gyr that areconsistent with observations without having to invoke any ``fudge factor'' forstar formation. our results strongly suggest that despite our gap inunderstanding the exact link between star formation and viscosity, the viscoustimescale is indeed the natural timescale for star formation.

astro-ph;0304085	a model for the jet-disk connection in bh accreting systems	based on theoretical arguments and quasi-stationary radiative mhdcalculations, a model for an accretion-powered jet is presented. it is arguedthat accretion disks around bhs consist of 1) a cold, keplerian-rotating andweakly magnetized mediumin the outer part, 2) a highly advective andturbulent-free plasma inside $r_\mm{tr}=10-20$ schwarzschild radii, wheremagnetic fields are predominantly of large scale topology and in excess ofthermal equipartition, and 3) an ion-dominated torus in the vicinity of thehole, where magnetic fields undergo a topological change into a monopolelike-configuration. the action of magnetic fields interior to $r_\mm{tr}$ is toinitiate torsional {\alfven} waves that extract angular momentum from thedisk-plasma and deposit it into the transition layer (-tl) above the disk,where the plasma is dissipative and tenuous. a significant fraction of theshear-generated toroidal magnetic field reconnects in the tl, thereby heatingthe plasma up to the virial-temperature and forming a super-keplerian rotating,and hence centrifugally accelerated outflow. the strong magnetic field in thetl forces the electrons to cool rapidly yielding thereby an ion-dominatedoutflow. the toroidal magnetic field in the tl is in thermal equipartition withthe ions, whereas the poloidal component is in equipartition with theelectrons. such a strong toroidal magnetic field is essential for increasingthe jet-disk luminosity in the radio regime.

astro-ph;0305190	role of clusters of galaxies in the evolution of the metal budget in the  universe	using the guidelines on sn element production provided by xmm-newton, wesummarize the results of asca observations on the element abundance in groupsand clusters of galaxies. we show that while the metal production in groupscould be described by a stellar population with a standard local imf, clustersof galaxies require a more top-heavy imf. we attribute an excess heavy elementproduction to an imf evolution with redshift. dating the galaxy formation inclusters by observations of the star-formation rate, we conclude that the imfvariations have occurred preferentially at z&gt;~4. we further combine ourmetallicity measurements with the mass function of clusters to estimate therole of clusters in the evolution of the metal content of the universe. weargue that at no epoch stars are a major container of metals, unless groups ofgalaxies are not representative for the star-formation. this lends furthersupport for the reduced (0.6 solar) mass-averaged oxygen abundance in thestellar population.

astro-ph;0309611	orbital parameters of merging dark matter halos	in order to specify cosmologically motivated initial conditions for majorgalaxy mergers (mass ratios $\leq$ 4:1) that are supposed to explain theformation of elliptical galaxies we study the orbital parameters of majormergers of cold dark matter halos using a high-resolution cosmologicalsimulation. almost half of all encounters are nearly parabolic witheccentricities $e \approx 1$ and no correlations between the halo spin planesor the orbital planes. the pericentric argument $\omega$ shows no correlationwith the other orbital parameters and is distributed randomly. in addition wefind that 50 % of typical pericenter distances are larger than half the halo'svirial radii which is much larger than typically assumed in numericalsimulations of galaxy mergers. in contrast to the usual assumption made insemi-analytic models of galaxy formation the circularities of major mergers arefound to be not randomly distributed but to peak around a value of $\epsilon\approx 0.5$. additionally all results are independent of the minimumprogenitor mass and major merger definitions (i.e. mass ratios $\leq$ 4:1; 3:1;2:1).

astro-ph;0401146	monte carlo simulations of the halo white dwarf population	the interpretation of microlensing results towards the large magellanic cloud(lmc) still remains controversial. whereas white dwarfs have been proposed toexplain these results and, hence, to contribute significantly to the massbudget of our galaxy, there are as well several constraints on the role playedby white dwarfs. in this paper we analyze self-consistently and simultaneouslyfour different results, namely, the local halo white dwarf luminosity function,the microlensing results reported by the macho team towards the lmc, theresults of hubble deep field (hdf) and the results of the eros experiment, forseveral initial mass functions and halo ages. we find that the proposedlog-normal initial mass functions do not contribute to solve the problem posedby the observed microlensing events and, moreover, they overproduce whitedwarfs when compared to the results of the hdf and of the eros survey. we alsofind that the contribution of hydrogen-rich white dwarfs to the dynamical massof the halo of the galaxy cannot be more than $\sim 4%$.

astro-ph;0501418	orbital structure of collisionless merger remnants: on the origin of  photometric and kinematic properties of elliptical and s0 galaxies	we present a detailed investigation of the relation between the orbitalcontent of merger remnants and observable properties of elliptical and s0galaxies. our analysis is based on the statistical sample of collisionlessmergers of disk galaxies with different mass ratios and orbital parameters,published by naab &amp; burkert. we use the spectral method by carpintero &amp; aguilarto determine the orbital content of every remnant and correlate it with itsintrinsic shape, and its projected kinematic and photometric properties. wediscuss the influence of the bulge component and varying pericenter distances.the two most abundant orbit classes are the minor axis tubes and the boxorbits. their ratio seems to determine the basic properties of a remnant. onaverage, the fraction of minor axis tubes increases by a factor of two from amerger mass ratio of 1:1 to 4:1, whereas the fraction of box orbits decreasesby 10%. at a given mass the central velocity dispersion of a remnant scaleswith the ratio of minor axis tubes to box orbits. interestingly, the divisionline between rotational supported systems and pressure supported objects,$(v_{maj}/\sigma_0)^*=0.7$, turns out to coincide with a box to minor axis tuberatio of unity. the observed $h_3$-$v/\sigma$ anti-correlation for ellipticalscan not be reproduced by collisionless merger remnants. we propose that thiscan only be reconciled by an additional physical process that significantlyreduces the box orbit content. remnants which are dominated by minor axis tubeorbits have predominantly disky projections. boxy remnants have always a box tominor axis tube ratio larger than one. this study will enable to identifyobserved ellipticals that could have formed, in the collisionless limit, bygas-poor disk mergers.

astro-ph;0505544	the formation of fossil galaxy groups in the hierarchical universe	we use a set of twelve high-resolution n-body/hydrodynamical simulations inthe $\lambda$cdm cosmology to investigate the origin and formation rate offossil groups (fgs), which are x-ray bright galaxy groups dominated by a largeelliptical galaxy, with the second brightest galaxy being at least twomagnitudes fainter. the simulations invoke star formation, chemical evolutionwith non-instantaneous recycling, metal dependent radiative cooling, strongstar burst driven galactic super winds, effects of a meta-galactic uv field andfull stellar population synthesis. we find an interesting correlation betweenthe magnitude gap between the first and second brightest galaxy and theformation time of the group. it is found that fgs have assembled half of theirfinal dark matter mass already at $z\ga1$, and subsequently typically grow byminor merging only, wheras non-fgs on average form later. the early assembly offgs leaves sufficient time for galaxies of $l \sim l_*$ to merge into thecentral one by dynamical friction, resulting in the large magnitude gap at$z=0$. a fraction of 33$\pm$16% of the groups simulated are found to be fossil,whereas the observational estimate is $\sim$10-20%. the fgs are found to bex-ray over-luminous relative to non-fgs of the same optical luminosity, inqualitative agreement with observations. finally, from a dynamical frictionanalysis is found that only because infall of $l \sim l_*$ galaxies happensalong filaments with small impact parameters do fgs exist at all.

astro-ph;0509707	evolution of local ultraluminous mergers from nir spectroscopy	we present results from our vlt large program to study the dynamicalevolution of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs). we have so far obtainednear-infrared high-resolution isaac spectra of 53 local ulirgs at severalmerger timescales and 12 palomar-green qsos (more than half of which areir-bright sources). we have extracted the stellar velocity dispersion androtational velocity along our slits to derive the kinematics of the merginggalaxies. these quantities enable us to answer the following questions aboutthe evolution of ulirgs: 1) what are the progenitor mass ratios?, 2) how do thestellar kinematics evolve?, and, 3) is there a connection between ulirgs andqsos? we find that the ultraluminous phase is mainly triggered by mergers ofapproximately equal mass galaxies, however, less violent minor mergers (ofprogenitor mass ratio ~3:1) also exist in our sample. dynamical heating of themerging hosts is observed as the stellar systematic rotation decreases withtime in favour of the increase of random motions. the merger remnants, beingdispersion-dominated systems with non-negligible rotation, resemble ellipticalgalaxies. placing ulirgs on the fundamental plane of early-type galaxies showsthat they resemble intermediate-mass ellipticals. after the nuclearcoalescence, the black hole masses of ulirgs, calculated from their relation tothe host dispersions, are of the order 10^7-10^8 m_sun. to investigate whetherulirgs go through a qso phase during their evolution, we perform a similar(preliminary) analysis of the ir-bright-qso kinematics. we find that theaverage dispersion of the ir-bright qsos is similar to that of the ulirgremnants, indicating that evolutionary links between the two populations mayexist.

astro-ph;0602005	how galaxies lose their angular momentum	the processes are investigated by which gas loses its angular momentum duringthe protogalactic collapse phase, leading to disk galaxies that are too compactwith respect to the observations. high-resolution n-body/sph simulations in acosmological context are presented including cold gas and dark matter. a halowith quiet merging activity since z~3.8 and with a high spin parameter isanalysed that should be an ideal candidate for the formation of an extendedgalactic disk. we show that the gas and the dark matter have similar specificangular momenta until a merger event occurs at z~2 with a mass ratio of 5:1.all the gas involved in the merger loses a substantial fraction of its specificangular momentum due to tidal torques and falls quickly into the center.dynamical friction plays a minor role,in contrast to previous claims. in fact,after this event a new extended disk begins to form from gas that was notinvolved in the 5:1 merger event and that falls in subsequently. we argue thatthe angular momentum problem of disk galaxy formation is a merger problem: incold dark matter cosmology substantial mergers with mass ratios of 1:1 to 6:1are expected to occur in almost all galaxies. we suggest that energeticfeedback processes could in principle solve this problem, however only if theheating occurs at the time or shortly before the last substantial merger event.good candidates for such a coordinated feedback would be a merger-triggeredstar burst or central black hole heating. if a large fraction of the lowangular momentum gas would be ejected as a result of these processes, late-typegalaxies could form with a dominant extended disk component, resulting fromlate infall, a small bulge-to-disk ratio and a low baryon fraction, inagreement with observations.

astro-ph;0609709	triggered star formation in the environment of young massive stars	recent observations with the spitzer space telescope show clear evidence thatstar formation takes place in the surrounding of young massive o-type stars,which are shaping their environment due to their powerful radiation and stellarwinds. in this work we investigate the effect of ionising radiation of massivestars on the ambient interstellar medium (ism): in particular we want toexamine whether the uv-radiation of o-type stars can lead to the observedpillar-like structures and can trigger star formation. we developed a newimplementation, based on a parallel smooth particle hydrodynamics code (calledivine), that allows an efficient treatment of the effect of ionising radiationfrom massive stars on their turbulent gaseous environment. here we presentfirst results at very high resolution. we show that ionising radiation cantrigger the collapse of an otherwise stable molecular cloud. the arisingstructures resemble observed structures (e.g. the pillars of creation in theeagle nebula (m16) or the horsehead nebula b33). including the effect ofgravitation we find small regions that can be identified as formation places ofindividual stars. we conclude that ionising radiation from massive stars alonecan trigger substantial star formation in molecular clouds.

astro-ph;0610949	magnetized non-linear thin shell instability: numerical studies in 2d	we revisit the analysis of the non-linear thin shell instability (ntsi)numerically, including magnetic fields. the magnetic tension force is expectedto work against the main driver of the ntsi -- namely transverse momentumtransport. however, depending on the field strength and orientation, theinstability may grow. for fields aligned with the inflow, we find that the ntsiis suppressed only when the alfv\'en speed surpasses the (supersonic)velocities generated along the collision interface. even for fieldsperpendicular to the inflow, which are the most effective at preventing thentsi from developing, internal structures form within the expanding slabinterface, probably leading to fragmentation in the presence of self-gravity orthermal instabilities. high reynolds numbers result in local turbulence withinthe perturbed slab, which in turn triggers reconnection and dissipation of theexcess magnetic flux. we find that when the magnetic field is initially alignedwith the flow, there exists a (weak) correlation between field strength and gasdensity. however, for transverse fields, this correlation essentially vanishes.in light of these results, our general conclusion is that instabilities areunlikely to be erased unless the magnetic energy in clouds is much larger thanthe turbulent energy. finally, while our study is motivated by the scenario ofmolecular cloud formation in colliding flows, our results span a larger rangeof applicability, from supernovae shells to colliding stellar winds.

astro-ph;9706092	protostellar fragmentation in a power-law density distribution	hydrodynamical calculations in three space dimensions of the collapse of anisothermal, rotating 1 m\sol protostellar cloud are presented. the initialdensity stratification is a power law with density $\rho \propto r^{-p}$, with$p=1$. the case of the singular isothermal sphere ($p=2$) is not considered;however $p=1$ has been shown observationally to be a good representation of thedensity distribution in molecular cloud cores just before the beginning ofcollapse. the collapse is studied with two independent numerical methods, ansph code with 200,000 particles, and a finite-difference code with nested gridswhich give high spatial resolution in the inner regions. although previousnumerical studies have indicated that such a power-law distribution would notresult in fragmentation into a binary system, both codes show, in contrast,that multiple fragmentation does occur in the central regions of the protostar.thus the process of binary formation by fragmentation is shown to be consistentwith the fact that a large fraction of young stars are observed to be in binaryor multiple systems.

astro-ph;9707343	dark baryons and rotation curves	the best measured rotation curve for any galaxy is that of the dwarfspiralxxxx ddo 154, which extends out to about 20 disk scale lengths. itprovides an ideal laboratory for testing the universal density profileprediction from high resolution numerical simulations of hierarchicalclustering in cold dark matter dominated cosmological models. we find that theobserved rotation curve cannot be fit either at small radii, as previouslynoted, or at large radii. we advocate a resolution of this dilemma bypostulating the existence of a dark spheroid of baryons amounting to severaltimes the mass of the observed disk component and comparable to that of thecold dark matter halo component. such an additional mass component provides anexcellent fit to the rotation curve provided that the outer halo is still colddark matter-dominated with a density profile and mass-radius scaling relationas predicted by standard cdm-dominated models. the universal existence of suchdark baryonic spheroidal components provides a natural explanation of theuniversal rotation curves observed in spiral galaxies, may have a similarorigin and composition to the local counterpart that has been detected asmachos in our own galactic halo via gravitational microlensing, and isconsistent with, and even motivated by, primordial nucleosynthesis estimates ofthe baryon fraction.

astro-ph;9906354	the origin and formation of cuspy density profiles through violent  relaxation of stellar systems	it is shown that the cuspy density distributions observed in the cores ofelliptical galaxies can be realized by dissipationless gravitational collapse.the initial models consist of power-law density spheres such as $\rho\proptor^{-1}$ with anisotropic velocity dispersions. collapse simulations are carriedout by integrating the collisionless boltzmann equation directly, on theassumption of spherical symmetry. from the results obtained, the extent ofconstant density cores, formed through violent relaxation, decreases as thevelocity anisotropy increases radially, and practically disappears forextremely radially anisotropic models. as a result, the relaxed densitydistributions become more cuspy with increasing radial velocity anisotropy. itis thus concluded that the velocity anisotropy could be a key ingredient forthe formation of density cusps in a dissipationless collapse picture. thevelocity dispersions increase with radius in the cores according to the nearlypower-law density distributions. the power-law index, $n$, of the densityprofiles, defined as $\rho\propto r^{-n}$, changes from $n\approx 2.1$ atintermediate radii, to a shallower power than $n\approx 2.1$ toward the centre.this density bend can be explained from our postulated local phase-spaceconstraint that the phase-space density accessible to the relaxed state isdetermined at each radius by the maximum phase-space density of the initialstate.

astro-ph;9907217	evidence for early stellar encounters in the orbital distribution of  edgeworth-kuiper belt objects	we have investigated effects of early stellar encounters on a protoplanetarydisk (planetesimal disk) and found that they can explain the higheccentricities and inclinations observed in the outer part ($&gt;42$au) of theedgeworth-kuiper belt (ekb). the proto-sun is considered as a member of astellar aggregation that undergoes dissolution on a timescale $\sim 10^8$yrs,such that a planetesimal disk experiences a flyby encounter at pericenterdistance ($q$) on the order of 100au. we simulated dynamical evolution of aplanetesimal (test particle) disk perturbed by a passing star. we show that thestellar encounter pumps the velocity dispersion in the disk in the outer parts($&gt; 0.25q$). planet formation is forestalled in that region. we also find thata stellar encounter with pericenter distance $q \sim 100-200$au could havepumped up the velocity dispersion of ekb objects outside 42au to the observedmagnitude while preserving that inside neptune's 3:2 mean-motion resonance(located at 39.5au), which allows for the efficient capture of objects by thesweeping of the 3:2 resonance during orbital migration by proto-neptune.

astro-ph;9910153	galactic bulges from hst-nicmos observations: ages and dust	we present optical and near-infrared colour maps of the central regions ofbulges of s0 and spiral galaxies obtained with wfpc2 and nicmos on the hst. bycombined use of hst and ground-based data the colour information spans from afew tens of pc to a few kpc. in almost all galaxies the colour profiles in thecentral 100-200 pc become more rapidly redder. we attribute the high centralcolour indices to a central concentration of dust. we infer an averageextinction at the center of a_v = 0.6 - 1.0 mag. several objects show centraldust rings or disks at sub-kpc scales similar to those found by others in giantellipticals. for galactic bulges of types s0 to sb, the tightness of the b-i vsi-h relation suggests that the age spread among bulges of early type galaxiesis small, of at most 2 gyr. colours at 1 r_eff, where we expect extinction tobe negligible are similar to than those of elliptical galaxies in the comacluster, suggesting that these bulges formed at the same time as the brightgalaxies in coma. furthermore the galaxy ages are found to be independent oftheir environment. since it is likely that coma was formed at redshift z &gt; 3,our bulges, which are in groups and in the field, also must have been formed atthis epoch. bulges of early-type spirals cannot be formed by secular evolutionof bars at recent epochs, since such bulges would be much younger. there arethree galaxies of type sbc and later, their bulges are younger and couldperhaps arise from secular evolution of transient bars. our results are in goodagreement with semi-analytic predictions (baugh et al. 1996, 1998, kauffmann1996), who also predict that bulges, in clusters and in the field, are as oldas giant ellipticals in clusters.

0809.5105	kinematics of planetary nebulae in the outskirts of the elliptical  galaxy ngc 4697	we describe the implementation of slitless radial velocity measurements ofextragalactic planetary nebulae (pns) with the 8.2 m subaru telescope and itscassegrain imaging spectrograph, focas. as a first application, we haveextended a previous search for pns in ngc 4697 to larger angular distances fromits center. a total of 218 pns were detected, and their radial velocities weremeasured. we have added 56 new pn detections to the existing sample of 535,observed previously with the eso vlt + fors imaging spectrograph; 36 of thesenew 56 pns are located at angular distances larger than 230 arcsec from thecenter of ngc 4697. we compare the new focas velocities with the earlier forsvelocities, for 158 of the 162 reobserved sources, finding good agreement. wenow have kinematic information extending out to 5 effective radii from thecenter. the outer line-of-sight velocity dispersion is a bit lower thanestimated earlier. this result is compatible with the existence of a darkmatter halo plus some degree of radial anisotropy, but the dark matter halo israther inconspicuous, and it is still unclear how massive it can be. a moredetailed global dynamical study of the whole set of pn velocities will berequired to decide if they permit to narrow down the range of possible darkmatter distributions in ngc 4697. the new radial velocities reveal no evidenceof rotation at 5 effective radii.

0811.2130	the flattening and the orbital structure of early-type galaxies and  collisionless n-body binary disk mergers	we use oblate axisymmetric dynamical models including dark halos to determinethe orbital structure of intermediate mass to massive coma early-type galaxies.we find a large variety of orbital compositions. averaged over all samplegalaxies the unordered stellar kinetic energy in the azimuthal and the radialdirection are of the same order, but they can differ by up to 40 percent inindividual systems. in contrast, both for rotating and non-rotating galaxiesthe vertical kinetic energy is on average smaller than in the other twodirections. this implies that even most of the rotating ellipticals areflattened by an anisotropy in the stellar velocity dispersions. usingthree-integral axisymmetric toy models we show that flattening by stellaranisotropy maximises the entropy for a given density distribution.collisionless disk merger remnants are radially anisotropic. the apparent lackof strong radial anisotropy in observed early-type galaxies implies that theymay not have formed from mergers of disks unless the influence of dissipationalprocesses was significant.
