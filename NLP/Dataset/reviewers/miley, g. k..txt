0901.3353	the growth and assembly of a massive galaxy at z ~ 2	we study the stellar mass assembly of the spiderweb galaxy (mrc 1138-262), amassive z = 2.2 radio galaxy in a protocluster and the probable progenitor of abrightest cluster galaxy. nearby protocluster galaxies are identified and theirproperties are determined by fitting stellar population models to theirrest-frame ultraviolet to optical spectral energy distributions. we find thatwithin 150 kpc of the radio galaxy the stellar mass is centrally concentratedin the radio galaxy, yet most of the dust-uncorrected, instantaneous starformation occurs in the surrounding low-mass satellite galaxies. we predictthat most of the galaxies within 150 kpc of the radio galaxy will merge withthe central radio galaxy by z = 0, increasing its stellar mass by up to afactor of ~ 2. however, it will take several hundred myr for the first mergersto occur, by which time the large star formation rates are likely to haveexhausted the gas reservoirs in the satellite galaxies. the tidal radii of thesatellite galaxies are small, suggesting that stars and gas are being strippedand deposited at distances of tens of kpc from the central radio galaxy. thesestripped stars may become intracluster stars or form an extended stellar haloaround the radio galaxy, such as those observed around cd galaxies in clustercores.

0909.1082	stellar masses of lyman break galaxies, lyman alpha emitters and radio  galaxies in overdense regions at z=4-6	we present new information on galaxies in the vicinity of luminous radiogalaxies and quasars at z=4,5,6. these fields were previously found to containoverdensities of lyman break galaxies (lbgs) or spectroscopic lyman alphaemitters. we use hst and spitzer data to infer stellar masses, and contrast ourresults with large samples of lbgs in more average environments as probed bythe great observatories origins deep survey (goods). the following results wereobtained. first, lbgs in both overdense regions and in the field at z=4-5 lieon a very similar sequence in a z'-[3.6] versus [3.6] color-magnitude diagram.this is interpreted as a sequence in stellar mass (log[m*/msun] = 9-11) inwhich galaxies become increasingly red due to dust and age as their starformation rate (sfr) increases. second, the two radio galaxies are among themost massive objects (log[m*/msun]~11) known to exist at z~4-5, and areextremely rare based on the low number density of such objects as estimatedfrom the ~25x larger area goods survey. we suggest that the presence of thesemassive galaxies and supermassive black holes has been boosted through rapidaccretion of gas or merging inside overdense regions. third, the total stellarmass found in the z=4 ``proto-cluster'' tn1338 accounts for &lt;30% of the stellarmass on the cluster red sequence expected to have formed at z&gt;4, based on acomparison with the massive x-ray cluster cl1252 at z=1.2. although futurenear-infrared observations should determine whether any massive galaxies arecurrently being missed, one possible explanation for this mass difference isthat tn1338 evolves into a smaller cluster than cl1252. this raises theinteresting question of whether the most massive protocluster regions at z&gt;4remain yet to be discovered.

1002.4198	a galaxy populations study of a radio-selected protocluster at z~3.1	we present a population study of several types of galaxies within theprotocluster surrounding the radio galaxy mrc0316-257 at z~3.1. in addition tothe known population of ly_alpha emitters (laes) and [oiii] emitters, we usecolour selection techniques to identify protocluster candidates that are lymanbreak galaxies (lbg) and balmer break galaxies (bbgs). the radio galaxy fieldcontains an excess of lbg candidates, with a surface density 1.6\pm0.3 timeslarger than found for comparable blank fields. this surface overdensitycorresponds to an lbg volume overdensity of ~8\pm4. the bbg photometricredshift distribution peaks at the protocluster's redshift, but we detect nosignificant surface overdensity of bbg. this is not surprising because a volumeoverdensity similar to the lbgs would have resulted in a surface density of~1.2 that found in the blank field. this could not have been detected in oursample. masses and star formation rates of the candidate protocluster galaxiesare determined using sed fitting. these properties are not significantlydifferent from those of field galaxies. the galaxies with the highest massesand star formation rates are located near the radio galaxy, indicating that theprotocluster environment influences galaxy evolution at z~3. we conclude thatthe protocluster around mrc0316-257 is still in the early stages of formation.

1008.4588	galaxy protocluster candidates around z ~ 2.4 radio galaxies	we study the environments of 6 radio galaxies at 2.2 &lt; z &lt; 2.6 usingwide-field near-infrared images. we use colour cuts to identify galaxies inthis redshift range, and find that three of the radio galaxies are surroundedby significant surface overdensities of such galaxies. the excess galaxies thatcomprise these overdensities are strongly clustered, suggesting they arephysically associated. the colour distribution of the galaxies responsible forthe overdensity are consistent with those of galaxies that lie within a narrowredshift range at z ~ 2.4. thus the excess galaxies are consistent with beingcompanions of the radio galaxies. the overdensities have estimated masses inexcess of 10^14 solar masses, and are dense enough to collapse into virizalisedstructures by the present day: these structures may evolve into groups orclusters of galaxies. a flux-limited sample of protocluster galaxies with k &lt;20.6 mag is derived by statistically subtracting the fore- and backgroundgalaxies. the colour distribution of the protocluster galaxies is bimodal,consisting of a dominant blue sequence, comprising 77 +/- 10% of the galaxies,and a poorly populated red sequence. the blue protocluster galaxies havesimilar colours to local star-forming irregular galaxies (u -v ~ 0.6),suggesting most protocluster galaxies are still forming stars at the observedepoch. the blue colours and lack of a dominant protocluster red sequenceimplies that these cluster galaxies form the bulk of their stars at z &lt; 3.

1103.4364	h-alpha emitters in z~2 proto-clusters: evidence for faster evolution in  dense environments	this is a study of h-alpha emitters in two dense galaxy proto-clusterssurrounding radio galaxies at z~2. we show that the proto-cluster surroundingmrc 1138-262 contains 14+/-2 times more h-alpha candidates than the averagefield (9 sigma significance), and the z=2.35 radio galaxy 4c+10.48 issurrounded by 12+/-2 times more emitters than the field (5 sigma), so it isalso likely to reside in a dense proto-cluster environment. we compared theseh-alpha emitters, situated in dense environments, to a control field sampleselected from 3 separate fields forming a total area of 172 arcmin^2. weconstructed and compared h-alpha and rest-frame r continuum luminosityfunctions of the emitters in both environments. the star formation density ison average 13 times greater in the proto-clusters than the field at z~2, so thetotal star formation rate within the central 1.5mpc of the proto-clustersexceeds 3000msun/yr. however, we found no significant difference in the shapeof the h-alpha luminosity functions, implying that environment does notsubstantially affect the strength of the h-alpha line from strongly starforming galaxies. the proto-cluster emitters are typically 0.8mag brighter inrest-frame r continuum than field emitters, implying they are twice as massiveas their field counterparts at the same redshift. we also show theproto-cluster galaxies have lower specific star formation rates than fieldgalaxies, meaning the emitters in the dense environments formed more of theirstars earlier than the field galaxies. we conclude that galaxy growth in theearly universe was accelerated in dense environments, and that cluster galaxiesdiffered from field galaxies even before the cluster had fully formed.

1104.1176	a sinfoni view of flies in the spiderweb: a galaxy cluster in the making	the environment of the high-z radio galaxy pks 1138-262 at z~2.2 is a primeexample of a forming galaxy cluster. we use deep sinfoni data to perform adetailed study of the kinematics of the galaxies within 60 kpc of the radiocore and we link this to the kinematics of the protocluster on the megaparsecscale. identification of optical emission lines shows that 11 galaxies are atthe redshift of the protocluster. the density of line emitters is more than anorder of magnitude higher in the core of the protocluster than the larger scaleenvironment. this implies a matter overdensity in the core of delta_m~70 whichis similar to the outskirts of local galaxy clusters. the velocity distributionof the confirmed satellite galaxies shows a broad, double-peaked velocitystructure with sigma=1360+/-206 km/s. a similar broad, double-peakeddistribution was found in a previous study targeting the large scaleprotocluster structure, indicating that a common process is acting on bothsmall and large scales. including all spectroscopically confirmed protoclustergalaxies, a velocity dispersion of 1013+/-87 km/s is found. we show that theprotocluster has likely decoupled from the hubble flow and is a dynamicallyevolved structure. comparison to the millenium simulation indicates that theprotocluster velocity distribution is consistent with that of the most massivehaloes at z~2, but we rule out that the protocluster is a fully virializedstructure based on dynamical arguments and its x-ray luminosity. comparison tomerging haloes in the millennium simulation shows that the structure asobserved in and around the spiderweb galaxy is best interpreted as being theresult of a merger between two massive haloes. we propose that this merger canresult in an increase in star formation and agn activity in the protoclustercore and is possibly an important stage in the evolution of massive cdgalaxies.

1106.5495	discovery of a high-z protocluster with tunable filters: the case of  6c0140+326 at z=4.4	we present the first results obtained using a tunable narrowband filter inthe search for high-z protoclusters. using the recently commissioned redtunable filter on the gran telescopio canarias we have searched for lyaemitters in a 75 arcmin^2 field centered on the z=4.413 radio galaxy6c0140+326. with three different wavelength tunings we find a total of 27unique candidate lya emitters. the availability of three different wavelengthtunings allows us to make estimates of the redshifts for each of the objects.it also allows us to separate a possible protocluster from structure in theimmediate foreground. this division shows that the foreground region containssignificantly fewer lya emitters. also, the spatial distribution of the objectsin the protocluster field deviates from a random distribution at the 2.5 sigmalevel. the observed redshift distribution of the emitters is different from theexpected distribution of a blank field at the ~3 sigma level, with the lyaemitters concentrated near the radio galaxy at z&gt;4.38. the 6c0140+326 field isdenser by a factor of 9+/-5 than a blank field, and the number density of lyaemitters close to the radio galaxy is similar to that of the z~4.1 protoclusteraround tnj1338-1942. we thus conclude that there is an overdensity of lyaemitters around the radio galaxy 6c0140+326. this is one of few knownoverdensities at such a high redshift.

0710.4553	diffuse uv light associated with the spiderweb galaxy: evidence for  in-situ star formation outside galaxies	we present detailed images of diffuse uv intergalactic light (igl), situatedin a 60kpc halo that surrounds the radio galaxy mrc 1138-262 at z=2. we discussthe nature of the igl and rule out faint cluster galaxies, nebular continuumemission, synchrotron, inverse compton emission and scattering of galacticstellar light as possible sources of the igl. dust scattered quasar light is anunlikely possibility that cannot be ruled out entirely. we conclude that thesource of the igl is most likely to be a young stellar population distributedin a halo encompassing the radio and satellite galaxies, undergoing starformation at a rate greater than 57 msun/yr. within 70kpc of the radio core,approximately 44% of the star formation that is traced by uv light occurs inthis diffuse mode. the average uv colour of the igl is bluer than the averagegalaxy colour, and there is a trend for the igl to become bluer with increasingradius from the radio galaxy. both the galaxies and the igl show a uvcolour--surface brightness relation which can be obtained by variations ineither stellar population age or extinction. these observations show adifferent, but potentially important mode of star formation, that is diffuse innature. star formation, as traced by uv light, occurs in two modes in the highredshift universe: one in the usual lyman break galaxy clump-like mode on kpcscales, and the other in a diffuse mode over a large region surrounding massivegrowing galaxies. such a mode of star formation can easily be missed by highangular resolution observations that are well suited for detecting high surfacebrightness compact galaxies. extrapolating from these results, it is possiblethat a significant amount of star formation occurs in large extended regionswithin the halos of the most massive galaxies forming at high redshift.

1203.2196	a z~3 radio galaxy and its protocluster: evidence for a superstructure?	we present spectroscopic follow-up observations of lyman break galaxies(lbgs) selected in the field surrounding the radio galaxy mrc0316-257 at z~3.13(0316). robust spectroscopic redshifts are determined for 20 out of 24 objects.three of the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies have 3.12&lt;z&lt;3.13 indicatingthat these objects reside in a protocluster structure previously found aroundthe radio galaxy. an additional 5 objects are found 1600 km/s blue-shifted withrespect to the main protocluster structure. this is in addition to three [oiii]emitters found at this redshift in a previous study. this is further evidencethat a structure exists directly in front of the 0316 protocluster. we estimatethat the foreground structure is responsible for half of the surfaceoverdensity of lbgs found in the field as a whole. the foreground structure isassociated with a strong surface density peak 1.4 mpc to the north-west of theradio galaxy and a 2d kolmogorov-smirnov test indicates that the spatialdistributions of the 0316 and foreground galaxies differ at the 3 sigma level.in addition, we compare the properties of protocluster, foreground structureand field galaxies, but we find no significant differences. in terms of thenature of the two structures, a merger scenario is a possible option. simplemerger dynamics indicates that the observed relative velocity of 1600 km/s canbe reproduced if the two structures have masses of ~5x10^14 msun and havestarting separations of around 2.5 to 3 mpc. it is also possible that theforeground structure is unrelated to the 0316 protocluster in which case thetwo structures will not interact before z=0.

1411.7680	subarcsecond international lofar radio images of the m82 nucleus at 118  mhz and 154 mhz	the nuclear starburst in the nearby galaxy m82 provides an excellentlaboratory for understanding the physics of star formation. this galaxy hasbeen extensively observed in the past, revealing tens of radio-bright compactobjects embedded in a diffuse free-free absorbing medium. our understanding ofthe structure and physics of this medium in m82 can be greatly improved byhigh-resolution images at low frequencies where the effects of free-freeabsorption are most prominent.  the aims of this study are, firstly, to demonstrate imaging usinginternational baselines of the low frequency array (lofar), and secondly, toconstrain low-frequency spectra of compact and diffuse emission in the centralstarburst region of m82 via high-resolution radio imaging at low frequencies.  the international lofar telescope was used to observe m82 at 110-126mhz and146-162mhz. images were obtained using standard techniques from very longbaseline interferometry. images were obtained at each frequency range: one onlyusing international baselines, and one only using the longest dutch (remote)baselines.  the 154mhz image obtained using international baselines is a new imagingrecord in terms of combined image resolution (0.3$"$) and sensitivity($\sigma$=0.15mjy/beam) at low frequencies ($&lt;327$mhz). we detected 16 objectsat 154mhz, six of these also at 118mhz. four weaker but resolved features arealso found: a linear (50pc) filament and three other resolved objects, of whichtwo show a clear shell structure. we do not detect any emission from eithersupernova 2008iz or from the radio transient source 43.78+59.3. the imagesobtained using remote baselines show diffuse emission, associated with theoutflow in m82, with reduced brightness in the region of the edge-onstar-forming disk.

0807.0152	[oiii] emitters in the field of the mrc 0316-257 protocluster	venemans et al. (2005) found evidence for an overdensity of ly-alpha emissionline galaxies associated with the radio galaxy mrc 0316-257 at z=3.13indicating the presence of a massive protocluster. here, we present the resultsof a search for additional star-forming galaxies and agn within theprotocluster. narrow-band infrared imaging was used to select candidate [o iii]emitters in a 1.1 x 1.1 mpc^2 region around the radio galaxy. thirteencandidates have been detected. four of these are among the previously confirmedsample of ly-alpha galaxies, and an additional three have been confirmedthrough follow-up infrared spectroscopy. the three newly confirmed objects liewithin a few hundred km/s of each other, but are blueshifted with respect tothe radio galaxy and ly-alpha emitters by ~2100 km/s. although the sample iscurrently small, our results indicate that the radio-selected protocluster isforming at the centre of a larger, ~60 co-moving mpc super-structure. on thebasis of an hst/acs imaging study we calculate dust-corrected star-formationrates and investigate morphologies and sizes of the [o iii] candidate emitters.from a comparison of the star formation rate derived from uv-continuum and [oiii] emission, we conclude that at least two of the [o iii] galaxies harbour anagn which ionized the o+ gas.

astro-ph;0005524	vla radio continuum observations of a new sample of high redshift radio  galaxies	we present new deep multi-frequency radio-polarimetric images of a sample ofhigh redshift radio galaxies (hzrgs), having redshift between 1.7 and 4.1. theradio data at 4.7 and 8.2 ghz were taken with the very large array in the aconfiguration and provide a highest angular resolution of 0.2''. maps of totalintensity, radio spectral index, radio polarization and internal magnetic fieldare presented for each source. the morphology of most objects is that ofstandard frii double radio sources, but several contain multiple hot-spots inone or both lobes. compared to similar samples of hzrgs previously imaged,there is a higher fraction (29%) of compact steep spectrum sources (i.e.sources with a projected linear size less than 20 kpc). radio cores areidentified in about half of the sample and tend to have relatively steepspectra (alpha &lt; -1). polarization is detected in all but 4 sources, withtypical polarization at 8.2 ghz of around 10-20%. the faraday rotation can bemeasured in most of the radio galaxies: the observed rotation measure (rm) of 8radio sources exceeds 100 rad m^{-2} in at least one of the lobes, with largegradients between the two lobes. we find no dependence of faraday rotation withother properties of the radio sources. if the origin of the faraday rotation islocal to the sources, as we believe, then the intrinsic rm is more than a 1000rad m^{-2}. because low redshift radio galaxies residing at the center ofclusters usually show extreme rms, we suggest that the high-z large rm sourcesalso lie in very dense environments. finally, we find that the fraction ofpowerful radio galaxies with extreme faraday rotation increases with redshift,as would be expected if their average environment tends to become denser withdecreasing cosmic epoch.

(2000), showsthat the normal to the dust disk in the nucleus is ~30 degrees from the planeof the sky and within 12 degrees of parallel to the overall orientation of theradio source. we suggest that the radio axis is also at an angle of ~30 degreesto the plane of the sky and that the north-west jet is on the approaching side.this orientation implies an overall size of 4.5 mpc (h_o = 75 km/s/mpc, q_o =0.5) for 3c236. the coincidence of a dust feature and the south-east compactjet, within the astrometric errors, leads us to suggest that the dust may be inthe form of a cloud encountered by the jet in the first ~400 pc of its journeyout from the nucleus. one-sided emission at 5 ghz on 1 mas scales would suggestthat the jets are ejected initially at &lt;= 35 degrees to the line of sight, butthis is difficult to reconcile with the obvious orientation stability of thejet system as a whole. free-free absorption of the counter-jet may be analternative explanation for the one-sideness.

astro-ph;0102337	observations of radio galaxy mrc 1138-262: merging galaxies embedded in  a giant lyman alpha halo	the radio galaxy mrc 1138-262 at z=2.16 is most likely a brightest clustergalaxy in an early stage of evolution. here we present observations of theluminous emission line halo and the stellar components of this radio galaxy.optical narrow band imaging shows a very extended (about 160 kpc) and luminouslyman alpha halo. infrared narrow band imaging reveals a much smaller h alphahalo with a very different morphology. we advocate a model in which the innerpart of the halo is photoionized by direct agn illumination or by uv photonsfrom young stars. far from the nucleus (about 25 kpc), there is a region ofgreatly enhanced lyman alpha emission. at this location, it is likely thatshock ionization is important as indicated by a bend in the radio jet.spectroscopy of several continuum clumps in the halo shows that, although thereare striking differences between the emission and absorption features of thespectra of various regions, they have properties similar to those oflyman-break galaxies. this is further evidence for a scenario in which massivegalaxies form hierarchically from smaller building blocks.

astro-ph;0111193	the x-ray -- radio alignment in the z = 2.2 radio galaxy pks 1138--262	we present high resolution x-ray observations of the narrow line radio galaxypks 1138-262 at z = 2.156 with the acis-s detector on the chandra observatory.these observations show that the x-ray emission from 1138-262 is dominated byemission from the agn with a (rest frame) 2 to 10 kev luminosity of 4x10^{45}erg/s. the relative x-ray and radio properties of the agn in 1138-262 aresimilar to those seen for the agn in the archetype powerful radio galaxy cygnusa. between 10% and 25% (depending on energy) of the x-ray emission from1138--262 is spatially extended on scales of 10'' to 20''. the extended x-rayemission is elongated, with a major axis aligned with that of the radio source.while the x-ray and radio emissions are elongated on similar scales andposition angles, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the radio andx-ray features in the source. the most likely origin for the extended x-rayemission in 1138-262 is thermal emission from shocked gas, although we cannotrule-out a contribution from inverse compton emission. if the emission is fromhot gas, the gas density is 0.05 cm^{-3} and the gas mass is 2.5x10^{12}m_solar. the pressure in this hot gas is adequate to confine the radio emittingplasma and the optical line emitting gas. we set an upper limit of 1.5x10^{44}erg/s to the 2 to 10 kev luminosity of any normal cluster atmosphere associatedwith 1138-262. no emission was detected from any of the ly alpha emittinggalaxies in the (proto-) cluster around 1138-262, outside of the ly alpha haloof 1138-262 itself, to a 2 to 10kev luminosity limit of 1.2x10^{43}erg/s.

astro-ph;0306215	star formation at z~6: i-dropouts in the acs gto fields	using an i-z dropout criterion, we determine the space density of z~6galaxies from two deep acs gto fields with deep optical-ir imaging. a total of23 objects are found over 46 arcmin^2, or ~0.5 objects/arcmin^2 down to z~27.3(6 sigma; all ab mag) (including one probable z~6 agn). combining deep isaacdata for our rdcs1252-2927 field (j~25.7 and ks~25.0 (5 sigma)) and nicmos datafor the hdf north (jh~27.3 (5 sigma)), we verify that these dropouts have flatspectral slopes. i-dropouts in our sample range in luminosity from ~1.5 l*(z~25.6) to ~0.3 l* (z~27.3) with the exception of one very bright candidate atz~24.2. the half-light radii vary from 0.09" to 0.29", or 0.5 kpc to 1.7 kpc.we derive the z~6 rest-frame uv luminosity density using three differentprocedures, each utilizing simulations based on a cdf south v dropout sample.first, we compare our findings with a no-evolution projection of this v-dropoutsample. we find 23+/-25% more i-dropouts than we predict. adopting previousresults to z~5, this works out to a 20+/-29% drop in the luminosity densityfrom z~3 to z~6. second, we use these same v-dropout simulations to derive aselection function for our i-dropout sample and compute the uv-luminositydensity (7.2+/-2.5 x 10^25 ergs/s/hz/mpc^3 down to z~27). we find a 39+/-21%drop over the same redshift range. this is our preferred value and suggests astar formation rate of 0.0090+/-0.0031 m_sol/yr/mpc^3 to z~27, or ~0.036+/-0.012 m_sol/yr/mpc^3 extrapolating the lf to the faint limit. third, we followa very similar procedure, but assume no incompleteness, finding a luminositydensity which is ~2-3x lower. this final estimate constitutes a lower limit.all three estimates are within the canonical range of luminosity densitiesnecessary for reionization of the universe at this epoch.

astro-ph;0309036	advanced camera for surveys photometry of the cluster rdcs1252.9-2927:  the color-magnitude relation at z=1.24	we investigate the color-magnitude (cm) relation of galaxies in the distantx-ray selected cluster rdcs1252.9-2927 at z=1.24 using images obtained with theadvanced camera for surveys (acs) on the hubble space telescope in the f775wand f850lp bandpasses. we select galaxies based on morphologicalclassifications extending about 3.5 mag down the galaxy luminosity function,augmented by spectroscopic membership information. at the core of the clusteris an extensive early-type galaxy population surrounding a central pair ofgalaxies that show signs of dynamical interaction. the early-type populationdefines a tight sequence in the cm diagram, with an intrinsic scatter inobserved (i-z) of $0.029\pm0.007$ mag based on 52 galaxies, or $0.024\pm0.008$mag for $\sim30$ ellipticals. simulations using the latest stellar populationmodels indicate an age scatter for the ellipticals of about 34%, with a meanage $\taul\gta2.6$ gyr (corresponding to $z_l\gta2.7$), and the last starformation occurring at $z_{end}\gta1.5$. transforming to rest-frame $(u-b)$, weconclude that the slope and scatter in the cm relation for morphologicallyselected early-type galaxies show little or no evidence for evolution out to$z\approx1.2$. thus, elliptical galaxies were already well established in x-rayluminous clusters when the universe was a third of its present age.

astro-ph;0311323	discovery of globular clusters in the proto-spiral ngc2915: implications  for hierarchical galaxy evolution	we have discovered three globular clusters beyond the holmberg radius inhubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys images of the gas-rich darkmatter dominated blue compact dwarf galaxy ngc2915. the clusters, all of whichstart to resolve into stars, have m_{v606} = -8.9 to -9.8 mag, significantlybrighter than the peak of the luminosity function of milky way globularclusters. their colors suggest a metallicity [fe/h] ~ -1.9 dex, typical ofmetal-poor galactic globular clusters. the specific frequency of clusters is ata minimum normal, compared to spiral galaxies. however, since only a smallportion of the system has been surveyed it is more likely that the luminosityand mass normalized cluster content is higher, like that seen in ellipticalgalaxies and galaxy clusters. this suggests that ngc2915 resembles a key phasein the early hierarchical assembly of galaxies - the epoch when much of the oldstellar population has formed, but little of the stellar disk. depending on thesubsequent interaction history, such systems could go on to build-up largerelliptical galaxies, evolve into normal spirals, or in rare circumstancesremain suspended in their development to become systems like ngc2915.

astro-ph;0405326	internal color properties of resolved spheroids in the deep hst/acs  field of ugc 10214	(abridged) we study the internal color properties of a morphologicallyselected sample of spheroidal galaxies taken from hst/acs ero program of ugc10214 (``the tadpole''). by taking advantage of the unprecedented highresolution of the acs in this very deep dataset we are able to characterizespheroids at sub-arcseconds scales. using the v_606w and i_814w bands, weconstruct v-i color maps and extract color gradients for a sample of spheroidsat i_814w &lt; 24 mag. we investigate the existence of a population ofmorphologically classified spheroids which show extreme variation in theirinternal color properties similar to the ones reported in the hdfs. these aredisplayed as blue cores and inverse color gradients with respect to thoseaccounted from metallicity variations. following the same analysis we find asimilar fraction of early-type systems (~30%-40%) that show non-homologousinternal colors, suggestive of recent star formation activity. we present twostatistics to quantify the internal color variation in galaxies and for tracingblue cores, from which we estimate the fraction of non-homogeneous tohomogeneous internal colors as a function of redshift up to z&lt;1.2. we find thatit can be described as about constant as a function of redshift, with a smallincrease with redshift for the fraction of spheroids that present strong colordispersions. the implications of a constant fraction at all redshifts suggeststhe existence of a relatively permanent population of evolving spheroids up toz~1. we discuss the implications of this in the context of spheroidalformation.

astro-ph;0406613	ultra compact dwarf galaxies in abell 1689: a photometric study with the  acs	the properties of ultra compact dwarf (ucd) galaxy candidates in abell 1689(z=0.183) are investigated, based on deep high resolution acs images. a ucdcandidate has to be unresolved, have i&lt;28 (m_v&lt;-11.5) mag and satisfy colorlimits derived from bayesian photometric redshifts. we find 160 ucd candidateswith 22&lt;i&lt;28 mag. it is estimated that about 100 of these are cluster members,based on their spatial distribution and photometric redshifts. for i&gt;26.8 mag,the radial and luminosity distribution of the ucd candidates can be explainedwell by abell 1689's globular cluster (gc) system. for i&lt;26.8 mag, there is anoverpopulation of 15 +/- 5 ucd candidates with respect to the gc luminosityfunction. for i&lt;26 mag, the radial distribution of ucd candidates is moreconsistent with the dwarf galaxy population than with the gc system of abell1689. the ucd candidates follow a color-magnitude trend with a slope similar tothat of abell 1689's genuine dwarf galaxy population, but shifted fainter byabout 2-3 mag. two of the three brightest ucd candidates (m_v ~ -17 mag) areslightly resolved. at the distance of abell 1689, these two objects would haveking-profile core radii of ~35 pc and r_eff ~300 pc, implying luminosities andsizes 2-3 times those of m32's bulge. additional photometric redshifts obtainedwith late type stellar and elliptical galaxy templates support the assignmentof these two resolved sources to abell 1689. our findings imply that in abell1689 there are at least 10 ucds with m_v&lt;-12.7 mag. compared to the ucds in thefornax cluster they are brighter, larger and have colors closer to normal dwarfgalaxies. this suggests that they may be in an intermediate stage of thestripping process. spectroscopy is needed to definitely confirm the existenceof ucds in abell 1689.

astro-ph;0407644	the luminosity function of early-type galaxies at z~0.75	we measure the luminosity function of morphologically selected e/s0 galaxiesfrom $z=0.5$ to $z=1.0$ using deep high resolution advanced camera for surveysimaging data. our analysis covers an area of $48\box\arcmin$ (8$\times$ thearea of the hdf-n) and extends 2 magnitudes deeper ($i\sim24$ mag) than waspossible in the deep groth strip survey (dgss). at $0.5&lt;z&lt;0.75$, we find$m_b^*-5\log h_{0.7}=-21.1\pm0.3$ and $\alpha=-0.53\pm0.2$, and at$0.75&lt;z&lt;1.0$, we find $m_b^*-5\log h_{0.7}=-21.4\pm0.2$. these luminosityfunctions are similar in both shape and number density to the luminosityfunction using morphological selection (e.g., dgss), but are much steeper thanthe luminosity functions of samples selected using morphological proxies likethe color or spectral energy distribution (e.g., cfrs, cadis, or combo-17). thedifference is due to the `blue', $(u-v)_0&lt;1.7$, e/s0 galaxies, which make up to$\sim30%$ of the sample at all magnitudes and an increasing proportion of faintgalaxies. we thereby demonstrate the need for {\it both morphological andstructural information} to constrain the evolution of galaxies.  we find that the `blue' e/s0 galaxies have the same average sizes and sersicparameters as the `red', $(u-v)_0&gt;1.7$, e/s0 galaxies at brighter luminosities($m_b&lt;-20.1$), but are increasingly different at fainter magnitudes where`blue' galaxies are both smaller and have lower sersic parameters. fits of thecolors to stellar population models suggest that most e/s0 galaxies have shortstar-formation time scales ($\tau&lt;1$ gyr), and that galaxies have formed at anincreasing rate from $z\sim8$ until $z\sim2$ after which there has been agradual decline.

astro-ph;0410203	a search for clusters at high redshift - iv. spectroscopy of h-alpha  emitters in a proto-cluster at z=2.16	radio galaxy pks 1138-262 is a massive galaxy at z=2.16, located in a denseenvironment. we have found an overdensity of ly-alpha emitting galaxies in thisfield, consistent with a proto-cluster structure associated with the radiogalaxy. recently, we have discovered forty candidate h-alpha emitters by theirexcess near infrared narrow band flux. here, we present infrared spectroscopyof nine of the brightest candidate h-alpha emitters. all these candidates showan emission line at the expected wavelength. the identification of three ofthese lines with h-alpha is confirmed by accompanying [nii] emission. thespectra of the other candidates are consistent with h-alpha emission at z~2.15,one being a qso as indicated by the broadness of its emission line. thevelocity dispersion of the emitters (360 km/s) is significantly smaller thanthat of the narrow band filter used for their selection (1600 km/s). wetherefore conclude that the emitters are associated with the radio galaxy. thestar formation rates (sfrs) deduced from the h-alpha flux are in the range 6-44m_solar/yr and the sfr density observed is 5-10 times higher than in the hdf-nat z=2.23. the properties of the narrow emission lines indicate that theemitters are powered by star formation and contain very young (&lt; 100 myr)stellar populations with moderately high metallicities.

astro-ph;0411516	the luminosity functions of the galaxy cluster ms1054-0321 at z=0.83  based on acs photometry	we present new measurements of the galaxy luminosity function (lf) and itsdependence on local galaxy density, color, morphology, and clustocentric radiusfor the massive z=0.83 cluster ms1054-0321. our analyses are based on imagingperformed with the acs onboard the hst in the f606w, f775w and f850lp passbandsand extensive spectroscopic data obtained with the keck lris. our main resultsare based on a spectroscopically selected sample of 143 cluster members withmorphological classifications derived from the acs observations. our threeprimary findings are (1) the faint-end slope of the lf is steepest in thebluest filter, (2) the lf in the inner part of the cluster (or highest densityregions) has a flatter faint-end slope, and (3) the fraction of early-typegalaxies is higher at the bright end of the lf, and gradually decreases towardfainter magnitudes. these characteristics are consistent with those in localgalaxy clusters, indicating that, at least in massive clusters, the commoncharacteristics of cluster lfs are established at z=0.83. we also find a 2sigmadeficit of intrinsically faint, red galaxies (i-z&gt;0.5, mi&gt;-19) in this cluster.this trend may suggest that faint, red galaxies (which are common in z&lt;0.1 richclusters) have not yet been created in this cluster at z=0.83. thegiant-to-dwarf ratio in ms1054-0321 starts to increase inwards of the virialradius or when sigma&gt;30 mpc^-2, coinciding with the environment where thegalaxy star formation rate and the morphology-density relation start to appear.(abridged)

astro-ph;0606298	large-scale structure of lyman break galaxies around a radio galaxy  protocluster at z~4	we present broad-band imaging with the subaru telescope of a 25'x25' fieldsurrounding the radio galaxy tn j1338-1942 at redshift z=4.1. the fieldcontains excesses of lyman-alpha emitters (laes) and lyman break galaxies(lbgs) identified with a protocluster surrounding the radio galaxy. our newwide-field images provide information about the boundary of the protoclusterand its surroundings. there are 874 candidate lbgs within our field, havingredshifts in the range z=3.5-4.5. an examination of the brightest of these(with i'&lt; 25.0) shows that the most prominent concentration coincides with thepreviously discovered protocluster. the diameter of this galaxy overdensitycorresponds to ~2 mpc at z=4, consistent with the previous estimation usinglaes. several other concentrations of lbgs are observed in the field, some ofwhich may well be physically connected with the z=4.1 protocluster. theobserved structure in the smoothed lbg distribution can be explained as theprojection of large-scale structure, within the redshift range z=3.5-4.5,comprising compact overdensities and prominent larger voids. if the 5-8observed compact overdensities are associated with protoclusters, the observedprotocluster volume density is ~5x10^-6 mpc^-3, similar to the volume densityof rich clusters in the local universe.

astro-ph;0610596	lofar - opening up a new window on the universe	lofar, the low frequency array, is a next-generation radio telescope that isbeing built in northern europe and expected to be fully operational at the endof this decade. it will operate at frequencies from 15 to 240 mhz(corresponding to wavelengths of 20 to 1.2 m). its superb sensitivity, highangular resolution, large field of view and flexible spectroscopic capabilitieswill represent a dramatic improvement over previous facilities at thesewavelengths. as such, lofar will carry out a broad range of fundamentalastrophysical studies.  the design of lofar has been driven by four fundamental astrophysicalapplications: (i) the epoch of reionisation, (ii) extragalactic surveys andtheir exploitation to study the formation and evolution of clusters, galaxiesand black holes, (iii) transient sources and their association with high energyobjects such as gamma ray bursts, and (iv) cosmic ray showers and theirexploitation to study the origin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. in thisconference the foreseen lofar work on the epoch of reionisation has beencovered by de bruyn and on cosmic ray showers by falcke.  during this contribution we will first present the lofar project with anemphasis on the challenges faced when carrying out sensitive imaging at lowradio frequencies. subsequently, we will discuss lofar's capabilities to surveythe low-frequency radio sky. main aims for the planned surveys are studies ofz&gt;6 radio galaxies, diffuse emission associated with distant clusters andstarbursting galaxies at z&gt;2.

astro-ph;0610652	a very brief description of lofar - the low frequency array	lofar (low frequency array) is an innovative radio telescope optimized forthe frequency range 30-240 mhz. the telescope is realized as a phased aperturearray without any moving parts. digital beam forming allows the telescope topoint to any part of the sky within a second. transient buffering makesretrospective imaging of explosive short-term events possible. the scientificfocus of lofar will initially be on four key science projects (ksps): 1)detection of the formation of the very first stars and galaxies in the universeduring the so-called epoch of reionization by measuring the power spectrum ofthe neutral hydrogen 21-cm line (shaver et al. 1999) on the ~5' scale; 2)low-frequency surveys of the sky with of order $10^8$ expected new sources; 3)all-sky monitoring and detection of transient radio sources such as gamma-raybursts, x-ray binaries, and exo-planets (farrell et al. 2004); and 4) radiodetection of ultra-high energy cosmic rays and neutrinos (falcke &amp; gorham 2003)allowing for the first time access to particles beyond 10^21 ev (scholten etal. 2006). apart from the ksps open access for smaller projects is alsoplanned. here we give a brief description of the telescope.

astro-ph;0610909	the spiderweb galaxy: a forming massive cluster galaxy at z~2	we present a deep image of the radio galaxy mrc 1138-262 taken with thehubble space telescope (hst) at a redshift of z = 2.2. the galaxy is known tohave properties of a cd galaxy progenitor and be surrounded by a 3 mpc-sizedstructure, identified with a protocluster. the morphology shown on the new deephst/acs image is reminiscent of a spider's web. more than 10 individual clumpyfeatures are observed, apparently star-forming satellite galaxies in theprocess of merging with the progenitor of a dominant cluster galaxy 11 gyr ago.there is an extended emission component, implying that star formation wasoccurring over a 50 times 40 kpc region at a rate of more than 100 m_sun/yr. astriking feature of the newly named ``spiderweb galaxy'' is the presence ofseveral faint linear galaxies within the merging structure. the denseenvironments and fast galaxy motions at the centres of protoclusters maystimulate the formation of these structures, which dominate the faint resolvedgalaxy populations in the hubble ultra deep field. the new image provides aunique testbed for simulations of forming dominant cluster galaxies.

astro-ph;9608063	spectroscopy of ultra--steep spectrum radio sources: a sample of z&gt;2  radio galaxies	we present spectroscopic observations for 64 radio galaxies having ultrasteep radio spectra. twenty-nine objects have redshifts $z&gt;2$, the largestredshifts being almost 4. our ultra steep spectrum (uss) criterion ($\alpha &lt;-1$) has proven to be the most efficient way of finding distant radio galaxies.we find that even among the uss sources, there is a strong statisticalcorrelation between the spectral index and redshift. the most distant radiogalaxies within the uss sample have the steepest radio spectra.  in our sample there are 3 radio galaxies at $z&gt;3$ compared with 26 at $2 &lt; z&lt; 3$. however, the present data do not allow us to decide whether there is adecrease in co-moving source density at the highest redshifts.  we have analyzed the spectra of the 30 objects with the highest redshifts($z&gt;1.9$). for these high redshift radio galaxies, ly$\alpha$ is almost alwaysthe dominant emission line, with a rest frame equivalent width ranging from$\sim100$ \aa\ to more than 1000 \aa. the equivalent widths of the mostimportant emission lines (ly$\alpha$, c\,{\small iv}, he\,{\small ii},c\,{\small iii}]) are found to correlate strongly with each other. the largerest frame equivalent widths and the correlation between the equivalent widthsof the emission lines, confirm that photoionization by a central continuumsource is most likely the dominant ionization mechanism.  there are significant velocity differences between the various emission linesof our high redshift radio galaxies; in particular the ly$\alpha$ line isshifted with respect to the higher ionization lines. velocity shifts range from100 to almost 1000 km s$^{-1}$ in some cases. simulations show that the effectsof associated h\,{\small i} absorption on the ly$\alpha$ emission line may be

astro-ph;9608092	the gaseous environments of radio galaxies in the early universe:  kinematics of the lyman $\alpha$ emission	we present intermediate resolution ($\sim3$ \aa ) spectra of the ly$\alpha$emission from 15 high redshift radio galaxies ($z&gt;2$). together with previouslypublished spectra we analyze data for a sample of 18 objects.  in 11 of the 18 radio galaxies we find deep troughs in the ly$\alpha$emission profile, which we interpret as h\,{\sc i} absorption with columndensities in the range $10^{18}$--$10^{19.5}$ cm$^{-2}$. since in most casesthe ly$\alpha$ emission is absorbed over its entire spatial extent (up to 50kpc), the absorbers must have a covering fraction close to unity. underplausible assumptions for the temperature and density of the absorbing gas thisimplies that the absorbing material must consist of $\sim 10^{12}$ clouds oftypical size $\sim 0.03$ pc with a total mass of $\sim 10^8$ m$_{\odot}$.  our observations show that strong h\,{\sc i} absorption occurs in $&gt;60$\% ofthe high redshift radio galaxies, while from the statistics of quasarabsorption lines there is only a 2\% probability of such a strong h\,{\sc i}absorption line falling by chance in the small redshift interval of thely$\alpha$ emission line. these absorbers are therefore most likely to bephysically associated with the galaxy hosting the radio source or its directenvironment.  there are strong correlations between the properties of the ly$\alpha$emission of the galaxies and the size of the associated radio source: (i) ofthe smaller ($&lt;50$ kpc) radio galaxies 9 out of 10 have strong associatedh\,{\sc i} absorption, whereas only 2 of the 8 larger ($&gt;50$ kpc) radiogalaxies show such strong absorption. (ii) larger radio sources tend to havelarger ly$\alpha$ emission regions and (iii) a smaller ly$\alpha$ velocity

astro-ph;9801304	deceleration of relativistic radio components and the morphologies of  gigahertz peaked spectrum sources	a relativistic radio component, which moves in a direction close to the skyplane, will increase in flux density when it decelerates. this effect is thebasis for the qualitative model for gps galaxies we present in this paper,which can explain their low-variability convex spectrum, their compact doubleor compact symmetric morphology, and the lack of gps quasars at similarredshifts. components are expelled from the nucleus at relativistic speeds at alarge angle to the line of sight, and are decelerated (eg. by ram-pressure orentrainment of the external gas) before contributing to a mini-lobe. the youngcomponents are doppler boosted in the direction of motion but appear fainterfor the observer. the non-relativistic mini-lobes dominate the structure andare responsible for the low variability in flux density and the convex radiospectrum as well as the compact double angular morphology. had the same sourcebeen orientated at a small angle to the line of sight, the young componentswould be boosted in the observer's direction resulting in a flat and variableradio spectrum at high frequencies. hence the characteristic convex spectrum ofa gps source would not be seen. these sources at small angles to the line ofsight are probably identified with quasars, and are not recognized as gpssources, but are embedded in the large population of flat spectrum variablequasars and bl lac objects. this leads to a deficiency in gps/csos identifiedwith quasars.

astro-ph;9802066	erratum for: an x-ray cluster at redshift 2.156?	a third possible explanation for the x-ray emission from the z=2.156 radiogalaxy 1138-262 is thermal emission from a very dense, sub-cluster `halo',perhaps associated with the (forming) cd galaxy on a scale &lt; 100 kpc. forinstance, increasing the gas density from 0.01 cm^{-3} to 0.1 cm^{-3} woulddecrease the required hot gas mass by the same factor, and could possiblyalleviate constraints on cosmological structure formation models. the pressurein this gas would be very high (10^{-9} dynes cm^{-2}), comparable to thepressure in the optical line emitting nebulosity and to the minimum pressure inthe radio source, and the cooling time would be short (&lt; fewx10^{8} years).circumstantial evidence for such very dense, hot gas enveloping some high zradio sources has been reviewed by fabian et al. (1986). fabian (1991) suggeststhat in some cases the `inferred pressures are close to the maximum that can beobtained by gas cooling in a potential well of a galaxy' (ie. the cooling time= gravitational free-fall time), and he designates such systems as `maximalcooling flows', with implied cooling flow rates up to 2000 m_solar year^{-1}.high resolution x-ray imaging with axaf should be able to test whether 1138-262has a normal cluster atmosphere, a `maximal cooling flow', or an unusuallyx-ray loud agn.

astro-ph;9803140	a new sample of faint gigahertz peaked spectrum radio sources	the westerbork northern sky survey (wenss) has been used to select a sampleof gigahertz peaked spectrum (gps) radio sources at flux densities one to twoorders of magnitude lower than bright gps sources investigated in earlierstudies. sources with inverted spectra at frequencies above 325 mhz have beenobserved with the wsrt at 1.4 and 5 ghz and with the vla at 8.6 and 15 ghz toselect genuine gps sources. this has resulted in a sample of 47 gps sourceswith peak frequencies ranging from ~500 mhz to &gt;15 ghz, and peak flux densitiesranging from ~40 to ~900 mjy. counts of gps sources in our sample as a functionof flux density have been compared with counts of large scale sources fromwenss scaled to 2 ghz, the typical peak frequency of our gps sources. thecounts can be made similar if the number of large scale sources at 2 ghz isdivided by 250, and their flux densities increase by a factor of 10. on thescenario that all gps sources evolve into large scale radio sources, theseresults show that the lifetime of a typical gps source is ~250 times shorterthan a typical large scale radio source, and that the source luminosity mustdecrease by a factor of ~10 in evolving from gps to large scale radio source.however, we note that the redshift distributions of gps and large scale radiosources are different and that this hampers a direct and straightforwardinterpretation of the source counts. further modeling of radio source evolutioncombined with cosmological evolution of the radio luminosity function for largesources is required.

astro-ph;9809056	hst images and properties of the most distant radio galaxies	we present hubble space telescope images of 11 high redshift radio galaxies(between $z=2.3$ and $z=3.6$). the galaxies were observed with the wfpc2 camerain a broad band filter (f606w or f707w, roughly equivalent to v or r-band), for2 orbits each. we find that on the scale of the hst observations there is awide variety of morphological structures of the hosting galaxies: most objectshave a clumpy, irregular appearance, consisting of a bright nucleus and anumber of smaller components, suggestive of merging systems. some observedstructures could be due (at least partly) to the presence of dust distributedthrough the galaxies. the uv continuum emission is generally elongated andaligned with the axis of the radio sources, however the characteristics of the``alignment effect'' differ from case to case, suggesting that the phenomenoncannot be explained by a single physical mechanism. we compare the propertiesof our radio galaxies with those of the  uv dropout galaxies and conclude that (i) the most massive radio galaxies maywell evolve from an aggregate of uv dropout galaxies and (ii) high redshiftradio galaxies probably evolve into present day brightest cluster galaxies.

astro-ph;9809069	optical and near-infrared imaging of faint gigahertz peaked spectrum  sources	a sample of 47 faint gigahertz peaked spectrum (gps) radio sources selectedfrom the westerbork northern sky survey (wenss, rengelink et al. 1997), hasbeen imaged in the optical and near infrared, resulting in an identificationfraction of 87%. the r-i and r-k colours of the faint optical counterparts areas expected for passively evolving elliptical galaxies, assuming that theyfollow the r band hubble diagram as determined for radio-bright gps galaxies.we have found evidence that the radio spectral properties of the gps quasarsare different from those of gps galaxies: the observed distribution of radiospectral peak frequencies for gps sources optically identified with brightstellar objects (presumably quasars) is shifted compared with gps sourcesidentified with faint or extended optical objects (presumably galaxies), in thesense that a gps quasar is likely to have a higher peak frequency than a gpsgalaxy. this means that the true peak frequency distribution is different forthe gps galaxies and quasars, because the sample selection effects areindependent of optical identification. the correlation between peak frequencyand redshift as has been suggested for bright sources has not been found inthis sample; no correlation exists between r magnitude (and therefore redshift)and peak frequency for the gps galaxies. we therefore believe that the claimedcorrelation is actually caused by the dependence of the peak frequency onoptical host, because the gps galaxies are in general at lower redshifts thanthe quasars. the difference in the peak frequency distributions of the gpsgalaxies and quasars is further evidence against the hypothesis that they forma single class of object.

astro-ph;9903226	optical spectroscopy of faint gigahertz peaked spectrum sources	we present spectroscopic observations of a sample of faint gigahertz peakedspectrum (gps) radio sources drawn from the westerbork northern sky survey(wenss). redshifts have been determined for 19 (40%) of the objects. theoptical spectra of the gps sources identified with low redshift galaxies showdeep stellar absorption features. this confirms previous suggestions that theiroptical light is not significantly contaminated by agn-related emission, but isdominated by a population of old (&gt;9 gyr) and metal-rich (&gt;0.2 [fe/h]) stars,justifying the use of these (probably) young radio sources as probes of galaxyevolution. the optical spectra of gps sources identified with quasars areindistinguishable from those of flat spectrum quasars, and clearly differentfrom the spectra of compact steep spectrum (css) quasars. the redshiftdistribution of the gps quasars in our radio-faint sample is comparable to thatof the bright samples presented in the literature, peaking at z ~ 2-3. it isunlikely that a significant population of low redshift gps quasars is misseddue to selection effects in our sample. we therefore claim that there is agenuine difference between the redshift distributions of gps galaxies andquasars, which, because it is present in both the radio-faint and brightsamples, can not be due to a redshift-luminosity degeneracy. it is thereforeunlikely that the gps quasars and galaxies are unified by orientation, unlessthe quasar opening angle is a strong function of redshift. we suggest that thegps quasars and galaxies are unrelated populations and just happen to haveidentical observed radio-spectral properties, and hypothesise that gps quasarsare a sub-class of flat spectrum quasars.
