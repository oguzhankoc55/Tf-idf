0901.4131	on the recovery of the star formation history of the lmc from the vista  survey of the magellanic system	the vista near infrared survey of the magellanic system (vmc) will providedeep yjks photometry reaching stars in the oldest turn-off point all over themagellanic clouds (mcs). as part of the preparation for the survey, we aim toaccess the accuracy in the star formation history (sfh) that can be expectedfrom vmc data, in particular for the lmc. to this aim, we first simulate vmcimages containing not only the lmc stellar populations but also the foregroundmw stars and background galaxies. we perform aperture photometry over thesesimulated images, access the expected levels of photometric errors andincompleteness, and apply the classical technique of sfh-recovery based on thereconstruction of colour-magnitude diagrams (cmd) via the minimization of achi-squared-like statistics. we then evaluate the expected errors in therecovered star formation rate as a function of stellar age, sfr(t), startingfrom models with a known age--metallicity relation (amr). it turns out that,for a given sky area, the random errors for ages older than ~0.4 gyr seem to beindependent of the crowding. for a spatial resolution of ~0.1 sqdeg, the randomerrors in sfr(t) will be below 20% for this wide range of ages. on the otherhand, due to the smaller stellar statistics for stars younger than ~0.4 gyr,the outer lmc regions will require larger areas to achieve the same level ofaccuracy in the sfr(t). if we consider the amr as unknown, the sfh-recoveryalgorithm is able to accurately recover the input amr, at the price of anincrease of random errors in the sfr(t) by a factor of about 2.5. experimentsof sfh-recovery performed for varying distance modulus and reddening indicatethat the propagation of the errors in these parameters in the sfr(t) impliessystematic errors below 30%.

0903.0946	stellar populations in the galactic bulge	aims:the aim of this paper is to study the characteristics of the stellarpopulations and the metallicity distribution in the galactic bulge. we studythe entire stellar population, but also retrieve information using only the redclump stars. methods: to study the characteristics of the stellar populationsand the metallicity distribution in the galactic bulge, we compared the outputof the galaxy model trilegal, which implements the binney et al. (1997) bulgemodel, with observations from 2mass and ogle-ii. a minimisation procedure hasbeen set up to retrieve the best fitting model with different stellarpopulations and metallicity distributions. results: using the trilegal code wefind that the best model resembling the characteristics of the galactic bulgeis a model with the distance to the galactic centre $r_0 =8.7\pm^{0.57}_{0.43}$ kpc, the major axis ratios of the bar $1:\eta:\zeta = 1 :0.68\pm_{0.19}^{0.05} : 0.31\pm_{0.04}^{0.06}$, and the angle between thesun-centre line and the bar $\phi = 15\deg\pm_{12.7}^{13.3}$. using theseparameters the best model is found for a burst of 8 gyr, although it is almostindistinguishable from models with ages of 9 and 10 gyr. the metallicitydistribution found is consistent with metallicity distributions in theliterature based on spectroscopic results.

0905.4415	synthetic photometry for carbon rich giants, i. hydrostatic dust-free  models	we study the spectroscopic and photometric properties of carbon stars. in thefirst paper of this series we focus on objects that can be described byhydrostatic models neglecting dynamical phenomena like pulsation and mass loss.as a consequence, the reddening due to circumstellar dust is not included. ourresults are collected in a database, which can be used in conjunction withstellar evolution and population synthesis calculations involving the agb. wehave computed a grid of 746 spherically symmetric comarcs atmospheres coveringeffective temperatures between 2400 and 4000k, surface gravities from log(g) =0.0 to -1.0, metallicities ranging from the solar value down to one tenth of itand c/o ratios in the interval between 1.05 and 5.0. subsequently, we usedthese models to create synthetic low resolution spectra and photometric datafor a large number of filter systems. the tables including the results areelectronically available. we have selected some of the most commonly usedcolours in order to discuss their behaviour as a function of the stellarparameters. a comparison with measured data shows that down to 2800k theagreement between predictions and observations of carbon stars is good. belowthis limit the synthetic colours are much too blue. the obvious reason forthese problems is the neglect of circumstellar reddening and structural changesdue to pulsation and mass loss.

0707.0788	evolved stars hint to an external origin of enhanced metallicity in  planet-hosting stars	exo-planets are preferentially found around high metallicity main sequencestars. we aim at investigating whether evolved stars share this property, andwhat this tells about planet formation. statistical tools and the basicconcepts of stellar evolution theory are applied to published results as wellas our own radial velocity and chemical analyses of evolved stars. we show thatthe metal distributions of planet-hosting (p-h) dwarfs and giants aredifferent, and that the latter do not favor metal-rich systems. rather, thesestars follow the same age-metallicity relation as the giants without planets inour sample. the straightforward explanation is to attribute the differencebetween dwarfs and giants to the much larger masses of giants' convectiveenvelopes. if the metal excess on the main sequence is due to pollution, theeffects of dilution naturally explains why it is not observed among evolvedstars. although we cannot exclude other explanations, the lack of anypreference for metal-rich systems among p-h giants could be a strong indicationof the accretion of metal-rich material. we discuss further tests, as well assome predictions and consequences of this hypothesis.

1001.5412	a near-infrared study of agb and red giant stars in the leo i dsph  galaxy	a near-infrared imaging study of the evolved stellar populations in the dwarfspheroidal galaxy leo i is presented. based on jhk observations obtained withthe wfcam wide-field array at the ukirt telescope, we build a near-infraredphotometric catalogue of red giant branch (rgb) and asymptotic giant branch(agb) stars in leo i over a 13.5 arcmin square area. the v-k colours of rgbstars, obtained by combining the new data with existing optical observations,allow us to derive a distribution of global metallicity [m/h] with average[m/h] = -1.51 (uncorrected) or [m/h] = -1.24 +/- 0.05 (int) +/- 0.15 (syst)after correction for the mean age of leo i stars. this is consistent with theresults from spectroscopy once stellar ages are taken into account. using anear-infrared two-colour diagram, we discriminate between carbon- andoxygen-rich agb stars and obtain a clean separation from milky way foregroundstars. we reveal a concentration of c-type agb stars relative to the red giantstars in the inner region of the galaxy, which implies a radial gradient in theintermediate-age (1-3 gyr) stellar populations. the numbers and luminosities ofthe observed carbon- and oxygen-rich agb stars are compared with thosepredicted by evolutionary models including the thermally-pulsing agb phase, toprovide new constraints to the models for low-metallicity stars. we find anexcess in the predicted number of c stars fainter than the rgb tip, associatedto a paucity of brighter ones. the number of o-rich agb stars is roughlyconsistent with the models, yet their predicted luminosity function is extendedto brighter luminosity. it appears likely that the adopted evolutionary modelsoverestimate the c star lifetime and underestimate their k-band luminosity.

1012.5193	the vmc survey - i. strategy and first data	the new visual and infrared telescope for astronomy (vista) has startedoperations. over its first five years it will be collecting data for six publicsurveys, one of these is the near-infrared yjksvista survey of the magellanicclouds system (vmc). this survey comprises the lmc, the smc, the bridgeconnecting the two galaxies and two fields in the stream. this paper providesan overview of the vmc survey strategy and presents first science results. themain goals of the vmc survey are the determination of the spatially resolvedsfh and 3d structure of the magellanic system. therefore, the vmc survey isdesigned to reach stars as faint as the oldest main sequence turn-off point andto constrain the mean magnitude of pulsating variable stars such as rr lyraestars and cepheids. this paper focuses on observations of vmc fields in the lmcobtained between november 2009 and march 2010. these observations correspond toa 7% completeness of the lmc fields. the vmc observations consist ofmulti-epoch measurements organised following a specific structure. the datawere reduced using the vista data flow system pipeline whose source catalogueswere produced and made available via the vista science archive. the analysis ofthe data shows that the sensitivity in each wave band agrees with expectations.uncertainties and completeness of the data are also derived. the first scienceresults, aimed at assessing the science quality of the vmc data, include anoverview of the distribution of stars in colour-magnitude and colour-colourdiagrams, the detection of planetary nebulae and of stellar clusters, and theks band light-curve of variable stars. the vmc survey represents a tremendousimprovement, in spatial resolution and sensitivity, on previous panoramicobservations of the magellanic system in the near-infrared and complementsnicely the deep observations at other wavelengths.

1110.2458	the visir@vlt mid-ir view of 47tuc: a further step in solving the puzzle  of rgb mass loss	there is an ongoing debate regarding the onset luminosity of dusty mass lossin population-ii red giant stars. in this paper we present visir@vlt mir 8.6micron imaging of 47tuc, centre of attention of a number of space-based spitzerobservations and studies. the visir high resolution (diffraction limited)observations allow excellent matching to existing optical hubble spacetelescope catalogues. the optical-mir coverage of the inner 1.15 arcmin of thecluster provide the cleanest possible, blending-free, sampling of the upper 3magnitudes of the giant branch. our diagrams show no evidence of faint giantswith mir-excess. a combined nir-mir diagram further confirms the near absenceof dusty red giants. dusty red giants and asymptotic giant stars are confinedto the 47tuc long period variables population. in particular, dusty red giantsare limited to the upper one 8.6 micron magnitude below the giant branch tip.this particular luminosity level corresponds to ~1000 solar luminosity,suggested in previous determinations to mark the onset of dusty mass-loss.interestingly, at this luminosity level, we detect a small deviation betweenthe colours of red giants and the theoretical isochrones.

0704.3192	deriving temperature, mass and age of evolved stars from high-resolution  spectra. application to field stars and the open cluster ic 4651	we test our capability of deriving stellar physical parameters of giant starsby analysing a sample of field stars and the well studied open cluster ic 4651with different spectroscopic methods. the use of a technique based online-depth ratios (ldrs) allows us to determine with high precision theeffective temperature of the stars and to compare the results with thoseobtained with a classical lte abundance analysis. (i) for the field stars wefind that the temperatures derived by means of the ldr method are in excellentagreement with those found by the spectral synthesis. this result is extremelyencouraging because it shows that spectra can be used to firmly derivepopulation characteristics (e.g., mass and age) of the observed stars. (ii) forthe ic 4651 stars we use the determined effective temperature to derive thefollowing results. a) the reddening e(b-v) of the cluster is 0.12+/-0.02,largely independent of the color-temperature calibration used. b) the age ofthe cluster is 1.2+/-0.2 gyr. c) the typical mass of the analysed giant starsis 2.0+/-0.2m_sun. moreover, we find a systematic difference of about 0.2 dexin log g between spectroscopic and evolutionary values. we conclude that, inspite of known limitations, a classical spectroscopic analysis of giant starsmay indeed result in very reliable stellar parameters. we caution that thequality of the agreement, on the other hand, depends on the details of theadopted spectroscopic analysis.

1204.2273	the vmc survey. v. first results for classical cepheids	the vista magellanic cloud (vmc, pi m.r. cioni) survey is collecting deepks-band time-series photometry of the pulsating variable stars hosted by thesystem formed by the two magellanic clouds (mcs) and the "bridge" connectingthem. in this paper we present the first results for classical cepheids, fromthe vmc observations of two fields in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). the vmcks-band light curves of the cepheids are well sampled (12-epochs) and ofexcellent precision. we were able to measure for the first time the ksmagnitude of the faintest classical cepheids in the lmc (ks\sim17.5 mag), whichare mostly pulsating in the first overtone (fo) mode, and to obtain foperiod-luminosity (pl), period-wesenheit (pw), and period-luminosity-color(plc) relations, spanning the full period range from 0.25 to 6 day. since thelongest period cepheid in our dataset has a variability period of 23 day, wehave complemented our sample with literature data for brighter f cepheids. onthis basis we have built a pl relation in the ks band that, for the first time,includes short period pulsators, and spans the whole range from 1.6 to 100 daysin period. we also provide the first ever empirical pw and plc relations usingthe (v-ks) color and time-series ks photometry. the very small dispersion(\sim0.07 mag) of these relations makes them very well suited to study thethree-dimensional (3d) geometry of the magellanic system. the use of "direct"(parallax- and baade-wesselink- based) distance measurements to both galacticand lmc cepheids, allowed us to calibrate the zero points of the pl, pw, andplc relations obtained in this paper, and in turn to estimate an absolutedistance modulus of (m-m)0=18.46\pm0.03 for the lmc. this result is inagreement with most of the latest literature determinations based on classicalcepheids.

1211.0146	galactic archaeology: mapping and dating stellar populations with  asteroseismology of red-giant stars	our understanding of how the galaxy was formed and evolves is severelyhampered by the lack of precise constraints on basic stellar properties such asdistances, masses, and ages. here, we show that solar-like pulsating red giantsrepresent a well-populated class of accurate distance indicators, spanning alarge age range, which can be used to map and date the galactic disc in theregions probed by observations made by the corot and kepler space telescopes.when combined with photometric constraints, the pulsation spectra of suchevolved stars not only reveal their radii, and hence distances, but alsoprovide well-constrained estimates of their masses, which are reliable proxiesfor the ages of the stars. as a first application we consider red giantsobserved by corot in two different parts of the milky way, and determineprecise distances for ~2000 stars spread across nearly 15,000 pc of thegalactic disc, exploring regions which are a long way from the solarneighbourhood. we find significant differences in the mass distributions ofthese two samples which, by comparison with predictions of synthetic models ofthe milky way, we interpret as mainly due to the vertical gradient in thedistribution of stellar masses (hence ages) in the disc. in the future, theavailability of spectroscopic constraints for this sample of stars will notonly improve the age determination, but also provide crucial constraints onage-velocity and age-metallicity relations at different galactocentric radiiand heights from the plane.

1304.1153	the vmc survey vii. reddening map of the 30 doradus field and the  structure of the cold interstellar medium	context: the details of how galaxies have evolved are imprinted in their starformation history, chemical enrichment and morpho-kinematic structure.parameters behind these can be measured by combining photometric techniqueswith modelling. however, there are uncertainties from the ambiguity of colourand magnitude and the effects of interstellar reddening.  aims: in this paper we present a detailed reddening map of the central 30doradus region of the large magellanic cloud; for community use and to test themethods used. the reddening, a measurement of dust extinction, acts as a tracerof the interstellar medium (ism).  methods: near infrared photometry of red clump stars are used to measurereddening as extinction is the main cause of their colour and magnitudevariance. the star formation history is used to convert colour to reddeningvalues which are subsequently converted to visual extinction.  results: presented is a dust map for the 30 doradus field. this map samples aregion of 1x1.5 deg, containing ~1.5x10^5 red clump stars which probe reddeningup to av=6 mag. we compare our map with maps from the literature, includingoptical extinction maps and radio, mid- and far-infrared maps of atomichydrogen and dust emission. through estimation of column density we locatemolecular clouds.  conclusions: this new reddening map shows correlation with equivalent maps inthe literature, validating the method of red clump star selection. we make ourreddening map available for community use. in terms of ism the red clump starsappear to be more affected by the cooler dust measured by 70 micron emissionbecause there is stronger correlation between increasing emission andextinction due to red clump stars not being located near hot stars that wouldheat the dust. the transition from atomic hydrogen to molecular hydrogen occursbetween densities of nh=4x10^21 to 6x10^21 cm^-2.

1306.4336	the vmc survey -ix. pilot study of the proper motion of stellar  populations in the lmc from 2mass and vista data	we use multi-epoch near-infrared observations from the vista survey of themagellanic cloud system (vmc) to measure the proper motion of stars of the lmc,in one tile of 1.5 deg^2 centred at (alpha, delta) = (05:59:23.136,-66:20:28.68) and including the south ecliptic pole, with respect to their2mass position over a time baseline of ~10 years and from vmc observationsonly, spanning a time range of ~1 year. stars of different ages are selectedfrom the (j-ks) vs. ks diagram and their average coordinate displacement iscomputed from the difference between ks band observations for stars as faint asks=19 mag. proper motions are derived by averaging up to seven 2mass-vmccombinations in the first case and from the slope of the best fit line amongthe seven vmc epochs in the second case. separate proper motion values areobtained for variable stars in the field. the proper motion of ~40,000 lmcstars in the tile, with respect to ~8000 background galaxies, obtained from vmcdata alone, is mu_alpha cos(delta) = +2.20+/-0.06 (stat) +/-0.29 (sys) andmu_delta = +1.70+/-0.06 (stat) +/-0.30 (sys) mas/yr. this value agrees withrecent ground-based determinations in a nearby field but is larger than studieswith the hst; the cause of this discrepancy may be due to additional systematicerrors in the data. the lmc proper motion is also clearly distinct from theproper motion derived for stars of the milky way. the relative proper motionbetween the foreground stars and the lmc stars is ~5 mas/yr. furthermore, wemeasure a decrease of the proper motion with increasing logarithm of stellarage for lmc stars. this study, based on just one vmc tile, shows the potentialof the 2mass-vmc and vmc-vmc combinations for a comprehensive investigation ofthe proper motion across the magellanic system.

0801.3336	testing planet formation theories with giant stars	planet searches around evolved giant stars are bringing new insights toplanet formation theories by virtue of the broader stellar mass range of thehost stars compared to the solar-type stars that have been the subject of mostcurrent planet searches programs. these searches among giant stars areproducing extremely interesting results. contrary to main sequence starsplanet-hosting giants do not show a tendency of being more metal rich. even iflimited, the statistics also suggest a higher frequency of giant planets (atleast 10 %) that are more massive compared to solar-type main sequence stars.the interpretation of these results is not straightforward. we propose that thelack of a metallicity-planet connection among giant stars is due to pollutionof the star while on the main sequence, followed by dilution during the giantphase. we also suggest that the higher mass and frequency of the planets aredue to the higher stellar mass. even if these results do not favor a specificformation scenario, they suggest that planetary formation might be more complexthan what has been proposed so far, perhaps with two mechanisms at work and oneor the other dominating according to the stellar mass. we finally stress as thedetailed study of the host stars and of the parent sample is essential toderive firm conclusions.

1402.2480	prospects for detecting asteroseismic binaries in kepler data	asteroseismology may in principle be used to detect unresolved stellar binarysystems comprised of solar-type stars and/or red giants. this novel methodrelies on the detection of the presence of two solar-like oscillation spectrain the frequency spectrum of a single lightcurve. here, we make predictions ofthe numbers of systems that may be detectable in data already collected by thenasa kepler mission. our predictions, which are based upon trilegal and bisepssimulations of the kepler field of view, indicate that as many as 200 or more``asteroseismic binaries'' may be detectable in this manner. most of thesebinaries should be comprised of two he-core-burning red giants. owing largelyto the limited numbers of targets with the requisite short-cadence kepler data,we expect only a small number of detected binaries containing solar-type stars.the predicted yield of detections is sensitive to the assumed initial massratio distribution of the binary components and therefore represents asensitive calibration of the much debated initial mass ratio distribution nearmass ratio unity.

1505.03454	long-lived, long-period radial velocity variations in aldebaran: a  planetary companion and stellar activity	we investigate the nature of the long-period radial velocity variations inalpha tau first reported over 20 years ago. we analyzed precise stellar radialvelocity measurements for alpha tau spanning over 30 years. an examination ofthe halpha and ca ii 8662 spectral lines, and hipparcos photometry was alsodone to help discern the nature of the long-period radial velocity variations.our radial velocity data show that the long-period, low amplitude radialvelocity variations are long-lived and coherent. furthermore, halpha equivalentwidth measurements and hipparcos photometry show no significant variations withthis period. another investigation of this star established that there was novariability in the spectral line shapes with the radial velocity period. anorbital solution results in a period of p = 628.96 +/- 0.90 d, eccentricity, e= 0.10 +/- 0.05, and a radial velocity amplitude, k = 142.1 +/- 7.2 m/s.evolutionary tracks yield a stellar mass of 1.13 +/- 0.11 m_sun, whichcorresponds to a minimum companion mass of 6.47 +/- 0.53 m_jup with an orbitalsemi-major axis of a = 1.46 +/- 0.27 au. after removing the orbital motion ofthe companion, an additional period of ~ 520 d is found in the radial velocitydata, but only in some time spans. a similar period is found in the variationsin the equivalent width of halpha and ca ii. variations at one-third of thisperiod are also found in the spectral line bisector measurements. the 520 dperiod is interpreted as the rotation modulation by stellar surface structure.its presence, however, may not be long-lived, and it only appears in epochs ofthe radial velocity data separated by $\sim$ 10 years. this might be due to anactivity cycle. the data presented here provide further evidence of a planetarycompanion to alpha tau, as well as activity-related radial velocity variations.

astro-ph;0001068	on the peculiar red clump morphology in the open clusters ngc 752 and  ngc 7789	the red clump stars in the open cluster ngc 752 present a peculiardistribution in the colour-magnitude diagran (cmd): the clump is observed topresent a faint extension, slightly to the blue of the main concentration ofclump stars. we point out that a similar structure is present in the cmd of ngc7789, and discuss their possible origins. this feature may be understood as theresult of having, at the same time, stars of low-mass which undergo thehelium-flash, and those just massive enough for avoiding it. the ages of bothclusters are compatible with this interpretation. similar features can beproduced in theoretical models which assume a non-negligible mass spread forclump stars, of about 0.2 mo. however, one can probably exclude that theobserved effect is due to the natural mass range of core helium burning starsfound in single isochrones, although present models do not present the level ofdetail necessary to completely explore this possibility. also the possibilityof a large age spread among cluster stars can be refuted on observationalgrounds. we then suggest a few alternatives. this spread may be resultingeither from star-to-star variations in the mass-loss rates during the rgbphase. alternatively, effects sush as stellar rotation or convective coreovershooting, could be causing a significant spread in the core mass athe-ignition for star of similar mass. finally, we point out that similareffects could also help to understand the distribution of clump stars in thecmds of the clusters ngc 2660 and ngc 2204.

astro-ph;0008109	ca ii activity and rotation in f-k evolved stars	(abridged) ca ii h and k high resolution observations for 60 evolved stars inthe field and in 5 open clusters are presented. from these spectrachromospheric fluxes are derived, and a homogeneous sample of more than 100giants is built adding data from the literature. in addition, for most stars,rotational velocities were derived from coravel observations. by comparingchromospheric emission in the cluster stars we confirm that chromosphericactivity depends on t_eff, and mass, when intermediate mass stars (m~4 msun)are considered. the hyades and praesepe clump giants show the same level ofactivity, as expected from stars with similar masses and t_effs. a differenceof up to 0.4 dex in the chromospheric fluxes among the hyades giants isrecorded and this sets a clear limit to the intrinsic spread of stellaractivity in evolved giants. among the field stars none of the giants with(v-r)&lt;0.4 and ia supergiants observed shows a signature of ca ii activity. wefind that chromospheric activity scales linearly with stellar rotationalvelocity and a high power of stellar effective temperature: f'_k proptot_eff^7.7 vsini^0.9. this result can be interpreted as the effect of twochromospheric components of different nature: one mechanical and one magnetic.for each range of masses activity can simply be expressed as a function of onlyone parameter: either the t_eff or the angular rotation omega. for the 1.6-3solar mass stars the data are consistent with i omega=const, while lower andhigher masses follow a law similar to i omega^2=const. we find it intriguingthat vsini remains almost constant for 1msun stars along their evolution; if asimilar behavior is shared by pop ii stars, this could explain the relativelyhigh degree of activity observed in pop ii giants.

astro-ph;0302601	the red tail of carbon stars in the lmc: models meet 2mass and denis  observations	carbon stars are known to exhibit systematically redder near-infrared colourswith respect to m-type stars. in the near-infrared colour-magnitude diagramsprovided by the 2mass and denis surveys, the lmc c-type stars draw a strikingred tail, well separated from the sequences of o-rich giants. so far, thisconspicuous feature has been absent from any set of available isochrones, eventhe few existing ones that include the tp-agb evolution of low- andintermediate-mass stars. to investigate such issue we simulate the complete2mass ks vs.(j-ks) data towards the lmc by means of a population synthesisapproach, that relies on extended libraries of published stellar evolutionarytracks, including the tp-agb phase. the simulations provide quite a detaileddescription of the several vertical fingers and inclined sequences seen in2mass data, due to both galactic foreground and lmc o-rich stars. instead, asmentioned, the red tail of c-stars sets a major difficulty: we find that tp-agbmodels with solar-scaled molecular opacities, the usual assumption of existingagb calculations, do not succeed in reproducing this feature. our testsindicate that the main reason for this failure should not be ascribed toempirical teff - (j-k) transformations for c-type stars. instead, thediscrepancy is simply removed by adopting new evolutionary models that accountfor the changes in molecular opacities as agb stars get enriched in carbon viathe third dredge-up (marigo 2002). in fact, simulations that adopt these modelsare able to reproduce, for the first time, the red tail of c-stars innear-infrared cmds. finally, we point out that these simulations also provideuseful indications about the efficiency of the third dredge-up process, and thepulsation modes of long-period variables.

astro-ph;0404376	evolution of planetary nebulae ii. population effects on the bright  cut-off of the pnlf	we investigate the bright cut-off of the [oiii]l5007 planetary nebulaluminosity function (pnlf), that has been suggested as a powerful extragalacticdistance indicator. theoretical pnlfs are constructed via monte-carlosimulations of populations of pne, whose individual properties are describedwith the aid of recent pn synthetic models (marigo et al. 2001), coupled to adetailed photoionisation code (cloudy). the basic dependences of the cut-offmagnitude m* are then discussed. we find that: (i) in galaxies with recent orongoing star formation, the modelled pnlf present m* values between -4 and -5,very close to the observationally-calibrated value for the lmc. (ii) in thesegalaxies, the pnlf cut-off is produced by pne with progenitor masses of about2.5 msun, while less massive stars give origin to fainter pne. as a consequencem* is expected to depend strongly on the age of the last burst of starformation, dimming by as much as 5 mag as we go from young to 10-gyr oldpopulations. (iii) rather than on the initial metallicity of a stellarpopulation, m* depends on the actual [o/h] of the observed pne, a quantity thatmay differ significantly from the initial value (due to dredge-up episodes),especially in young and intermediate-age pn populations. (iv) also thetransition time from the end of agb to the pn phase, and the nuclear-burningproperties (i.e. h- or he-burning) of the central stars introducenon-negligible effects on m*. the strongest indication derived from the presentcalculations is a serious difficulty to explain the age-invariance of thecut-off brightness over an extended interval, say from 1 to 13 gyr, thatobservations of pnlfs in galaxies of late-to-early type seem to suggest.

astro-ph;0505510	a substellar companion around the intermediate-mass giant star hd 11977	we report the discovery of a substellar companion to the intermediate-massstar hd 11977 (g5 iii). radial velocities of this star have been monitored forfive years with feros at the 1.52-m eso and later at the 2.2-m mpg/esotelescope in la silla, chile. based on the collected data we calculated anorbital solution with a period of p=711 days, a semi-amplitude of k1=105 m/s,and an eccentricity of e=0.4. the period of the radial-velocity variation islonger than that of the estimated stellar rotation, rendering it unlikely thatrotational modulation is the source of the variation in the radial velocity.this hypothesis is supported by the absence of a correlation between stellaractivity indicators and radial-velocity variation. by determining a primarystellar mass of mstar=1.91 msun, the best-fit minimum mass of the companion andsemi-major axis of the orbit are m2sini=6.54 mjup and a2=1.93 au, respectively.an upper limit for the mass of the companion of m2 &lt; 65.5 mjup has beencalculated from hipparcos astrometric measurements. although the possibility ofa brown-dwarf companion cannot be excluded, hd 11977 b is one of the few planetcandidates detected around an intermediate-mass star. the progenitormain-sequence star of hd 11977 is probably an a-type star. this discovery givesan indirect evidence for planetary companions around early type main-sequencestars.

astro-ph;0509881	agb stars in the magellanic clouds. ii. the rate of star formation  across the lmc	this article compares the distribution of ks magnitude of large magellaniccloud (lmc) asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars obtained from the denis and2mass data with theoretical distributions. these have been constructed usingup-to-date stellar evolution calculations for low and intermediate-mass stars,and in particular for thermally pulsing agb stars. a fit of both the magnitudedistribution of carbon- and oxygen-rich agb stars allowed us to constrain themetallicity distribution across the lmc and its star formation rate (sfr). thelmc stellar population is found to be on average 5-6 gyr old and is consistentwith a mean metallicity corresponding to z=0.006. these values may however beaffected by systematic errors in the underlying stellar models, and by thelimited exploration of the possible sfr histories. our method should be,instead, particularly useful for detecting variations in the mean metallicityand sfr across the lmc disk. in fact, there are well defined regions where boththe metallicity and the mean-age of the underlying stellar population span thewhole range of grid parameters. the c/m ratio discussed in paper i is a tracerof the metallicity distribution if the underlying stellar population is olderthan about a few gyr. a similar study across the small magellanic cloud isgiven in paper iii of this series.

astro-ph;0608160	basic physical parameters of a selected sample of evolved stars	we present the detailed spectroscopic analysis of 72 evolved stars, includingthe [fe/h] determination for the whole sample. these metallicities, togetherwith the teff values and the absolute v magnitude derived from hipparcosparallaxes, are used to estimate basic stellar parameters (ages, masses, radii,(b-v)o and log g using theoretical isochrones and a bayesian estimation method.the (b-v)o values so estimated turn out to be in excellent agreement with theobserved (b-v), confirming the reliability of the (teff,(b-v)o) relation usedin the isochrones. the estimated diameters have been compared with limbdarkening-corrected ones measured with independent methods, finding anagreement better than 0.3 mas within the 1-10 mas interval. we derive theage-metallicity relation for the solar neighborhood; for the first time such arelation has been derived from observations of field giants rather than fromopen clusters and field dwarfs and subdwarfs. the age-metallicity relation ischaracterized by close-to-solar metallicities for stars younger than ~4 gyr,and by a large [fe/h] spread with a trend towards lower metallicities forhigher ages. we find that the [fe/h] dispersion of young stars (less than 1gyr) is comparable to the observational errors, indicating that stars in thesolar neighbourhood are formed from interstellar matter of quite homogeneouschemical composition. the three giants of our sample which have been proposedto host planets are not metal rich, what is at odds with those for mainsequence stars. however, two of these stars have masses much larger than asolar mass so we may be sampling a different stellar population from mostradial velocity searches for extrasolar planets. we also confirm that theradial velocity variability tends to increase along the rgb.

astro-ph;0703094	on the effect of helium enhancement on bolometric corrections and  teff-colour relations	we evaluate the effects that variations in he content have on bolometriccorrections and teff-colour relations. to this aim, we compute atlas9 modelatmospheres and spectral energy distributions for effective temperaturesranging from 3500 k to 40000 k for dwarfs and from 3500 k to 8000 k for giants,considering both ``he-non enhanced'' and ``he-enhanced'' compositions. theconsidered variations in he content are of deltay = +0.1 and +0.2 for themetallicity [m/h]=+0.5 and deltay=+0.1 for [m/h]=-0.5 and -1.5. then, syntheticphotometry is performed in the ubvrijhk system. we conclude that the changes inbolometric corrections, caused by the adopted he-enhancements are in generaltoo small (less than 0.01 mag), for both dwarfs and giants, to be affectingpresent-day tables of bolometric corrections at a significant level. the onlypossible exceptions are found for the u-band at teff between 4000 k and 8000 k,where |delta bc_u| amounts to ~0.02 mag, and for teff equal to 3500 k, where|delta bc_lambda| values become clearly much higher (up to 0.06 mag forpassbands from u to v). however, even in the latter case the overalluncertainty caused by variations in the he content may be not so significant,because the atlas9 results are still approximative at their lowest temperaturelimit.

astro-ph;0703672	discovery of a planet around the k giant star 4 uma	context: for the past 3 years we have been monitoring a sample of 62 k giantstars using precise stellar radial velocity measurements taken at thethueringer landessternwarte tautenburg. aims: to search for sub-stellarcompanions to giant stars and to understand the nature of the diverse radialvelocity variations exhibited by k giant stars. methods: we present precisestellar radial velocity measurements of the k1iii giant star 4 uma (hd 73108).these were obtained using the coude echelle spectrograph of 2-m alfred jenschtelescope. the wavelength reference for the radial velocity measurements wasprovided by an iodine absorption cell. results: our measurements reveal thatthe radial velocity of 4 uma exhibits a periodic variation of 269.3 days with asemiamplitude k = 216.8 m/s. a keplerian orbit with an eccentricity, e = 0.43+/- 0.02 is the most reasonable explanation for the radial velocity variations.the orbit yields a mass function, f(m) = (2.05 +/- 0.24) x 10^(- 7) m_sun. fromour high resolution spectra we calculate a metallicity of -0.25 +/- 0.05 andderive a stellar mass of 1.23 m_sun +/- 0.15 for the host star. conclusions:the k giant star 4 uma hosts a substellar companion with minimum mass m sin i =7.1 +/- 1.6 m_jupiter.

astro-ph;9805127	fine structure of the red giant clump from hipparcos data, and distance  determinations based on its mean magnitude	the i-band brightness of clump stars has been used recently to determine thedistance to the bulge, the lmc and smc, and to m31. it was assumed to be astandard candle based on the observational fact that it is independent of(v-i)-colour in all observed populations. the calibration was done using nearbyclump stars with hipparcos-parallaxes. the most surprising result of thisprocedure was the claim that the distance to the lmc was only 18.04 mag. in thepresent paper we show that with a population synthesis approach we canreproduce the constancy of m_i with colour for the local hipparcos clumpsample. nevertheless, m_i is not a constant among different populations, butdepends on metallicity. as a result, the determined distance modulus to the lmcof 18.28+-0.18 mag is in better agreement with standard values. this resolves,at least partially, the controversial result obtained by the assumption of auniversal value for m_i. we also find and discuss substructures in the clump:we predict that stars slightly heavier than the maximum mass for developingdegenerate he cores should define a secondary, clumpy structure, about 0.3 magbelow the bluest extremity of the red clump. this secondary clump can beclearly identified in the hipparcos database of stars. we argue that thereremain severe uncertainties in the use of clump stars as a distance indicator.

astro-ph;9910040	is the core mass-luminosity relation violated by the occurrence of the  third dredge-up ?	the core mass-luminosity (mc-l) relation of tp-agb stars is a key ingredientin synthetic calculations of their evolution. recently, herwig et al. (1998)have presented full calculations of tp-agb models with strong dredge-upoccurring already during early thermal pulses. the resulting luminosityevolution differs appreciably from the simple linear mc-l relation. in thispaper, we show that at least part of the luminosity evolution can be understoodas being the result of two well-known effects: the gradual approach to theasymptotic behaviour that characterises the first thermal pulses, and thechemical composition changes of the envelope. both effects are alreadyimplemented in the mc-l relations used in synthetic models. consequently, thesemodels are able to reproduce the behaviour of full calculations. whetheradditional effects, not yet taken into account, are present, can be decidedonly through additional calculations and data. we also comment on the validityof a linear mc-l relation and its possible violation, as mentioned by herwig etal.

astro-ph;9911432	the puzzling theoretical predictions for the luminosity of clumping he  burning stars	this paper deals with theoretical predictions for he burning models in arange of masses covering the so-called red giant branch phase transition.taking as a guideline the observational constraints given by hipparcosparallaxes to the predicted luminosity of models originated from red giantprogenitors with he core undergoing electron degeneracy, we compare models byvarious authors as recently appeared in the literature, disclosing sensitivedifferences in the predicted luminosity. the solidity of these theoreticalpredictions is investigated by exploring the effects of varying the assumptionsabout the efficiency of core overshooting or the amount of mass loss, givingquantitative estimates of the related uncertainties. however, one finds thattheoretical predictions concerning the luminosity of the red giant clump in thehipparcos sample is scarcely affected by these mechanisms.a comparison amongtheoretical predictions as recently given by different authors convincinglydemonstrates that the different luminosity predictions are the natural resultsof evolutionary codes with different - but all reasonable- input physics. inthis context observations suggests that stellar models based on the mostupdated input physics are possibly overestimating the luminosity of thesestructures, raising doubts on several current predictions concerning theluminosity of hb stars in galactic globulars.

0811.2902	interstellar extinction and long-period variables in the galactic center	we use the spitzer irac catalogue of the galactic center (gc) point sources(ramirez et al. 2008) and combine it with new isochrones (marigo et al. 2008)to derive extinctions based on photometry of red giants and asymptotic giantbranch (agb) stars. this new extinction map extends to much higher values of avthan previoulsy available. our new extinction map of the gc region covers 2.0 x1.4 degree (280 x 200 pc at a distance of 8 kpc). we apply it to deredden thelpvs found by glass et al. (2001) near the gc. we make period-magnitudediagrams and compare them to those from other regions of different metallicity.  the glass-lpvs follow well-defined period-luminosity relations (pl) in theirac filter bands at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micron. the period-luminosityrelations are similar to those in the large magellanic cloud, suggesting thatthe pl relation in the irac bands is universal. we use isogal data to derivemass-loss rates and find for the glass-lpv sample some correlation betweenmass-loss and pulsation period, as expected theoretically.the gc has an excessof high luminosity and long period lpvs compared to the bulge, which supportsprevious suggestions that it contains a younger stellar population.
