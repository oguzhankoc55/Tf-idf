0902.0643	a new search for distant radio galaxies in the southern hemisphere --  ii. 2.2 micron imaging	we have compiled a sample of 234 ultra-steep-spectrum (uss) selected radiosources in order to find high-redshift radio galaxies. the sample covers thedeclination range -40deg &lt; dec &lt; -30deg in the overlap region between the1400-mhz nrao vla sky survey, 408-mhz revised molonglo reference catalogue andthe 843-mhz sydney university molonglo sky survey (the mrcr-sumss sample). thisis the second in a series of papers on the mrcr-sumss sample, and here wepresent the k-band (2.2 micron) imaging of 173 of the sources primarily fromthe magellan and the anglo-australian telescopes. we detect a counterpart tothe radio source in 93% of the new k-band images which, along with previouslypublished data, makes this the largest published sample of k-band counterpartsto uss-selected radio galaxies. the location of the k-band identification hasbeen compared to the features of the radio emission for the double sources. wefind that the identification is most likely to lie near the midpoint of theradio lobes rather than closer to the brighter lobe, making the centroid a lesslikely place to find the optical counterpart. 79% of the identifications areless than 1 arcsec from the radio lobe axis. these results differ from studiesof low-redshift radio samples where the environments are typically not nearlyso dense and disturbed as those at high redshift. in contrast to someliterature samples, we find that the majority of our sample shows no alignmentbetween the near-infrared and radio axes. several different morphologies ofaligned structures are found and those that are aligned within 10 degrees areconsistent with jet-induced star formation. ...abridged...

0902.3677	high redshift radio galaxies: laboratories for massive galaxy and  cluster formation in the early universe	high redshift radio galaxies are among the largest, most luminous, mostmassive, and most beautiful objects in the universe. they are generallyidentified from their radio emission, thought to be powered by accretion ofmatter onto supermassive black holes in the nuclei of their host galaxies.observations show that they are energetic sources of radiation throughout mostof the electromagnetic spectrum, including relativistic plasma, gas and dust,stars and the active galactic nuclei (agn). 1 hzrgs are inferred to beextremely massive, including old stars (up to $\sim$ 10$^{12}$ m$_{\odot}$),hot gas (up to $\sim$ 10$^{12}$ m$_{\odot}$) and molecular gas (up to $\sim$10$^{11}$ m$_{\odot}$).because they are highly luminous and (unlike quasars)spatially resolvable from the ground, most components of hzrgs provideimportant diagnostic information about the spatial distributions of processeswithin hzrgs and their environment. the fact that the different constituentsare present in the same objects and that the {\bf {\it interrelationships andinteractions between them}} can be studied make distant radio galaxies uniquelaboratories for probing massive galaxy and cluster formation in the earlyuniverse.

0910.2821	the laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south	we present a sensitive 870 micron survey of the extended chandra deep fieldsouth (ecdfs) using laboca on the apex telescope. the laboca ecdfssubmillimetre survey (less) covers the full 30' x 30' field size of the ecdfsand has a uniform noise level of 1.2 mjy/beam. less is thus the largestcontiguous deep submillimetre survey undertaken to date. the noise propertiesof our map show clear evidence that we are beginning to be affected byconfusion noise. we present a catalog of 126 smgs detected with a significancelevel above 3.7 sigma. the ecdfs exhibits a deficit of bright smgs relative topreviously studied blank fields but not of normal star-forming galaxies thatdominate the extragalactic background light (ebl). this is in line with theunderdensities observed for optically defined high redshift source populationsin the ecdfs (bzks, drgs,optically bright agn and massive k-band selectedgalaxies). the differential source counts in the full field are well describedby a power law with a slope of alpha=-3.2, comparable to the results from otherfields. we show that the shape of the source counts is not uniform across thefield. the integrated 870 micron flux densities of our source-count modelsaccount for &gt;65% of the estimated ebl from cobe measurements. we haveinvestigated the clustering of smgs in the ecdfs by means of a two-pointcorrelation function and find evidence for strong clustering on angular scales&lt;1'. assuming a power law dependence for the correlation function and a typicalredshift distribution for the smgs we derive a spatial correlation length ofr_0=13+/-6 h^-1 mpc.

0910.3097	multi-wavelength properties of spitzer-selected starbursts at z~2	a complete sample of 33 sources believed to be starbursts("5.8micron-peakers") was selected in the (0.5 sq. deg.) j1046+56 field withselection criteria f_(24micron)&gt;400mujy, the presence of a redshifted stellaremission peak at 5.8um, and r'(vega)&gt;23. the field, part of the swire lockmanhole field, benefits from very deep vla/gmrt 20cm, 50cm, and 90cm radio data(all 33 sources are detected at 50cm), and deep 160micron and 70micron spitzerdata. the 33 sources, with photometric redshifts ~1.5-2.5, were observed at1.2mm with iram-30m/mambo to an rms ~0.7-0.8mjy in most cases. theirmillimeter, radio, 7-band spitzer, and near-ir properties were jointlyanalyzed. the entire sample of 33 sources has an average 1.2mm flux density of1.56+/-0.22mjy and a median of 1.61mjy, so the majority of the sources can beconsidered smgs. four sources have confirmed 4sigma detections, and nine weretentatively detected at the 3sigma level. because of its 24micron selection,our sample shows systematically lower f_(1.2mm)/f_(24micron) flux ratios thanclassical smgs, probably because of enhanced pah emission. a median fir sed wasbuilt by stacking images at the positions of 21 sources in the region ofdeepest spitzer coverage. its parameters are t_(dust)=37+/-8k,l_(fir)=2.5x10^{12}lo, and sfr=450mo/yr. the fir-radio correlation providesanother estimate of l_(fir) for each source, with an average value of4.1x10^{12}lo; however, this value may be overestimated because of some agncontribution. most of our targets are also luminous star-forming bzk galaxieswhich constitute a significant fraction of weak smgs at 1.7&lt;z&lt;2.3.

1002.4198	a galaxy populations study of a radio-selected protocluster at z~3.1	we present a population study of several types of galaxies within theprotocluster surrounding the radio galaxy mrc0316-257 at z~3.1. in addition tothe known population of ly_alpha emitters (laes) and [oiii] emitters, we usecolour selection techniques to identify protocluster candidates that are lymanbreak galaxies (lbg) and balmer break galaxies (bbgs). the radio galaxy fieldcontains an excess of lbg candidates, with a surface density 1.6\pm0.3 timeslarger than found for comparable blank fields. this surface overdensitycorresponds to an lbg volume overdensity of ~8\pm4. the bbg photometricredshift distribution peaks at the protocluster's redshift, but we detect nosignificant surface overdensity of bbg. this is not surprising because a volumeoverdensity similar to the lbgs would have resulted in a surface density of~1.2 that found in the blank field. this could not have been detected in oursample. masses and star formation rates of the candidate protocluster galaxiesare determined using sed fitting. these properties are not significantlydifferent from those of field galaxies. the galaxies with the highest massesand star formation rates are located near the radio galaxy, indicating that theprotocluster environment influences galaxy evolution at z~3. we conclude thatthe protocluster around mrc0316-257 is still in the early stages of formation.

1104.0937	the dynamics of the ionized and molecular ism in powerful obscured  quasars at z&gt;=3.5	we present an analysis of the kinematics and excitation of the warm ionizedgas in two obscured, powerful quasars at z&gt;=3.5 from the swire survey, swirej022513.90-043419.9 and swire j022550.67-042142, based on imaging spectroscopyon the vlt. line ratios in both targets are consistent with luminousnarrow-line regions of agn. swire j022550.67-042142 has very broad (fwhm=2000km/s), spatially compact [oiii] line emission. swire j022513.90-043419.9 isspatially resolved, has complex line profiles of h-beta and [oiii], includingbroad wings with blueshifts of up to -1500 km/s relative to the narrow[oiii]5007 component, and widths of up to fwhm=5000 km/s. estimating thesystemic redshift from the narrow h-beta line, as is standard for agn hostgalaxies, implies that a significant fraction of the molecular gas isblueshifted by up to ~ -1000 km/s relative to the systemic velocity. thus themolecular gas could be participating in the outflow. significant fractions ofthe ionized and molecular gas reach velocities greater than the escapevelocity. we compare empirical and modeling constraints for different energyinjection mechanisms, such as merging, star formation, and momentum-driven agnwinds. we argue that the radio source is the most likely culprit, in spite ofthe sources rather modest radio power of 10^25 w/hz. such a radio power is notuncommon for intense starburst galaxies at z~2. we discuss these results inlight of the co-evolution of agn and their host galaxy.

1206.5821	rapid coeval black hole and host galaxy growth in mrc 1138-262: the  hungry spider	we present a detailed study of the infrared spectral energy distribution ofthe high-redshift radio galaxy mrc 1138-26 at z = 2.156, also known as thespiderweb galaxy. by combining photometry from spitzer, herschel and laboca wefit the rest-frame 5-300 um emission using a two component, starburst andactive galactic nucleus (agn), model. the total infrared (8 - 1000 um)luminosity of this galaxy is (1.97+/-0.28)x10^13 lsun with (1.17+/-0.27) and(0.79+/-0.09)x10^13 lsun due to the agn and starburst components respectively.the high derived agn accretion rate of \sim20% eddington, and the measured starformation rate (sfr) of 1390pm150 msun/yr, suggest that this massive system isin a special phase of rapid central black hole and host galaxy growth, likelycaused by a gas rich merger in a dense environment. the accretion rate issufficient to power both the jets and the previously observed large outflow.the high sfr and strong outflow suggest this galaxy could potentially exhaustits fuel for stellar growth in a few tens of myr, although the likely merger ofthe radio galaxy with nearby satellites suggest bursts of star formation mayrecur again on time scales of several hundreds of myr. the age of the radiolobes implies the jet started after the current burst of star formation, andtherefore we are possibly witnessing the transition from a merger-inducedstarburst phase to a radio-loud agn phase. we also note tentative evidence for[cii]158um emission. this paper marks the first results from the herschelgalaxy evolution project (project herge), a systematic study of theevolutionary state of 71 high redshift, 1 &lt; z &lt; 5.2, radio galaxies.

1209.5399	jet and torus orientations in high redshift radio galaxies	we examine the relative orientation of radio jets and dusty tori surroundingthe agn in powerful radio galaxies at z &gt; 1. the radio core dominance r = p(20ghz) /p(500 mhz) serves as an orientation indicator, measuring the ratiobetween the anisotropic doppler-beamed core extended core emission and theisotropic lobe emission. assuming a fixed cylindrical geometry for the hot,dusty torus, we derive its inclination i by fitting optically-thick radiativetransfer models to spectral energy distributions obtained with the spitzerspace telescope. we find a highly significant anti-correlation (p &lt; 0.0001)between r and i in our sample of 35 type 2 agn combined with a sample of 18 z =1 3cr sources containing both type 1 and 2 agn. this analysis providesobservational evidence both for the unified scheme of agn and for the commonassumption that radio jets are in general perpendicular to the plane of thetorus. the use of inclinations derived from mid-infrared photometry breaksseveral degeneracies which have been problematic in earlier analyses. weillustrate this by deriving the core lorentz factor gamma from the r-ianti-correlation, finding gamma &gt; 1.3.

1210.4984	the orientation and polarization of broad absorption line quasars	we present new spectropolarimetric observations of 8 radio-loud broadabsorption line (bal) quasars, and combine these new data with our previousspectropolarimetric atlases (of both radio-loud and radio-quiet objects) inorder to investigate the polarization properties of bal quasars as a group. thetotal (radio-selected) sample includes 36 (26) high-ionization and 22 (15)low-ionization bal quasars. on average, we confirm that broad emission linesare polarized at a level similar to or less than the continuum and broadabsorption troughs are more highly polarized, but we note that these propertiesare not true for all individual objects. of the whole sample, 18 (31%) havehigh (&gt;2%) continuum polarization, including 45% of the lobals and 22% ofhibals. we identify a few correlations between polarization and other quasarproperties, as well as some interesting non-correlations. in particular,continuum polarization does not correlate with radio spectral index, whichsuggests that the polarization is not due to a standard geometry and preferredviewing angle to bal quasars. the polarization also does not correlate with theamount of intrinsic dust reddening, indicating that the polarization is notsolely due to direct light attenuation either. polarization does appear todepend on the minimum bal outflow velocity, confirming the results of previousstudies, and it may correlate with the maximum outflow velocity. we also findthat continuum polarization anti-correlates with the polarization in the c ivbroad emission and broad absorption. these results suggest that thepolarization of bal quasars cannot be described by one simple model, and thatthe scatterer location and geometry can vary significantly from object toobject.

0801.1118	detection of `parent' molecules from the inner wind of agb stars as  tracers of non-equilibrium chemistry	asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars are typified by strong dust-driven,molecular outflows. for long, it was believed that the molecular setup of thecircumstellar envelope of agb stars is primarily determined by the atmosphericc/o ratio. however, recent observations of molecules such as hcn, sio, and soreveal gas-phase abundances higher than predicted by thermodynamic equilibrium(te) models. uv-photon initiated dissociation in the outer envelope ornon-equilibrium formation by the effect of shocks in the inner envelope may bethe origin of the anomolous abundances. we aim at detecting (i.) a group of`parent' molecules (co, sio, hcn, cs), predicted by the non-equilibrium studyof cherchneff (2006) to form with almost constant abundances independent of thec/o ratio and the stellar evolutionary stage on the asymptotic giant branch(agb), and (ii.) few molecules, such as sis and so,which are sensitive to theo- or c-rich nature of the star. several low and high excitation rotationaltransitions of key molecules are observed at mm and sub-mm wavelengths withjcmt and apex in four agb stars: the oxygen-rich mira wx psc, the s star w aql,and the two carbon stars v cyg and ii lup. a critical density analysis isperformed to determine the formation region of the high-excitation molecularlines. we detect the four `parent' molecules in all four objects, implyingthat, indeed, these chemical species form whatever the stage of evolution onthe agb. high-excitation lines of sis are also detected in three stars withapex, whereas so is only detected in the oxygen-rich star wx psc. this is thefirst multi-molecular observational proof that periodically shocked layersabove the photosphere of agb stars show some chemical homogeneity, whatever thephotospheric c/o ratio and stage of evolution of the star.

1310.5710	searching for large-scale structures around high-redshift radio galaxies  with herschel	this paper presents the first results of a far-infrared search forprotocluster-associated galaxy overdensities using the spire instrumenton-board the {\it herschel} space observatory. large ($\sim$400 arcmin$^{2}$)fields surrounding 26 powerful high-redshift radio galaxies ($2.0 &lt; z &lt; 4.1$;$l_{\rm 500 mhz} &gt; 10^{28.5}$ whz$^{-1}$) are mapped at 250, 350 and 500\mic togive a unique wide-field sample.  on average the fields have a higher than expected, compared to blank fields,surface density of 500\mic sources within 6 comoving mpc of the radio galaxy.the analysis is then restricted to potential protocluster members only, whichare identified using a far-infrared colour selection; this reveals significantoverdensities of galaxies in 2 fields, neither of which are previously knownprotoclusters. the probability of finding 2 overdensities of this size bychance, given the number of fields observed is $5 \times 10^{-4}$.overdensities here exist around radio galaxies with $l_{\rm 500 mhz} \gtrsim10^{29}$ whz$^{-1}$ and $z &lt; 3$. the radial extent of the average far-infraredoverdensity is found to be $\sim$6 comoving mpc.  comparison with predictions from numerical simulations shows that theoverdensities are consistent with having masses $&gt; 10^{14}$msolar. however, thelarge uncertainty in the redshift estimation means that it is possible thatthese far-infrared overdensities consist of several structures across theredshift range searched.

1310.6364	an alma survey of submillimeter galaxies in the extended chandra deep  field south: the agn fraction and x-ray properties of submillimeter galaxies	the large gas and dust reservoirs of submm galaxies (smgs) could potentiallyprovide ample fuel to trigger an active galactic nucleus (agn), but previousstudies of the agn fraction in smgs have been controversial largely due to theinhomogeneity and limited angular resolution of the available submillimetersurveys. here we set improved constraints on the agn fraction and x-rayproperties of the smgs with alma and chandra observations in the extendedchandra deep field-south (e-cdf-s). this study is the first among similar worksto have unambiguously identified the x-ray counterparts of smgs; this isaccomplished using the fully submm-identified, statistically reliable smgcatalog with 99 smgs from the alma laboca e-cdf-s submillimeter survey (aless).we found 10 x-ray sources associated with smgs (median redshift z = 2.3), ofwhich 8 were identified as agns using several techniques that enablecross-checking. the other 2 x-ray detected smgs have levels of x-ray emissionthat can be plausibly explained by their star-formation activity. 6 of the 8smg-agns are moderately/highly absorbed, with n_h &gt; 10e23 cm-2. an analysis ofthe agn fraction, taking into account the spatial variation of x-raysensitivity, yields an agn fraction of 17+16-6% for agns with rest-frame 0.5-8kev absorption-corrected luminosity &gt;7.8x10e42 erg s-1; we provide estimatedagn fractions as a function of x-ray flux and luminosity. alma's high angularresolution also enables direct x-ray stacking at the precise positions of smgsfor the first time, and we found 4 potential smg-agns in our stacking sample.

1311.3444	silicon isotopic abundance toward evolved stars and its application for  presolar grains	galactic chemical evolution (gce) is important for understanding thecomposition of the present-day interstellar medium (ism) and of our solarsystem. in this paper, we aim to track the gce by using the 29si/30si ratios inevolved stars and tentatively relate this to presolar grain composition. weused the apex telescope to detect thermal sio isotopologue emission toward fouroxygen-rich m-type stars. together with the data retrieved from the herschelscience archive and from the literature, we were able to obtain the 29si/30siratios for a total of 15 evolved stars inferred from their optically thin 29sioand 30sio emission. these stars cover a range of masses and ages, and becausethey do not significantly alter 29si/30si during their lifetimes, they provideexcellent probes of the ism metallicity (or 29si/30si ratio) as a function oftime. the 29si/30si ratios inferred from the thermal sio emission tend to belower toward low-mass oxygen-rich stars (e.g., down to about unity for w hya),and close to an interstellar or solar value of 1.5 for the higher-mass carbonstar irc+10216 and two red supergiants. there is a tentative correlationbetween the 29si/30si ratios and the mass-loss rates of evolved stars, where wetake the mass-loss rate as a proxy for the initial stellar mass or currentstellar age. this is consistent with the different abundance ratios found inpresolar grains. we found that older objects (up to possibly 10 gyr old) in oursample trace a previous, lower 29si/30si value of about 1. material with thisisotopic ratio is present in two subclasses of presolar grains, providingindependent evidence of the lower ratio. therefore, the 29si/30si ratio derivedfrom the sio emission of evolved stars is a useful diagnostic tool for thestudy of the gce and presolar grains.

1403.1667	the rest-frame submillimeter spectrum of high-redshift, dusty,  star-forming galaxies	we present the average rest-frame spectrum of high-redshift dusty,star-forming galaxies from 250-770ghz. this spectrum was constructed bystacking alma 3mm spectra of 22 such sources discovered by the south poletelescope and spanning z=2.0-5.7. in addition to multiple bright spectralfeatures of 12co, [ci], and h2o, we also detect several faint transitions of13co, hcn, hnc, hco+, and cn, and use the observed line strengths tocharacterize the typical properties of the interstellar medium of thesehigh-redshift starburst galaxies. we find that the 13co brightness in theseobjects is comparable to that of the only other z&gt;2 star-forming galaxy inwhich 13co has been observed. we show that the emission from the high-criticaldensity molecules hcn, hnc, hco+, and cn is consistent with a warm, densemedium with t_kin ~ 55k and n_h2 &gt;~ 10^5.5 cm^-3. high molecular hydrogendensities are required to reproduce the observed line ratios, and wedemonstrate that alternatives to purely collisional excitation are unlikely tobe significant for the bulk of these systems. we quantify the average emissionfrom several species with no individually detected transitions, and findemission from the hydride ch and the linear molecule cch for the first time athigh redshift, indicating that these molecules may be powerful probes ofinterstellar chemistry in high-redshift systems. these observations representthe first constraints on many molecular species with rest-frame transitionsfrom 0.4-1.2mm in star-forming systems at high redshift, and will be invaluablein making effective use of alma in full science operations.

0803.1615	submillimeter observations of the j2142-4423 lya protocluster at z =  2.38	we present observations aimed at exploring both the nature of lya emittingnebulae (lya blobs) at z=2.38 and the way they trace large scale structure(lss), by exploring their proximity to maximum starbursts through submillimeteremission. our most important objectives are to make a census of associatedsubmillimeter galaxies (smgs), check their properties, and look for a possibleoverdensity in the protocluster j2142-4426 at z=2.38.  we used the newly commissioned large apex bolometer camera (laboca) on theatacama pathfinder experiment (apex) telescope, in its science verificationphase, to carry out a deep 10'x10' map at 870 micron, and we performed multiplechecks of the quality of data processing and source extraction.  our map, the first published deep image, confirms the capabilities ofapex/laboca as the most efficient current equipment for wide and deep submmmapping. twenty-two sources were securely extracted with 870 micron fluxdensities in the range 3-21 mjy, rms noise 0.8-2.4 mjy, and far-ir luminositiesprobably in the range ~5-20 x 10(12) lo. only one of the four 50 kpc-extendedlya blobs has a secure 870 micron counterpart. the 870 micron source counts inthe whole area are marginally higher than in the shades scuba survey, with apossible over-density around this blob. the majority of the 3.6-24 micron sedsof the submillimeter sources indicate they are starburst dominated, withredshifts mostly &gt;2. however, there is evidence of a high-z agn in ~30% of thesources.

1409.1218	why z &gt; 1 radio-loud galaxies are commonly located in proto-clusters	distant powerful radio-loud active galactic nuclei (rlagn) tend to reside indense environments and are commonly found in proto-clusters at z &gt; 1.3. weexamine whether this occurs because rlagn are hosted by massive galaxies, whichpreferentially reside in rich environments. we compare the environments ofpowerful rlagn at 1.3 &lt; z &lt; 3.2 from the carla survey to a sample ofradio-quiet galaxies matched in mass and redshift. we find the environments ofrlagn are significantly denser than those of radio-quiet galaxies, implyingthat not more than 50% of massive galaxies in this epoch can host powerfulradio-loud jets. this is not an observational selection effect as we find noevidence to suggest it is easier to observe the radio emission when the galaxyresides in a dense environment. we therefore suggest that the dense mpc-scaleenvironment fosters the formation of a radio-jet from an agn. we show that thenumber density of potential rlagn host galaxies is consistent with every &gt;10^14 solar mass cluster having experienced powerful radio-loud feedback ofduration ~60 myr during 1.3 &lt; z &lt; 3.2. this feedback could heat theintracluster medium to the extent of 0.5-1 kev per gas particle, which couldlimit the amount of gas available for further star formation in theproto-cluster galaxies.

1409.4764	allsmog: an apex low-redshift legacy survey for molecular gas. i -  molecular gas scaling relations, and the effect of the co/h2 conversion  factor	we present allsmog, the apex low-redshift legacy survey for molecular gas.allsmog is a survey designed to observe the co(2-1) emission line with the apextelescope, in a sample of local galaxies (0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.03), with stellar massesin the range 8.5 &lt; log(m*/msun) &lt; 10. this paper is a data release and initialanalysis of the first two semesters of observations, consisting of 42 galaxiesobserved in co(2-1). by combining these new co(2-1) emission line data witharchival hi data and sdss optical spectroscopy, we compile a sample of low-massgalaxies with well defined molecular gas masses, atomic gas masses, andgas-phase metallicities. we explore scaling relations of gas fraction and gasconsumption timescale, and test the extent to which our findings are dependenton a varying co/h2 conversion factor. we find an increase in the h2/hi massratio with stellar mass which closely matches semi-analytic predictions. wefind a mean molecular gas fraction for allsmog galaxies of mh2/m* = (0.09 -0.13), which decreases with stellar mass. we measure a mean molecular gasconsumption timescale for allsmog galaxies of 0.4 - 0.7 gyr. we also confirmthe non-universality of the molecular gas consumption timescale, which varies(with stellar mass) from ~100 myr to ~2 gyr. importantly, we find that thetrends in the h2/hi mass ratio, gas fraction, and the non-universal moleculargas consumption timescale are all robust to a range of recentmetallicity-dependent co/h2 conversion factors.

1410.3730	an excess of dusty starbursts related to the spiderweb galaxy	we present apex laboca 870 micron observations of the field around thehigh-redshift radio galaxy mrc1138-262 at z=2.16. we detect 16 submillimetergalaxies in this ~140 square arcmin bolometer map with flux densities in therange 3-11 mjy. the raw number counts indicate a density of submillimetergalaxies (smgs) that is up to four times that of blank field surveys. based onan exquisite multiwavelength database, including vla 1.4 ghz radio and infraredobservations, we investigate whether these sources are members of theprotocluster structure at z=2.2. using herschel pacs+spire and spitzer mipsphotometry, we derive reliable far-infrared photometric redshifts for allsources. follow-up vlt isaac and sinfoni near-infrared spectra confirm thatfour of these smgs have redshifts of z=2.2. we also present evidence thatanother smg in this field, detected earlier at 850 micron, has a counterpartthat exhibits halpha and co(1-0) emission at z=2.15. including the radio galaxyand two smgs with far-ir photometric redshifts at z=2.2, we conclude that atleast eight submm sources are part of the protocluster at z=2.16 associatedwith the radio galaxy mrc1138-262. we measure a star formation rate densitysfrd ~1500 msun yr^-1 mpc^-3, four magnitudes higher than the global sfrd ofblank fields at this redshift. strikingly, these eight sources are concentratedwithin a region of 2 mpc (the typical size of clusters in the local universe)and are distributed within the filaments traced by the halpha emitters atz=2.2. this concentration of massive, dusty starbursts is not centered on thesubmillimeter-bright radio galaxy which could support the infalling of thesesources into the cluster center. approximately half (6/11) of the smgs that arecovered by the halpha imaging data are associated with halpha emitters,demonstrating the potential of tracing smg counterparts with this population(abridged).

1505.00949	a co-rich merger shaping a powerful and hyper-luminous infrared radio  galaxy at z=2: the dragonfly galaxy	in the low-redshift universe, the most powerful radio sources are oftenassociated with gas-rich galaxy mergers or interactions. we here presentevidence for an advanced, gas-rich (`wet') merger associated with a powerfulradio galaxy at a redshift of z~2. this radio galaxy, mrc 0152-209, is the mostinfrared-luminous high-redshift radio galaxy known in the southern hemisphere.using the australia telescope compact array, we obtained high-resolutionco(1-0) data of cold molecular gas, which we complement with hst/wfpc2 imagingand wht long-slit spectroscopy. we find that, while roughly m(h2) ~ 2 x10$^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$ of molecular gas coincides with the central host galaxy,another m(h2) ~ 3 x 10$^{10}$ m$_{\odot}$ is spread across a total extent of~60 kpc. most of this widespread co(1-0) appears to follow prominent tidalfeatures visible in the rest-frame near-uv hst/wfpc2 imaging. ly$\alpha$emission shows an excess over heii, but a deficiency over l(ir), which islikely the result of photo-ionisation by enhanced but very obscured starformation that was triggered by the merger. in terms of feedback, the radiosource is aligned with widespread co(1-0) emission, which suggests that thereis a physical link between the propagating radio jets and the presence of coldmolecular gas on scales of the galaxy's halo. its optical appearance, combinedwith the transformational stage at which we witness the evolution of mrc0152-209, leads us to adopt the name `dragonfly galaxy'.

1506.03725	defying jet-gas alignment in two radio galaxies at z~2 with extended  light profiles: similarities to brightest cluster galaxies	we report the detection of extended warm ionized gas in two powerfulhigh-redshift radio galaxies, nvss j210626-314003 at z=2.10 and txs 2353-003 atz=1.49, that does not appear to be associated with the radio jets. this iscontrary to what would be expected from the alignment effect, a characteristicfeature of distant, powerful radio galaxies at z&gt; 0.6. the gas also has smallervelocity gradients and line widths than most other high-z radio galaxies withsimilar data. both galaxies are part of a systematic study of 50 high-redshiftradio galaxies with sinfoni, and are the only two that are characterized by thepresence of high surface-brightness gas not associated with the jet axis and bythe absence of such gas aligned with the jet. both galaxies are spatiallyresolved with isaac broadband imaging covering the rest-frame r band, and haveextended wings that cannot be attributed to line contamination. we argue thatthe gas and stellar properties of these galaxies are more akin to gas-richbrightest cluster galaxies in cool-core clusters than the general population ofhigh-redshift radio galaxies at z&gt;2. in support of this interpretation, one ofour sources, txs 2353-003, for which we have h\alpha\ narrowband imaging, isassociated with an overdensity of candidate h\alpha\ emitters by a factor of 8relative to the field at z=1.5. we discuss possible scenarios of theevolutionary state of these galaxies and the nature of their emission line gaswithin the context of cyclical agn feedback.

0805.2143	mid-infrared spectra of high redshift (z&gt;2) radio galaxies	we present the first mid-infrared spitzer/infrared spectrograph (irs)observations of powerful radio galaxies at z&gt;2. these radio galaxies, 4c +23.56(z=2.48) and 6c j1908+7220 (z=3.53), both show strong mid-infrared continua,but with 6c j1908+7220 also showing strong pah emission at rest-frame 6.2 and7.7um. in 4c+23.56 we see no obvious pah features above the continuum. the pahemission in 6c j1908+7220 is the amongst the most distant observed to date andimplies that there is a large instantaneous star formation rate (sfr). this isconsistent with the strong detection of 6c j1908+7220 at far-ir and sub-mmwavelengths, indicative of large amounts of cold dust, ~10^9msun. powerfulradio galaxies at lower redshifts tend to have weak or undetectable pahfeatures and typically have lower far-ir luminosities. in addition, 4c 23.56shows moderate silicate absorption as seen in less luminous radio galaxies,indicating tau_{9.7um}=0.3+/-0.05. this feature is shifted out of the observedwavelength range for 6c j1908+7220. the correlation of strong pah features withlarge amounts of cold dust, despite the presence of a powerful agn, is inagreement with other recent results and implies that star formation at highredshift is, in some cases at least, associated with powerful, obscured agn.

1509.02835	stellar masses and star formation rates of lensed dusty star-forming  galaxies from the spt survey	to understand cosmic mass assembly in the universe at early epochs, weprimarily rely on measurements of stellar mass and star formation rate ofdistant galaxies. in this paper, we present stellar masses and star formationrates of six high-redshift ($2.8\leq z \leq 5.7$) dusty, star-forming galaxies(dsfgs) that are strongly gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxies. thesesources were first discovered by the south pole telescope (spt) at millimeterwavelengths and all have spectroscopic redshifts and robust lens models derivedfrom alma observations. we have conducted follow-up observations, obtainingmulti-wavelength imaging data, using {\it hst}, {\it spitzer}, {\it herschel}and the atacama pathfinder experiment (apex). we use the high-resolution {\ithst}/wfc3 images to disentangle the background source from the foreground lensin {\it spitzer}/irac data. the detections and upper limits provide importantconstraints on the spectral energy distributions (seds) for these dsfgs,yielding stellar masses, ir luminosities, and star formation rates (sfrs). thesed fits of six spt sources show that the intrinsic stellar masses span a rangemore than one order of magnitude with a median value $\sim$ 5 $\times10^{10}m_{\sun}$. the intrinsic ir luminosities range from 4$\times10^{12}l_{\sun}$ to 4$\times 10^{13}l_{\sun}$. they all have prodigiousintrinsic star formation rates of 510 to 4800 $m_{\sun} {\rm yr}^{-1}$.compared to the star-forming main sequence (ms), these six dsfgs have specificsfrs that all lie above the ms, including two galaxies that are a factor of 10higher than the ms. our results suggest that we are witnessing the ongoingstrong starburst events which may be driven by major mergers.

1510.01359	probing star formation in the dense environments of z~1 lensing halos  aligned with dusty star-forming galaxies detected with the south pole  telescope	we probe star formation in the environments of massive$\sim10^{13}\,m_{\odot}$ dark matter halos at redshifts of $z$$\sim$$1$. thisstar formation is linked to a sub-millimetre clustering signal which we detectin maps of the planck high frequency instrument that are stacked at thepositions of a sample of high-redshift ($z$$&gt;$$2$) strongly-lensed dustystar-forming galaxies (dsfgs) selected from the south pole telescope (spt) 2500deg$^2$ survey. the clustering signal has sub-millimetre colours which areconsistent with the mean redshift of the foreground lensing halos($z$$\sim$$1$). we report a mean excess of star formation rate (sfr) comparedto the field, of $(2700\pm700)\,m_{\odot}\,{yr}^{-1}$ from all galaxiescontributing to this clustering signal within a radius of 3.5' from the sptdsfgs. the magnitude of the planck excess is in broad agreement withpredictions of a current model of the cosmic infrared background. the modelpredicts that 80$\%$ of the excess emission measured by planck originates fromgalaxies lying in the neighbouring halos of the lensing halo. using herschelmaps of the same fields, we find a clear excess, relative to the field, ofindividual sources which contribute to the planck excess. the mean excess sfrcompared to the field is measured to be ($370\pm40)$$\,m_{\odot}\,{yr}^{-1}$per resolved, clustered source. our findings suggest that the environmentsaround these massive $z$$\sim$$1$ lensing halos host intense star formation outto about $2\,$mpc. the flux enhancement due to clustering should also beconsidered when measuring flux densities of galaxies in planck data.

1510.02381	alma unveils a triple merger and gas exchange in a hyper-luminous radio  galaxy at z=2: the dragonfly galaxy (ii)	the dragonfly galaxy (mrc0152-209), at redshift z~2, is one of the mostvigorously star-forming radio galaxies in the universe. what triggered itsactivity? we present alma cycle 2 observations of cold molecular co(6-5) gasand dust, which reveal that this is likely a gas-rich triple merger. itconsists of a close double nucleus (separation ~4 kpc) and a weak co-emitter at~10 kpc distance, all of which have counterparts in hst/nicmos imagery. thehyper-luminous starburst and powerful radio-agn were triggered at thisprecoalescent stage of the merger. the co(6-5) traces dense molecular gas inthe central region, and complements existing co(1-0) data, which revealed morewidespread tidal debris of cold gas. we also find ~10$^{10}$ m(sun) ofmolecular gas with enhanced excitation at the highest velocities. at least20-50% of this high-excitation, high-velocity gas shows kinematics thatsuggests it is being displaced and redistributed within the merger, althoughwith line-of-sight velocities of |v| &lt; 500 km/s, this gas will probably notescape the system. the processes that drive the redistribution of cold gas arelikely related to either the gravitational interaction between two kpc-scalediscs, or starburst/agn-driven outflows. we estimate that the rate at which themolecular gas is redistributed is at least ~1200 +- 500 m(sun)/yr, and couldperhaps even approach the star formation rate of ~3000 +- 800 m(sun)/yr. thefact that the gas depletion and gas redistribution timescales are similarimplies that dynamical processes can be important in the evolution of massivehigh-z galaxies.

1510.06631	kinematic signatures of agn feedback in moderately powerful radio  galaxies at z~2 observed with sinfoni	most successful galaxy formation scenarios now postulate that the intensestar formation in massive, high-redshift galaxies during their major growthperiod was truncated when powerful agns launched galaxy-wide outflows of gasthat removed large parts of the interstellar medium. the most powerful radiogalaxies at z~2 show clear signatures of such winds, but are too rare to begood representatives of a generic phase in the evolution of all massivegalaxies at high redshift. here we present sinfoni imaging spectroscopy of 12radio galaxies at z~2 that are intermediate between the most powerful radio andvigorous starburst galaxies in radio power, and common enough to represent ageneric phase in the early evolution of massive galaxies.  the kinematic properties are diverse, with regular velocity gradients withamplitudes of delta v=200-400 km s^-1 as in rotating disks as well as irregularkinematics with multiple velocity jumps of a few 100 km s^-1. line widths aregenerally high, typically around fwhm=800 km s^-1, consistent with windvelocities in hydrodynamic models. a broad h-alpha line in one target implies ablack hole mass of a few 10^9 m$_sun. the ratio of line widths, sigma, to bulkvelocity, v, is so large that even the gas in galaxies with regular velocityfields is unlikely to be gravitationally bound. it is unclear, however, whetherthe large line widths are due to turbulence or unresolved, local outflows asare sometimes observed at low redshifts. comparison of the kinetic energy withthe energy supply from the agn through jet and radiation pressure suggests thatthe radio source still plays a dominant role for feedback, consistent withlow-redshift radio-loud quasars.

astro-ph;0101152	deep vlt spectroscopy of the z=2.49 radio galaxy mrc 2104-242: evidence  for a metallicity gradient in its extended emission line region	we present spectroscopic observations of the rest-frame uv line emissionaround radio galaxy mrc 2104-242 at z=2.49, obtained with fors1 on vlt antu.the morphology of the halo is dominated by two spatially resolved regions. lyais extended by &gt;12 arcsec along the radio axis, civ and heii are extended by ~8arcsec. the overall spectrum is typical for that of high redshift radiogalaxies. the most striking spatial variation is that nv is present in thespectrum of the region associated with the center of the galaxy hosting theradio source, the northern region, while absent in the southern region.assuming that the gas is photoionized by a hidden quasar, the difference in nvemission can be explained by a metallicity gradient within the halo. this isconsistent with a scenario in which the gas is associated with a massivecooling flow or originates from the debris of the merging of two or moregalaxies.

astro-ph;0203249	the most distant structure of galaxies known: a protocluster at z=4.1	imaging and spectroscopy with the very large telescope have revealed 20lyman-alpha emitters within a projected distance of 1.3 mpc and 600 km/s of theluminous radio galaxy tn j1338-1942 at z=4.1. compared to the field density oflyman-alpha emitters, this implies an overdensity on the order of 15. thestructure has a projected size of at least 2.7 mpc x 1.8 mpc and a velocitydispersion of 325 km/s, which makes it the most distant structure known. usingthe galaxy overdensity and assuming a bias parameter b = 3 - 5, the mass isestimated to be ~10^15 m_sun. the radio galaxy itself is surrounded by anuniquely asymmetric lyman-alpha halo. taken together with our previous data onpks 1138-262 at z ~ 2.16, these results suggest that luminous radio sources areexcellent tracers of high density regions in the early universe, which evolveinto present-day clusters. the statistics of bright radio sources and ofconcentrations in the lyman break galaxy population are consistent with thepicture that each of those concentrations harbours an active or passiveluminous radio source.

astro-ph;0311490	the radio galaxy k-z relation: the 10^12 msol mass limit; masses of  galaxies from the l_k luminosity, up to z &gt;4	the narrow k-z relation of powerful radio galaxies in the hubble k diagram isoften attributed to the stellar populations of massive elliptical galaxies.extended over a large range of redshifts (0&lt;z&lt;4), it is difficult to estimatemasses at high z from galaxy evolution. in the present paper, we propose toestimate the stellar masses of galaxies using the galaxy evolution modelpegase. we use star formation scenarios that successfully fit faint galaxycounts and z=0 galaxy templates. they also allow to estimate valid photometricredshifts. the baryonic mass of the initial gas cloud m_bar is then derived.the k-z relation is remarkably reproduced by our scenario for ellipticalgalaxies of baryonic mass m_(bar,max)=10^12 msol, at all z up to z=4.m_(bar,max) is also the maximum mass limit of all types of galaxies. usinganother imf, even a top-heavy one, does not alter our conclusions. the highvalue of m_(bar,max) observed at z &gt; 4 implies that massive clouds were alreadyformed at early epochs. we also find that the m_(bar,max) limit is similar tothe critical mass m_crit of a self-gravitating cloud regulated by cooling (rees&amp; ostriker, 1977; silk, 1977). moreover, the critical size r_crit = 75 kpc isremarkably close to the typical diameter of ly_alpha haloes surrounding distantradio galaxies. this confirms the validity of the method of baryonic massdetermination based on the k-band luminosity. a puzzling question that remainsto be answered is the short time-scale of mass-accumulation required to formsuch massive galaxies at z=4. we discuss the dispersion of the k-z relation andthe link between the active nucleus and a large stellar mass.

astro-ph;0501259	properties of ly-alpha emitters around the radio galaxy mrc 0316-257	observations of the radio galaxy mrc 0316-257 at z=3.13 and the surroundingfield are presented. using narrow- and broad-band imaging obtained with thevlt, 77 candidate ly-alpha emitters with a rest-frame equivalent width of &gt; 15a were selected in a ~7'x7' field around the radio galaxy. spectroscopy of 40candidate emitters resulted in the discovery of 33 emission line galaxies ofwhich 31 are ly-alpha emitters with redshifts similar to that of the radiogalaxy, while the remaining two galaxies turned out to be [oii] emitters. thely-alpha profiles have widths (fwhm) in the range of 120-800 km/s, with amedian of 260 km/s. where the signal-to-noise was large enough, the ly-alphaprofiles were found to be asymmetric, with apparent absorption troughs bluewardof the profile peaks, indicative of absorption along the line of sight of an himass of at least 2x10^2 - 5x10^4 m_sun. the properties of the ly-alpha galaxies(faint, blue and small) are consistent with young star forming galaxies whichare still nearly dust free. the volume density of ly-alpha emitting galaxies inthe field around mrc 0316-257 is a factor of 3.3+0.5-0.4 larger compared withthe density of field ly-alpha emitters at that redshift. the velocitydistribution of the spectroscopically confirmed emitters has a fwhm of 1510km/s, which is substantially smaller than the width of the narrow-band filter(fwhm ~ 3500 km/s). the peak of the velocity distribution is located within 200km/s of the redshift of the radio galaxy. we conclude that the confirmedly-alpha emitters are members of a protocluster of galaxies at z~3.13. the sizeof the protocluster is larger than 3.3x3.3 mpc^2. the mass of this structure isestimated to be &gt; 3-6x10^14 m_sun and could be the progenitor of a cluster ofgalaxies similar to e.g. the virgo cluster.

0809.1267	spatially extended absorption around the z=2.63 radio galaxy mrc  2025-218: outflow or infall?	we present an investigation into the absorber in front of the z=2.63 radiogalaxy mrc 2025-218, using integral field spectroscopy obtained at the verylarge telescope, and long slit spectroscopy obtained at the keck ii telescope.the properties of mrc 2025-218 are particularly conducive to study the natureof the absorbing gas, i.e., this galaxy shows bright and spatially extendedly-alpha emission, along with bright continuum emission from the activenucleus. ly-alpha absorption is detected across ~40x30 kpc^2, has a coveringfactor of ~1, and shows remarkably little variation in its properties acrossits entire spatial extent. this absorber is kinematically detached from theextended emission line region (eelr). its properties suggest that the absorberis outside of the eelr. we derive lower limits to the hi, hii and h columndensities for this absorber of 3x10^16, 7x10^17 and 2x10^18 cm^-2,respectively. moreover, the relatively bright emission from the active nucleushas allowed us to measure a number of metal absorption lines: ci, cii, civ, nv,oi, siii, siiv, alii and aliii. the column density ratios are most naturallyexplained using photoionization by a hard continuum, with an ionizationparameter u~0.0005-0.005. shocks or photoionization by young stars cannotreproduce satisfactorily the measured column ratios. using the ratio betweenthe siii* and siii column densities, we derive a lower limit of &gt;10 cm^-3 forthe electron density of the absorber. the data do not allow useful constraintsto be placed on the metallicity of the absorber. we consider two possibilitiesfor the nature of this absorber: the cosmological infall of gas, and an outflowdriven by supernovae or the radio-jets.

astro-ph;0606469	a search for distant radio galaxies from sumss and nvss: iii. radio  spectral energy distributions and the z-alpha correlation	this is the third in a series of papers that present observations and resultsfor a sample of 76 ultra-steep-spectrum radio sources designed to find galaxiesat high redshift. here we present multi-frequency radio observations, from theaustralia telescope compact array, for a subset of 37 galaxies from the sample.matched resolution observations at 2.3, 4.8 and 6.2ghz are presented for allgalaxies, with the z&lt;2 galaxies additionally observed at 8.6 and 18ghz. newangular size constraints are reported for 19 sources based on high resolution4.8 and 6.2ghz observations. functional forms for the rest-frame spectralenergy distributions are derived: 89% of the sample is well characterised by asingle power law, whilst the remaining 11% show some flattening toward higherfrequencies: not one source shows any evidence for high frequency steepening.we discuss the implications of this result in light of the empiricalcorrelation between redshift and spectral index seen in flux limited samples ofradio galaxies. finally, a new physical mechanism to explain the redshift --spectral index correlation is posited: extremely steep spectrum radio galaxiesin the local universe usually reside at the centres of rich galaxy clusters. weargue that if a higher fraction of radio galaxies, as a function of redshift,are located in environments with densities similar to nearby rich clusters,then this could be a natural interpretation for the correlation. we brieflyoutline our plans to pursue this line of investigation.

astro-ph;0611778	giant lyman-alpha nebulae around z&gt;2 radio galaxies: evidence for infall	we present an investigation into the possible relationship betweenside-to-side asymmetries of powerful radio galaxies at high redshift, with thegoal of understanding the geometry, orientation and gas dynamics of thesesources. our sample consists of 11 radio galaxies at 2.3&lt;z&lt;3.6 previously knownto have giant, kinematically quiescent nebulae. we identify several correlatedasymmetries: on the side of the brightest radio jet and hotspot (i) theredshift of the kinematically quiescent nebula is highest, (ii) ly-alpha isbrighter relative to the other lines and continuum, (iii) the radio spectrum isflattest and (iv) the radio structure has its highest polarization. theseasymmetries are not found to be correlated with either the radio arm lengthasymmetry or the brightness asymmetry of the uv-optical emitting material. thecorrelation between the radio brightness asymmetry and the radial velocity ofthe quiescent gas also appears to be present in powerful radio galaxies with0&lt;z&lt;1.  collectively, these asymmetries are most naturally explained as an effect oforientation, with the quiescent nebulae in infall: this is the first study todistinguish between the rotation, infall, outflow and chaotic motion scenariosfor the kinematically quiescent emission line nebulae around powerful activegalactic nuclei.

astro-ph;0612116	ly-alpha excess in high redshift radio galaxies: a signature of star  formation	about 54% of radio galaxies at z&gt;3 and 8% of radio galaxies at 2&lt;z&lt;3 showunusually strong ly-alpha emission, compared with the general population ofhigh redshift (z&gt;2) radio galaxies. these ly-alpha excess objects (laes) showly-alpha/heii values consistent with or above standard photoionization modelpredictions.  we show that the most successful explanation is the presence of a youngstellar population which provides the extra supply of ionizing photons requiredto explain the ly-alpha excess in at least the most extreme laes (probably inall of them).  the measurement of unusually high ly-alpha ratios in the extended gas of somehigh redshift radio galaxies suggests that star formation activity occurs inspatial scales of tens of kpc.  we argue that, although the fraction of laes may be incompletely determined,both at 2&lt;z&lt;3 and at z&gt;3, the much larger fraction of laes found at z&gt;3 is agenuine redshift evolution and not due to selection effects. therefore, ourresults suggest that the radio galaxy phenomenon is more often associated witha massive starburst at z&gt;3 than at z&lt;3.

0809.5171	evidence for powerful agn winds at high redshift: dynamics of galactic  outflows in radio galaxies during the "quasar era"	agn feedback now appears as an attractive mechanism to resolve some of theoutstanding problems with the "standard" cosmological models, in particularthose related to massive galaxies. to directly constrain how this may influencethe formation of massive galaxies near the peak in the redshift distribution ofpowerful quasars, z~2, we present an analysis of the emission-line kinematicsof 3 powerful radio galaxies at z~2-3 (hzrgs) based on rest-frame opticalintegral-field spectroscopy obtained with sinfoni on the vlt. hzrgs are amongthe most massive galaxies, so agn feedback may have a particularly clearsignature. we find evidence for bipolar outflows in all hzrgs, with kineticenergies that are equivalent to 0.2% of the rest-mass of the supermassive blackhole. velocity offsets in the outflows are ~800-1000 km s^-1 between theblueshifted and redshifted line emission, fwhms ~1000 km s^-1 suggest strongturbulence. ionized gas masses estimated from the ha luminosity are of order10^10 m_s, similar to the molecular gas content of hzrgs, underlining thatthese outflows may indicate a significant phase in the evolution of the hostgalaxy. the total energy release of ~10^60 erg during a dynamical time of ~10^7yrs corresponds to about the binding energy of a massive galaxy. geometry,timescales and energy injection rates of order 10% of the kinetic energy fluxof the jet suggest that the outflows are most likely driven by the radiosource. the global energy density release of ~10^57 erg s^-1 mpc^-3 may alsoinfluence the subsequent evolution of the hzrg by enhancing the entropy andpressure in the surrounding halo and facilitating ram-pressure stripping of gasin satellite galaxies that may contribute to the subsequent mass assembly ofthe hzrg through low-dissipation "dry" mergers.
