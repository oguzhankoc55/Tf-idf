0907.1093	aztec half square degree survey of the shades fields -- i. maps,  catalogues, and source counts	we present the first results from the largest deep extragalacticmillimetre-wavelength survey undertaken to date. these results are derived frommaps covering over 0.7 deg^2, made at 1.1mm, using the aztec continuum cameramounted on the james clerk maxwell telescope. the maps were made in the twofields originally targeted at 0.85mm with scuba in the shades project, namelythe lockman hole east (mapped to a depth of 0.9-1.3 mjy rms) and the subaru xmmdeep field (1.0-1.7 mjy rms). the wealth of existing and forthcoming deepmulti-frequency data in these two fields will allow the bright mm sourcepopulation revealed by these images to be explored in detail in subsequentpapers. here we present the maps themselves, a catalogue of 114high-significance sub-millimetre galaxy detections, and a thorough statisticalanalysis leading to the most robust determination to date of the 1.1mm sourcenumber counts. through careful comparison, we find that both the cosmos andgoods north fields, also imaged with aztec, contain an excess of mm sourcesover the new 1.1mm source-count baseline established here. in particular, ournew aztec/shades results indicate that very luminous high-redshift dustenshrouded starbursts (s_{1.1} &gt; 3 mjy) are 25-50% less common than would havebeen inferred from these smaller surveys, thus highlighting the potential rolesof cosmic variance and clustering in such measurements. we compare number countpredictions from recent models of the evolving mm/sub-mm source population tothese smg surveys, which provide important constraints for the ongoingrefinement of semi-analytic and hydrodynamical models of galaxy formation, andfind that all recent models over-predict the number of bright sub-millimetregalaxies found in this survey.

0910.5120	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the input catalogue and star-galaxy  separation	we describe the spectroscopic target selection for the galaxy and massassembly (gama) survey. the input catalogue is drawn from the sloan digital skysurvey (sdss) and ukirt infrared deep sky survey (ukidss). the aim is tomeasure redshifts for galaxies in three 4x12 degree regions at 9h, 12h and14.5h, on the celestial equator, with magnitude selections r &lt; 19.4, z &lt; 18.2and k(ab) &lt; 17.6 over all three regions, and r &lt; 19.8 in the 12-h region. thetarget density is 1080 per sq. deg. in the 12-h region and 720 per sq. deg. inthe other regions. the average gama target density and area are compared withcompleted and ongoing galaxy redshift surveys. the gama survey implements ahighly complete star-galaxy separation that jointly uses an intensity-profileseparator (delta(sg) = r-band psf mag - model mag) as per the sdss) and acolour separator. the colour separator is defined as delta(sg,jk) = j - k -f(g-i), where f(g-i) is a quadratic fit to the j-k colour of the stellar locusover the range 0.3 &lt; g-i &lt; 2.3. all galaxy populations investigated are wellseparated with delta(sg,jk) &gt; 0.2. from two years out of a three-year aaomegaprogram on the anglo-australian telescope, we have obtained 79599 unique galaxyredshifts. previously known redshifts in the gama region bring the total up to98497. the median galaxy redshift is 0.2 with 99% at z &lt; 0.5. we present someof the global statistical properties of the survey, including k-band galaxycounts, colour-redshift relations and preliminary n(z).

0912.0039	x-ray groups and clusters of galaxies in the subaru-xmm deep field	we present the results of a search for galaxy clusters in subaru-xmm deep  field. we reach a depth for a total cluster flux in the 0.5-2 kev band of2x10^{-15} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1} over one of the widest xmm-newton contiguousraster surveys, covering an area of 1.3 square degrees. cluster candidates areidentified through a wavelet detection of extended x-ray emission. the redsequence technique allows us to identify 57 cluster candidates. we report onthe progress with the cluster spectroscopic follow-up and derive theirproperties based on the x-ray luminosity and cluster scaling relations. inaddition, 3 sources are identified as x-ray counterparts of radio lobes, and in3 further sources, x-ray counterpart of radio lobes provides a significantfraction of the total flux of the source. in the area covered by nir data, ouridentification success rate achieves 86%. we detect a number of radio galaxieswithin our groups and for a luminosity-limited sample of radio galaxies wecompute halo occupation statistics using a marked cluster mass function. wecompare the cluster detection statistics in the sxdf with the predictions ofconcordance cosmology and current knowledge of the x-ray cluster properties,concluding that a reduction of concordance sigma_8 value by 5% is required inorder to match the prediction of the model and the data. this conclusion stillneeds verification through the completion of cluster follow-up.

1011.3048	which halos host herschel-atlas galaxies in the local universe?	we measure the projected cross-correlation between low redshift (z &lt; 0.5)far-ir selected galaxies in the sdp field of the herschel-atlas (h-atlas)survey and optically selected galaxies from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama)redshift survey. in order to obtain robust correlation functions, we restrictthe analysis to a subset of 969 out of 6900 h-atlas galaxies, which havereliable optical counterparts with r&lt;19.4 mag and well-determined spectroscopicredshifts. the overlap region between the two surveys is 12.6 sq. deg; thematched sample has a median redshift of z ~ 0.2. the cross-correlation of gamaand h-atlas galaxies within this region can be fitted by a power law, withcorrelation length r_0 ~ 4.63 +/- 0.51 mpc. comparing with the correspondingauto-correlation function of gama galaxies within the sdp field yields arelative bias (averaged over 2-8 mpc) of h-atlas and gama galaxies of b_h/b_g ~0.6. combined with clustering measurements from previous optical studies, thisindicates that most of the low redshift h-atlas sources are hosted by haloswith masses comparable to that of the milky way. the correlation functionappears to depend on the 250 um luminosity, l_250, with bright (medianluminosity \nu l_250 ~ 1.6 x 10^10 l_sun) objects being somewhat more stronglyclustered than faint (\nu l_250 ~ 4.0 x 10^9 l_sun) objects. this implies thatgalaxies with higher dust-obscured star formation rates are hosted by moremassive halos.

1012.3771	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): galaxies at the faint end of the halpha  luminosity function	we present an analysis of the properties of the lowest halpha-luminositygalaxies (l_halpha&lt;4x10^32 w; sfr&lt;0.02 msun/yr) in the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey. these galaxies make up the the rise above a schechter functionin the number density of systems seen at the faint end of the halpha luminosityfunction. above our flux limit we find that these galaxies are principallycomposed of intrinsically low stellar mass systems (median stellar mass=2.5x10^8 msun) with only 5/90 having stellar masses m&gt;10^10 msun. the low sfrsystems are found to exist predominantly in the lowest density environments(median density ~0.02 galaxy mpc^-2 with none in environments more dense than~1.5 galaxy mpc^-2). their current specific star formation rates (ssfr; -8.5 &lt;log(ssfr[yr^-1])&lt;-12.) are consistent with their having had a variety of starformation histories. the low density environments of these galaxiesdemonstrates that such low-mass, star-forming systems can only remain aslow-mass and forming stars if they reside sufficiently far from other galaxiesto avoid being accreted, dispersed through tidal effects or having their gasreservoirs rendered ineffective through external processes.

1101.4822	the power of bayesian evidence in astronomy	we discuss the use of the bayesian evidence ratio, or bayes factor, for modelselection in astronomy. we treat the evidence ratio as a statistic andinvestigate its distribution over an ensemble of experiments, considering bothsimple analytical examples and some more realistic cases, which requirenumerical simulation. we find that the evidence ratio is a noisy statistic, andthus it may not be sensible to decide to accept or reject a model based solelyon whether the evidence ratio reaches some threshold value. the odds suggestedby the evidence ratio bear no obvious relationship to the power or type i errorrate of a test based on the evidence ratio. the general performance of suchtests is strongly affected by the signal to noise ratio in the data, theassumed priors, and the threshold in the evidence ratio that is taken as`decisive'. the comprehensiveness of the model suite under consideration isalso very important. the usefulness of the evidence ratio approach in a givenproblem can be assessed in advance of the experiment, using simple models andnumerical approximations. in many cases, this approach can be as informative asa much more costly full-scale bayesian analysis of a complex problem.

0704.2545	the angular correlations of galaxies in the cosmos field	we present measurements of the two-point galaxy angular correlation functionw(\theta) in the cosmos field. independent determinations of w(\theta) as afunction of magnitude limit are presented for both the hst acs catalog and alsofor the ground-based data from subaru and the cfht. despite havingsignificantly different masks, these three determinations agree well. at brightmagnitudes (iab&lt;22), our data generally match very well with existingmeasurements and with mock catalogs based on semi-analytic galaxy formationcalculations of kitzbichler and white from the millennium simulation. theexception is that our result is at the upper end of the expected cosmicvariance scatter for \theta &gt; 10 arcmin, which we attribute to a particularlyrich structure known to exist at z~0.8. for fainter samples, however, the levelof clustering is somewhat higher than reported by some previous studies: in allthree catalogues we find w(\theta=1')~0.014 at a median iab magnitude of 24. atthese very faintest magnitudes, our measurements agree well with the latestdeterminations from the canada-france legacy survey. this level of clusteringis approximately double what is predicted by the semi-analytic catalogs (at allangles). the semi-analytic results allow an estimate of cosmic variance, whichis too small to account for the discrepancy. we therefore conclude that themean amplitude of clustering at this level is higher than previously estimated.

1104.2379	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the star formation rate dependence of  the stellar initial mass function	the stellar initial mass function (imf) describes the distribution in stellarmasses produced from a burst of star formation. for more than fifty years, theimplicit assumption underpinning most areas of research involving the imf hasbeen that it is universal, regardless of time and environment. we measure thehigh-mass imf slope for a sample of low-to-moderate redshift galaxies from thegalaxy and mass assembly survey. the large range in luminosities and galaxymasses of the sample permits the exploration of underlying imf dependencies. astrong imf-star formation rate dependency is discovered, which shows thathighly star forming galaxies form proportionally more massive stars (they haveimfs with flatter power-law slopes) than galaxies with low star formationrates. this has a significant impact on a wide variety of galaxy evolutionstudies, all of which rely on assumptions about the slope of the imf. ourresult is supported by, and provides an explanation for, the results ofnumerous recent explorations suggesting a variation of or evolution in the imf.

1104.5020	the luminosity-dependent high-redshift turnover in the steep spectrum  radio luminosity function: clear evidence for downsizing in the radio-agn  population	this paper presents a new grid-based method for investigating the evolutionof the steep-spectrum radio luminosity function, with the aim of quantifyingthe high-redshift cut-off suggested by previous work. to achieve this, thecombined eis-nvss survey of radio sources (censors) has been developed; this isa 1.4 ghz radio survey, containing 135 sources complete to a flux density of7.2 mjy, selected from the nrao vla sky survey (nvss) over 6 deg^2 of the esoimaging survey (eis) patch d. the sample is currently 73% spectroscopicallycomplete, with the remaining redshifts estimated via the k-z or i-zmagnitude-redshift relation. censors is combined with additional radio datafrom the parkes all-sky, parkes selected regions, hercules and vla cosmossamples to provide comprehensive coverage of the radio power vs. redshiftplane. the redshift distributions of these samples, together with radio sourcecount determinations, and measurements of the local luminosity function,provide the input to the fitting process. the modelling reveals clear declines,at &gt; 3sigma significance, in comoving density at z &gt; 0.7 for lower luminositysources (log p = 25-26); these turnovers are still present at log p &gt; 27, butmove to z &gt; 3, suggesting a luminosity-dependent evolution of the redshiftturnover, similar to the `cosmic downsizing' seen for other agn populations.these results are shown to be robust to the estimated redshift errors and toincreases in the spectral index for the highest redshift sources. analytic fitsto the best-fitting steep spectrum grid are provided so that the resultspresented here can be easily accessed by the reader, as well as allowingplausible extrapolations outside of the regions covered by the input datasets

1107.0141	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the red fraction and radial  distribution of satellite galaxies	we investigate the properties of satellite galaxies that surround isolatedhosts within the redshift range 0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.15, using data taken as part ofthe galaxy and mass assembly survey. making use of isolation and satellitecriteria that take into account stellar mass estimates, we find 3514 isolatedgalaxies of which 1426 host a total of 2998 satellites. separating the red andblue populations of satellites and hosts, using colour-mass diagrams, weinvestigate the radial distribution of satellite galaxies and determine how thered fraction of satellites varies as a function of satellite mass, host massand the projected distance from their host. comparing the red fraction ofsatellites to a control sample of small neighbours at greater projected radii,we show that the increase in red fraction is primarily a function of host mass.the satellite red fraction is about 0.2 higher than the control sample forhosts with 11.0 &lt; log m_* &lt; 11.5, while the red fractions show no differencefor hosts with 10.0 &lt; log m_* &lt; 10.5. for the satellites of more massive hoststhe red fraction also increases as a function of decreasing projected distance.our results suggest that the likely main mechanism for the quenching of starformation in satellites hosted by isolated galaxies is strangulation.

1111.0166	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): ugriz galaxy luminosity functions	galaxy and mass assembly (gama) is a project to study galaxy formation andevolution, combining imaging data from ultraviolet to radio with spectroscopicdata from the aaomega spectrograph on the anglo-australian telescope. usingdata from phase 1 of gama, taken over three observing seasons, and correctingfor various minor sources of incompleteness, we calculate galaxy luminosityfunctions (lfs) and their evolution in the ugriz passbands.  at low redshift, z &lt; 0.1, we find that blue galaxies, defined according to amagnitude-dependent but non-evolving colour cut, are reasonably well fit over arange of more than ten magnitudes by simple schechter functions in all bands.red galaxies, and the combined blue-plus-red sample, require double power-lawschechter functions to fit a dip in their lf faintward of the characteristicmagnitude m* before a steepening faint end. this upturn is at least partly dueto dust-reddened disk galaxies.  we measure evolution of the galaxy lf over the redshift range 0.002 &lt; z &lt; 0.5using both a parametric fit and by measuring binned lfs in redshift slices. thecharacteristic luminosity l* is found to increase with redshift in all bands,with red galaxies showing stronger luminosity evolution than blue galaxies. thecomoving number density of blue galaxies increases with redshift, while that ofred galaxies decreases, consistent with prevailing movement from blue cloud tored sequence. as well as being more numerous at higher redshift, blue galaxiesalso dominate the overall luminosity density beyond redshifts z = 0.2. at lowerredshifts, the luminosity density is dominated by red galaxies in the rizbands, by blue galaxies in u and g.

1111.5707	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the galaxy stellar mass function at z &lt;  0.06	we determine the low-redshift field galaxy stellar mass function (gsmf) usingan area of 143 deg^2 from the first three years of the galaxy and mass assembly(gama) survey. the magnitude limits of this redshift survey are r &lt; 19.4 magover two thirds and 19.8 mag over one third of the area. the gsmf is determinedfrom a sample of 5210 galaxies using a density-corrected maximum volume method.this efficiently overcomes the issue of fluctuations in the number densityversus redshift. with h_0 = 70, the gsmf is well described between 10^8 and10^11.5 msun using a double schechter function with mass^* = 10^10.66 msun,phi_1^* = 3.96 x 10^-3 mpc^-3, alpha_1 = -0.35, phi_2^* = 0.79 x 10^-3 mpc^-3and alpha_2 = -1.47. this result is more robust to uncertainties in theflow-model corrected redshifts than from the shallower sloan digital sky surveymain sample (r &lt; 17.8 mag). the upturn in the gsmf is also seen directly in thei-band and k-band galaxy luminosity functions. accurately measuring the gsmfbelow 10^8 msun is possible within the gama survey volume but as expectedrequires deeper imaging data to address the contribution from lowsurface-brightness galaxies.

1206.0943	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): colour and luminosity dependent  clustering from calibrated photometric redshifts	we measure the two-point angular correlation function of a sample of4,289,223 galaxies with r &lt; 19.4 mag from the sloan digital sky survey as afunction of photometric redshift, absolute magnitude and colour down to m_r -5log h = -14 mag. photometric redshifts are estimated from ugriz modelmagnitudes and two petrosian radii using the artificial neural network packageannz, taking advantage of the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) spectroscopicsample as our training set. the photometric redshifts are then used todetermine absolute magnitudes and colours. for all our samples, we estimate theunderlying redshift and absolute magnitude distributions using monte-carloresampling. these redshift distributions are used in limber's equation toobtain spatial correlation function parameters from power law fits to theangular correlation function. we confirm an increase in clustering strength forsub-l* red galaxies compared with ~l* red galaxies at small scales in allredshift bins, whereas for the blue population the correlation length is almostindependent of luminosity for ~l* galaxies and fainter. a linear relationbetween relative bias and log luminosity is found to hold down to luminositiesl~0.03l*. we find that the redshift dependence of the bias of the l* populationcan be described by the passive evolution model of tegmark &amp; peebles (1998). avisual inspection of a random sample of our r &lt; 19.4 sample of sdss galaxiesreveals that about 10 per cent are spurious, with a higher contamination ratetowards very faint absolute magnitudes due to over-deblended nearby galaxies.we correct for this contamination in our clustering analysis.

1209.0259	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the 0.013 &lt; z &lt; 0.1 cosmic spectral  energy distribution from 0.1 micron to 1mm	we use the gama i dataset combined with galex, sdss and ukidss imaging toconstruct the low-redshift (z&lt;0.1) galaxy luminosity functions in fuv, nuv,ugriz, and yjhk bands from within a single well constrained volume of 3.4 x10^5 (mpc/h)^{3}. the derived luminosity distributions are normalised to thesdss dr7 main survey to reduce the estimated cosmic variance to the 5 per centlevel. the data are used to construct the cosmic spectral energy distribution(csed) from 0.1 to 2.1 \mum free from any wavelength dependent cosmic variancefor both the elliptical and non-elliptical populations. the two populationsexhibit dramatically different cseds as expected for a predominantly old andyoung population respectively. using the driver et al. (2008) prescription forthe azimuthally averaged photon escape fraction, the non-ellipticals arecorrected for the impact of dust attenuation and the combined csed constructed.the final results show that the universe is currently generating (1.8 +/- 0.3)x 10^{35} h w mpc^{-3} of which (1.2 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} h w mpc^{-3} isdirectly released into the inter-galactic medium and (0.6 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} hw mpc^{-3} is reprocessed and reradiated by dust in the far-ir. using the gamadata and our dust model we predict the mid and far-ir emission which agreesremarkably well with available data. we therefore provide a robust descriptionof the pre- and post dust attenuated energy output of the nearby universe from0.1micron to 0.6mm. the largest uncertainty in this measurement lies in the midand far-ir bands stemming from the dust attenuation correction and itscurrently poorly constrained dependence on environment, stellar mass, andmorphology.

1303.2621	the vimos public extragalactic redshift survey (vipers). a support  vector machine classification of galaxies, stars and agns	the aim of this work is to develop a comprehensive method for classifyingsources in large sky surveys and we apply the techniques to the vimos publicextragalactic redshift survey (vipers). using the optical (u*, g', r', i') andnir data (z', ks), we develop a classifier, based on broad-band photometry, foridentifying stars, agns and galaxies improving the purity of the vipers sample.support vector machine (svm) supervised learning algorithms allow the automaticclassification of objects into two or more classes based on a multidimensionalparameter space. in this work, we tailored the svm for classifying stars, agnsand galaxies, and applied this classification to the vipers data. we train thesvm using spectroscopically confirmed sources from the vipers and vvds surveys.we tested two svm classifiers and concluded that including nir data cansignificantly improve the efficiency of the classifier. the self-check of thebest optical + nir classifier has shown a 97% accuracy in the classification ofgalaxies, 97 for stars, and 95 for agns in the 5-dimensional colour space. inthe test on vipers sources with 99% redshift confidence, the classifier givesan accuracy equal to 94% for galaxies, 93% for stars, and 82% for agns. themethod was applied to sources with low quality spectra to verify theirclassification, and thus increasing the security of measurements for almost 4900 objects. we conclude that the svm algorithm trained on a carefully selectedsample of galaxies, agns, and stars outperforms simple colour-colour selectionmethods, and can be regarded as a very efficient classification methodparticularly suitable for modern large surveys.

1310.3380	the vimos public extragalactic redshift survey (vipers): $\omega_{\rm  m_0}$ from the galaxy clustering ratio measured at $z \sim 1$	we use a sample of about 22,000 galaxies at $0.65&lt;z&lt;1.2$ from the viperspdr-1 catalogue, to constrain the cosmological model through a measurement ofthe galaxy {\it clustering ratio} $\eta_{g,r}$. this statistic has favourableproperties, being defined as the ratio of two quantities characterizing thesmoothed density field in spheres of given radius $r$: the value of itscorrelation function on a multiple of this scale, $\xi(nr)$, and its variance$\sigma^2(r)$. for sufficiently large values of $r$, this is a universalnumber, capturing 2-point clustering information independently of the linearbias and linear redshift-space distortions of the specific galaxy tracers. inthis paper we discuss in detail how to extend the application of $\eta_{g,r}$to quasi-linear scales and how to control and remove observational selectioneffects which are typical of redshift surveys as vipers. we verify the accuracyand efficiency of these procedures using mock catalogues that match the surveyselection process. these results evidence the robustness of $\eta_{g,r}$ tonon-linearities and observational effects, which is related to its verydefinition as a ratio of quantities that are similarly affected.  we measure $\omega_{m,0}=0.270_{-0.025}^{+0.029}$. in addition to the greatprecision achieved on our estimation of $\omega_m$ using vipers pdr-1, thisresult is remarkable because it appears to be in good agreement with a recentestimate $z\simeq 0.3$, obtained applying the same technique to the sdss-lrgcatalogue. it, therefore, suports the robustness of the present analysis.moreover, the combination of these two measurements at $z\sim 0.3$ and $z\sim0.9$ provides us with a very precise estimate $\omega_{m,0}=0.274\pm0.017$which highlights the great consistency between our estimation and othercosmological probes such as baos, cmb and supernovae.

0705.0898	testing anthropic predictions for lambda and the cmb temperature	it has been claimed that the observed magnitude of the vacuum energy densityis consistent with the distribution predicted in anthropic models, in which anensemble of universes is assumed. this calculation is revisited, without makingthe assumption that the cmb temperature is known, and considering in detail thepossibility of a recollapsing universe. new accurate approximations for thegrowth of perturbations and the mass function of dark haloes are presented.structure forms readily in the recollapsing phase of a model with negativelambda, so collapse fraction alone cannot forbid lambda from being large andnegative. a negative lambda is disfavoured only if we assume that formation ofobservers can be neglected once the recollapsing universe has heated to t &gt; 8k. for the case of positive lambda, however, the current universe does occupy aextremely typical position compared to the predicted distribution on thelambda-t plane. contrasting conclusions can be reached if anthropic argumentsare applied to the curvature of the universe, and we discuss the falsifiabilityof this mode of anthropic reasoning.

1401.0837	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): mid-infrared properties and empirical  relations from $wise$	the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey furnishes a deep redshift catalogthat, when combined with the wide-field infrared explorer ($wise$), allows usto explore for the first time the mid-infrared properties of $&gt; 110, 000$galaxies over 120 deg$^2$ to $z\simeq 0.5$. in this paper we detail theprocedure for producing the matched gama-$wise$ catalog for the g12 and g15fields, in particular characterising and measuring resolved sources; thecomplete catalogs for all three gama equatorial fields will be made availablethrough the gama public releases. the wealth of multiwavelength photometry andoptical spectroscopy allows us to explore empirical relations between opticallydetermined stellar mass (derived from synthetic stellar population models) and3.4micron and 4.6micron wise measurements. similarly dust-correctedhalpha-derived star formation rates can be compared to 12micron and 22micronluminosities to quantify correlations that can be applied to large samples to$z&lt;0.5$. to illustrate the applications of these relations, we use the 12micronstar formation prescription to investigate the behavior of specific starformation within the gama-wise sample and underscore the ability of wise todetect star-forming systems at $z\sim0.5$. within galaxy groups (determined bya sophisticated friends-of-friends scheme), results suggest that galaxies witha neighbor within 100$\,h^{-1} $kpc have, on average, lower specific starformation rates than typical gama galaxies with the same stellar mass.

1401.3745	the vimos public extragalactic redshift survey (vipers). never mind the  gaps: comparing techniques to restore homogeneous sky coverage	[abridged] non-uniform sampling and gaps in sky coverage are common in galaxyredshift surveys, but these effects can degrade galaxy counts-in-cells anddensity estimates. we carry out a comparison of methods that aim to fill thegaps to correct for the systematic effects. our study is motivated by theanalysis of the vimos extragalactic redshift survey (vipers), a flux-limitedsurvey (i&lt;22.5) based on one-pass observations with vimos, with gaps covering25% of the surveyed area and a mean sampling rate of 35%. our findings areapplicable to other surveys with similar observing strategies. we compare 1)two algorithms based on photometric redshift, that assign redshifts to galaxiesbased on the spectroscopic redshifts of the nearest neighbours, 2) two bayesianmethods, the wiener filter and the poisson-lognormal filter. using galaxy mockcatalogues we quantify the accuracy of the counts-in-cells measurements onscales of r=5 and 8 mpc/h after applying each of these methods. we also studyhow they perform to account for spectroscopic redshift error and inhomogeneousand sparse sampling rate. we find that in vipers the errors in counts-in-cellsmeasurements on r&lt;10 mpc/h scales are dominated by the sparseness of thesample. all methods underpredict by 20-35% the counts at high densities. thissystematic bias is of the same order as random errors. no method outperformsthe others. random and systematic errors decrease for larger cells. we showthat it is possible to separate the lowest and highest densities on scales of 5mpc/h at redshifts 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.1, over a large volume such as in vipers survey.this is vital for the characterisation of cosmic variance and rare populations(e.g, brightest galaxies) in environmental studies at these redshifts.

1412.2141	galaxy and mass assembly (gama): the galaxy luminosity function within  the cosmic web	we investigate the dependence of the galaxy luminosity function on geometricenvironment within the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. the tidal tensorprescription, based on the hessian of the pseudo-gravitational potential, isused to classify the cosmic web and define the geometric environments: for agiven smoothing scale, we classify every position of the surveyed region,$0.04&lt;{z}&lt;0.26$, as either a void, a sheet, a filament or a knot. we considerhow to choose appropriate thresholds in the eigenvalues of the hessian in orderto partition the galaxies approximately evenly between environments. we find asignificant variation in the luminosity function of galaxies between differentgeometric environments; the normalisation, characterised by $\phi^{*}$ in aschechter function fit, increases by an order of magnitude from voids to knots.the turnover magnitude, characterised by $m^*$, brightens by approximately$0.5$ mag from voids to knots. however, we show that the observed modulationcan be entirely attributed to the indirect local-density dependence. wetherefore find no evidence of a direct influence of the cosmic web on thegalaxy luminosity function.

astro-ph;0002328	an analytic model for the epoch of halo creation	in this paper we describe the bayesian link between the cosmological massfunction and the distribution of times at which isolated halos of a given massexist. by assuming that clumps of dark matter undergo monotonic growth on thetime-scales of interest, this distribution of times is also the distribution of`creation' times of the halos. this monotonic growth is an inevitable aspect ofgravitational instability. the spherical top-hat collapse model is used toestimate the rate at which clumps of dark matter collapse. this gives the priorfor the creation time given no information about halo mass. applying bayes'theorem then allows any mass function to be converted into a distribution oftimes at which halos of a given mass are created. this general result coversboth gaussian and non-gaussian models. we also demonstrate how the massfunction and the creation time distribution can be combined to give a jointdensity function, and discuss the relation between the time distribution ofmajor merger events and the formula calculated. finally, we determine thecreation time of halos within three n-body simulations, and compare the linkbetween the mass function and creation rate with the analytic theory.

astro-ph;0005010	halo occupation numbers and galaxy bias	we propose a heuristic model that displays the main features of realistictheories for galaxy bias. we show that the low-order clustering statistics ofthe dark-matter distribution depend almost entirely on the locations anddensity profiles of dark-matter haloes. a hypothetical galaxy catalogue dependson (i) the efficiency of galaxy formation, as manifested by the halo occupationnumber -- the number of galaxies brighter than some sample limit contained in ahalo of a given mass; (ii) the location of these galaxies within their halo.the first factor is constrained by the empirical luminosity function of groups.for the second factor, we assume that one galaxy marks the halo centre, withany remaining galaxies acting as satellites that trace the halo mass. thesesimple assumptions amount to a recipe for non-local bias, in which theprobability of finding a galaxy is not a simple function of its local massdensity. we have applied this prescription to some cdm models of currentinterest, and find that the predictions are close to the observed galaxycorrelations for a flat $\omega=0.3$ model ($\lambda$cdm), but not for an$\omega=1$ model with the same power spectrum ($\tau$cdm). this is aninevitable consequence of cluster normalization for the power spectra:cluster-scale haloes of given mass have smaller core radii for high $\omega$,and hence display enhanced small-scale clustering. finally, the pairwisevelocity dispersion of galaxies in the $\lambda$cdm model is lower than that ofthe mass, allowing cluster-normalized models to yield a realistic mach numberfor the peculiar velocity field. this is largely due to the strong variation ofgalaxy-formation efficiency with halo mass that is required in this model.

astro-ph;0005259	clustering of galaxy clusters in cdm universes	we use very large cosmological n--body simulations to obtain accuratepredictions for the two-point correlations and power spectra of mass-limitedsamples of galaxy clusters. we consider two currently popular cold dark matter(cdm) cosmogonies, a critical density model ($\tau$cdm) and a flat low densitymodel with a cosmological constant ($\lambda$cdm). our simulations each use$10^9$ particles to follow the mass distribution within cubes of side$2h^{-1}$gpc ($\tau$cdm) and $3h^{-1}$gpc ($\lambda$cdm) with a forceresolution better than $10^{-4}$ of the cube side. we investigate how thepredicted cluster correlations increase for samples of increasing mass anddecreasing abundance. very similar behaviour is found in the two cases. thecorrelation length increases from $r_0=12$ -- 13$h^{-1}$mpc for samples withmean separation $d_{\rm c}=30h^{-1}$mpc to $r_0=22$-- 27$h^{-1}$mpc for sampleswith $d_{\rm c}=100h^{-1}$mpc. the lower value here corresponds to $\tau$cdmand the upper to $\lambda$cdm. the power spectra of these cluster samples areaccurately parallel to those of the mass over more than a decade in scale. bothcorrelation lengths and power spectrum biases can be predicted to better than10% using the simple model of sheth, mo &amp; tormen (2000). this predictionrequires only the linear mass power spectrum and has no adjustable parameters.we compare our predictions with published results for the apm cluster sample.the observed variation of correlation length with richness agrees well with themodels, particularly for $\lambda$cdm. the observed power spectrum (for acluster sample of mean separation $d_{\rm c}=31h^{-1}$mpc) lies significantlyabove the predictions of both models.

astro-ph;0010587	simulations of galaxy formation in a cosmological volume	we present results of large n-body-hydrodynamic simulations of galaxyformation. our simulations follow the formation of galaxies in cubic volumes ofside 100mpc, in two versions of the cold dark matter (cdm) cosmogony: thestandard, omega=1 scdm model and the flat, omega=0.3 lcdm model. over 2000galaxies form in each of these simulations. we examine the rate at which gascools and condenses into dark matter halos. this roughly tracks the cosmic starformation rate inferred from observations at various redshifts. galaxies in thesimulations form gradually over time in the hierarchical fashion characteristicof the cdm cosmogony. in the lcdm model, substantial galaxies first appear atz=5 and the population builds up rapidly until z=1 after which the rate ofgalaxy formation declines as cold gas is consumed and the cooling time of hotgas increases. in both cosmologies, the present-day k-band luminosity functionof the simulated galaxies resembles observations. the galaxy autocorrelationfunctions differ significantly from those of the dark matter. at the presentepoch there is little bias in either model between galaxies and dark matter onlarge scales, but a significant anti-bias on scales of 1mpc/h and a positivebias on scales of 100kpc/h. the galaxy correlation function evolves little withredshift in the range z=0-3, and depends on the luminosity of the galaxysample. the projected pairwise velocity dispersion of the galaxies is muchlower than that of the dark matter on scales less than 2mpc/h. applying avirial mass estimator to the largest galaxy clusters recovers the clustervirial masses in an unbiased way.

astro-ph;0011212	simulations of deep pencil-beam redshift surveys	we create mock pencil-beam redshift surveys from very large cosmological$n$-body simulations of two cold dark matter cosmogonies, an einstein-de sittermodel ($\tau$cdm) and a flat model with $\omega_0 =0.3$ and a cosmologicalconstant ($\lambda$cdm). we use these to assess the significance of theapparent periodicity discovered by broadhurst et al. (1990). simulationparticles are tagged as `galaxies' so as to reproduce observed present-daycorrelations. they are then identified along the past light-cones ofhypothetical observers to create mock catalogues with the geometry and thedistance distribution of the broadhurst et al. data. we produce 1936 (2625)quasi-independent catalogues from our $\tau$cdm ($\lambda$cdm) simulation. acouple of large clumps in a catalogue can produce a high peak at lowwavenumbers in the corresponding one-dimensional power spectrum, without anyapparent large-scale periodicity in the original redshift histogram. althoughthe simulated redshift histograms frequently display regularly spaced clumps,the spacing of these clumps varies between catalogues and there is no`preferred' period over our many realisations. we find only a 0.72 (0.49) percent chance that the highest peak in the power spectrum of a $\tau$cdm($\lambda$cdm) catalogue has a peak-to-noise ratio higher than that in thebroadhurst et al. data. none of the simulated catalogues with such high peaksshows coherently spaced clumps with a significance as high as that of the realdata. we conclude that in cdm universes, the kind of regularity observed bybroadhurst et al. has a priori probability well below $10^{-3}$.

astro-ph;0106430	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: the population of nearby radio galaxies  at the 1 mjy level	we use redshift determinations and spectral analysis of galaxies in the 2dfgalaxy redshift survey to study the properties of local radio sources with$s\ge 1$ mjy. 557 objects drawn from the first survey, corresponding to 2.3 percent of the total radio sample, are found in the 2dfgrs cataloge within thearea $9^h 48^m \simlt {\rm ra}({\rm 2000}) \simlt 14^h 32^m$ and $-2.77^\circ\simlt {\rm dec}({\rm 2000}) \simlt 2.25^\circ$, down to a magnitude limit$b_j= 19.45$. the excellent quality of 2df spectra allows us to divide thesesources into classes, according to their optical spectra. radio galaxies (i.e.absorption systems, mainly belonging to the class of fr i sources, whosespectra may or may not show emission lines due to agn activity) make up 63 percent of the spectroscopic sample; they are characterized by relatively highradio-to-optical ratios, red colours and luminosities $10^{21}\simlt p_{1.4{\rmghz}} w hz^${-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ \simlt 10^{24}$. actively star-forming galaxiesinstead contribute with 30 per cent to the total sample. these objects --principally found at low redshifts ($z \simlt 0.1$) -- in general show lowradio-to-optical ratios, blue colours and low radio luminosities. we also found18 seyfert 2 galaxies and 4 seyfert 1's. analysis of the local radio luminosityfunction shows that radio galaxies are well described by models that assumepure luminosity evolution, at least down to radio powers $p_{1.4{\rmghz}}\simlt 10^{20.5} w hz$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$ late-type galaxies, whose relativecontribution to the rlf is found to be lower than was predicted by previouswork, present a luminosity function which is compatible with the iras galaxylf, and therefore plausibly constitute the radio counterpart of the dustyspirals and starbursts that dominate the counts at 60 $\mu$m.

astro-ph;0107197	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: galaxy luminosity functions per spectral  type	we calculate the optical bj luminosity function of the 2df galaxy redshiftsurvey (2dfgrs) for different subsets defined by their spectral properties.these spectrally selected subsets are defined using a new parameter, eta, whichis a linear combination of the first two projections derived from a principalcomponent analysis. this parameter eta identifies the average emission andabsorption line strength in the galaxy rest-frame spectrum and hence is auseful indicator of the present star formation. we use a total of 75,000galaxies in our calculations, chosen from a sample of high signal-to-noiseratio, low redshift galaxies observed before january 2001. we find that thereis a systematic steepening of the faint end slope (alpha) as one moves frompassive (alpha = -0.54) to active (alpha = -1.50) star-forming galaxies, andthat there is also a corresponding faintening of the rest-frame characteristicmagnitude m* - 5\log_10(h) (from -19.6 to -19.2). we also show that theschechter function provides a poor fit to the quiescent (type 1) lf for veryfaint galaxies (m - 5log_10(h) fainter than -16.0), perhaps suggesting thepresence of a significant dwarf population. the luminosity functions presentedhere give a precise confirmation of the trends seen previously in a muchsmaller preliminary 2dfgrs sample, and in other surveys. we also present a newprocedure for determining self-consistent k-corrections and investigatepossible fibre-aperture biases.

astro-ph;0108400	the coincidence and angular clustering of chandra and scuba sources	we explore the relationship between the hard x-ray and sub-mm populationsusing deep chandra observations of a large, contiguous scuba survey. inagreement with other recent findings, we confirm that the direct overlap issmall. of the 17 sub-mm sources detected in this field at 850 microns, only oneis coincident with a chandra source. the resulting limits imply that themajority of scuba sources are not powered by agn, unless the central engine isobscured by compton-thick material with a low (&lt;1 per cent) scatteredcomponent. furthermore, since chandra detects only ~5 per cent of scubasources, the typical obscuration would need to be almost isotropic. the x-rayupper limits are so strong that in most cases we can also rule out a starburstsed at low redshift, suggesting that the majority of scuba sources lie at z&gt;1even if they are purely starburst galaxies. despite the low detection rate, wefind evidence for strong angular clustering between the x-ray and sub-mmpopulations. the implication is that agn and scuba sources trace the samelarge-scale structure but do not generally coincide. if bright sub-mm sourcesrepresent massive elliptical galaxies in formation, we suggest that (for agiven galaxy) the major episode of star-formation must be distinct from theperiod of observable quasar activity.

astro-ph;0207663	old elliptical galaxies at z=1.5 and the kormendy relation	deep spectroscopy of the two mjy radio galaxies lbds 53w069 and 53w091 haspreviously shown them to have old (&gt;3 gyr) stellar populations at z=1.5. herewe present the results of hst observations of these galaxies. 53w069 has anr^1/4 profile in both the f814w &amp; f110w data with an effective radius of 0.30arcsec (2.7 kpc). the restframe u-b colour gradient requires a stellarpopulation of super-solar (3z_sun) metallicity that formed on a very shorttimescale at high redshift (z&gt;5). 53w091 has a regular r^1/4 profile in f110wwith an effective radius of 0.32 arcsec (2.9 kpc). the f814w profile is moreextended and is consistent with a blue exponential disk that contributes 20% ofthe flux within r_e. the restframe u-b colour gradient is significantly largerthan that observed in field ellipticals at z&lt;1, implying a stellar populationof mixed metallicity (1-3z_sun) that formed in a high-redshift rapid burst.  we have compared these two lbds radio galaxies with the kormendy relation often 3cr radio galaxies at z=0.8. the lbds galaxies follow the same relation asthe more radio-luminous 3cr galaxies, assuming passive evolution of theirstellar populations, although they are smaller than the 3cr galaxies whose meaneffective radius is 12 kpc. their sizes and radio luminosities are consistentwith scaling relations applied to the 3cr galaxies, in which both radio powerand effective radius scale with galaxy mass. compared with a sample of z=0.4cluster ellipticals, 53w069 &amp; 53w091 lie well within the scatter of thekormendy relation. we conclude that the hosts of these mjy radio sources atz=1.5 are passively-evolving elliptical galaxies that will evolve into ordinaryl* ellipticals by the present day.

astro-ph;0207664	stable clustering, the halo model and nonlinear cosmological power  spectra	we present the results of a large library of cosmological n-body simulations,using power-law initial spectra. the nonlinear evolution of the matter powerspectra is compared with the predictions of existing analytic scaling formulaebased on the work of hamilton et al. the scaling approach has assumed thathighly nonlinear structures obey `stable clustering' and are frozen in propercoordinates. our results show that, when transformed under the self-similarityscaling, the scale-free spectra define a nonlinear locus that is clearlyshallower than would be required under stable clustering. furthermore, thesmall-scale nonlinear power increases as both the power-spectrum index n andthe density parameter omega decrease, and this evolution is not well accountedfor by the previous scaling formulae. this breakdown of stable clustering canbe understood as resulting from the modification of dark-matter haloes bycontinuing mergers. these effects are naturally included in the analytic `halomodel' for nonlinear structure; using this approach we are able to fit both ourscale-free results and also our previous cdm data. this approach is moreaccurate than the commonly-used peacock--dodds formula and should be applicableto more general power spectra. code to evaluate nonlinear power spectra usingthis method is available fromhttp://as1.chem.nottingham.ac.uk/~res/software.html following publication, wewill make the power-law simulation data available through the virgo websitehttp://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/virgo

astro-ph;0301042	implications of 2dfgrs results on cosmic structure	the 2df galaxy redshift survey is the first to observe more than 100,000redshifts, making possible precise measurements of many aspects of galaxyclustering. the spatial distribution of galaxies can be studied as a functionof galaxy spectral type, and also of broad-band colour. redshift-spacedistortions are detected with a high degree of significance, confirming thedetailed kaiser distortion from large-scale infall velocities, and measuringthe distortion parameter beta = omega_m^{0.6}/b = 0.49 +- 0.09. the powerspectrum is measured to &lt;10% accuracy for k &gt; 0.02 h mpc^{-1}, and is wellfitted by a cdm model with omega_m h =0.18 +- 0.02 and a baryon fraction of0.17 +- 0.06. a joint analysis with cmb data requires omega_m = 0.31 +- 0.05and h = 0.67 +- 0.04, assuming scalar fluctuations. the fluctuation amplitudefrom the cmb is sigma_8 = 0.76 +- 0.04, assuming reionization at z &lt; approx 10,so that the general level of galaxy clustering is approximately unbiased, inagreement with an internal bispectrum analysis. luminosity dependence ofclustering is however detected at high significance, and is well described by arelative bias of b/b^* = 0.85 + 0.15(l/l^*). this is consistent with theobservation that l^* in rich clusters is brighter than the global value by 0.28+- 0.08 mag.

astro-ph;0401405	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: hierarchical galaxy clustering	we use the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) to test thehierarchical scaling hypothesis: namely, that the $p$-point galaxy correlationfunctions can be written in terms of the two point correlation function orvariance. this scaling is expected if an initially gaussian distribution ofdensity fluctuations evolves under the action of gravitational instability. wemeasure the volume averaged $p$-point correlation functions using a counts incells technique applied to a volume limited sample of 44,931 $l_*$ galaxies. wedemonstrate that $l_{*}$ galaxies display hierarchical clustering up to order$p=6$ in redshift space. the variance measured for $l_{*}$ galaxies is inexcellent agreement with the predictions from a $\lambda$-cold dark mattern-body simulation. this applies to all cell radii considered,$0.3&lt;(r/h^{-1}{\rm mpc})&lt;30$. however, the higher order correlation functionsof $l_*$ galaxies have a significantly smaller amplitude than is predicted forthe dark matter for $r&lt;10h^{-1}$mpc. this disagreement implies that anon-linear bias exists between the dark matter and $l_*$ galaxies on thesescales. we also show that the presence of two rare, massive superclusters inthe 2dfgrs has an impact on the higher-order clustering moments measured onlarge scales.

astro-ph;0402566	galaxy groups in the 2dfgrs: the luminous content of the groups	the 2dfgrs percolation-inferred galaxy group (2pigg) catalogue of ~29000objects is used to study the luminous content of galaxy systems of varioussizes. mock galaxy catalogues constructed from cosmological simulations areused to gauge the accuracy with which intrinsic group properties can berecovered. a schechter function is found to be a reasonable fit to the galaxyluminosity functions in groups of different mass in the real data. thecharacteristic luminosity l* is larger for more massive groups. however, themock data show that the shape of the recovered luminosity function is expectedto differ from the true shape, and this must be allowed for when interpretingthe data. the variation of halo mass-to-light ratio with group size is studiedin both these wavebands. a robust trend of increasing m/l with increasing groupluminosity is found in the 2pigg data. from groups with l_bj=10^{10}lsol tothose 100 times more luminous, the typical bj-band m/l increases by a factor of5, whereas the rf-band m/l grows by a factor of 3.5. these trends agree wellwith the simulations, which also predict a minimum m/l on a scale correspondingto the local group. our data indicate that if such a minimum exists, then itmust occur at l&lt;~10^{10}lsol, below the range accurately probed by the 2piggcatalogue. according to the mock data, the bj m/ls of the largest groups areexpected to be approximately 1.1 times the global value. assuming that thiscorrection applies to the real data yields an estimate of omega_m=0.26+/-0.03(statistical).

astro-ph;0404276	the nature of the relative bias between galaxies of different spectral  type in 2dfgrs	we present an analysis of the relative bias between early- and late-typegalaxies in the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs). our analysisexamines the joint counts in cells between early- and late-type galaxies, usingapproximately cubical cells with sides ranging from 7h^{-1}mpc to 42h^{-1}mpc.we measure the variance of the counts in cells using the method of efstathiouet al. (1990), which we find requires a correction for a finite volume effect.we fit lognormal models to the one-point density distribution and developmethods of dealing with biases in the recovered variances resulting from thistechnique. we directly fit deterministic models for the joint densitydistribution function, f(delta_e,delta_l), to the joint counts in cells using amaximum likelihood technique. our results are consistent with a scale invariantrelative bias factor on all scales studied. linear bias is ruled out on scalesless than l=28h^{-1}mpc. a power-law bias model is a significantly better fitto the data on all but the largest scales studied; the relative goodness of fitof this model as compared to that of the linear bias model suggests that anynonlinearity is negligible for l&gt;~40h^{-1}mpc, consistent with the expectationfrom theory that the bias should become linear on large scales.

astro-ph;0412049	where are the stars?	the 2dfgrs is used in conjunction with the 2massxsc to study the near-irlight and stellar mass content of the local universe. mock galaxy catalogues,constructed from cosmological n-body simulations and semi-analytical galaxyformation models, are used to gauge the accuracy with which quantities can berecovered. the mean luminosity densities of the universe are found to berho_j=(3.57+/-0.11)*10^8 h lsol/mpc^3 and rho_ks=(7.04+/-0.23)*10^8 hlsol/mpc^3 (statistical uncertainty). using the 2pigg catalogue, the groupdynamical mass-to-light ratio in the k_s band is found to increase by a factorof ~3 when going from groups with total bj-band luminosities of 3*10^10 h^-2lsol to rich clusters, which have typical values of upsilon_k~80 h upsilon_sol.taking into account the bias introduced by uncertainties in estimating galaxystellar masses from luminosities, a value of omega_* h=(0.99+/-0.03)*10^-3 ismeasured, assuming that a kennicutt stellar imf is applicable to all galaxies.the 2piggs are then used to study the distribution of the stellar content ofthe local universe. the three main conclusions are: (1) a slowly rising stellarm/l_ks is found with the clusters having the largest value of ~0.6 upsilon_sol,(2) in contrast, the fraction of mass in stars decreases with increasing groupsize, reaching ~5*10^-3 h for the rich clusters, and (3) in answer to thequestion posed in the title, most stellar mass is contained in localgroup-sized objects (m~2*10^12 h^-1 msol) with only ~2% in clusters withm&gt;5*10^14 h^-1 msol.

astro-ph;0501174	the 2df galaxy redshift survey: power-spectrum analysis of the final  dataset and cosmological implications	we present a power spectrum analysis of the final 2df galaxy redshift survey,employing a direct fourier method. the sample used comprises 221,414 galaxieswith measured redshifts. we investigate in detail the modelling of the sampleselection. a new angular mask is derived, based on revisions to the photometriccalibration. the redshift selection function is determined by dividing thesurvey according to rest-frame colour, and deducing a self-consistent treatmentof k-corrections and evolution for each population. the covariance matrix forthe power-spectrum estimates is determined using two different approaches tothe construction of mock surveys which are used to demonstrate that the inputcosmological model can be correctly recovered. we are confident that the 2dfgrspower spectrum can be used to infer the matter content of the universe. onlarge scales, our estimated power spectrum shows evidence for the `baryonoscillations' that are predicted in cdm models. fitting to a cdm model,assuming a primordial $n_{s}=1$ spectrum, $h=0.72$ and negligible neutrinomass, the preferred parameters are $\omega_{m} h = 0.168 \pm 0.016$ and abaryon fraction $\omega_{b} /\omega_{m} = 0.185\pm0.046$ (1$\sigma$ errors).the value of $\omega_{m} h$ is $1\sigma$ lower than the $0.20 \pm 0.03$ in our2001 analysis of the partially complete 2dfgrs. this shift is largely due tothe signal from the newly-sampled regions of space, rather than the refinementsin the treatment of observational selection. this analysis therefore implies adensity significantly below the standard $\omega_{m} =0.3$: in combination withcmb data from wmap, we infer $\omega_{m} =0.231\pm 0.021$.

astro-ph;9406052	mapping cluster mass distributions via gravitational lensing of  background galaxies	we present a new method for measuring the projected mass distributions ofgalaxy clusters. the gravitational amplification is measured by comparing thejoint distribution in redshift and magnitude of galaxies behind the clusterwith that of field galaxies. we show that the total amplification is directlyrelated to the surface mass density in the weak field limit, and so it ispossible to map the mass distribution of the cluster. the method is shown to belimited by discreteness noise and galaxy clustering behind the lens. galaxyclustering sets a lower limit to the error along the redshift direction, but aclustering independent lensing signature may be obtained from the magnitudedistribution at fixed redshift. statistical techniques are developed forestimating the surface mass density of the cluster. we extend these methods toaccount for any obscuration by cluster halo dust, which may be mappedindependently of the dark matter. we apply the method to a series of numericalsimulations and show the feasibility of the approach. we consider approximateredshift information, and show how the mass estimates are degraded.

astro-ph;9605017	measuring the cosmological constant with redshift surveys	it has been proposed that the cosmological constant $\lambda$ might bemeasured from geometric effects on large-scale structure. a positive vacuumdensity leads to correlation-function contours which are squashed in the radialdirection when calculated assuming a matter-dominated model. we show that thiseffect will be somewhat harder to detect than previous calculations havesuggested: the squashing factor is likely to be $&lt;1.3$, given realisticconstraints on the matter contribution to $\omega$. moreover, the geometricaldistortion risks being confused with the redshift-space distortions caused bythe peculiar velocities associated with the growth of galaxy clustering. thesedepend on the density and bias parameters via the combination $\beta\equiv\omega^{0.6}/b$, and we show that the main practical effect of a geometricalflattening factor $f$ is to simulate gravitational instability with $\beta_{\rmeff}\simeq 0.5(f-1)$. nevertheless, with datasets of sufficient size it ispossible to distinguish the two effects; we discuss in detail how this shouldbe done. new-generation redshift surveys of galaxies and quasars arepotentially capable of detecting a non-zero vacuum density, if it exists at acosmologically interesting level.

astro-ph;9610206	the virgo consortium: simulations of dark matter and galaxy clustering	we report on work in progress by the virgo consortium, a collaboration set upto carry out large simulations of the formation of galaxies and large-scalestructure exploiting the latest generation of parallel supercomputers. we showresults of $256^3$ particle n-body simulations of the clustering evolution ofdark matter in four cold dark matter models with different cosmologicalparameters. the high resolution and large volume of these simulations allows usto determine reliably the mass autocorrelation function for pair separations inthe range $40\hkpc$ to $20\hmpc$. comparison of these with the observed galaxycorrelation function shows that for any of these models to be viable, thedistribution of galaxies must be biased relative to the distribution of mass ina non-trivial, scale-dependent fashion. in particular, low $\omega_0$ modelsrequire the galaxies to be more ``weakly'' clustered than the mass at small andintermediate pair separations. simulations which include the evolution of gasshow that cold gas knots form with approximately the abundance expected ontheoretical grounds, although a few excessively massive objects grow near thecentres of rich clusters. the locations where these cold gas knots form are, ingeneral, biased relative to the distribution of mass in a scale-dependent way.some of these biases have the required sign but they are, for the most part,weaker than is necessary for agreement with observations. the antibias presentin our low $\omega_0$ n-body/sph simulation appears to be related to themerging and disruption of galaxies in rich clusters.

astro-ph;9709010	evolution of structure in cold dark matter universes	we present an analysis of the clustering evolution of dark matter in fourcold dark matter (cdm) cosmologies. we use a suite of high resolution,17-million particle, n-body simulations which sample volumes large enough togive clustering statistics with unprecedented accuracy. we investigate both aflat and an open model with omega_0=0.3, and two models with omega=1, one withthe standard cdm power spectrum and the other with the same power spectrum asthe omega_0=0.3 models. the amplitude of primordial fluctuations is set so thatthe models reproduce the observed abundance of rich galaxy clusters by thepresent day. the mass 2-point correlation function and power spectrum of allthe simulations differ significantly from those of the observed galaxydistribution, in both shape and amplitude. thus, for any of these models toprovide an acceptable representation of reality, the distribution of galaxiesmust be biased relative to the mass in a non-trivial, scale-dependent, fashion.in the omega=1 models the required bias is always greater than unity, but inthe omega_0=0.3 models an "antibias" is required on scales smaller than \sim5\hmpc. the mass correlation functions in the simulations are well fit byrecently published analytic models. the velocity fields are remarkably similarin all the models, whether they be characterised as bulk flows, 1-particle orpairwise velocity dispersions. this similarity is a direct consequence of ouradopted normalisation. the small-scale pairwise velocity dispersion of the darkmatter is somewhat larger than recent determinations from galaxy redshiftsurveys, but the bulk-flows predicted by our models are broadly in agreementwith most available data.

astro-ph;9710368	genus statistics of the virgo n-body simulations and the 1.2-jy redshift  survey	we study the topology of the virgo n-body simulations and compare it to the1.2-jy redshift survey of iras galaxies by means of the genus statistic. fourhigh-resolution simulations of variants of the cdm cosmology are considered: aflat standard model (scdm), a variant of it with more large-scale power (tcdm),and two low density universes, one open (ocdm) and one flat (lcdm). the fullysampled n-body simulations are examined down to strongly nonlinear scales, bothwith spatially fixed smoothing, and with an adaptive smoothing technique. whilethe tcdm, lcdm, and ocdm simulations have very similar genus statistics in theregime accessible to fixed smoothing, they can be separated with adaptivesmoothing at small mass scales. in order to compare the n-body models with the1.2-jy survey, we extract large ensembles of mock catalogues from thesimulations. these mock surveys are used to test for systematic effects in thegenus analysis and to establish the distribution of errors of the genus curve.we find that a simple multivariate analysis of the genus measurements iscompromised both by non-gaussian distributed errors and by noise that dominatesthe covariance matrix. we therefore introduce a principal components analysisof the genus curve. with a likelihood ratio test we find that the 1.2-jy datafavours the lcdm, tcdm and ocdm models compared to scdm. when genusmeasurements for different smoothing scales are combined, the scdm model can beexcluded at a 99% confidence level, while the other three models fit the 1.2-jydata well.

astro-ph;9801184	old high-redshift galaxies and primordial density fluctuation spectra	we have discovered a population of extremely red galaxies at $z\simeq 1.5$which have apparent stellar ages of $\gs 3$ gyr, based on detailed spectroscopyin the rest-frame ultraviolet. in order for galaxies to have existed at thehigh collapse redshifts indicated by these ages, there must be a minimum levelof power in the density fluctuation spectrum on galaxy scales. this papercompares the required power with that inferred from other high-redshiftpopulations. if the collapse redshifts for the old red galaxies are in therange $z_c\simeq 6$ -- 8, there is general agreement between the varioustracers on the required inhomogeneity on 1-mpc scales. this level ofsmall-scale power requires the lyman-limit galaxies to be approximately$\nu\simeq 3.0$ fluctuations, implying a very large bias parameter $b\simeq 6$.the high collapse redshifts of the red galaxies as deduced from gravitationalcollapse provides independent support for the ages estimated from their stellarpopulations. such early-forming galaxies are rare, and their contribution tothe cosmological stellar density is consistent with an extrapolation to higherredshifts of the star-formation rate measured at $z&lt;5$; there is no evidencefor a general era of spheroid formation at extreme redshifts.

astro-ph;9805208	the evolution of clustering and bias in the galaxy distribution	this paper reviews the measurements of galaxy correlations at high redshifts,and discusses how these may be understood in models of hierarchicalgravitational collapse. the clustering of galaxies at redshift one is muchweaker than at present, and this is consistent with the rate of growth ofstructure expected in an open universe. if $\omega=1$, this observation wouldimply that bias increases at high redshift, in conflict with observed $m/l$values for known high-$z$ clusters. at redshift 3, the population oflyman-limit galaxies displays clustering which is of similar amplitude to thatseen today. this is most naturally understood if the lyman-limit population isa set of rare recently-formed objects. knowing both the clustering and theabundance of these objects, it is possible to deduce empirically thefluctuation spectrum required on scales which cannot be measured today owing togravitational nonlinearities. of existing physical models for the fluctuationspectrum, the results are most closely matched by a low-density spatially flatuniverse. this conclusion is reinforced by an empirical analysis of cmbanisotropies, in which the present-day fluctuation spectrum is forced to havethe observed form. open models are strongly disfavoured, leaving $\lambda$cdmas the most successful simple model for structure formation.

astro-ph;9812214	baryonic signatures in large-scale structure	we investigate the consequences of a non-negligible baryon fraction formodels of structure formation in cold dark matter dominated cosmologies,emphasizing in particular the existence of oscillations in the present-daymatter power spectrum. these oscillations are the remnants of acousticoscillations in the photon-baryon fluid before last scattering. for acceptablevalues of the cosmological and baryon densities, the oscillations modulate thepower by up to 10%, with a `period' in spatial wavenumber which is close todelta k approximately 0.05/ mpc. we study the effects of nonlinear evolution onthese features, and show that they are erased for k &gt; 0.2 h/ mpc. at largerscales, the features evolve as expected from second-order perturbation theory:the visibility of the oscillations is affected only weakly by nonlinearevolution. no realistic cdm parameter combination is able to account for theclaimed feature near k = 0.1 h/ mpc in the apm power spectrum, or the excesspower at 100 mpc/h wavelengths quoted by several recent surveys. thus baryonicoscillations are not predicted to dominate existing measurements of clustering.we examine several effects which may mask the features which are predicted, andconclude that future galaxy surveys may be able to detect the oscillatoryfeatures in the power spectrum provided baryons comprise more than 15% of thetotal density, but that it will be a technically challenging achievement.

astro-ph;9912231	starburst galaxies and structure in the submillimetre background towards  the hubble deep field	we use an 850-micron scuba map of the hdf to study the dust properties ofoptically-selected starburst galaxies at high redshift. although the 850-micronmap does not allow detection of the majority of individual sources, we showthat the galaxies with the highest uv star-formation rates are detectedstatistically, with a flux density of about s_{850}=0.2 mjy for an apparent uvstar-formation rate of 1 h^{-2} msun yr^{-1}. this level of submillimetreoutput indicates that the total star-forming activity is on average a factor ofapproximately 6 times larger than the rate inferred from the uv output of thesegalaxies. the general population of optical starbursts is then predicted tocontribute at least 25 per cent of the 850-micron background. we carry out apower-spectrum analysis of the map, which yields some evidence for angularclustering of the background source population, but at a level lower than thatseen in lyman-break galaxies. together with other lines of argument,particularly from the nicmos hdf data, this suggests that the 850-micronbackground originates over an extremely wide range of redshifts -- perhaps 1 &lt;z &lt; 6.
