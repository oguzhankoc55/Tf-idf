0902.2517	revealing x-ray obscured quasars in swire sources with extreme  mid-ir/optical flux ratios	recent works have suggested that selection criteria based on mir colors canbe used to reveal a population of dust-enshrouded, extremely luminous quasarsat z&gt;1. however the x-ray spectral properties of these intriguing sources stillremain largely unexplored. we report on an x-ray spectroscopic study of asample of 44 very bright mid-ir galaxies with extreme mid-ir to optical fluxratios (mir/o&gt;2000). the x-ray coverage of the sample is highly inhomogeneous(from snap-shot 5 ks chandra observations to medium-deep xmm exposures of 70ks) and, consequently, a sizable fraction of them (~43%) remains undetected inthe 0.5-10 kev band. the vast majority (95%) of the detected sources (23) showan absorption column density nh&gt;10e22 cm-2 and, remarkably, we also find that50% of them can be classified as type 2 quasars on the basis of theirabsorption properties and x-ray luminosity. moreover, most of the x-rayundetected sources show extreme mid-ir colors, consistent with being luminousagn-powered objects, suggesting they might host heavily obscured (possiblycompton-thick) quasars in x-rays. this demonstrates that our selection criteriaapplied to a wide area survey is very efficient in finding a large number oftype 2 quasars at z &gt; 1. the existence of this class of very powerful, obscuredquasars at high z could have important implications in the context of theformation and cosmological evolution of accreting supermassive black holes andtheir host galaxies.

0903.2444	the x-ray view of giga-hertz peaked spectrum radio galaxies	this paper presents the x-ray properties of a flux- and volume-limitedcomplete sample of 16 giga-hertz peaked spectrum (gps) galaxies. this studyaddresses three basic questions in our understanding of the nature andevolution of gps sources: a) what is the physical origin of the x-ray emissionin gps galaxies? b) what physical system is associated with the x-rayobscuration? c) what is the "endpoint" of the evolution of compact radiosources? we obtain a 100% (94%) detection fraction in the 0.5-2 kev (0.5-10kev) energy band. gps galaxy x-ray spectra are typically highly obscured. thex-ray column density is higher than the hi column density measured in the radioby a factor of 10 to 100. gps galaxies lie well on the extrapolation to highradio powers of the correlation between radio and x-ray luminosity known inlow-luminosity fri radio galaxies. on the other hand, gps galaxies exhibit acomparable x-ray luminosity to frii radio galaxies, notwithstanding their muchhigher radio luminosity. the x-ray to radio luminosity ratio distribution inour sample is consistent with the bulk of the high-energy emission beingproduced by the accretion disk, as well as with dynamical models of gpsevolution where x-rays are produced by compton upscattering of ambient photons.further support for the former scenario comes from the location of gps galaxiesin the x-ray to o[iii] luminosity ratio versus column density plane. we proposethat gps galaxies are young radio sources, which would reach their fullmaturity as classical frii radio galaxies. however, column densities ~10^{22}atoms/cm/cm could lead to a significant underestimate of dynamical agedeterminations based on the hotspot recession velocity measurements.

0909.2960	does the x-ray emission of the luminous quasar rbs 1124 originate in a  mildly relativistic outflowing corona?	we have observed the luminous (l_x ~ 6x10^44 erg/s) radio-quiet quasar rbs1124 (z=0.208) with suzaku. we report the detection of a moderately broad iron(fe) line and of a weak soft x-ray excess. the x-ray data are very welldescribed by a simple model comprising a power law x-ray continuum plus itsreflection off the accretion disc. if the inner disc radius we measure (&lt;=3.8gravitational radii) is identified with the innermost stable circular orbit ofthe black hole spacetime, we infer that the black hole powering rbs 1124 isrotating rapidly with spin a&gt;= 0.6. the soft excess contribution in the 0.5-2kev band is ~15%, about half than that typically observed in unobscured seyfert1 galaxies and quasars, in line with the low disc reflection fraction wemeasure (r_disc ~0.4). the low reflection fraction cannot be driven by disctruncation which is at odds not only with the small inner disc radius we inferbut, most importantly, with the radiatively efficient nature of the source(l_bol / l_edd ~1). a plausible explanation is that the x-ray corona is thebase of a failed jet (rbs 1124 being radio-quiet) and actually outflowing atmildly relativistic speeds. aberration reduces the irradiation of the disc,thus forcing a lower than standard reflection fraction, and halves the inferredsource intrinsic luminosity, reducing the derived eddington ratio from ~1to~0.5.

0707.2465	the xmm-newton view of iras 09104+4109: evidence for a changing-look  type 2 quasar?	we analyzed the spectroscopic data from the pn and the mos cameras in the0.4-10 kev band. we also used an archival bepposax 1-50 kev observation of iras09104+4109 to investigate possible variations of the quasar emission. the x-rayemission in the epic band is dominated by the intra-cluster medium thermalemission. we found that the quasar contributes ~35% of the total flux in the2-10 kev band. both a transmission- (through a compton-thin absorber with acompton optical depth of \tau_c~0.3, i.e. nh~5 x 10^{23} cm^-2) and areflection-dominated (\tau_c&gt;1) model provide an excellent fit to the quasarcontinuum emission. however, the value measured for the ew of fe kalphaemission line is only marginally consistent with the presence of acompton-thick absorber in a reflection-dominated scenario, which had beensuggested by a previous, marginal (i.e. 2.5\sigma) detection with the hardx-ray (15-50 kev), non-imaging bepposax/pds instrument. moreover, the value ofluminosity in the 2-10 kev band measured by the transmission-dominated model isfully consistent with that expected on the basis of the bolometric luminosityof iras 09104+4109. from the analysis of the xmm-newton data we thereforesuggest the possibility that the absorber along the line of sight to thenucleus of iras 09104+4109 is compton-thin. alternatively, the absorber columndensity could have changed from compton-thick to -thin in the five yearselapsed between the observations. if this is the case, then iras 09104+4109 isthe first 'changing-look' quasar ever detected.

0912.4456	a long hard look at the minimum state of pg 2112+059 with xmm-newton	xmm-newton successfully detected the minimum state of pg 2112+059 during ashort snapshot observation and performed a long follow-up observation. the highsignal-to-noise spectra are modelled assuming different emission scenarios andcompared with archival spectra taken by xmm-newton and chandra.  the pg 2112+059 x-ray spectra acquired in may 2007 allowed the detection of aweak iron fluorescent line, which is interpreted as being caused by reflectionfrom neutral material at some distance from the primary x-ray emitting source.the x-ray spectra of pg 2112+059 taken at five different epochs duringdifferent flux states can be interpreted within two different scenarios. thefirst consists of two layers of ionised material with column densities of n_h~5 x 10^22 cm^-2 and n_h ~3.5 x 10^23 cm^-2, respectively. the first layer ismoderately ionised and its ionisation levels follow the flux changes, while theother layer is highly ionised and does not show any correlation with the fluxof the source. the spectra can also be interpreted assuming reflection by anionised accretion disk seen behind a warm absorber. the warm absorberionisation is consistent with being correlated with the flux of the source,which provides an additional degree of self-consistency with the overallreflection-based model. we explain the spectral variability with light bendingaccording to the models of miniutti and fabian and constrain the black holespin to be a/m &gt; 0.86. both scenarios also assume that a distant cold reflectoris responsible for the fe k \alpha emission line.  light bending provides an attractive explanation of the different states ofpg 2112+059 and may also describe the physical cause of the observed propertiesof other x-ray weak quasars.

1001.2404	investigating the complex x-ray spectrum of a broad-line 2mass red  quasar: xmm-newton observation of ftm 0830+3759	we report results from a 50 ks xmm-newton observation of the dust-reddenedbroad-line quasar ftm 0830+3759 (z=0.413) selected from the first/2mass redquasar survey. for this agn, a very short 9 ks chandra exposure had suggested afeature-rich x-ray spectrum and hst images revealed a very disturbed hostgalaxy morphology. contrary to classical, optically-selected quasars, the x-rayproperties of red (i.e. with j-ks&gt; 1.7 and r-ks&gt; 4) broad line quasars arestill quite unexplored, although there is a growing consensus that, due tomoderate obscuration, these objects can offer a unique view of spectralcomponents typically swamped by the agn light in normal, blue quasars. thexmm-newton observation discussed here has definitely confirmed the complexityof the x-ray spectrum revealing the presence of a cold (or mildly-ionized)absorber with nh ~10^{22} cm^-2 along the line of sight to the nucleus and acompton reflection component accompanied by an intense fe k emission line inthis quasar with a lum(2-10) ~5 x 10^{44} erg/s. a soft-excess component isalso required by the data. the match between the column density derived by ourspectral analysis and that expected on the basis of reddening due to the dustsuggests the possibility that both absorptions occur in the same medium. ftm0830+3759 is characterized by an extinction/absorption-correctedx-ray-to-optical flux ratio alphaox = -2.3, that is steeper than expected onthe basis of its uv luminosity. these findings indicate that the x-rayproperties of ftm 0830+3759 differs from those typically observed foroptically-selected broad line quasars with comparable hard x-ray luminosity.

1003.0020	a runaway black hole in cosmos: gravitational wave or slingshot recoil?	we present a detailed study of a peculiar source in the cosmos survey atz=0.359. source cxocj100043.1+020637 (cid-42) presents two compact opticalsources embedded in the same galaxy. the distance between the 2, measured inthe hst/acs image, is 0.495" that, at the redshift of the source, correspondsto a projected separation of 2.46 kpc. a large (~1200 km/s) velocity offsetbetween the narrow and broad components of hbeta has been measured in threedifferent optical spectra from the vlt/vimos and magellan/imacs instruments.cid-42 is also the only x-ray source having in its x-ray spectra a strongredshifted broad absorption iron line, and an iron emission line, drawing aninverted p-cygni profile. the chandra and xmm data show that the absorptionline is variable in energy by 500 ev over 4 years and that the absorber has tobe highly ionized, in order not to leave a signature in the soft x-rayspectrum. that these features occur in the same source is unlikely to be acoincidence. we envisage two possible explanations: (1) a gravitational waverecoiling black hole (bh), caught 1-10 myr after merging, (2) a type 1/ type 2system in the same galaxy where the type 1 is recoiling due to slingshot effectproduced by a triple bh system. the first possibility gives us a candidategravitational waves recoiling bh with both spectroscopic and imagingsignatures. in the second case, the x-ray absorption line can be explained as abal-like outflow from the foreground nucleus (a type 2 agn) at the rearer one(a type 1 agn), which illuminates the otherwise undetectable wind, giving usthe first opportunity to show that fast winds are present in obscured agn.

1007.4762	fero: finding extreme relativistic objects. i. statistics of  relativistic fe kalpha lines in radio-quiet type 1 agn	accretion models predict that fluorescence lines broadened by relativisticeffects should arise from reflection of x-ray emission onto the inner region ofthe accretion disc surrounding the central black hole of active galactic nuclei(agn). the theory behind the origin of relativistic lines is well established,and observational evidence from a moderate number of sources seems to supportthe existence of these lines. the aim of this work is to establish the fractionof agn with relativistic fe kalpha lines, and study possible correlations withsource physical properties. an xmm-newton collection of 149 radio-quiet type 1agn has been systematically and uniformly analyzed in order to search forsignificant evidence of a relativistically broadened fe kalpha line. to enablestatistical studies, an almost complete, flux-limited subsample of 31 sourceshas been defined. the 2-10 kev spectra of the fero sources have been comparedwith a complex model including most of the physical components observed in thex-ray spectra of seyfert galaxies: a power law primary continuum modified bynon-relativistic compton reflection and warm absorption, plus a series ofnarrow fe line reflection features. the observed fraction of sources in theflux-limited sample that show significant evidence of a relativistic fe kalphaline is 36%. the average line equivalent width (ew) is of the order of 100 ev,while the average disc inclination angle is 28+/-5 deg and the averagepower-law index of the radial disc emissivity law is 2.4+/-0.4. the spin valueis well constrained only in 2 cases (mcg-6-30-15 and mrk509), and in the restof the cases, whenever a constraint can be placed, it always implies therejection of the static black hole solution. the fe kalpha line ew does notcorrelate with disc parameters or with system physical properties, such asblack hole mass, accretion rate and hard x-ray luminosity.

1010.4227	the x-ray spectral signatures from the complex circumnuclear regions in  the compton thick agn ngc 424	we present the xmm-newton rgs and epic pn spectra of a long (\simeq 100 ks)observation of one of the soft x-ray brightest compton-thick seyfert 2galaxies, ngc 424. as a first step, we performed a phenomenological analysis ofthe data to derive the properties of all the spectral components. on the basisof these results, we fitted the spectra with self-consistent photoionisationmodels, produced with cloudy. the high-energy part of the spectrum is dominatedby a pure neutral compton reflection component and a neutral iron k-alpha line,together with k-alpha emission from neutral ni, suggesting a significant ni/feoverabundance. the soft x-ray rgs spectrum comes mostly from line emission fromh-like and he-like c, n, o, and ne, as well as from the fe l-shell. thepresence of narrow rrc from o viii, o vii, and c vi, the last two with resolvedwidths corresponding to temperatures around 5-10 ev, is a strong indication ofa gas in photoionisation equilibrium, as confirmed by the prevalence of theforbidden component in the o vii triplet. two gas phases with differentionisation parameters are needed to reproduce the spectrum with aself-consistent photoionisation model, any contribution from a gas incollisional equilibrium being no more than 10% of the total flux in the0.35-1.55 kev band. when this self-consistent model is applied to the 0.5-10kev band of the epic pn spectrum, a third photoionised phase is needed toaccount for emission lines with higher ionisation potential, although k-alphaemission from s xv and fe xxvi remains under-predicted.

1101.3478	discovery of strong iron k{\alpha} emitting compton thick quasars at  z=2.5 and 2.9	we report the detection of the 6.4 kev iron k{\alpha} emission line in twoinfrared-luminous, massive, star-forming bzk galaxies at z = 2.578 and z = 2.90in the cdf-s. the chandra 4 ms spectra of bzk4892 and bzk8608 show a reflectiondominated continuum with strong iron lines, with rest-frame equivalent widthsew-2.3 kev and 1.2 kev, respectively, demonstrating compton thick obscurationof the central agn. for bzk8608 the line identification closely matches theexisting photometric redshift derived from the stellar emission. we use theobserved luminosities of the iron k{\alpha} line, of the rest-frame mid-ircontinuum and of the uv rest-frame narrow emission lines to infer intrinsicl(2-10 kev)&gt;1e44 erg/s, about 1.0-2.5 dex larger than the observed ones, henceconfirming the presence of an absorber with n(h) &gt; 1e24 cm-2. the two bzkgalaxies have stellar masses of 5e10 m\odot and, based on vla 1.4 ghz and submm870{\mu}m observations, they appear to host vigorous starburst activity withsfr - 300-700 m\odot/yr that is also optically thick. we estimate that the agnmight also conceivably account for an important fraction of the bolometricfar-ir emission of the galaxies. the implied volume density of compton thick(ct) agn with l(2-10 kev)&gt;1e44 erg/s is in agreement with predictions fromx-ray background synthesis models. these sources provide one of the firstclearcut observations of the long-sought phase of simultaneous, heavilyobscured quasar and star formation activity, predicted by models of massivegalaxy evolution at high redshifts.

0709.2412	xmm-newton observation of the deep minimum state of pg 2112+059: a  spectrum dominated by reflection from the accretion disk?	we analyse a 75ks xmm-newton observation of pg 2112+059 performed in november2005 and compare it with a 15ks xmm-newton observation taken in may 2003. pg2112+059 was found in a deep minimum state as its 0.2-12 kev flux decreased bya factor of 10 in comparison to the may 2003 observation. during the deepminimum state the spectra show strong emission in excess of the continuum inthe 3-6 kev region. the excess emission corresponds to an ew = 26.1 kev whereasits shape resembles that of heavily absorbed objects. the spectra of bothobservations of pg 2112+059 can be explained statistically by a combination oftwo absorbers where one shows a high column density, $n_{h} \sim 4.5 \times10^{23} cm^{-2}$, and the other high ionisation parameters. as the ionisationparameter of the high flux state, $\xi \sim 34 erg cm s^{-1}$, is lower thanthe value found for the deep minimum state, $\xi \sim 110 erg cm s^{-1}$,either the absorbers are physically different or the absorbing material ismoving with respect to the x-ray source. the spectra can also be explained by acontinuum plus x-ray ionised reflection on the accretion disk, seen behind awarm absorber. the ionisation parameter of the high state ($\xi \sim 5.6 erg cms^{-1}$) is higher than the ionisation parameter of the deep minimum state($\xi \sim 0.2 erg cm s^{-1}$), as expected for a stationary absorber. thevalues found for the ionisation parameters are in the range typical for agns.the spectra observed during the deep minimum state are reflection dominated andshow no continuum emission. these can be understood in the context of lightbending near the supermassive black hole as predicted by minutti and fabian.

1204.2904	evidence of strong quasar feedback in the early universe	most theoretical models invoke quasar driven outflows to quench starformation in massive galaxies, this feedback mechanism is required to accountfor the population of old and passive galaxies observed in the local universe.the discovery of massive, old and passive galaxies at z=2, implies that suchquasar feedback onto the host galaxy must have been at work very early on,close to the reionization epoch. we have observed the [cii]158um transition insdssj114816.64+525150.3 that, at z=6.4189, is one of the most distant quasarsknown. we detect broad wings of the line tracing a quasar-driven massiveoutflow. this is the most distant massive outflow ever detected and is likelytracing the long sought quasar feedback, already at work in the early universe.the outflow is marginally resolved on scales of about 16 kpc, implying that theoutflow can really affect the whole galaxy, as required by quasar feedbackmodels. the inferred outflow rate, dm/dt &gt; 3500 msun/yr, is the highest everfound. at this rate the outflow can clean the gas in the host galaxy, andtherefore quench star formation, in a few million years.

1204.5881	the physics and the structure of the quasar-driven outflow in mrk 231	massive agn-driven outflows are invoked by agn-galaxy co-evolutionary modelsto suppress both star formation and black hole accretion. massive molecularoutflows have recently been revealed in some agn hosts. however, the physicalproperties and structure of these agn-driven molecular outflows are stillpoorly constrained. here we present new iram pdbi observations of mrk231, theclosest quasar known, targeting both the co(1-0) and co(2-1) transitions. wedetect broad wings in both transitions, tracing a massive molecular outflowwith velocities up to 800 km/s. the wings are spatially resolved at highsignificance level (5-11 sigma), indicating that the molecular outflow extendson the kpc scale. the co(2-1)/co(1-0) ratio of the red broad wings isconsistent with the ratio observed in the narrow core, while the blue broadwing is less excited than the core. the latter result suggests that quasardriven outflow models invoking shocks (which would predict higher gasexcitation) are not appropriate to describe the bulk of the outflow in mrk231.however, we note that within the central 700 pc the co(2-1)/co(1-0) ratio ofthe red wing is slightly, but significantly, higher than in the line core,suggesting that shocks may play a role in the central region. we also find thatthe average size of the outflow anticorrelates with the critical density of thetransition used as a wind tracer. this indicates that, although diffuse anddense clumps coexist in the outflowing gas, dense outflowing clouds haveshorter lifetime and that they evaporate into the diffuse component along theoutflow or, more simply, that diffuse clouds are more efficiently acceleratedto larger distances by radiation pressure.

1211.0841	ngc6240: extended co structures and their association with shocked gas	we present deep co observations of ngc6240 performed with the iram plateau debure interferometer (pdbi). ngc6240 is the prototypical example of a majorgalaxy merger in progress, caught at an early stage, with an extended,strongly-disturbed butterfly-like morphology and the presence of a heavilyobscured active nucleus in the core of each progenitor galaxy. the co lineshows a skewed profile with very broad and asymmetric wings detected out tovelocities of -600 km/s and +800 km/s with respect to the systemic velocity.the pdbi maps reveal the existence of two prominent structures of blueshiftedco emission. one extends eastward, i.e. approximately perpendicular to the lineconnecting the galactic nuclei, over scales of ~7 kpc and shows velocities upto -400 km/s. the other extends southwestward out to ~7 kpc from the nuclearregion, and has a velocity of -100 km/s with respect to the systemic one.interestingly, redshifted emission with velocities 400 to 800 km/s is detectedaround the two nuclei, extending in the east-west direction, and partlyoverlapping with the eastern blue-shifted structure, although tracing a morecompact region of size ~1.7 kpc. the overlap between the southwestern co bloband the dust lanes seen in hst images, which are interpreted as tidal tails,indicates that the molecular gas is deeply affected by galaxy interactions. theeastern blueshifted co emission is co-spatial with an halpha filament that isassociated with strong h2 and soft x-ray emission. the analysis of chandrax-ray data provides strong evidence for shocked gas at the position of thehalpha emission. its association with outflowing molecular gas supports ascenario where the molecular gas is compressed into a shock wave thatpropagates eastward from the nuclei. if this is an outflow, the agn are likelythe driving force.

0712.3445	heavy absorption and soft x-ray emission lines in the xmm-newton  spectrum of the type 2 radio-loud quasar 3c 234	we report results on a 40 ks xmm-newton observation of the type 2 quasar 3c234. optical spectropolarimetric data have demonstrated the presence of ahidden broad-line region in this powerful (m_v &lt;~ -24.2 after reddening andstarlight correction) narrow-line frii radio galaxy. our analysis is aimed atinvestigating the x-ray spectral properties of this peculiar source which haveremained poorly known so far. we analyze the 0.5--10 kev spectroscopic datacollected by the epic cameras in 2006. the x-ray spectrum of this radio-loudquasar is typical of a local compton-thin seyfert 2 galaxy. it exhibits strongabsorption (nh~3.5 x 10^{23} cm^{-2}) and a narrow, neutral fe kalpha emissionline with an equivalent width of ~140+/-40 ev. our observation also revealsthat the soft portion of the spectrum is characterized by strong emission lineswith a very low level of scattered primary continuum. a possible explanation ofthese features in terms of thermal emission from a two-temperaturecollisionally ionized plasma emission seems to be unlikely due to the highluminosity estimated for this component (l(0.5-2) ~ 6 x 10^{42} erg/s). it islikely that most of the soft x-ray emission originates from a photoionizedplasma as commonly observed in obscured, radio-quiet seyfert-like agns. thisx-ray observation has definitively confirmed the presence of a hidden quasar in3c 234. the line-rich spectrum and the steepness of the hard x-ray continuum(gamma ~ 1.7) found in this source weaken the hypothesis that the bulk ofthex-ray emission in radio-loud agns with high excitation optical lines arisesfrom jet non-thermal emission.

1306.2330	the hot and energetic universe: astrophysics of feedback in local agn	understanding the astrophysics of feedback in active galactic nuclei (agn) iskey to understanding the growth and co-evolution of supermassive black holesand galaxies. agn-driven winds/outflows are potentially the most effective wayof transporting energy and momentum from the nuclear scales to the host galaxy,quenching star formation by sweeping away the gas reservoir. key questions inthis field are: 1) how do accretion disks around black holes launchwinds/outflows, and how much energy do these carry? 2) how are the energy andmetals accelerated in winds/outflows transferred and deposited into thecircumgalactic medium? x-ray observations are a unique way to address thesequestions because they probe the phase of the outflows which carries most ofthe kinetic energy. we show how a high throughput, high spectral resolutioninstrument like the x-ray integral field unit (x-ifu) on athena+ will allow usto address these questions by determining the physical parameters (ionizationstate, density, temperature, abundances, velocities, geometry, etc.) of theoutflows on a dynamical time-scale, in a broad sample of nearby bright agn. thex-ifu will also allow direct spectral imaging of the impact of these winds onthe host galaxy for local agn, forming a template for understanding agn athigher redshifts where wind shocks cannot be resolved.

1307.1048	high resolution mapping of co(1-0) in ngc6240	we present high spatial resolution co(1-0) mapping of the luminous infraredgalaxy ngc6240 obtained with the iram - plateau de bure interferometer. thissource is a well-known early-stage merging system hosting two agn. we find abroad co(1-0) line profile, with maximum velocity 800 km/s and fwzi=1400 km/s,and displaying several kinematic components, revealing the complexity of thegas dynamics in this system. we detect a blueshifted co emission with velocityin the range -200 and -500 km/s, peaked around the southern agn, at the sameposition where the h2 outflow is located, and with a mass loss rate of ~500msun/yr. we interpret this blueshifted component as a outflow, originating fromthe southern nucleus. the spatial and spectral match strongly suggests that theco outflow is connected to the h2 superwind located around the southernnucleus, and to the large scale co outflow, with similar velocities, extendedon scales of 10 kpc. the large mass loading factor (dm/dt /sfr ~ 10) of themolecular gas suggests that the outflow is likely driven by both sna winds andthe radiation of the southern agn. we discovered a nuclear, redshifted coemission peaking in the mid point of the two nuclei, as it is the case for theco emission at the systemic velocity. the large velocity dispersion, whichreaches its maximum (~500 km/s) in the mid point between the two nuclei,suggests that the gas might be highly turbulent in this region, although thepresence of an unresolved rotation component cannot be ruled out.

1310.1399	the xmm-newton spectrum of a candidate recoiling supermassive black  hole: an elusive inverted p-cygni profile	we present a detailed spectral analysis of new xmm-newton data of the sourcecxoc j100043.1+020637, also known as cid-42, detected in the cosmos survey at z= 0.359. previous works suggested that cid-42 is a candidate recoilingsupermassive black holes showing also an inverted p-cygni profile in the x- rayspectra at ~6 kev (rest) with an iron emission line plus a redshiftedabsorption line (detected at 3sigma in previous xmm-newton and chandraobservations). detailed analysis of the absorption line suggested the presenceof ionized material inflowing into the black hole at high velocity. in the newlong xmm-newton observation, while the overall spectral shape remains constant,the continuum 2-10 kev flux decreased of ~20% with respect to previousobservation and the absorption line is undetected. the upper limit on theintensity of the absorption line is ew&lt;162 kev. extensive monte carlosimulations show that the non detection of the line is solely due to variationin the properties of the inflowing material, in agreement with the transientnature of these features, and that the intensity of the line is lower than thepreviously measured with a probability of 98.8%. in the scenario of cid-42 asrecoiling smbh, the absorption line can be interpreted as due to inflow of gaswith variable density and located in the proximity of the smbh and recoilingwith it. new monitoring observations will be requested to further characterizethis line.

1310.7701	the properties of the clumpy torus and blr in the polar-scattered  seyfert 1 galaxy eso 323-g77 through x-ray absorption variability	we report results from multi-epoch x-ray observations of the polar-scatteredseyfert 1 galaxy eso 323-g77. the source exhibits remarkable spectralvariability from months to years timescales. the observed spectral variabilityis entirely due to variations of the column density of a neutral absorbertowards the intrinsic nuclear continuum. the column density is generallycompton-thin ranging from a few times 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ to a few times10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. however, one observation reveals a compton-thick statewith column density of the order of 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. theobserved variability offers a rare opportunity to study the properties of thex-ray absorber(s) in an active galaxy. we identify variable x-ray absorptionfrom two different components, namely (i) a clumpy torus whose individualclumps have a density of $\leq$ 1.7 $\times$ 10$^8$ cm$^{-3}$ and an averagecolumn density of $\sim$ 4 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, and (ii) the broadline region (blr), comprising individual clouds with density of 0.1-8 $\times$10$^9$ cm$^{-3}$ and column density of 10$^{23}$-10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. thederived properties of the clumpy torus can also be used to estimate the torushalf-opening angle, which is of the order of 47 $^\circ$. we also confirm thepreviously reported detection of two highly ionized warm absorbers with outflowvelocities of 1000-4000 km s$^{-1}$. the observed outflow velocities areconsistent with the keplerian/escape velocity at the blr. hence, the warmabsorbers may be tentatively identified with the warm/hot inter-cloud mediumwhich ensures that the blr clouds are in pressure equilibrium with theirsurroundings. the blr line-emitting clouds may well be the cold, dense clumpsof this outflow, whose warm/hot phase is likely more homogeneous, as suggestedby the lack of strong variability of the warm absorber(s) properties during ourmonitoring.

1311.2595	massive molecular outflows and evidence for agn feedback from co  observations	we study the properties of massive, galactic-scale outflows of molecular gasand investigate their impact on galaxy evolution. we present new iram pdbico(1-0) observations of local ulirgs and qso hosts: clear signature of massiveand energetic molecular outflows, extending on kpc scales, is found in theco(1-0) kinematics of four out of seven sources, with measured outflow rates ofseveral 100 msun/yr. we combine these new observations with data from theliterature, and explore the nature and origin of massive molecular outflowswithin an extended sample of 19 local galaxies. we find thatstarburst-dominated galaxies have an outflow rate comparable to their sfr, oreven higher by a factor of ~ 2-4, implying that starbursts can indeed beeffective in removing cold gas from galaxies. nevertheless, our results suggestthat the presence of an agn can boost the outflow rate by a large factor, whichis found to increase with the l_agn/l_bol ratio. the gas depletion time-scalesdue to molecular outflows are anti-correlated with the presence and luminosityof an agn in these galaxies, and range from a few hundred million years instarburst galaxies, down to just a few million years in galaxies hostingpowerful agns. in quasar hosts the depletion time-scales due to the outflow aremuch shorter than the depletion time-scales due to star formation. we estimatethe outflow kinetic power and find that, for galaxies hosting powerful agns, itcorresponds to about 5% of the agn luminosity, as expected by models of agnfeedback. moreover, we find that momentum rates of about 20 l_agn/c are commonamong the agn-dominated sources in our sample. for "pure" starburst galaxiesour data tentatively support models in which outflows are mostlymomentum-driven by the radiation pressure from young stars onto dusty clouds.

1401.5614	simultaneous xmm-\textit{newton} and hst-cos observation of 1h0419-577:  ii. broadband spectral modeling of a variable seyfert galaxy	in this paper we present the longest exposure (97 ks) xmm-newton epic-pnspectrum ever obtained for the seyfert 1.5 galaxy 1h 0419-577. with the aim ofexplaining the broadband emission of this source, we took advantage of thesimultaneous coverage in the optical/uv that was provided in the present caseby the xmm-newton optical monitor and by a hst-cos observation. archival fuseflux measurements in the fuv were also used for the present analysis. wesuccessfully modeled the x-ray spectrum together with the optical/uv fluxesdata points using a comptonization model. we found that a blackbody temperatureof $t \sim 56$ ev accounts for the optical/uv emission originating in theaccretion disk. this temperature serves as input for the comptonized componentsthat model the x-ray continuum. both a warm ($t_{\rm wc} \sim 0.7 $ kev,$\tau_{\rm wc} \sim 7 $) and a hot corona ($t_{\rm hc} \sim 160 $ kev,$\tau_{\rm hc} \sim 0.5$) intervene to upscatter the disk photons to x-raywavelengths. with the addition of a partially covering ($c_v\sim50\%$) coldabsorber with a variable opacity ($ {\it n}_{\rm h}\sim [10^{19}- 10^{22}]\,\rm cm^{-2}$), this model can well explain also the historical spectralvariability of this source, with the present dataset presenting the lowest one(${\it n}_{\rm h}\sim 10^{19} \, \rm cm^{-2} $). we discuss a scenario wherethe variable absorber, getting ionized in response to the variations of thex-ray continuum, becomes less opaque in the highest flux states. the lowerlimit for the absorber density derived in this scenario is typical for thebroad line region clouds. finally, we critically compare this scenario with allthe different models (e.g. disk reflection) that have been used in the past toexplain the variability of this source

1403.0853	gas reservoir of a hyper-luminous qso at z=2.6	understanding the relationship between the formation and evolution ofgalaxies and their central super massive black holes (smbh) is one of the maintopics in extragalactic astrophysics. links and feedback may reciprocallyaffect both black hole and galaxy growth. observations of the co line atredshifts of 2-4 are crucial to investigate the gas mass, star formationactivity and accretion onto smbhs, as well as the effect of agn feedback.potential correlations between agn and host galaxy properties can behighlighted by observing extreme objects. despite their luminosity,hyper-luminous qsos at z=2-4 are still little studied at mm wavelengths. wetargeted co(3-2) in ulas j1539+0557, an hyper-luminos qso (lbol&gt; 10^48 erg/s)at z=2.658, selected through its unusual red colors in the ukidss large areasurvey (ulas). we find a molecular gas mass of 4.1+-0.8 10^10 msun, and a gasfraction of 0.4-0.1, depending mostly on the assumed source inclination. wealso find a robust lower limit to the star-formation rate (sfr=250-1600msun/yr) and star-formation efficiency (sfe=25-350 lsun/(k km s-1 pc2) bycomparing the observed optical-near-infrared spectral energy distribution withagn and galaxy templates. the black hole gas consumption timescale,m(h_2)/dm(accretion)/dt, is ~160 myr, similar or higher than the gasconsumption timescale. the gas content and the star formation efficiency aresimilar to those of other high-luminosity, highly obscured qsos, and at thelower end of the star-formation efficiency of unobscured qsos, in line withpredictions from agn-galaxy co-evolutionary scenarios. further measurements ofthe (sub)-mm continuum in this and similar sources are mandatory to obtain arobust observational picture of the agn evolutionary sequence.

1411.4208	blowin' in the wind: both `negative' and `positive' feedback in an  obscured high-z quasar	quasar feedback in the form of powerful outflows is invoked as a keymechanism to quench star formation in galaxies, preventing massive galaxies toover-grow and producing the red colors of ellipticals. on the other hand, somemodels are also requiring `positive' agn feedback, inducing star formation inthe host galaxy through enhanced gas pressure in the interstellar medium.however, finding observational evidence of the effects of both types offeedback is still one of the main challenges of extragalactic astronomy, as fewobservations of energetic and extended radiatively-driven winds are available.here we present sinfoni near infrared integral field spectroscopy of xid2028,an obscured, radio-quiet z=1.59 qso detected in the xmm-cosmos survey, in whichwe clearly resolve a fast (1500 km/s) and extended (up to 13 kpc from the blackhole) outflow in the [oiii] lines emitting gas, whose large velocity andoutflow rate are not sustainable by star formation only. the narrow componentof ha emission and the rest frame u band flux from hst-acs imaging enable tomap the current star formation in the host galaxy: both tracers independentlyshow that the outflow position lies in the center of an empty cavity surroundedby star forming regions on its edge. the outflow is therefore removing the gasfrom the host galaxy (`negative feedback'), but also triggering star formationby outflow induced pressure at the edges (`positive feedback'). xid2028represents the first example of a host galaxy showing both types of feedbacksimultaneously at work.

1506.03096	ionised outflows in z $\sim$ 2.4 quasar host galaxies	agn-driven outflows are invoked by galaxy evolutionary models to quench starformation and to explain the origin of the relations observed locally betweensuper massive black holes and their host galaxies. this work aims to detect thepresence of extended ionised outflows in luminous quasars where we expect themaximum activity both in star formation and in black hole accretion. currently,there are only a few studies based on spatially resolved observations ofoutflows at high redshift, $z&gt;2$. we analyse a sample of six luminous (${\rml&gt;10^{47} \ erg/s}$) quasars at $z\sim2.4$, observed in h-band using thenear-ir integral field spectrometer sinfoni at vlt. we perform a kinematicanalysis of the [oiii] emission line at $\lambda = 5007\aa$. [oiii] has acomplex gas kinematic, with blue-shifted velocities of a few hundreds of km/sand line widths up to 1500 km/s. using the spectroastrometric method we infersize of the ionised outflows of up to $\sim$2 kpc. the properties of theionised outflows, mass outflow rate, momentum rate and kinetic power, arecorrelated with the agn luminosity. the increase in outflow rate withincreasing agn luminosity is consistent with the idea that a luminous agnpushes away the surrounding gas through fast outflows driven by radiationpressure, which depends on the emitted luminosity. we derive mass outflow ratesof about 6-700 m$_{\odot}$/yr for our sample, which are lower than thoseobserved in molecular outflows. indeed physical properties of ionised outflowsshow dependences on agn luminosity which are similar to those of molecularoutflows but indicating that the mass of ionised gas is smaller than that ofthe molecular one. alternatively, this discrepancy between ionised andmolecular outflows could be explained with different acceleration mechanisms.

astro-ph;0309606	an xmm-newton study of the hard x-ray sky	we report on the spectral properties of a sample of 90 hard x-ray selectedserendipitous sources detected in 12 xmm observations with 1&lt;f(2-10)&lt;8010^(-14) erg/cm2/s. approximately 40% of the sources are optically identifiedwith 0.1&lt;z&lt;2 and most of them are classified as broad line agns. a simple modelconsisting of power law modified by galactic absorption offers an acceptablefit to ~65% of the source spectra. this fit yields an average photon index of&lt;gamma&gt;~1.55 over the whole sample. we also find that the mean slope of theqsos in our sample turns out to remain nearly constant (&lt;gamma&gt;~1.8-1.9)between 0&lt;z&lt;2, with no hints of particular trends emerging along z. anadditional cold absorption component with 10^(21)&lt;nh&lt;10^(23) cm^(-2) isrequired in ~30% of the sources. considering only subsamples that are completein flux, we find that the observed fraction of absorbed sources (i.e. withnh&gt;~10^(22) cm^(-2)) is ~30%, with little evolution in the range 2&lt;f(2-10)&lt;8010^(-14) erg/cm2/s. interestingly, this value is a factor ~2 lower thanpredicted by the synthesis models of the cxb. this finding, detected for thefirst time in this survey, therefore suggests that most of the heavily obscuredobjects which make up the bulk of the cxb will be found at lower fluxes(f(2-10)&lt; 10^(-14) erg/cm2/s). this mismatch together with other recentobservational evidences which contrast with cxb model predictions suggest thatone (or more) of the assumptions usually included in these models need to berevised.

astro-ph;0404263	evidence for a multizone warm absorber in the xmm-newton spectrum of  markarian 304	we present a xmm-newton observation of markarian 304, a seyfert 1 galaxy at z= 0.066. the epic data show that mkn 304 is affected by heavy (nh ~10^{23}cm{-2}) obscuration due to ionized gas. a two-phase warm absorber provides anadequate parameterization of this gas. the ionization parameter of the twocomponents is \xi ~6 erg/cm2/s and \xi ~90 erg/cm2/s, respectively. theobserved continuum photon index (gamma ~1.9) is typical for seyfert 1 galaxies.two significant emission lines are detected at 0.57 kev and 6.4 kev,respectively. the former is mostly likely due to he-like oxygen tripletemission arising from an ionized plasma (maybe the warm absorber itself). thelatter is due to fluorescent emission of k-shell iron in a low-ionization state(fei--xv). the upper limit for the line width of sigma_{k\alpha} &lt;0.18 kev mostlikely rules out an origin in the inner parts of the accretion disk.interestingly, the strength of such line is consistent with the possibilitythat the emission is produced in the warm absorber itself. however, asubstantial contribution from the torus is plausible too. we have also found aweak (4% of the primary continuum) soft excess emission component. the presenceof this excess could be explained by either emission/scattering from a warm gasor partial covering, or a combination of them.

astro-ph;0411051	the xmm-newton view of pg quasars i. x-ray continuum and absorption	we present results of a systematic analysis of the xmm-newton spectra of 40quasars (qsos) (z&lt;1.72) from the palomar-green (pg) bright quasar survey sample(m_b&lt;-23). the sample includes 35 radio-quiet quasars (rqqs) and 5 radio-loudquasars (rlqs). the analysis of the spectra above 2 kev reveals that the hardx-ray continuum emission can be modeled with a power law component with&lt;gamma_(2-12)&gt; = 1.89+/-0.11 and &lt;gamma_(2-12)&gt; = 1.63^(+0.02)_(-0.01) for therqqs and rlqs, respectively. below 2 kev, a strong, broad excess is present inmost qso spectra. this feature has been fitted with four different modelsassuming several physical scenarios. all tested models (blackbody, multicolorblackbody, bremsstrahlung and power law) satisfactorily fitted the majority ofthe spectra. however, none of them is able to provide an adequateparameterization for the soft excess emission in all qsos, indicating theabsence of an universal shape for this spectral feature. an additional coldabsorption component was required only in three sources. on the other hand, asrecently pointed out by porquet et al. (2004) for a smaller sample of pg qsos,warm absorber features are present in ~50% of the qso spectra in contrast withtheir rare occurrence (~5-10%) found in previous studies. the xmm-newton viewof optically-selected bright qsos therefore suggests that there are nosignificant difference in the x-ray spectral properties once compared with thelow-luminosity seyfert 1 galaxies. properties of the fe kalpha emission linesare presented in a companion paper.

astro-ph;0501587	the xmm-newton view of pg quasars: ii. properties of the fe k-alpha line	the properties of the fluorescence fe k-alpha emission lines of a sample of38 quasars (qsos) observed with xmm-newton are studied. these objects areincluded in the optically selected sample from the palomar-green (pg) brightquasar survey with an x-ray luminosity 1.3e43&lt;l(2-10 kev)&lt;5.1e45 ergs/s andz&lt;1.72. for each object in the sample, we investigated the presence of bothnarrow and broad iron lines in detail. a total of 20 out of the 38 qsos showevidence of an fe k-alpha emission line with a narrow profile. the majority ofthe lines are consistent with an origin in low ionization material, which islikely to be located in the outer parts of the accretion disk, the moleculartorus, and/or the broad line region. the average properties of the narrow fek-alpha emission line observed in the sample are similar to those of seyferttype galaxies as inferred from recent xmm-newton and chandra studies. a broadline has been significantly detected in only three objects. furthermore, westudied the relationship between the equivalent width (ew) of the iron line andthe hard band x-ray luminosity for radio quiet quasars. the analysis indicatesthat no clear correlation between the strength of the line and the hard x-rayluminosity is present, and our results do not show compelling evidence for ananticorrelation between these two quantities, i.e. the so-called x-ray baldwineffect.

astro-ph;0509043	the hard x-ray view of giga-hertz peaked spectrum radio galaxies	we present the first broadband x-ray observations of four giga-hertz peakedspectrum (gps) radio galaxies at redshift &lt;~1 performed by chandra andxmm-newton. these observations more than double the number of members of thisclass with measured spectra in hard (e &gt; 2 kev) x-rays. all sources weredetected. their radio-to-x-ray spectral energy distributions are similar,except for pks0941-080, which is x-ray under-luminous by about two orders ofmagnitude. the comparison between the full sample of gps galaxies withmeasurements in hard x-rays and a control sample of radio galaxies rules outintrinsic x-ray weakness as causing a lower detection rate of gps sources inx-ray surveys. four out of seven gps galaxies exhibit high x-ray columndensities, whereas for the remaining three this measurement is hampered by thepoor spectral statistics. bearing in mind the low number statistics in both thegps and the control sample, the average column density measured in gps galaxiesis larger than in fri or broad line region fr ii radio galaxies, but consistentwith that measured in high-excitation frii galaxies. this leads to a locationthe absorbing gas in an obscuring ``torus'', which prevents us from observingthe nuclear region along lines-of-sight perpendicular to the radio axis. thisinterpretation is supported by the discovery of rapid (timescale ~1000 s) x-rayvariability in the gps galaxy coinsj0029+3456, and by an almostorder-of-magnitude difference between the hi column density measured in radioand x-rays in pks0500+019.

astro-ph;0509584	x-ray spectral survey with xmm--newton of a complete sample of nearby  seyfert galaxies	results obtained from an x-ray spectral survey of nearby seyfert galaxiesusing xmm--newton are reported. the sample was optically selected, welldefined, complete in b mag, and distance limited: it consists of the nearest(d&lt;22 mpc) 27 seyfert galaxies (9 of type 1, 18 of type 2) taken from the ho etal. (1997) sample. this is one of the largest atlases of hard x-ray spectra oflow-l active galaxies ever assembled. all nuclear sources except two sey 2s aredetected between 2-10 kev, half for the first time ever, and average spectraare obtained for all of them. nuclear luminosities reach values down to 10**38erg/s. the shape of the distribution of x-ray parameters is affected by thepresence of compton-thick objects (&gt; 30% among type 2s). the latter have beenidentified either directly from their intense fek line and flat x-ray spectra,or indirectly with flux diagnostic diagrams which use isotropic indicators.after taking into account these highly absorbed sources, we find that (i) theintrinsic x-ray spectral properties (i.e., spectral shapes and luminositiesabove 2 kev) are consistent between type 1 and type 2 sey, as expected from``unified models'', (ii) sey galaxies as a whole are distributed fairlycontinuously over the entire range of nh, between 10**20 and 10**25 cm**-2, and(iii) while sey 1s tend to have lower nh and sey 2s tend to have the highest,we find 30% and 10% exceptions, respectively. overall the sample wellrepresents the average intrinsic x-ray spectral properties of nearby agn,including a proper estimate of the distribution of their absorbing columns.finally, we conclude that, with the exception of a few cases, the present studyagrees with predictions of unified models of sey galaxies, and extends theirvalidity down to very low luminosities.

astro-ph;0603713	4u 1344-60: a bright intermediate seyfert galaxy at z=0.012 with a  relativistic fe kalpha emission line	we present analysis of the optical and x-ray spectra of the low galacticlatitude bright (f(2-10) = 3.6 10^{-11} erg/cm2/s) source 4u 1344-60. on thebasis of the optical data we propose to classify 4u 1344-60 as an intermediatetype seyfert galaxy and we measure a value of z=0.012+/-0.001 for its redshift.  from the xmm-newton observation we find that the overall x-ray spectral shapeof 4u 1344-60 is complex and can be described by a power-law continuum (gamma ~1.55) obscured by two neutral absorption components (nh(f) ~ 10^{22} cm^{-2}and nh(p) ~ 4 10^{22} cm^{-2}), the latter covering only the ~50% of theprimary x-ray source. the x-ray data therefore lend support to ourclassification of 4u 1344-60. it exhibits a broad and skewed fe kalpha line at6.4 kev, which suggests the existence of an accretion disk that is able toreprocess the primary continuum down to a few gravitational radii. such a linerepresents one of the clearest examples of a relativistic line observed byxmm-newton so far. our analysis has also revealed the marginal presence of twonarrow line-like emission features at ~4.9 and ~5.2 kev.

0810.0513	detection of blueshifted emission and absorption and a relativistic iron  line in the x-ray spectrum of eso 323-g077	we report on the x-ray observation of the seyfert 1 eso323-g077 performedwith xmm-newton. the spectra show a complex spectrum with conspicuousabsorption and emission features. the continuum emission can be modelled with apower law with an index of 1.99+/-0.02 in the whole xmm-newton energy band,marginally consistent with typical values of type-i objects. an absorptioncomponent with an uncommonly high equivalent hydrogen column,n_h=5.82(+0.12/-0.11)x10^22 cm-2, is affecting the soft part of the spectrum.additionally, two warm absorption components are also present. the lowerionised one has an ionisation parameter of log(u)=2.14(+0.06/-0.07) and anoutflowing velocity of v=3200(+600/-200) km/s. two absorption lines located at~6.7 and ~7.0 kev can be modelled with the highly ionised absorber. theionisation parameter and outflowing velocity of the gas measured arelog(u)=3.26(+0.19/-0.15) and v=1700(+600/-400) km/s, respectively. fouremission lines were also detected in the soft energy band. the most likelyexplanation for these emission lines is that they are associated with anoutflowing gas with a velocity of ~2000 km/s. the data suggest that the samegas which is causing the absorption could also being responsible of theseemission features. finally, the spectrum shows the presence of a relativisticiron emission line likely originated in the accretion disc of a kerr bh with aninclination of ~25 deg. we propose a model to explain the observed x-rayproperties which invokes the presence of a two-phase outflow with cone-likestructure and a velocity of the order of 2,000-4,000 km/s. the inner layer ofthe cone would be less ionised, or even neutral, than the outer layer. theinclination angle would be lower than the opening angle of the outflowing cone.
