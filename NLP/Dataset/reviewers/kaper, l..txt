0812.4605	search for the magnetic field of the o7.5 iii star xi persei	cyclical wind variability is an ubiquitous but as yet unexplained featureamong ob stars. the o7.5 iii(n)((f)) star xi persei is the brightestrepresentative of this class on the northern hemisphere. as its prominentcyclical wind properties vary on a rotational time scale (2 or 4 days) the starhas been already for a long time a serious magnetic candidate. as the cause ofthis enigmatic behavior non-radial pulsations and/or a surface magnetic fieldare suggested. we present a preliminary report on our attempts to detect amagnetic field in this star with high-resolution measurements obtained with thespectropolarimeter narval at tbl, france during 2 observing runs of 5 nights in2006 and 5 nights in 2007. only upper limits could be obtained, even with thelongest possible exposure times. if the star hosts a magnetic field, itssurface strength should be less than about 300 g. this would still be enough todisturb the stellar wind significantly. from our new data it seems that theamplitude of the known non-radial pulsations has changed within less than ayear, which needs further investigation.

0907.2422	the ultraviolet spectrum and physical properties of the mass donor star  in hd 226868 = cygnus x-1	we present an examination of high resolution, ultraviolet spectroscopy fromhubble space telescope of the photospheric spectrum of the o-supergiant in themassive x-ray binary hd 226868 = cyg x-1. we analyzed this and ground-basedoptical spectra to determine the effective temperature and gravity of the o9.7iab supergiant. using non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-lte), lineblanketed, plane parallel models from the tlusty grid, we obtain t_eff = 28.0+/- 2.5kk and log g &gt; 3.00 +/- 0.25, both lower than in previous studies. theoptical spectrum is best fit with models that have enriched he and nabundances. we fit the model spectral energy distribution for this temperatureand gravity to the uv, optical, and ir fluxes to determine the angular size ofand extinction towards the binary. the angular size then yields relations forthe stellar radius and luminosity as a function of distance. by assuming thatthe supergiant rotates synchronously with the orbit, we can use the radius -distance relation to find mass estimates for both the supergiant and black holeas a function of the distance and the ratio of stellar to roche radius. fits ofthe orbital light curve yield an additional constraint that limits thesolutions in the mass plane. our results indicate masses of 23^{+8}_{-6} m_sunfor the supergiant and 11^{+5}_{-3} m_sun for the black hole.

0911.3901	grb 090313: x-shooter's first shot at a grb	context. x-shooter is the first second-generation instrument to becomeoperative at the eso very large telescope (vlt). it is a broad-bandmedium-resolution spectrograph designed with gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglowspectroscopy as one of its main science drivers.  aims. during the first commissioning night on sky with the instrument fullyassembled, x-shooter observed the afterglow of grb 090313 as a demonstration ofthe instrument's capabilities.  methods. grb 090313 was observed almost two days after the burst onset, whenthe object had already faded to r~21.6. furthermore, the 90% illuminated moonwas just 30 degrees away from the field. in spite of the adverse conditions, weobtained a spectrum that, for the first time in grb research, coverssimultaneously the range from 5700 to 23000 angstroms.  results. the spectrum shows multiple absorption features at a redshift of3.3736, the redshift of the grb. these features are composed of 3 componentswith different ionisation levels and velocities. some of the features havenever been observed before in a grb at such a high redshift. furthermore, wedetect two intervening systems at redshifts of 1.8005 and 1.9597.  conclusions. these results demonstrate the potential of x-shooter in the grbfield, as it was capable of observing a grb down to a magnitude limit thatwould include 72% of long grb afterglows 2 hours after the burst onset. coupledwith the rapid response mode available at vlt, allowing reaction times of justa few minutes, x-shooter constitutes an important leap forward on mediumresolution spectroscopic studies of grbs, their host galaxies and interveningsystems, probing the early history of the universe.

0707.2802	determination of the mass of the neutron star in smc x-1, lmc x-4 and  cen x-3 with vlt/uves	we present the results of a spectroscopic monitoring campaign of the ob-starcompanions to the eclipsing x-ray pulsars smc x-1, lmc x-4 and cen x-3.high-resolution optical spectra obtained with uves on the eso very largetelescope are used to determine the radial-velocity orbit of the ob(super)giants with high precision. the excellent quality of the spectraprovides the opportunity to measure the radial-velocity curve based onindividual lines, and to study the effect of possible distortions of the lineprofiles due to e.g. x-ray heating on the derived radial-velocity amplitude.several spectral lines show intrinsic variations with orbital phase. themagnitude of these variations depends on line strength, and thus provides acriterion to select lines that do not suffer from distortions. the undistortedlines show a larger radial-velocity amplitude than the distorted lines,consistent with model predictions. application of our line-selection criteriaresults in a mean radial-velocity amplitude k(opt) of 20.2 +/- 1.1, 35.1 +/-1.5, and 27.5 +/- 2.3 km/s (1 sigma errors), for the ob companion to smc x-1,lmc x-4 and cen x-3, respectively. adding information on the projectedrotational velocity of the ob companion (derived from our spectra), theduration of x-ray eclipse and orbital parameters of the x-ray pulsar (obtainedfrom literature), we arrive at a neutron star mass of 1.06^{+0.11}_{-0.10},1.25^{+0.11}_{-0.10} and 1.34^{+0.16}_{-0.14} m{sun} for smc x-1, lmc x-4 andcen x-3, respectively. the mass of smc x-1 is near the minimum mass (~1 m{sun})expected for a neutron star produced in a supernova. we discuss theimplications of the measured mass distribution on the neutron-star formationmechanism, in relation to the evolutionary history of the massive binaries.

1002.2571	sequential star formation in rcw 34: a spectroscopic census of the  stellar content of high-mass star-forming regions	we present vlt/sinfoni integral field spectroscopy of rcw 34 along withspitzer/irac photometry of the surroundings. rcw 34 consists of three differentregions. a large bubble has been detected on the irac images in which a clusterof intermediate- and low-mass class ii objects is found. at the northern edgeof this bubble, an hii region is located, ionized by 3 ob stars. intermediatemass stars (2 - 3 msun) are detected of g- and k- spectral type. these starsare still in the pre-main sequence (pms) phase. north of the hii region, aphoton-dominated region is present, marking the edge of a dense molecular cloudtraced by h2 emission. several class 0/i objects are associated with thiscloud, indicating that star formation is still taking place. the distance torcw 34 is revised to 2.5 +- 0.2 kpc and an age estimate of 2 - 1 myrs isderived from the properties of the pms stars inside the hii region. the mostlikely scenario for the formation of the three regions is that star formationpropagates from south to north. first the bubble is formed, produced byintermediate- and low-mass stars only, after that, the hii region is formedfrom a dense core at the edge of the molecular cloud, resulting in theexpansion as a champagne flow. more recently, star formation occurred in therest of the molecular cloud. two different formation scenarios are possible:(a) the bubble with the cluster of low- and intermediate mass stars triggeredthe formation of the o star at the edge of the molecular cloud which in turninduces the current star-formation in the molecular cloud. (b) an externaltriggering is responsible for the star-formation propagating from south tonorth. [abridged]

1002.4626	galaxy counterparts of metal-rich damped lyman-alpha absorbers - i: the  case of the z=2.35 dla towards q2222-0946	we have initiated a survey using the newly commissioned x-shooterspectrograph to target candidate relatively metal-rich damped lyman-alphaabsorbers (dlas). the spectral coverage of x-shooter allows us to search fornot only lyman-alpha emission, but also rest-frame optical emission lines. wehave chosen dlas where the strongest rest-frame optical lines ([oii], [oiii],hbeta and halpha) fall in the nir atmospheric transmission bands. in this firstpaper resulting from the survey, we report on the discovery of the galaxycounterpart of the z_abs = 2.354 dla towards the z=2.926 quasar q2222$-0946.this dla is amongst the most metal-rich z&gt;2 dlas studied so far at comparableredshifts and there is evidence for substantial depletion of refractoryelements onto dust grains. we measure metallicities from znii, siii, niii, mniiand feii of -0.46+/-0.07, -0.51+/-0.06, -0.85+/-0.06, -1.23+/-0.06, and-0.99+/-0.06, respectively. the galaxy is detected in the lyman-alpha, [oiii]lambda4959,5007 halpha emission lines at an impact parameter of about 0.8arcsec (6 kpc at z_abs = 2.354). we infer a star-formation rate of 10 m_sunyr^-1, which is a lower limit due to the possibility of slit-loss. compared tothe recently determined halpha luminosity function for z=2.2 galaxies thedla-galaxy counterpart has a luminosity of l~0.1l^*_halpha. the emission-lineratios are 4.0 (lyalpha/halpha) and 1.2 ([oiii]/halpha). the lyalpha line showsclear evidence for resonant scattering effects, namely an asymmetric,redshifted (relative to the systemic redshift) component and a much weakerblueshifted component. the fact that the blueshifted component is relativelyweak indicates the presence of a galactic wind. the properties of the galaxycounterpart of this dla is consistent with the prediction that metal-rich dlasare associated with the most luminous of the dla-galaxy counterparts.

1007.5357	vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of the grb 090926a afterglow	the aim of this paper is to study the environment and intervening absorbersof the gamma-ray burst grb 090926a through analysis of optical spectra of itsafterglow. we analyze medium resolution spectroscopic observations (r=10 000,corresponding to 30 km/s, s/n=15 - 30 and wavelength range 3000-25000) of theoptical afterglow of grb 090926a, taken with x-shooter at the vlt ~ 22 hr afterthe grb trigger. the spectrum shows that the ism in the grb host galaxy at z =2.1071 is rich in absorption features, with two components contributing to theline profiles. in addition to the ground state lines, we detect c ii, o i, siii, fe ii and ni ii excited absorption features. no host galaxy emission lines,molecular absorption features nor diffuse interstellar bands are detected inthe spectrum. the hydrogen column density associated to grb 090926a is logn_h/cm^{-2} = 21.60 +/- 0.07, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in therange [x/h] =3.2x10^{-3}-1.2x10^{-2} with respect to the solar values, i.e.,among the lowest values ever observed for a grb host galaxy. a comparison withgalactic chemical evolution models has suggested that the host of grb090926a islikely to be a dwarf irregular galaxy. we put an upper limit to the hydrogenmolecular fraction of the host galaxy ism, which is f &lt; 7x10^{-7}. we deriveinformation on the distance between the host absorbing gas and the site of thegrb explosion. the distance of component i is found to be 2.40 +/- 0.15 kpc,while component ii is located far away from the grb, possibly at ~ 5 kpc. thesevalues are compatible with that found for other grbs.

1011.5312	galaxy counterparts of metal-rich damped lyman-alpha absorbers - ii. a  solar-metallicity and dusty dla at z_abs=2.58	[abridged]. here, we report on the discovery of the galaxy counterpart of thez_abs=2.58 dla on the line-of-sight to the z=3.07 quasar sdssj091826.16+163609.0. the galaxy counterpart of the dla is detected in the oiii5007 and oii 3726,3729 emission lines redshifted into the nir at an impactparameter of 16 kpc. ly-alpha emission is not detected. the upper limit impliesthat ly-alpha emission from this galaxy is suppressed by more than an order ofmagnitude. the dla is amongst the most metal-rich dlas studied so far atcomparable redshifts. we find evidence for substantial depletion of refractoryelements onto dust grains. fitting the main metal line component of the dla,which is located at z_abs=2.5832 and accounts for at least 85% of the totalcolumn density of low-ionisation species, we measure metal abundances fromznii, sii, siii, crii, mnii, feii and niii of -0.12, -0.26, -0.46, -0.88,-0.92, -1.03 and -0.78, respectively. in addition, we detect absorption in thelyman and werner bands of hydrogen, which represents the first detection of h_2molecules with x-shooter. the background quasar q0918+1636 is amongst thereddest qsos at redshifts 3.02&lt;z&lt;3.12 from the sdss catalogue. its uv to nirspectrum is well fitted by a composite qso spectrum reddened by smc/lmc-likeextinction curves at z_abs=2.58 with a significant amount of extinction givenby a_v = 0.2 mag. this supports previous claims that there may be moremetal-rich dlas missing from current samples due to dust reddening of thebackground qsos. the fact that there is evidence for dust both in the centralemitting regions of the galaxy (as evidenced by the lack of ly-alpha emission)and at an impact parameter of 16 kpc (as probed by the dla) suggests that dustis widespread in this system.

1207.6988	investigating the spectroscopic, magnetic and circumstellar variability  of the o9 subgiant star hd 57682	the o9iv star hd 57682, discovered to be magnetic within the context of themimes survey in 2009, is one of only eight convincingly detected magnetico-type stars. among this select group, it stands out due to its sharp-linedphotospheric spectrum. since its discovery, the mimes collaboration hascontinued to obtain spectroscopic and magnetic observations in order to refineour knowledge of its magnetic field strength and geometry, rotational period,and spectral properties and variability. in this paper we report new espadonsspectropolarimetric observations of hd 57682, which are combined withpreviously published espadons data and archival h{\alpha} spectroscopy. thisdataset is used to determine the rotational period (63.5708 \pm 0.0057 d),refine the longitudinal magnetic field variation and magnetic geometry (dipolesurface field strength of 880\pm50 g and magnetic obliquity of 79\pm4\circ asmeasured from the magnetic longitudinal field variations, assuming aninclination of 60\circ), and examine the phase variation of various lines. inparticular, we demonstrate that the h{\alpha} equivalent width undergoes adouble-wave variation during a single rotation of the star, consistent with thederived magnetic geometry. we group the variable lines into two classes: thosethat, like h{\alpha}, exhibit non-sinusoidal variability, often with multiplemaxima during the rotation cycle, and those that vary essentially sinusoidally.based on our modelling of the h{\alpha} emission, we show that the variabilityis consistent with emission being generated from an optically thick, flatteneddistribution of magnetically-confined plasma that is roughly distributed aboutthe magnetic equator. finally, we discuss our findings in the magnetosphericframework proposed in our earlier study.

1212.4144	the outflow history of two herbig-haro jets in rcw 36: hh 1042 and hh  1043	jets around low- and intermediate-mass young stellar objects (ysos) contain afossil record of the recent accretion and outflow activity of their parentstar-forming systems. we aim to understand whether the accretion/ejectionprocess is similar across the entire stellar mass range of the parent ysos. tothis end we have obtained vlt/x-shooter spectra of hh 1042 and hh 1043, twonewly discovered jets in the massive star-forming region rcw 36. hh 1042 isassociated with the intermediate-mass yso 08576nr292. over 90 emission linesare detected in the spectra. high-velocity (up to 220 km/s) blue- andredshifted emission from a bipolar flow is observed in typical shock tracers.low-velocity emission from the background cloud is detected in nebular tracers,including lines from high ionization species. we applied combined optical andinfrared spectral diagnostic tools in order to derive the physical conditions(density, temperature, and ionization) in the jets. the measured mass outflowrates are mjet ~ 10^-7 msun/yr. we measure a high accretion rate for hh 1042(macc ~ 10^-6 msun/yr) and mjet/macc ~ 0.1, comparable to low-mass sources andconsistent with models for magneto-centrifugal jet launching. the knottedstructure and velocity spread in both jets are interpreted as fossil signaturesof a variable outflow rate. the mean velocities in both lobes of the jets arecomparable, but the variations in mjet and velocity in the two lobes are notsymmetric, suggesting that the launching mechanism on either side of theaccretion disk is not synchronized. for hh 1042, we have constructed aninterpretative physical model with a stochastic or periodic outflow rate and adescription of a ballistic flow as its constituents. the knotted structure andvelocity spread can be reproduced qualitatively with the model, indicating thatthe outflow velocity varies on timescales on the order of 100 yr.

1302.2352	a new population of ultra-long duration gamma-ray bursts	we present comprehensive multiwavelength observations of three gamma-raybursts (grbs) with durations of several thousand seconds. we demonstrate thatthese events are extragalactic transients; in particular we resolve thelong-standing conundrum of the distance of grb 101225a (the "christmas-dayburst"), finding it to have a redshift z=0.847, and showing that two apparentlysimilar events (grb 111209a and grb 121027a) lie at z=0.677 and z=1.773respectively. the systems show extremely unusual x-ray and optical lightcurves,very different from classical grbs, with long lasting highly variable x-rayemission and optical light curves that exhibit little correlation with thebehaviour seen in the x-ray. their host galaxies are faint, compact, and highlystar forming dwarf galaxies, typical of "blue compact galaxies". we proposethat these bursts are the prototypes of a hitherto largely unrecognizedpopulation of ultra-long grbs, that while observationally difficult to detectmay be astrophysically relatively common. the long durations may naturally beexplained by the engine driven explosions of stars of much larger radii thannormally considered for grb progenitors which are thought to have compactwolf-rayet progenitor stars. however, we cannot unambiguously identifysupernova signatures within their light curves or spectra. we also consider thealternative possibility that they arise from the tidal disruption of stars bysupermassive black holes.

1304.4591	r144 revealed as a double-lined spectroscopic binary	r144 is a wn6h star in the 30 doradus region. it is suspected to be a binarybecause of its high luminosity and its strong x-ray flux, but no periodicitycould be established so far. here, we present new xshooter multi-epochspectroscopy of r144 obtained at the eso very large telescope (vlt). we detectvariability in position and/or shape of all the spectral lines. we measureradial velocity variations with an amplitude larger than 250 km/s in niv and nvlines. furthermore, the niii and nv line doppler shifts are anti-correlated andthe niv lines show a double-peaked profile on six of our seven epochs. we thusconclude that r144 is a double-lined spectroscopic binary. possible orbitalperiods range from 2 to 6 months, although a period up to one year is allowedif the orbit is highly eccentric. we estimate the spectral types of thecomponents to be wn5-6h and wn6-7h, respectively. the high luminosity of thesystem (log lbol/lsun ~ 6.8) suggests a present-day total mass content in therange of about 200 to 300 msun, depending on the evolutionary stage of thecomponents. this makes r144 the most massive binary identified so far, with atotal mass content at birth possibly as large as 400 msun. we briefly discussthe presence of such a massive object 60 pc away from the r136 cluster core inthe context of star formation and stellar dynamics.

1304.7003	molecular hydrogen in the damped lyman-alpha system towards grb 120815a  at z=2.36	we present the discovery of molecular hydrogen (h_2), including the presenceof vibrationally-excited h_2^* in the optical spectrum of the afterglow of grb120815a at z=2.36 obtained with x-shooter at the vlt. simultaneous photometricbroad-band data from grond and x-ray observations by swift/xrt place furtherconstraints on the amount and nature of dust along the sightline. the galacticenvironment of grb 120815a is characterized by a strong dla withlog(n(h)/cm^-2) = 21.95 +/- 0.10, prominent h_2 absorption in the lyman-wernerbands (log(n(h_2)/cm^-2) = 20.53 +/- 0.13) and thus a molecular gas fractionlog f(h_2)=-1.14 +/- 0.15. the distance d between the absorbing neutral gas andgrb 120815a is constrained via photo-excitation modeling of fine-structure andmeta-stable transitions of feii and niii to d = 0.5 +/- 0.1 kpc. the dlametallicity ([zn/h] = -1.15 +/- 0.12), visual extinction (a_v &lt; 0.15 mag) anddust depletion ([zn/fe] = 1.01 +/- 0.10) are intermediate between the values ofwell-studied, h_2-deficient grb-dlas observed at high spectral resolution, andthe approximately solar metallicity, highly-obscured and h_2-rich grb 080607sightline. with respect to n(h), metallicity, as well as dust-extinction anddepletion, grb 120815a is fairly representative of the average properties ofgrb-dlas. this demonstrates that molecular hydrogen is present in at least afraction of the more typical grb-dlas, and h_2 and h_2^* are probably morewide-spread among grb-selected systems than the few examples of previousdetections would suggest.

1305.6832	discovery of the broad-lined type ic sn 2013cq associated with the very  energetic grb 130427a	long-duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) at z &lt; 1 are in most cases found to beaccompanied by bright, broad-lined type ic supernovae (sne ic-bl). thehighest-energy grbs are mostly located at higher redshifts, where theassociated sne are hard to detect observationally. here we present early andlate observations of the optical counterpart of the very energetic grb 130427a.despite its moderate redshift z = 0.3399+/-0.0002, grb 130427a is at the highend of the grb energy distribution, with an isotropic-equivalent energy releaseof eiso ~ 9.6x10^53 erg, more than an order of magnitude more energetic thanother grbs with spectroscopically confirmed sne. in our dense photometricmonitoring, we detect excess flux in the host-subtracted r-band light curve,consistent with what expected from an emerging sn, ~0.2 mag fainter than theprototypical sn 1998bw. a spectrum obtained around the time of the sn peak(16.7 days after the grb) reveals broad undulations typical of sne ic-bl,confirming the presence of a sn, designated sn 2013cq. the spectral shape andearly peak time are similar to those of the high expansion velocity sn 2010bhassociated with grb 100316d. our findings demonstrate that high-energylong-duration grbs, commonly detected at high redshift, can also be associatedwith sne ic-bl, pointing to a common progenitor mechanism.

1308.2984	spectroscopy of the short-hard grb 130603b: the host galaxy and  environment of a compact object merger	short duration gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are thought to be related to theviolent merger of compact objects, such as neutron stars or black holes, whichmakes them promising sources of gravitational waves. the detection of a'kilonova'-like signature associated to the swift-detected grb 130603b hassuggested that this event is the result of a compact object merger. ourknowledge on sgrb has been, until now, mostly based on the absence of supernovasignatures and the analysis of the host galaxies to which they cannot always besecurely associated. further progress has been significantly hampered by thefaintness and rapid fading of their optical counterparts (afterglows), whichhas so far precluded spectroscopy of such events. afterglow spectroscopy is thekey tool to firmly determine the distance at which the burst was produced,crucial to understand its physics, and study its local environment. here wepresent the first spectra of a prototypical sgrb afterglow in which bothabsorption and emission features are clearly detected. together withmultiwavelength photometry we study the host and environment of grb 130603b.from these spectra we determine the redshift of the burst to be z =0.3565+/-0.0002, measure rich dynamics both in absorption and emission, and asubstantial line of sight extinction of a_v = 0.86+/-0.15 mag. the grb waslocated at the edge of a disrupted arm of a moderately star forming galaxy withnear-solar metallicity. unlike for most long grbs (lgrbs), n_hx / a_v isconsistent with the galactic ratio, indicating that the explosion site differsfrom those found in lgrbs. the merger is not associated with the moststar-forming region of the galaxy; however, it did occur in a dense region,implying a rapid merger or a low natal kick velocity for the compact objectbinary.

1308.3238	rcw36: characterizing the outcome of massive star formation	massive stars play a dominant role in the process of clustered starformation, with their feedback into the molecular cloud through ionizingradiation, stellar winds and outflows. the formation process of massive starsis poorly constrained because of their scarcity, the short formation timescaleand obscuration. by obtaining a census of the newly formed stellar population,the star formation history of the young cluster and the role of the massivestars within it can be unraveled. we aim to reconstruct the formation historyof the young stellar population of the massive star-forming region rcw 36. westudy several dozens of individual objects, both photometrically andspectroscopically, look for signs of multiple generations of young stars andinvestigate the role of the massive stars in this process. we obtain a censusof the physical parameters and evolutionary status of the young stellarpopulation. using a combination of near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy weestimate ages and masses of individual objects. we identify the population ofembedded young stellar objects (yso) by their infrared colors and emission linespectra. rcw 36 harbors a stellar population of massive and intermediate-massstars located around the center of the cluster. class 0/i and ii sources arefound throughout the cluster. the central population has a median age of 1.1+/- 0.6 myr. of the stars which could be classified, the most massive ones aresituated in the center of the cluster. the central cluster is surrounded byfilamentary cloud structures; within these, some embedded and accreting ysosare found. our age determination is consistent with the filamentary structureshaving been shaped by the ionizing radiation and stellar winds of the centralmassive stars. the formation of a new generation of stars is ongoing, asdemonstrated by the presence of embedded protostellar clumps, and two exposedjets.

0801.4286	stellar wind variations during the x-ray high and low states of cygnus  x-1	we present results from hubble space telescope uv spectroscopy of the massivex-ray binary system, hd226868 = cyg x-1. the spectra were obtained at bothorbital conjunction phases in two separate runs in 2002 and 2003 when thesystem was in the x-ray high/soft state. the stellar wind lines suffer largereductions in strength when the black hole is in the foreground due to thex-ray ionization of the wind ions. a comparison of hst and archival iue spectrashows that similar photoionization effects occur in both the x-ray states. weconstructed model uv wind line profiles assuming that x-ray ionization occurseverywhere in the wind except the zone where the supergiant blocks the x-rayflux. the good match between the observed and model profiles indicates that thewind ionization extends to near to the hemisphere of the supergiant facing thex-ray source. the h-alpha emission strength is generally lower in the high/softstate compared to the low/hard state, but the he ii 4686 emission is relativelyconstant between states. the results suggest that mass transfer in cyg x-1 isdominated by a focused wind flow that peaks along the axis joining the starsand that the stellar wind contribution is shut down by x-ray photoionizationeffects. the strong stellar wind from the shadowed side of the supergiant willstall when coriolis deflection brings the gas into the region of x-rayillumination. this stalled gas component may be overtaken by the orbital motionof the black hole and act to inhibit accretion from the focused wind. thevariations in the strength of the shadow wind component may then lead toaccretion rate changes that ultimately determine the x-ray state.

1401.3744	relating jet structure to photometric variability: the herbig ae star hd  163296	herbig ae/be stars are intermediate-mass pre-main sequence stars surroundedby circumstellar dust disks. some are observed to produce jets, whoseappearance as a sequence of shock fronts (knots) suggests a past episodicoutflow variability. this "jet fossil record" can be used to reconstruct theoutflow history. we present the first optical to near-infrared (nir)vlt/x-shooter spectra of the jet from the herbig ae star hd 163296. wedetermine physical conditions in the knots, as well as their kinematic "launchepochs". knots are formed simultaneously on either side of the disk, with aregular interval of ~16 yr. the velocity dispersion versus jet velocity and theenergy input are comparable in both lobes. however, the mass loss rate,velocity, and shock conditions are asymmetric. we find mjet/macc ~ 0.01-0.1,consistent with magneto-centrifugal jet launching models. no evidence for dustis found in the high-velocity jet, suggesting it is launched within thesublimation radius (&lt;0.5 au). the jet inclination measured from proper motionsand radial velocities confirms it is perpendicular to the disk. a tentativerelation is found between the structure of the jet and the photometricvariability of the source. episodes of nir brightening were previously detectedand attributed to a dusty disk wind. we report for the first time significantoptical fadings lasting from a few days up to a year, coinciding with the nirbrightenings. these are likely caused by dust lifted high above the disk plane;this supports the disk wind scenario. the disk wind is launched at a largerradius than the high-velocity atomic jet, although their outflow variabilitymay have a common origin. no significant relation between outflow and accretionvariability could be established. our findings confirm that this sourceundergoes periodic ejection events, which may be coupled with dust ejectionsabove the disk plane.

1401.3774	grb 120422a/sn 2012bz: bridging the gap between low- and high-luminosity  grbs	at low redshift, a handful of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) have been discoveredwith peak luminosities ($l_{\rm iso} &lt; 10^{48.5}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$)substantially lower than the average of the more distant ones ($l_{\rm iso} &gt;10^{49.5}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$). the properties of several low-luminosity(low-$l$) grbs indicate that they can be due to shock break-out, as opposed tothe emission from ultrarelativistic jets. owing to this, it is highly debatedhow both populations are connected, and whether there is a continuum betweenthem. the burst at redshift $z=0.283$ from 2012 april 22 is one of the very fewexamples of intermediate-$l$ grbs with a $\gamma$-ray luminosity of$l\sim10^{48.9}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}$ that have been detected up to now. togetherwith the robust detection of its accompanying supernova sn 2012bz, it has thepotential to answer important questions on the origin of low- and high-$l$ grbsand the grb-sn connection. we carried out a spectroscopy campaign using medium-and low-resolution spectrographs at 6--10-m class telescopes, covering the timespan of 37.3 days, and a multi-wavelength imaging campaign from radio to x-rayenergies over a duration of $\sim270$ days. furthermore, we used a tuneablefilter centred at h$\alpha$ to map star formation in the host galaxy and thesurrounding galaxies. we used these data to extract and model the properties ofdifferent radiation components and incorporate spectral-energy-distributionfitting techniques to extract the properties of the host galaxy. modelling thelight curve and spectral energy distribution from the radio to the x-raysrevealed the blast-wave to expand with an initial lorentz factor of$\gamma_0\sim60$, low for a high-$l$ grb, and that the afterglow had anexceptional low peak luminosity-density of$\lesssim2\times10^{30}~\rm{erg\,s}^{-1}\,\rm{hz}^{-1}$ in the sub-mm.[abridged]

1401.7185	blowing in the wind: the dust wave surrounding $\sigma$ ori ab	observations with the spitzer space telescope and the wise satellite haverevealed a prominent arc-like structure at 50" ($\simeq0.1$ pc) from theo9.5v/b0.5v system $\sigma$ ori ab. we attribute this dust structure to theinteraction of radiation pressure from the star with dust carried along by theic 434 photo-evaporative flow of ionized gas from the dark cloud l1630. we havedeveloped a quantitative model for the interaction of a dusty ionized flow withnearby (massive) stars where radiation pressure stalls dust, piling it up at anappreciable distance (&gt; 0.1 pc), and force it to flow around the star. themodel demonstrates that for the conditions in ic 434, the gas will decouplefrom the dust and will keep its original flow lines. we argue that this duststructure is the first example of a dust wave created by a massive star movingthrough the interstellar medium. dust waves (and bow waves) stratify dustgrains according to their radiation pressure opacity, which reflects the sizedistribution and composition of the grain material. comparison of our modelwith observations implies that dust-gas coupling through coulomb interaction isless important than previously thought, challenging our understanding of graindynamics in hot, ionized regions of space. we describe the difference betweendust (and bow) waves and classical bow shocks. we conclude that dust waves andbow waves should be common around stars showing the weak-wind phenomenon andthat these structures are best observed at mid-ir to fir wavelengths. inparticular, dust waves and bow waves are most efficiently formed aroundweak-wind stars moving through a high density medium. moreover, they provide aunique opportunity to study the direct interaction between a (massive) star andits immediate surroundings.

1404.2807	radiation-pressure-driven dust waves inside bursting interstellar  bubbles	massive stars drive the evolution of the interstellar medium through theirradiative and mechanical energy input. after their birth, they form bubbles ofhot gas surrounded by a dense shell. traditionally, the formation of bubbles isexplained through the input of a powerful stellar wind, even though directevidence supporting this scenario is lacking. here we explore the possibilitythat interstellar bubbles seen by the spitzer- and herschel space telescopes,blown by stars with log(l/l_sun) &lt; 5.2, form and expand due to the thermalpressure accompanying ionization of the surrounding gas. we show that densitygradients in the natal cloud or a puncture in the swept up shell lead to anionized gas flow through the bubble into the general interstellar medium, whichis traced by a dust wave near the star, demonstrating the importance ofradiation pressure during this phase. dust waves provide a natural explanationfor the presence of dust inside h ii bubbles, offer a novel method to studydust in h ii regions and provide direct evidence that bubbles are relievingtheir pressure into the ism through a champagne flow, acting as a probe of theradiative interaction of a massive star with its surroundings. we create aparameter space connecting the ambient density, the ionizing source luminosity,and the position of the dust wave, while using the well-studied h ii bubblesrcw 120 and rcw 82 as benchmarks of our model. finally, we briefly examine theimplications of our study for the environments of super star clusters formed inultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs), merging galaxies and the earlyuniverse, which occur in very luminous and dense environments and whereradiation pressure is expected to dominate the dynamical evolution.

1407.0370	vlt/x-shooter survey of near-infrared diffuse interstellar bands	this paper presents a spectral survey of diffuse interstellar bands (dibs) inthe nir range, from 0.9 to 2.5 micron. the observations were designed to detectnew dibs, confirm previously proposed nir dibs, and characterise theirbehaviour with respect to known line-of-sight properties (including the opticaldibs present in our spectra). x-shooter at the vlt was used to obtainedmedium-resolution spectra of eight known dib targets and one telluric referencestar. in addition to the known 9577, 9632, 10780, 11797, and 13175 angstromsnir dibs, we confirm 9 out of the 13 nir dibs that were presented by geballeand co-workers in 2011. furthermore, we report 12 new nir dib candidates. thestrengths of the strongest nir dibs show a general correlation with reddening,e(b-v), but with a large scatter. several nir dibs are more strongly correlatedwith the 5780 angstroms dib strength than with e(b-v); this is especially thecase for the 15268 angstroms dib. the nir dibs are strong: the summedequivalent widths of the five strongest nir dibs represent a few percent of thetotal equivalent width of the entire average dib spectrum (per unit reddening).the nir dibs towards the translucent cloud hd 147889 are all weak with respectto the general trend. no direct match was found between observed nir dibs andlaboratory matrix-isolation spectroscopic data of pahs. the strong correlationbetween the 5780-15268 dib pair implies that (nf)_5780 / (nf)_15268 = 14.however, the reduced strength of the 15268 angstroms dib in hd 147889 rules outa common carrier for these two dibs. since the ionisation fraction for smallpahs in this translucent cloud is known to be low compared to diffuse clouds,the weakness of the 15268 angstrom dib suggests that an ionised species couldbe the carrier of this nir dib.

1408.2828	models of the circumstellar medium of evolving, massive runaway stars  moving through the galactic plane	at least 5 per cent of the massive stars are moving supersonically throughthe interstellar medium (ism) and are expected to produce a stellar wind bowshock. we explore how the mass loss and space velocity of massive runaway starsaffect the morphology of their bow shocks. we run two-dimensional axisymmetrichydrodynamical simulations following the evolution of the circumstellar mediumof these stars in the galactic plane from the main sequence to the redsupergiant phase. we find that thermal conduction is an important processgoverning the shape, size and structure of the bow shocks around hot stars, andthat they have an optical luminosity mainly produced by forbidden lines, e.g.[oiii]. the ha emission of the bow shocks around hot stars originates from neartheir contact discontinuity. the h$\alpha$ emission of bow shocks around coolstars originates from their forward shock, and is too faint to be observed forthe bow shocks that we simulate. the emission of optically-thin radiationmainly comes from the shocked ism material. all bow shock models are brighterin the infrared, i.e. the infrared is the most appropriate waveband to searchfor bow shocks. our study suggests that the infrared emission comes from nearthe contact discontinuity for bow shocks of hot stars and from the inner regionof shocked wind for bow shocks around cool stars. we predict that, in thegalactic plane, the brightest, i.e. the most easily detectable bow shocks areproduced by high-mass stars moving with small space velocities.

0803.3897	probing the early evolution of young high-mass stars	near-infrared imaging surveys of high-mass star-forming regions reveal anamazingly complex interplay between star formation and the environment(churchwell et al. 2006; alvarez et al. 2004). by means of near-ir spectroscopythe embedded massive young stars can be characterized and placed in the contextof their birth site. however, so far spectroscopic surveys have been hopelesslyincomplete, hampering any systematic study of these very young massive stars.new integral field instrumentation available at eso has opened the possibilityto take a huge step forward by obtaining a full spectral inventory of theyoungest massive stellar populations in star-forming regions currentlyaccessible. simultaneously, the analysis of the extended emission allows thecharacterization of the environmental conditions. the formation and earlyevolution of massive stars (fems) collaboration aims at setting up a largeobserving campaign to obtain a full census of the stellar content, ionizedmaterial, outflows and pdr's over a sample of regions that covers a largeparameter space. complementary radio, mm and infrared observations will be usedfor the characterization of the deeply embedded population. for the first eightregions we have obtained 40 hours of sinfoni observations. in thiscontribution, we present the first results on three regions that illustrate thepotential of this strategy.

1409.4804	vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of the afterglow of the swift grb 130606a:  chemical abundances and reionisation at $z\sim6$	the reionisation of the universe is thought to have ended around z~6, asinferred from spectroscopy of distant bright background sources, such asquasars (qso) and gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows. furthermore, spectroscopyof a grb afterglow provides insight in its host galaxy, which is often too dimand distant to study otherwise. we present the high s/n vlt/x-shooter spectrumof grb130606a at z=5.913. we aim to measure the degree of ionisation of the igmbetween 5.02&lt;z&lt;5.84 and to study the chemical abundance pattern and dustcontent of its host galaxy. we measured the flux decrement due to absorption atly$\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ wavelength regions. the hydrogen and metalabsorption lines formed in the host galaxy were fitted with voigt profiles toobtain column densities. our measurements of the ly$\alpha$-forest opticaldepth are consistent with previous measurements of qsos, but have a muchsmaller uncertainty. the analysis of the red damping wing yields a neutralfraction $x_{hi}&lt;0.05$ (3$\sigma$). we obtain column density measurements ofseveral elements. the ionisation corrections due to the grb is estimated to benegligible (&lt;0.03 dex), but larger corrections may apply due to thepre-existing radiation field (up to 0.4 dex based on sub-dla studies). ourmeasurements confirm that the universe is already predominantly ionised overthe redshift range probed in this work, but was slightly more neutral at z&gt;5.6.grbs are useful probes of the ionisation state of the igm in the earlyuniverse, but because of internal scatter we need a larger statistical sampleto draw robust conclusions. the high [si/fe] in the host can be due to dustdepletion, alpha-element enhancement, or a combination of both. the very highvalue of [al/fe]=2.40+/-0.78 might connected to the stellar population history.we estimate the host metallicity to be -1.7&lt;[m/h]&lt;-0.9 (2%-13% of solar).(trunc.)

1410.0934	the properties of ten o-type stars in the low-metallicity galaxies ic  1613, wlm and ngc 3109	massive stars likely played an important role in the reionization of theuniverse, and the formation of the first black holes. massive stars inlow-metallicity environments in the local universe are reminiscent of theirhigh redshift counterparts. in a previous paper, we reported on indicationsthat the stellar winds of low-metallicity o stars may be stronger thanpredicted, which would challenge the current paradigm of massive starevolution. in this paper, we aim to extend our initial sample of six o stars inlow-metallicity environments by four. we aim to derive their stellar and windparameters, and compare these to radiation-driven wind theory and stellarevolution models. we have obtained intermediate-resolution vlt/x-shooterspectra of our sample of stars. we derive the stellar parameters by fittingsynthetic fastwind line profiles to the vlt/x-shooter spectra using a geneticfitting algoritm. we compare our parameters to evolutionary tracks and obtainevolutionary masses and ages. we also investigate the effective temperatureversus spectral type calibration for smc and lower metallicities. finally, wereassess the wind momentum versus luminosity diagram. the derived parameters ofour target stars indicate stellar masses that reach values of up to 50$m_{\odot}$. the wind strengths of our stars are, on average, stronger thanpredicted from radiation-driven wind theory and reminiscent of stars with anlmc metallicity. we discuss indications that the iron content of the hostgalaxies is higher than originally thought and is instead smc-like. we findthat the discrepancy with theory is lessened, but remains significant for thishigher metallicity. this may imply that our current understanding of the windproperties of massive stars, both in the local universe as well as at cosmicdistances, remains incomplete.

1503.03623	spectrophotometric analysis of grb afterglow extinction curves with  x-shooter	in this work we use gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglow spectra observed with thevlt/x-shooter spectrograph to measure rest-frame extinction in grblines-of-sight by modeling the broadband near-infrared (nir) to x-ray afterglowspectral energy distributions (seds). our sample consists of nine swift grbs,eight of them belonging to the long-duration and one to the short-durationclass. dust is modeled using the average extinction curves of the milky way andthe two magellanic clouds. we derive the rest-frame extinction of the entiresample, which fall in the range $0 \lesssim {\it a}_{\rm v} \lesssim 1.2$.moreover, the smc extinction curve is the preferred extinction curve templatefor the majority of our sample, a result which is in agreement with thosecommonly observed in grb lines-of-sights. in one analysed case (grb 120119a),the common extinction curve templates fail to reproduce the observedextinction. to illustrate the advantage of using the high-quality x-shooterafterglow seds over the photometric seds, we repeat the modeling using thebroadband seds with the nir-to-uv photometric measurements instead of thespectra. the main result is that the spectroscopic data, thanks to acombination of excellent resolution and coverage of the blue part of the sed,are more successful in constraining the extinction curves and therefore thedust properties in grb hosts with respect to photometric measurements. in allcases but one the extinction curve of one template is preferred over theothers. we show that the modeled values of the extinction and the spectralslope, obtained through spectroscopic and photometric sed analysis, can differsignificantly for individual events. finally we stress that, regardless of theresolution of the optical-to-nir data, the sed modeling gives reliable resultsonly when the fit is performed on a sed covering a broader spectral region.

astro-ph;0304516	a vlt spectroscopic study of the ultracompact hii region g29.96-0.02	a high quality, medium-resolution k-band spectrum has been obtained of theultracompact hii region g29.96-0.02 with the very large telescope (vlt). theslit was positioned along the symmetry axis of the cometary shaped nebula.besides the spectrum of the embedded ionizing o star, the long-slit observationrevealed the rich emission-line spectrum produced by the ionized nebula withsub-arcsec spatial resolution. the nebular spectrum includes br$\gamma$,several helium emission lines and a molecular hydrogen line. a detailedanalysis is presented of the variation in strength, velocity and width of thenebular emission lines along the slit. the results are consistent with previousobservations, but the much better spatial resolution allows a criticalevaluation of models explaining the cometary shape of the nebula. ourobservations support neither the wind bow shock model nor the champagne flowmodel. the measured line ratios of the nebular hydrogen and helium lines arecompared to predictions from case b recombination-line theory. the resultsindicate an electron temperature between 6400 and 7500 k, in good agreementwith other determinations and the galactocentric distance of 4.6 kpc. thehe$^{+}$/h$^{+}$ ratio is practically constant over the slit; we argue that heis singly ionized throughout the nebula. we review the various observationalconstraints on the effective temperature of the ionizing star and show thatthese are in agreement with its k-band spectral type of o5-o6v.

astro-ph;0305227	variable polarization in the optical afterglow of grb 021004	we present polarimetric observations of the afterglow of gamma-ray burst(grb) 021004, obtained with the nordic optical telescope (not) and the verylarge telescope (vlt) between 8 and 17 hours after the burst. comparison amongthe observations shows a 45 degree change in the position angle from 9 hoursafter the burst to 16 hours after the burst, and comparison with published datafrom later epochs even shows a 90 degree change between 9 and 89 hours afterthe burst. the degree of linear polarization shows a marginal change, but isalso consistent with being constant in time. in the context of currentlyavailable models for changes in the polarization of grbs, a homogeneous jetwith an early break time of t_b ~ 1 day provides a good explanation of ourdata. the break time is a factor 2 to 6 earlier than has been found from theanalysis of the optical light curve. the change in the position angle of thepolarization rules out a structured jet model for the grb.

astro-ph;0408370	on the hipparcos parallaxes of o stars	we compare the absolute visual magnitude of the majority of bright o stars inthe sky as predicted from their spectral type with the absolute magnitudecalculated from their apparent magnitude and the hipparcos parallax. we findthat many stars appear to be much fainter than expected, up to five magnitudes.we find no evidence for a correlation between magnitude differences and thestellar rotational velocity as suggested for ob stars by lamers et al. (1997),whose small sample of stars is partly included in ours. instead, by means of asimulation we show how these differences arise naturally from the largedistances at which o stars are located, and the level of precision of theparallax measurements achieved by hipparcos. straightforwardly deriving adistance from the hipparcos parallax yields reliable results for one or two ostars only. we discuss several types of bias reported in the literature inconnection with parallax samples (lutz-kelker, malmquist) and investigate howthey affect the o star sample. in addition, we test three absolute magnitudecalibrations from the literature (schmidt-kaler et al. 1982; howarth &amp; prinja1989; vacca et al. 1996) and find that they are consistent with the hipparcosmeasurements. although o stars conform nicely to the simulation, we notice thatsome b stars in the sample of lamers et al.

astro-ph;0605413	vlt k-band spectroscopy of massive young stellar objects in  (ultra-)compact hii regions	high-quality k-band spectra of strongly reddened point sources, deeplyembedded in (ultra-) compact hii regions, have revealed a population of 20young massive stars showing no photospheric absorption lines, but sometimesstrong br-gamma emission. the br-gamma equivalent widths occupy a wide range(from about 1 to over 100 a); the line widths of 100-200 km/s indicate acircumstellar rather than a nebular origin. the k-band spectra exhibit one ormore features commonly associated with massive young stellar objects (ysos)surrounded by circumstellar material: a very red colour (j-k) &gt; 2, co bandheademission, hydrogen emission lines (sometimes doubly peaked), and feii and/ormgii emission lines. the massive yso distribution in the cmd suggests that themajority of the objects are of similar spectral type as the herbig be stars,but some of them are young o stars.  the co emission must come from a relatively dense (~10^{10} cm^{-3}) and hot(t~ 2000-5000 k) region, sufficiently shielded from the intense uv radiationfield of the young massive star. the hydrogen emission is produced in anionised medium exposed to uv radiation. the best geometrical solution is adense and neutral circumstellar disk causing the co bandhead emission, and anionised upper layer where the hydrogen lines are produced. we present argumentsthat the circumstellar disk is more likely a remnant of the accretion processthan the result of rapid rotation and mass loss such as in be/b[e] stars.

astro-ph;0607613	vlt/uves spectroscopy of wray 977, the hypergiant companion to the x-ray  pulsar gx301-2	model atmosphere fits to high-resolution optical spectra of wray 977 confirmthe b hypergiant classification of the massive companion to the x-ray pulsargx301-2. the models give a radius of 62 rsun, an effective temperature of18,100 k and a luminosity of 5 x 10^^5 lsun. the deduced mass-loss rate andterminal velocity of the stellar wind are 10^^-5 msun/yr and 305 km/s,respectively. the interstellar na i d absorption indicates that wray 977 islocated behind the first intersection with the sagittarius-carina spiral arm(1-2.5 kpc) and probably belongs to the stellar population of the norma spiralarm at a distance of 3-4 kpc. the spectra obtained with uves on the very largetelescope (vlt) cover a full orbit of the system, including periastron passage,from which we derive the radial-velocity curve of the b hypergiant. themeasured radial-velocity amplitude is 10 +/-3 km/s yielding a mass ratio q =0.046 +/- 0.014. the absence of an x-ray eclipse results in a lower limit tothe mass of wray 977 of 39 msun. an upper limit of 53 msun is derived for themass of wray 977 adopting a maximum neutron star mass of 2.5 msun. the``spectroscopic'' mass of wray 977 is 43 +/- 10 msun, consistent with the rangein mass derived from the binarity constraints. the mass of the neutron star is1.85 +/- 0.6 msun. time series of spectral lines formed in the dense stellarwind indicate the presence of a gas stream trailing the neutron star in itsorbit. the long-term behaviour of the h alpha equivalent width exhibits strongvariations in wind strength; the sampling of the data is insufficient toconclude whether a relation exists between wind mass-loss rate and pulsar spinperiod.

astro-ph;0611903	a brown dwarf desert for intermediate mass stars in sco ob2?	we present jhk observations of 22 intermediate-mass stars in sco ob2,obtained with vlt/naco. the survey was performed to determine the status of(sub)stellar candidate companions of a and late-b members. the distinctionbetween companions and background stars is by a comparison with isochrones andstatistical arguments. we are sensitive to companions in the separation range0.1''-11'' (13-1430 au) and k&lt;17. we detect 62 secondaries of which 18 arephysical companions (3 new), 11 candidates, and 33 background stars. thecompanion masses are in the range 0.03&lt;m&lt;1.19 msun, with mass ratios0.06&lt;q&lt;0.55. we include in our sample a subset of 9 targets with multi-coloradonis observations from kouwenhoven et al. (2005). in the adonis surveysecondaries with k&lt;12 were classified as companions; those with k&gt;12 asbackground stars. our multi-color analysis demonstrates that the simple k=12criterion correctly classifies the secondaries in ~80% of the cases. wereanalyse the total adonis/naco sample and conclude that of the 176secondaries, 25 are physical companions, 55 are candidates, and 96 arebackground stars. although we are sensitive and complete to brown dwarfs asfaint as k=14 in the separation range 130-520 au, we detect only one, giving abrown dwarf companion fraction of 0.5% (m&gt;30 mj). however, the number of browndwarfs is consistent with an extrapolation of the stellar companion massdistribution. this indicates that the physical mechanism for the formation ofbrown dwarfs around intermediate mass stars is similar to that of stellarcompanions, and that the embryo ejection mechanism does not need to be invokedin order to explain the small number of brown dwarf companions among thesestars.

astro-ph;9505070	spectroscopy of hd 77581 and the mass of vela x-1	we present new high-resolution, high signal-to-noise optical spectra of hd77581, the optical counterpart of the x-ray source vela x-1, and determineradial velocities from these spectra, as well as from high-resolution iuespectra and from digitized photographic spectra. the measured velocities showstrong deviations from a pure keplerian radial-velocity curve, which areautocorrelated within one night, but not from one night to another. since linesof different ions exhibit very similar changes in profile, these deviationsmost likely reflect large-scale motions of the stellar surface akin tonon-radial pulsations. a possible cause could be that the varying tidal forceexerted by the neutron star in its eccentric orbit excites high-order pulsationmodes in the optical star which interfere constructively for short timeintervals. the effect of such velocity excursions on the orbital solution isestimated by means of a monte-carlo simulation technique. we investigatesources of systematic error, due to, e.g., the tidal deformation of the star,and find, in particular, evidence for a systematic perturbation of the radialvelocity near the time of velocity minimum. this possible distortion severelycompromises the accuracy of the radial-velocity amplitude, leading to a 95\%confidence range of 18.0--28.2\,\kms. the corresponding 95\% confidence limitsof the masses are given by $\mx=1.9_{-0.5}^{+0.7}\,\msun$ and$\mopt=23.5_{-1.5}^{+2.2}\,\msun$.

astro-ph;9812427	long- and short-term variability in o-star winds ii. quantitative  analysis of dac behaviour	a quantitative analysis of time series of ultraviolet spectra from a sampleof 10 bright o-type stars (cf. kaper et al. 1996, paper i) is presented. themigrating discrete absorption components (dacs), responsible for the observedvariability in the uv resonance doublets, are modeled. it turns out that thecolumn density of a dac first increases and subsequently decreases with timewhen the component is approaching its asymptotic velocity. in some cases thisvelocity systematically differs from event to event. the recurrence timescaleof dacs is derived for most targets, and consistent results are obtained fordifferent spectral lines. the dac recurrence timescale is interpreted as aninteger fraction of the stellar rotation period. in some datasets thevariability in the blue edge of the p cygni lines exhibits a longer period thanthe dac variability. this might be related to the systematic difference inasymptotic velocity of successive dacs. the phase diagram for the o giant xipersei shows clear evidence for so-called ``phase bowing'', which is anobservational indication for the presence of curved wind structures likecorotating interaction regions. no other o stars in our sample convincinglyshow phase bowing, but this could be simply due to the absence of periodicsignal and hence coherent phase behaviour at low wind velocities.

0811.2859	exploring the consequences of pairing algorithms for binary stars	knowledge of the binary population in stellar groupings provides importantinformation about the outcome of the star forming process in differentenvironments (see, e.g., blaauw 1991, and references therein). binarity is alsoa key ingredient in stellar population studies, and is a prerequisite tocalibrate the binary evolution channels. in this paper we present an overviewof several commonly used methods to pair individual stars into binary systems,which we refer to as pairing functions. these pairing functions are frequentlyused by observers and computational astronomers, either for their mathematicalconvenience, or because they roughly describe the expected outcome of the starforming process. we discuss the consequences of each pairing function for theinterpretation of observations and numerical simulations. the binary fractionand mass ratio distribution generally depend strongly on the selection of therange in primary spectral type in a sample. the mass ratio distribution andbinary fraction derived from a binarity survey among a mass-limited sample oftargets is thus not representative for the population as a whole. neithertheory nor observations indicate that random pairing of binary components fromthe mass distribution, the simplest pairing function, is realistic. it is morelikely that companion stars are formed in a disk around a star, or that apre-binary core fragments into two binary components. the results of ouranalysis are important for (i) the interpretation of the observed mass ratiodistribution and binary fraction for a sample of stars, (ii) a range ofpossible initial condition algorithms for star cluster simulations, and (iii)how to discriminate between the different star formation scenarios.
