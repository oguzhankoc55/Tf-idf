0902.0365	tracing the young massive high-eccentricity binary system theta 1  orionis c through periastron passage	the nearby high-mass star binary system theta 1 orionis c is the brightestand most massive of the trapezium ob stars at the core of the orion nebulacluster, and it represents a perfect laboratory to determine the fundamentalparameters of young hot stars and to constrain the distance of the oriontrapezium cluster. between january 2007 and march 2008, we observed t1oric withvlti/amber near-infrared (h- and k-band) long-baseline interferometry, as wellas with bispectrum speckle interferometry with the eso 3.6m and the bta 6mtelescopes (b'- and v'-band). combining amber data taken with three different3-telescope array configurations, we reconstructed the first vlti/amberclosure-phase aperture synthesis image, showing the t1oric system with aresolution of approx. 2 mas. to extract the astrometric data from ourspectrally dispersed amber data, we employed a new algorithm, which fits thewavelength-differential visibility and closure phase modulations along the h-and k-band and is insensitive to calibration errors induced, for instance, bychanging atmospheric conditions. our new astrometric measurements show that thecompanion has nearly completed one orbital revolution since its discovery in1997. the derived orbital elements imply a short-period (p=11.3 yrs) andhigh-eccentricity orbit (e=0.6) with periastron passage around 2002.6. the neworbit is consistent with recently published radial velocity measurements, fromwhich we can also derive the first direct constraints on the mass ratio of thebinary components. we employ various methods to derive the system mass(m_system=44+/-7 m_sun) and the dynamical distance (d=410+/-20 pc), which is inremarkably good agreement with recently published trigonometric parallaxmeasurements obtained with radio interferometry.

0904.1822	a new spectroscopic and interferometric study of the young stellar  object v645 cyg	we present the results of high-resolution optical spectroscopy,low-resolution near-ir spectroscopy and near-infrared speckle interferometry ofthe massive young stellar object candidate v645 cyg, acquired to refine itsfundamental parameters and the properties of its circumstellar envelope.speckle interferometry in the $h$- and $k$-bands and an optical spectrum in therange 5200--6680 \aa with a spectral resolving power of $r$ = 60 000 wereobtained at the 6-m telescope of the russian academy of sciences. anotheroptical spectrum in the range 4300--10500 \aa with $r$ = 79 000 was obtained atthe 3.6-m cfht. low-resolution spectra in the ranges 0.46--1.4 $\mu$m and1.4--2.5 $\mu$m with $r \sim$ 800 and $\sim$ 700, respectively, were obtainedat the 3-m shane telescope of the lick observatory. using a novel kinematicalmethod based on the non-linear modeling of the neutral hydrogen density profilein the direction toward the object, we propose a distance of $d = 4.2\pm$0.2kpc. we also suggest a revised estimate of the star's effective temperature,t$_{\rm eff} \sim$25 000 k. we resolved the object in both $h$- and $k$-bands.we conclude that v645 cyg is a young, massive, main-sequence star, whichrecently emerged from its cocoon and has already experienced its protostellaraccretion stage. the presence of accretion is not necessary to account for thehigh observed luminosity of (2--6)$\times 10^4$ m$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. thereceding part of a strong, mostly uniform outflow with a terminal velocity of$\sim$800 km s$^{-1}$ is only blocked from view far from the star, whereforbidden lines form.

0906.4792	spatially resolving the inhomogeneous structure of the dynamical  atmosphere of betelgeuse with vlti/amber	we present spatially resolved high-spectral resolution k-band observations ofthe red supergiant betelgeuse (alpha ori) using amber at the very largetelescope interferometer (vlti). betelgeuse was observed between 2.28 and 2.31micron using baselines of 16, 32, and 48m with spectral resolutions of 4800 --12000. spectrally dispersed interferograms have been obtained in the 2nd, 3rd,and 5th lobes, which represents the highest spatial resolution (9 mas) achievedfor betelgeuse, corresponding to 5 resolution elements over its stellar disk.the amber data in the continuum can be reasonably fitted by a uniform disk witha diameter of 43.19+/-0.03 mas or a limb-darkening disk with 43.56+/-0.06 mas.the k-band interferometric data taken at various epochs suggest that betelgeuseseen in the continuum shows much smaller deviations from the aboveuniform/limb-darkened disk than predicted by 3-d convection simulations. on theother hand, our amber data in the co lines reveal that the blue and red wingsof the co lines originate in spatially distinct regions over the stellar disk,indicating an inhomogeneous velocity field. our amber data in the co lines canbe roughly explained by a simple model, in which a patch of co gas is movingoutward or inward at velocities of 10--15 km s^-1, while the co gas in theremaining region in the atmosphere is moving in the opposite direction at thesame velocities. the amber data are also consistent with the presence of warmmolecular layers at ~1.4--1.5 rstar with a co column density of ~1 x 10^20cm^-2. our amber observations of betelgeuse are the first spatially resolvedstudy of the so-called macroturbulence in a stellar atmosphere other than thesun. the spatially resolved co gas motion is likely to be related to convectivemotion or intermittent mass ejections in clumps or arcs.

0909.4688	resolving the asymmetric inner wind region of the yellow hypergiant  irc+10420 with vlti/amber in low and high spectral resolution mode	we obtained near-infrared long-baseline interferometry of irc+10420 with theamber instrument of eso's very large telescope interferometer (vlti) in low andhigh spectral resolution (hr) mode to probe the photosphere and the innermostcircumstellar environment of this rapidly evolving yellow hypergiant. in the hrobservations, the visibilities show a noticeable drop across the brackett gamma(brg) line on all three baselines, and we found differential phases up to -25degrees in the redshifted part of the brg line and a non-zero closure phaseclose to the line center. the calibrated visibilities were corrected foramber's limited field-of-view to appropriately account for the fluxcontribution of irc+10420's extended dust shell. we derived fwhm gaussian sizesof 1.05 +/- 0.07 and 0.98 +/- 0.10 mas for irc+10420's continuum-emittingregion in the h and k bands, respectively, and the brg-emitting region can befitted with a geometric ring model with a diameter of 4.18 +0.19/-0.09 mas,which is approximately 4 times the stellar size. the geometric model alsoprovides some evidence that the brg line-emitting region is elongated towards aposition angle of 36 degrees, well aligned with the symmetry axis of the outerreflection nebula. the hr observations were further analyzed by means ofradiative transfer modeling using cmfgen and the 2-d busche &amp; hillier codes.our spherical cmfgen model poorly reproduces the observed line shape,blueshift, and extension, definitively showing that the irc+10420 outflow isasymmetric. our 2-d radiative transfer modeling shows that the blueshifted brgemission and the shape of the visibility across the emission line can beexplained with an asymmetric bipolar outflow with a high density contrast frompole to equator (8-16), where the redshifted light is substantially diminished.

0911.3653	revealing the sub-au asymmetries of the inner dust rim in the disk  around the herbig ae star r cra	models predict that in the innermost au of the disk around herbig ae/be star,the dust disk forms a "puffed-up" inner rim, which should result in a stronglyasymmetric brightness distribution for disks seen under intermediateinclination. using the vlti/amber long-baseline interferometer, we obtained 24near-infrared (h- and k-band) spectro-interferometric observations on theherbig ae star r cra. in the derived visibility function, we detect thesignatures of an extended (25 mas) and a compact component (5.8 mas), with thecompact component contributing about 2/3 of the total flux. the brightnessdistribution is highly asymmetric, as indicated by the strong closure phases(up to 40 deg) and the detected position angle dependence of the visibilitiesand closure phases. to interpret these asymmetries, we employ geometric as wellas physical models, including a binary model, a skewed ring model, and apuffed-up inner rim model with a vertical or curved rim shape. our curvedpuffed-up rim model can reasonably well reproduce the interferometricobservables and the sed simultaneously and suggests a luminosity of 29 l_sunand the presence of relatively large (&gt; 1.2 micron) silicate dust grains.perpendicular to the disk, two bow shock-like structures appear in theassociated reflection nebula ngc 6729, suggesting that the resolved sub-au sizedisk is the driving engine of a large-scale outflow. detecting, for the firsttime, strong non-localized asymmetries in the inner regions of a herbig aedisk, our study supports the existence of a puffed-up inner rim in yso disks.

0911.4363	strong near-infrared emission in the sub-au disk of the herbig ae star  hd163296: evidence for refractory dust?	we present new long-baseline spectro-interferometric observations of theherbigae star hd163296 obtained in the h and k bands with the amber instrumentat vlti. the observations cover a range of spatial resolutions between 3 and 12milli-arcseconds, with a spectral resolution of ~30. with a total of 1481visibilities and 432 closure phases, they result in the best (u,v) coverageachieved on a young star so far. the circumstellar material is resolved at thesub-au spatial scale and closure phase measurements indicate a small butsignificant deviation from point-symmetry. we discuss the results assuming thatthe near-infrared excess in hd163296 is dominated by the emission of acircumstellar disk. a successful fit to the spectral energy distribution,near-infrared visibilities and closure phases is found with a model where adominant contribution to the h and k band emissions arises from an opticallythin, smooth and point-symmetric region extending from about 0.1 to 0.45 au. atthe latter distance from the star, silicates condense, the disk becomesoptically thick and develops a puffed-up rim, whose skewed emission can accountfor the non-zero closure phases. we discuss the nature of the inner diskemission and tentatively rule out dense molecular gas as well as optically thinatomic or ionized gas as its possible origin. we propose instead that the inneremission traces the presence of very refractory grains in a partially clearedregion, extending at least to 0.5 au. if so, we may be observing the disk ofhd163296 just before it reaches the transition disk phase. however, we notethat the nature of the refractory grains or even the possibility for any grainto survive at the very high temperatures we require (~2100-2300 k at 0.1 aufrom the star) is unclear and should be investigated further.

1007.0682	the 2008 outburst in the young stellar system zcma: i. evidence of an  enhanced bipolar wind on the au-scale	accretion is a fundamental process in star formation. although the timeevolution of accretion remains a matter of debate, observations and modellingstudies suggest that episodic outbursts of strong accretion may dominate theformation of the protostar. observing young stellar objects during theseelevated accretion states is crucial to understanding the origin of unsteadyaccretion. zcma is a pre-main-sequence binary system composed of an embeddedherbig be star, undergoing photometric outbursts, and a fu orionis star. theherbig be component recently underwent its largest optical photometric outburstdetected so far. we aim to constrain the origin of this outburst by studyingthe emission region of the hi brackett gamma line, a powerful tracer ofaccretion/ejection processes on the au-scale in young stars. using theamber/vlti instrument at spectral resolutions of 1500 and 12 000, we performedspatially and spectrally resolved interferometric observations of the hot gasemitting across the brackett gamma emission line, during and after theoutburst. from the visibilities and differential phases, we derivecharacteristic sizes for the brackett gamma emission and spectro-astrometricmeasurements across the line, with respect to the continuum. we find that theline profile, the astrometric signal, and the visibilities are inconsistentwith the signature of either a keplerian disk or infall of matter. they are,instead, evidence of a bipolar wind, maybe partly seen through a disk holeinside the dust sublimation radius. the disappearance of the brackett gammaemission line after the outburst suggests that the outburst is related to aperiod of strong mass loss rather than a change of the extinction along theline of sight. based on these conclusions, we speculate that the origin of theoutburst is an event of enhanced mass accretion, similar to those occuring inex ors and fu ors.

1101.3695	vlti/amber spectro-interferometry of the herbig be star mwc 297 with  spectral resolution 12 000	circumstellar disks and outflows play a fundamental role in star formation.infrared spectro-interferometry allows the inner accretion-ejection region tobe resolved. we measured interferometric visibilities, wavelength-differentialphases, and closure phases of mwc 297 with a spectral resolution of 12000. tointerpret our mwc 297 observations, we employed disk-wind models. the measuredcontinuum visibilities confirm previous results that the continuum-emittingregion of mwc 297 is remarkably compact. we derive a continuum ring-fit radiusof ~2.2 mas (~0.56 au at a distance of 250 pc), which is ~5.4 times smallerthan the 3 au dust sublimation radius expected for silicate grains (in theabsence of radiation-shielding material). the strongly wavelength-dependent andasymmetric br gamma-emitting region is more extended (~2.7 times) than thecontinuum-emitting region. at the center of the br gamma line, we derive agaussian fit radius of ~6.3 mas hwhm (~1.6 au). to interpret the observations,we employ a magneto-centrifugally driven disk-wind model consisting of anaccretion disk, which emits the observed continuum radiation, and a disk wind,which emits the br gamma line. the calculated wavelength-dependent modelintensity distributions and br gamma line profiles are compared with theobservations (i.e., k-band spectrum, visibilities, differential phases, andclosure phases). the closest fitting model predicts a continuum-emitting diskwith an inner radius of ~0.3 au and a disk wind ejection region with an innerradius of ~0.5 au (~17.5 stellar radii). we obtain a disk-wind half-openingangle (the angle between the rotation axis and the innermost streamline of thedisk wind) of ~80 degrees, which is larger than in t tau models, and a diskinclination angle of ~20 degrees (i.e., almost pole-on).

1104.0905	constraining the structure of the planet-forming region in the disk of  the herbig be star hd 100546	studying the physical conditions in circumstellar disks is a crucial steptoward understanding planet formation. of particular interest is the case of hd100546, a herbig be star that presents a gap within the first 13 au of itsprotoplanetary disk, that may originate in the dynamical interactions of aforming planet. we gathered a large amount of new interferometric data usingthe amber/vlti instrument in the h- and k-bands to spatially resolve the warminner disk and constrain its structure. then, combining these measurements withphotometric observations, we analyze the circumstellar environment of hd 100546in the light of a passive disk model based on 3d monte-carlo radiativetransfer. finally, we use hydrodynamical simulations of gap formation byplanets to predict the radial surface density profile of the disk and test thehypothesis of ongoing planet formation. the sed and the nir interferometricdata are adequately reproduced by our model. we show that the h- and k-bandemissions are coming mostly from the inner edge of the internal dust disk,located near 0.24 au from the star, i.e., at the dust sublimation radius in ourmodel. we directly measure an inclination of $33^{\circ} \pm 11^{\circ}$ and aposition angle of $140^{\circ} \pm 16^{\circ}$ for the inner disk. this issimilar to the values found for the outer disk ($i \simeq 42^{\circ}$, $pa\simeq 145^{\circ}$), suggesting that both disks may be coplanar. we finallyshow that 1 to 8 jupiter mass planets located at $\sim 8$ au from the starwould have enough time to create the gap and the required surface density jumpof three orders of magnitude between the inner and outer disk. however, noinformation on the amount of matter left in the gap is available, whichprecludes us from setting precise limits on the planet mass, for now.

1104.0958	imaging the dynamical atmosphere of the red supergiant betelgeuse in the  co first overtone lines with vlti/amber	we present the first 1-d aperture synthesis imaging of the red supergiantbetelgeuse in the individual co first overtone lines with vlti/amber. thereconstructed 1-d projection images reveal that the star appears differently inthe blue wing, line center, and red wing of the individual co lines. the 1-dprojection images in the blue wing and line center show a pronounced,asymmetrically extended component up to ~1.3 stellar radii, while those in thered wing do not show such a component. the observed 1-d projection images inthe lines can be reasonably explained by a model in which the co gas within aregion more than half as large as the stellar size is moving slightly outwardwith 0--5 km s^-1, while the gas in the remaining region is infalling fast with20--30 km s^-1. a comparison between the co line amber data taken in 2008 and2009 shows a significant time variation in the dynamics of the co line-formingregion in the photosphere and the outer atmosphere. in contrast to the linedata, the reconstructed 1-d projection images in the continuum show only aslight deviation from a uniform disk or limb-darkened disk. we derive auniform-disk diameter of 42.05 +/- 0.05 mas and a power-law-type limb-darkeneddisk diameter of 42.49 +/- 0.06 mas and a limb-darkening parameter of (9.7 +/-0.5) x 10^{-2}. this latter angular diameter leads to an effective temperatureof 3690 +/- 54 k for the continuum-forming layer. these diameters confirm thatthe near-ir size of betelgeuse was nearly constant over the last 18 years, inmarked contrast to the recently reported noticeable decrease in the mid-irsize. the continuum data taken in 2008 and 2009 reveal no or only marginal timevariations, much smaller than the maximum variation predicted by the current3-d convection simulations.

1111.5987	spatially resolving the outer atmosphere of the m giant bk vir in the co  first overtone lines with vlti/amber	the mass-loss mechanism in normal k--m giant stars with small variabilityamplitudes is not yet understood, although they are the majority among redgiant stars. we present high-spatial and high-spectral resolution observationsof the 2.3 micron co lines in the m7 giant bk vir with a spatial resolution of9.8 mas and a spectral resolution of 12000, using amber at the very largetelescope interferometer (vlti). the angular diameters observed in the co linesare 12--31% larger than those measured in the continuum. we also detectedasymmetry in the co line-forming region. the data taken 1.5 months apart showpossible time variation on a spatial scale of 30 mas (corresponding to 3 xstellar diameter) at the co band head. comparison of the observed data with themarcs photospheric model shows that whereas the observed co line spectrum canbe well reproduced by the model, the angular sizes observed in the co lines aremuch larger than predicted by the model. our model with two additional colayers above the marcs photosphere reproduces the observed spectrum andinterferometric data in the co lines simultaneously. this model suggests thatthe inner co layer at ~1.2 stellar radii is very dense and warm with a cocolumn density of ~10^{22} cm^{-2} and temperatures of 1900--2100k, while theouter co layer at 2.5--3.0 stellar radii is characterized by column densitiesof 10^{19}--10^{20} cm^{-2} and temperatures of 1500--2100k. our amberobservations of bk vir have spatially resolved the extended molecular outeratmosphere of a normal m giant in the individual co lines for the first time.the temperatures derived for the co layers are higher than or equal to theuppermost layer of the marcs photospheric model, implying the operation of someheating mechanism in the outer atmosphere.

1204.2823	the complexity of parsec-scaled dusty tori in agn	warm gas and dust surround the innermost regions of active galactic nuclei(agn). they provide the material for accretion onto the super-massive blackhole and they are held responsible for the orientation-dependent obscuration ofthe central engine. the agn-heated dust distributions turn out to be verycompact with sizes on scales of about a parsec in the mid-infrared. onlyinfrared interferometry currently provides the necessary angular resolution todirectly study the physical properties of this dust. size estimates for thedust distributions derived from interferometric observations can be used toconstruct a size--luminosity relation for the dust distributions. the largescatter about this relation suggests significant differences between the dusttori in the individual galaxies, even for nuclei of the same class of objectsand with similar luminosities. this questions the simple picture of the samedusty doughnut in all agn. the circinus galaxy is the closest seyfert 2 galaxy.because its mid-infrared emission is well resolved interferometrically, it is aprime target for detailed studies of its nuclear dust distribution. anextensive new interferometric data set was obtained for this galaxy. it showsthat the dust emission comes from a very dense, disk-like structure which issurrounded by a geometrically thick, similarly warm dust distribution as wellas significant amounts of warm dust within the ionisation cone.

1206.6252	amber and crires observations of the binary sgb[e] star hd 327083:  evidence of a gaseous disc traced by co bandhead emission	hd 327083 is a sgb[e] star that forms a binary system with an orbitalsemi-major axis of ~1.7 au. our previous observations using the vlti and amberin the medium resolution k-band mode spatially resolved the environment of hd327083. the continuum visibilities obtained indicate the presence of acircumbinary disc. co bandhead emission was also observed. however, due to thelimited spectral resolution of the previous observations, the kinematicstructure of the emitting material was not constrained. in this paper, weaddress this and probe the source of the co emission with high spectralresolution and spatial precision. we have observed hd 327083 with high spectralresolution (25 &amp; 6 km/s) using amber and crires. the observations are comparedto kinematical models to constrain the source of the emission. it is shown thatthe co bandhead emission can be reproduced using a model of a keplerian discwith an inclination and size consistent with our previous vlti observations.the model is compared to amber differential phase measurements, which have aprecision as high as 30-micro-arcseconds. a differential phase signalcorresponding to 0.15 milli-arcseconds (~5 sigma) is seen over the bandheademission, which is in excellent agreement with the model that fits the criresobservations. in comparison, a model of an equatorial outflow, as envisaged inthe standard sgb[e] scenario, does not reproduce the observations well. theexcellent agreement between the disc model and observations in the spatial andspectral domains is compelling evidence that the co bandhead emission of hd327083 originates in a circumbinary keplerian disc. in contrast, the model ofan equatorial outflow cannot reproduce the observations well. this suggeststhat the standard sgb[e] scenario is not applicable to hd 327083, whichsupports the hypothesis that the b[e] behaviour of hd 327083 is due to binarity(abridged).

1301.0276	pre-main-sequence binaries with tidally disrupted discs: the br gamma in  hd 104237	active pre-main-sequence binaries with separations of around ten stellarradii present a wealth of phenomena unobserved in common systems. the study ofthese objects is extended from classical t tauri stars to the herbig ae star hd104237. spectro-interferometry with the vlti/amber is presented.  it is found that the k-band continuum squared visibilities are compatiblewith a circumbinary disc with a radius of ~0.5 au. however, a significantfraction (~50 per cent) of the flux is unresolved and not fully accounted bythe stellar photospheres. the stars probably don't hold circumstellar discs, inaddition to the circumbinary disk, due to the combined effects of innermagnetospheric truncation and outer tidal truncation. this unresolved fluxlikely arises in compact structures inside the tidally disrupted circumbinarydisc.  most ($\gtrsim 90$ per cent) of the br gamma line emission is unresolved. theline-to-continuum spectro-astrometry shifts in time, along the direction of thely alpha jet known to be driven by the system. the shift is anti-correlatedwith the br gamma equivalent width. it is shown that the unresolved br gammaemission cannot originate in the jet but instead is compatible with stellaremission from the orbiting binary components. the increase in the absolutevalue of the equivalent width of the line takes place at periastron passage; itcould arise in an accretion burst, a flare or in the increase in effective sizeof the emission region by the interaction of the magnetospheres. the binarylongitude of the ascending node is found to be $\omega=(235\pm3)\degr$ and theorbit retrograde.  the origin of the jet is revisited. the tidal disruption of the circumstellardisks creates difficulties to ejection models that rely on stellarmagnetosphere and disc coupling. a scenario of a stellar wind collimated by acircumbinary disc wind is suggested.

1302.6749	spatially resolved h_2 emission from a very low-mass star	molecular outflows from very low-mass stars (vlmss) and brown dwarfs havebeen studied very little. so far, only a few co outflows have been observed,allowing us to map the immediate circumstellar environment. we present thefirst spatially resolved h2 emission around irs54 (ylw52), a ~0.1-0.2 msunclass i source. by means of vlt sinfoni k-band observations, we probed the h2emission down to the first ~50 au from the source. the molecular emission showsa complex structure delineating a large outflow cavity and an asymmetricmolecular jet. thanks to the detection of several h2 transitions, we are ableto estimate average values along the jet-like structure (from source positionto knot d) of av~28 mag, t~2000-3000 k, and h2 column density n(h2)~1.7x10^17cm^-2. this allows us to estimate a mass loss rate of ~2x10^-10 msun/yr for thewarm h2 component . in addition, from the total flux of the br gamma line, weinfer an accretion luminosity and mass accretion rate of 0.64 lsun and ~3x10^-7msun/yr, respectively. the outflow structure is similar to those found inlow-mass class i and ctts. however, the lacc/lbol ratio is very high (~80%),and the mass accretion rate is about one order of magnitude higher whencompared to objects of roughly the same mass, pointing to the young nature ofthe investigated source.

1304.6267	lbt/lucifer near-infrared spectroscopy of pv cephei. an outbursting  young stellar object with an asymmetric jet	we present a detailed spectroscopic investigation of the young eruptive starpv cep, to improve our understanding of its nature and characterise itscircumstellar environment after its last outburst in 2004. the analysis of ourmedium-resolution spectroscopy in the near-ir (0.9-2.35 um), collected in 2012at the large binocular telescope with the ir spectrograph lucifer, allows us toinfer the main stellar parameters (visual extinction, accretion luminosity,mass accretion and ejection rates), and model the inner disc, jet, and wind.the nir spectrum displays several strong emission lines associated withaccretion/ejection activity and circumstellar environment. our analysis showsthat the brightness of pv cep is fading, as well as the mass accretion rate(2x10^-7 msun/yr^-1 in 2012 vs ~5x10^-6 msun/yr^-1 in 2004), which is more thanone order of magnitude lower than in the outburst phase. among the severalemission lines, only the [feii] intensity increased after the outburst. theobserved [feii] emission delineates blue- and red-shifted lobes, both withhigh- and low-velocity components, which trace an asymmetric jet and wind,respectively. the observed emission in the jet has a dynamical age of ~8 years,indicating that it was produced during the last outburst. the mass ejectionrate in both lobes is 1.5x10^-7 msun/yr^-1, approximately matching the highaccretion rate observed during and immediately after the outburst . theobserved jet/outflow asymmetries are consistent with an inhomogeneous medium.our modelling of the co emission hints at a small-scale gaseous disc ring,extending from ~0.2-0.4 au to ~3 au from the source, with an inner temperatureof ~3000 k. our hi lines modelling indicates that most of the observed emissioncomes from an expanding disc wind at te=10000 k. the line profiles are stronglyaffected by scattering, disc screening, and outflow self-absorption.

1312.4534	the dusty torus in the circinus galaxy: a dense disk and the torus  funnel	(abridged) with infrared interferometry it is possible to resolve the nucleardust distributions that are commonly associated with the dusty torus in activegalactic nuclei (agn). the circinus galaxy hosts the closest seyfert 2 nucleusand previous interferometric observations have shown that its nuclear dustemission is well resolved.  to better constrain the dust morphology in this active nucleus, extensive newobservations were carried out with midi at the very large telescopeinterferometer.  the emission is distributed in two distinct components: a disk-like emissioncomponent with a size of ~ 0.2 $\times$ 1.1 pc and an extended component with asize of ~ 0.8 $\times$ 1.9 pc. the disk-like component is elongated along pa ~46{\deg} and oriented perpendicular to the ionisation cone and outflow. theextended component is elongated along pa ~ 107{\deg}, roughly perpendicular tothe disk component and thus in polar direction. it is interpreted as emissionfrom the inner funnel of an extended dust distribution and shows a strongincrease in the extinction towards the south-east. we find no evidence of anincrease in the temperature of the dust towards the centre. from this we inferthat most of the near-infrared emission probably comes from parsec scales aswell. we further argue that the disk component alone is not sufficient toprovide the necessary obscuration and collimation of the ionising radiation andoutflow. the material responsible for this must instead be located on scales of~ 1 pc, surrounding the disk.  the clear separation of the dust emission into a disk-like emitter and apolar elongated source will require an adaptation of our current understandingof the dust emission in agn. the lack of any evidence of an increase in thedust temperature towards the centre poses a challenge for the picture of acentrally heated dust distribution.

astro-ph;0004184	gi2t/regain spectro-interferometry with a new infrared beam combiner	we have built an infrared beam combiner for the gi2t/regain interferometer ofthe observatoire de la cote d'azur. the beam combiner allows us to recordspectrally dispersed michelson interference fringes in the near-infrared j-, h-or k-bands. the beam combiner has the advantage that michelson interferogramscan simultaneously be recorded in about 128 different spectral channels. thetilt of the spectrally dispersed fringes is a measure of the instantaneousoptical path difference. we present the optical design of the beam combiner andgi2t/regain observations of the mira star r cas with this beam combiner in thespectral range of 2.00 micron - 2.18 micron (observations on 22 and 25 august1999; variability phase 0.08; v-magnitude approx. 6; seven baselines between12m and 24m; reference stars vega and beta peg). the spectrograph of the beamcombiner consists of an anamorphotic cylindrical lens system, an image planeslit, and a grism. a system of digital signal processors calculates theensemble average power spectrum of the spectrally dispersed michelsoninterferograms and the instantaneous optical path difference error in realtime. from the observed r cas visibilities at baselines 12.0m, 13.8m and 13.9m,a 2.1 micron uniform-disk diameter of 25.3mas +/-3.3mas was derived. theunusually high visibility values at baselines &gt;16m show that the stellarsurface of r cas is more complex than previously assumed. the visibility valuesat baselines &gt;16m can be explained by high-contrast surface structure on thestellar surface of r cas or other types of unexpected center-to-limbvariations. the r cas observations were compared with theoretical mira starmodels yielding a linear rosseland radius of 276rsun +/-66rsun and an effectivetemperature of 2685k+/-238k for r cas at phase 0.08.

astro-ph;0509746	high angular resolution n-band observation of the silicate carbon star  iras08002-3803 with the vlti/midi instrument	we present the results of n-band spectro-interferometric observations of thesilicate carbon star iras08002-3803 with the mid-infrared interferometricinstrument (midi) at the very large telescope interferometer (vlti) of theeuropean southern observatory (eso). the observations were carried out usingtwo unit telescopes (ut2 and ut3) with projected baseline lengths ranging from39 to 47 m. our observations of iras08002-3803 have spatially resolved thedusty environment of a silicate carbon star for the first time and revealed anunexpected wavelength dependence of the angular size in the n band: theuniform-disk diameter is found to be constant and ~36 mas (72 rstar) between 8and 10 micron, while it steeply increases longward of 10 micron to reach ~53mas (106 rstar) at 13 micron. model calculations with our monte carlo radiativetransfer code show that neither spherical shell models nor axisymmetric diskmodels consisting of silicate grains alone can simultaneously explain theobserved wavelength dependence of the visibility and the spectral energydistribution (sed). we propose that the circumstellar environment ofiras08002-3803 may consist of two grain species coexisting in the disk:silicate and a second grain species, for which we consider amorphous carbon,large silicate grains, and metallic iron grains. comparison of the observedvisibilities and sed with our models shows that such disk models can fairly --though not entirely satisfactorily -- reproduce the observed sed and n-bandvisibilities. our midi observations and the radiative transfer calculationslend support to the picture where oxygen-rich material around iras08002-3803 isstored in a circumbinary disk surrounding the carbon-rich primary star and itsputative low-luminosity companion.

astro-ph;0510350	disk and wind interaction in the young stellar object mwc 297 spatially  resolved with vlti/amber	the young stellar object mwc 297 has been observed with the vltinterferometer equipped with the amber instrument. mwc 297 has been spatiallyresolved in the continuum with a visibility of 0.50 as well as in the br gammaemission line where the visibility decrease to a lower value of 0.33. thischange in the visibility with the wavelength can be interpreted by the presenceof an optically thick disk responsible for the visibility in the continuum andof a stellar wind traced by br gamma and whose apparent size is 40% larger. wevalidate this interpretation by building a model of the stellar environmentthat combines a geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disk modelconsisting of gas and dust, and a latitude-dependent stellar wind outflowingabove the disk surface. the continuum emission and visibilities obtained fromthis model are fully consistent with the interferometric amber data. they agreealso with existing optical, near-infrared spectra and other broad-bandnear-infrared interferometric visibilities. a picture emerges in which mwc 297is surrounded by an equatorial flat disk that is possibly still accreting andan outflowing wind which has a much higher velocity in the polar region than atthe equator.

astro-ph;0602494	radiative transfer modeling of three-dimensional clumpy agn tori and its  application to ngc 1068	recent observations of ngc 1068 and other agn support the idea of ageometrically and optically thick dust torus surrounding the centralsupermassive black hole and accretion disk of agn. in type 2 agn, the torus isseen roughly edge-on, leading to obscuration of the central radiation sourceand a silicate absorption feature near 10 micron. while most of the currenttorus models distribute the dust smoothly, there is growing evidence that thedust must be arranged in clouds. we describe a new method for modeling near-and mid-infrared emission of 3-dimensional clumpy tori using monte carlosimulations. we calculate the radiation fields of individual clouds at variousdistances from the agn and distribute these clouds within the torus region. theproperties of the individual clouds and their distribution within the torus aredetermined from a theoretical approach of self-gravitating clouds close to theshear limit in a gravitational potential. we demonstrate that clumpiness in agntori can overcome the problem of over-pronounced silicate features. finally, wepresent model calculations for the prototypical seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 andcompare them to recent high-resolution measurements. our model is able toreproduce both the sed and the interferometric observations of ngc 1068 in thenear- and mid-infrared.

(2003). we compare the measured visibilities with predictionsof the radiative transfer model of hillier et al.
