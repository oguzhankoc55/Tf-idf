0907.1659	cosmological constraints from the clustering of the sloan digital sky  survey dr7 luminous red galaxies	we present the power spectrum of the reconstructed halo density field derivedfrom a sample of luminous red galaxies (lrgs) from the sloan digital sky surveyseventh data release (dr7). the halo power spectrum has a direct connection tothe underlying dark matter power for k &lt;= 0.2 h/mpc, well into the quasi-linearregime. this enables us to use a factor of ~8 more modes in the cosmologicalanalysis than an analysis with kmax = 0.1 h/mpc, as was adopted in the sdssteam analysis of the dr4 lrg sample (tegmark et al. 2006). the observed halopower spectrum for 0.02 &lt; k &lt; 0.2 h/mpc is well-fit by our model: chi^2 = 39.6for 40 degrees of freedom for the best fit lcdm model. we find \omega_m h^2 *(n_s/0.96)^0.13 = 0.141^{+0.009}_{-0.012} for a power law primordial powerspectrum with spectral index n_s and \omega_b h^2 = 0.02265 fixed, consistentwith cmb measurements. the halo power spectrum also constrains the ratio of thecomoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch to an effective distance toz=0.35: r_s/d_v(0.35) = 0.1097^{+0.0039}_{-0.0042}. combining the halo powerspectrum measurement with the wmap 5 year results, for the flat lcdm model wefind \omega_m = 0.289 +/- 0.019 and h_0 = 69.4 +/- 1.6 km/s/mpc. allowing formassive neutrinos in lcdm, we find \sum m_{\nu} &lt; 0.62 ev at the 95% confidencelevel. if we instead consider the effective number of relativistic species neffas a free parameter, we find neff = 4.8^{+1.8}_{-1.7}. combining also with thekowalski et al. (2008) supernova sample, we find \omega_{tot} = 1.011 +/- 0.009and w = -0.99 +/- 0.11 for an open cosmology with constant dark energy equationof state w.

0907.1660	baryon acoustic oscillations in the sloan digital sky survey data  release 7 galaxy sample	the spectroscopic sloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 7 (dr7) galaxysample represents the final set of galaxies observed using the original sdsstarget selection criteria. we analyse the clustering of galaxies within thissample, including both the luminous red galaxy (lrg) and main samples, and alsoinclude the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) data. baryonacoustic oscillations are observed in power spectra measured for differentslices in redshift; this allows us to constrain the distance--redshift relationat multiple epochs. we achieve a distance measure at redshift z=0.275, ofr_s(z_d)/d_v(0.275)=0.1390+/-0.0037 (2.7% accuracy), where r_s(z_d) is thecomoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch,d_v(z)=[(1+z)^2d_a^2cz/h(z)]^(1/3), d_a(z) is the angular diameter distance andh(z) is the hubble parameter. we find an almost independent constraint on theratio of distances d_v(0.35)/d_v(0.2)=1.736+/-0.065, which is consistent at the1.1sigma level with the best fit lambda-cdm model obtained when combining ourz=0.275 distance constraint with the wmap 5-year data. the offset is similar tothat found in previous analyses of the sdss dr5 sample, but the discrepancy isnow of lower significance, a change caused by a revised error analysis and achange in the methodology adopted, as well as the addition of more data. usingwmap5 constraints on omega_bh^2 and omega_ch^2, and combining our bao distancemeasurements with those from the union supernova sample, places a tightconstraint on omega_m=0.286+/-0.018 and h_0 = 68.2+/-2.2km/s/mpc that is robustto allowing curvature and non-lambda dark energy. this result is independent ofthe behaviour of dark energy at redshifts greater than those probed by the baoand supernova measurements.

0908.2598	the baryonic acoustic feature and large-scale clustering in the sdss lrg  sample	we examine the correlation function \xi of the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) luminous red galaxy sample (lrg) at large scales (60&lt;s&lt;400 mpc/h) usingthe final data release (dr7; 105,831 lrgs between 0.16&lt;z&lt;0.47). using mockcatalogs, we demonstrate that the observed baryonic acoustic peak and largerscale signal are consistent with lcdm at the 1.5\sigma level. the signal at155&lt;s&lt;200 mpc/h tends to be high relative to theoretical expectations; thisslight deviation can be attributed to a bright subsample of the lrgs. fittingdata to a non-linear, redshift-space, template based-model, we constrain thepeak position at s_p=103.6+3.6-2.4 mpc/h when fitting the range 60&lt;s&lt;150 mpc/h(1\sigma uncertainties measured from the mocks. this redshift-space distances_p is related to the comoving sound horizon scale r_s after taking intoaccount matter clustering non-linearities, redshift distortions and galaxyclustering bias. mock catalogs show that the probability that a dr7-sizedsample would not have an identifiable peak is at least 10%. as a consistencycheck of a fiducial cosmology, we use the observed s_p to obtain the distanced_v=[(1+z)^2d_a^2cz/h(z)]^(1/3) relative to the acoustic scale. we findr_s/d_v(z=0.278)=0.1394+-0.0049. this result is in excellent agreement withpercival et. al (2009), who examine roughly the same data set, but using thepower spectrum. comparison with other determinations in the literature are alsoin very good agreement. we have tested our results against a battery ofpossible systematic effects, finding all effects are smaller than our estimatedsample variance.

0910.4113	galaxy zoo: passive red spirals	we study the spectroscopic properties and environments of red spiral galaxiesfound by the galaxy zoo project. by carefully selecting face-on, disk dominatedspirals we construct a sample of truly passive disks (not dust reddened, nordominated by old stellar populations in a bulge). as such, our red spiralsrepresent an interesting set of possible transition objects between normal bluespirals and red early types. we use sdss data to investigate the physicalprocesses which could have turned these objects red without disturbing theirmorphology. red spirals prefer intermediate density regimes, however there areno obvious correlations between red spiral properties and environment -environment alone is not sufficient to determine if a spiral will become red.red spirals are a small fraction of spirals at low masses, but are asignificant fraction at large stellar masses - massive galaxies are redindependent of morphology. we confirm that red spirals have older stellar popnsand less recent star formation than the main spiral population. while thepresence of spiral arms suggests that major star formation cannot have ceasedlong ago, we show that these are not recent post-starbursts, so star formationmust have ceased gradually. intriguingly, red spirals are ~4 times more likelythan normal spirals to host optically identified seyfert or liner, with most ofthe difference coming from liners. we find a curiously large bar fraction inthe red spirals suggesting that the cessation of star formation and barinstabilities are strongly correlated. we conclude by discussing the possibleorigins. we suggest they may represent the very oldest spiral galaxies whichhave already used up their reserves of gas - probably aided by strangulation,and perhaps bar instabilities moving material around in the disk.

1001.1744	galaxy zoo: dust in spirals	we investigate the effect of dust on spiral galaxies by measuring theinclination-dependence of optical colours for 24,276 well-resolved sdssgalaxies visually classified in galaxy zoo. we find clear trends of reddeningwith inclination which imply a total extinction from face-on to edge-on of 0.7,0.6, 0.5 and 0.4 magnitudes for the ugri passbands. we split the sample into"bulgy" (early-type) and "disky" (late-type) spirals using the sdss fracdev (orf_dev) parameter and show that the average face-on colour of "bulgy" spirals isredder than the average edge-on colour of "disky" spirals. this shows that theobserved optical colour of a spiral galaxy is determined almost equally by thespiral type (via the bulge-disk ratio and stellar populations), and reddeningdue to dust. we find that both luminosity and spiral type affect the totalamount of extinction, with "disky" spirals at m_r ~ -21.5 mags having the mostreddening. this decrease of reddening for the most luminous spirals has notbeen observed before and may be related to their lower levels of recent starformation. we compare our results with the latest dust attenuation models oftuffs et al. we find that the model reproduces the observed trends reasonablywell but overpredicts the amount of u-band attenuation in edge-on galaxies. weend by discussing the effects of dust on large galaxy surveys and emphasizethat these effects will become important as we push to higher precisionmeasurements of galaxy properties and their clustering.

1011.2481	redshift-space enhancement of line-of-sight baryon acoustic oscillations  in the sdss main-galaxy sample	we show that redshift-space distortions of galaxy correlations have a strongeffect on correlation functions with distinct, localized features, like thesignature of the baryon acoustic oscillations (bao). near the line of sight,the features become sharper as a result of redshift-space distortions. wedemonstrate this effect by measuring the correlation function in gaussiansimulations and the millennium simulation. we also analyze the sdss dr7main-galaxy sample (mgs), splitting the sample into slices 2.5 degrees on thesky in various rotations. measuring 2d correlation functions in each slice, wedo see a sharp bump along the line of sight. using mexican-hat wavelets, welocalize it to (110 +/- 10) mpc/h. averaging only along the line of sight, weestimate its significance at a particular wavelet scale and location at 2.2sigma. in a flat angular weighting in the (pi,r_p) coordinate system, the noiselevel is suppressed, pushing the bump's significance to 4 sigma. we estimatethat there is about a 0.2% chance of getting such a signal anywhere in thevicinity of the bao scale from a power spectrum lacking a bao feature. however,these estimates of the significances make some use of idealized gaussiansimulations, and thus are likely a bit optimistic.

1101.2608	a method to extract the redshift distortions beta parameter in  configuration space from minimal cosmological assumptions	we present a method to extract the redshift-space distortions beta parameterin configuration space with a minimal set of cosmological assumptions. we showthat a novel combination of the observed monopole and quadrupole correlationfunctions can remove efficiently the impact of mild non linearities andredshift errors. the method offers a series of convenient properties: it doesnot depend on the theoretical linear correlation function, the mean galaxydensity is irrelevant, only convolutions are used, there is no explicitdependence on linear bias. analyses based on dark matter n-body simulations andfisher matrix demonstrate that errors of a few percent on beta are possiblewith a full sky, 1(gpc/h)^3 survey centered at a redshift of unity and withnegligible shot noise. we also find a baryonic feature in the normalizedquadrupole in configuration space that should complicate the extraction of thegrowth parameter from the linear theory asymptote, but that does not have amajor impact with our method.

1111.1215	a high resolution atlas of composite sdss galaxy spectra	in this work we present an atlas of composite spectra of galaxies based onthe data of the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 (sdss dr7). galaxiesare classified by colour, nuclear activity and star-formation activity tocalculate average spectra of high signal-to-noise ratio and resolution (s/n =132 - 4760 at {dlambda = 1 a), using an algorithm that is robust againstoutliers. besides composite spectra, we also compute the first five principalcomponents of the distributions in each galaxy class to characterize the natureof variations of individual spectra around the averages. the continua of thecomposite spectra are fitted with bc03 stellar population synthesis models toextend the wavelength coverage beyond the coverage of the sdss spectrographs.common derived parameters of the composites are also calculated: integratedcolours in the most popular filter systems, line strength measurements, andcontinuum absorption indices (including lick indices). these derived parametersare compared with the distributions of parameters of individual galaxies and itis shown on many examples that the composites of the atlas cover much of theparameter space spanned by sdss galaxies. by co-adding thousands of spectra, atotal integration time of several months can be reached, which results inextremely low noise composites. the variations in redshift not only allow forextending the spectral coverage bluewards to the original wavelength limit ofthe sdss spectrographs, but also make higher spectral resolution achievable.the composite spectrum atlas is available online athttp://www.vo.elte.hu/compositeatlas.

1111.4466	straightening the density-displacement relation with a logarithmic  transform	we investigate the use of a logarithmic density variable in estimating thelagrangian displacement field, motivated by the success of a logarithmictransformation in restoring information to the matter power spectrum. thelogarithmic relation is an extension of the linear relation, motivated by thecontinuity equation, in which the density field is assumed to be proportionalto the divergence of the displacement field; we compare the linear andlogarithmic relations by measuring both of these fields directly in acosmological n-body simulation. the relative success of the logarithmic andlinear relations depends on the scale at which the density field is smoothed.thus we explore several ways of measuring the density field, includingcloud-in-cell smoothing, adaptive smoothing, and the (scale-independent)delaunay tessellation, and we use both a fourier space and a geometricaltessellation approach to measuring the divergence. we find that the relationbetween the divergence of the displacement field and the density issignificantly tighter with a logarithmic density variable, especially at lowredshifts and for very small (~2 mpc/h) smoothing scales. we find that thegrid-based methods are more reliable than the tessellation-based method ofcalculating both the density and the divergence fields, though in both casesthe logarithmic relation works better in the appropriate regime, whichcorresponds to nonlinear scales for the grid-based methods and low densitiesfor the tessellation-based method.

1202.1306	nonlinear behavior of baryon acoustic oscillations from the zel'dovich  approximation using a non-fourier perturbation approach	baryon acoustic oscillations are an excellent technique to constrain theproperties of dark energy in the universe. in order to accurately characterizethe dark energy equation of state, we must understand the effects of both thenonlinearities and redshift space distortions on the location and shape of theacoustic peak. in this paper, we consider these effects using the zel'dovichapproximation and a novel approach to 2nd order perturbation theory. the secondorder term of the zel'dovich power spectrum is built from convolutions of thelinear power spectrum with polynomial kernels in fourier space, suggesting thatthe corresponding term of the the zel'dovich correlation function can bewritten as a sum of quadratic products of a broader class of correlationfunctions, expressed through simple spherical bessel transforms of the linearpower spectrum. we show how to systematically perform such a computation. weexplicitly prove that our result is the fourier transform of the zel'dovichpower spectrum, and compare our expressions to numerical simulations. finally,we highlight the advantages of writing the nonlinear expansion in configurationspace, as this calculation is easily extended to redshift space, and the higherorder terms are mathematically simpler than their fourier counterparts.

1206.5021	skyquery: an implementation of a parallel probabilistic join engine for  cross-identification of multiple astronomical databases	multi-wavelength astronomical studies require cross-identification ofdetections of the same celestial objects in multiple catalogs based onspherical coordinates and other properties. because of the large data volumesand spherical geometry, the symmetric n-way association of astronomicaldetections is a computationally intensive problem, even when sophisticatedindexing schemes are used to exclude obviously false candidates. legacyastronomical catalogs already contain detections of more than a hundred millionobjects while the ongoing and future surveys will produce catalogs of billionsof objects with multiple detections of each at different times. the varyingstatistical error of position measurements, moving and extended objects, andother physical properties make it necessary to perform the cross-identificationusing a mathematically correct, proper bayesian probabilistic algorithm,capable of including various priors. one time, pair-wise cross-identificationof these large catalogs is not sufficient for many astronomical scenarios.consequently, a novel system is necessary that can cross-identify multiplecatalogs on-demand, efficiently and reliably. in this paper, we present oursolution based on a cluster of commodity servers and ordinary relationaldatabases. the cross-identification problems are formulated in a language basedon sql, but extended with special clauses. these special queries arepartitioned spatially by coordinate ranges and compiled into a complex workflowof ordinary sql queries. workflows are then executed in a parallel frameworkusing a cluster of servers hosting identical mirrors of the same data sets.

0711.3640	large-scale anisotropic correlation function of sdss luminous red  galaxies	we study the large-scale anisotropic two-point correlation function using46,760 luminous red galaxies at redshifts 0.16 -- 0.47 from the sloan digitalsky survey. we measure the correlation function as a function of separationsparallel and perpendicular to the line-of-sight in order to take account ofanisotropy of the large-scale structure in redshift space. we find a slightsignal of baryonic features in the anisotropic correlation function, i.e., a``baryon ridge'' which corresponds to a baryon acoustic peak in the sphericallyaveraged correlation function which has already been reported using the samesample. the baryon ridge has primarily a spherical structure with a knownradius in comoving coordinates. it enables us to divide the redshift distortioneffects into dynamical and geometrical components and provides furtherconstraints on cosmological parameters, including the dark energyequation-of-state. with an assumption of a flat $\lambda$ cosmology, we findthe best-fit values of $\omega_{\rm m} = 0.218^{+0.047}_{-0.037}$ and$\omega_{\rm b} = 0.047^{+0.016}_{-0.016}$ (68% c.l.) when we use the overallshape of the anisotropic correlation function of $40&lt;s&lt;200\himpc$ including ascale of baryon acoustic oscillations. when an additional assumption$\omega_{\rm b}h^2=0.024$ is adopted, we obtain $\omega_{\rmde}=0.770^{+0.051}_{-0.040}$ and $w=-0.93^{+0.45}_{-0.35}$. these constraintsare estimated only from our data of the anisotropic correlation function, andthey agree quite well with values both from the cosmic microwave background(cmb) anisotropies and from other complementary statistics using the lrgsample. with the cmb prior from the 3 year wmap results, we give strongerconstraints on those parameters.

1211.3130	removing bao-peak shifts with local density transforms	large-scale bulk flows in the universe distort the initial density field,broadening the baryon-acoustic-oscillation (bao) feature that was imprintedwhen baryons were strongly coupled to photons. additionally, there is a smallshift inward in the peak of the conventional overdensity correlation function,a mass-weighted statistic. this shift occurs when high density peaks movetoward each other. we explore whether this shift can be removed by applying tothe density field a transform (such as a logarithm) that gives fairerstatistical weight to fluctuations in underdense regions. usingconfiguration-space perturbation theory in the zel'dovich approximation, wefind that the log-density correlation function shows a much smaller inwardshift in the position of the bao peak at low redshift than is seen in theoverdensity correlation function. we also show that if the initial, lagrangiandensity of matter parcels could be estimated at their eulerian positions,giving a displaced-initial-density field, its peak shift would be even smaller.in fact, a transformed field that accentuates underdensities, such as thereciprocal of the density, pushes the peak the other way, outward. in ourmodel, these shifts in the peak position can be attributed to shift terms,involving the derivative of the linear correlation function, that entirelyvanish in this displaced-initial-density field.

1308.1440	graywulf: a platform for federated scientific databases and services	many fields of science rely on relational database management systems toanalyze, publish and share data. since rdbms are originally designed for, andtheir development directions are primarily driven by, business use cases theyoften lack features very important for scientific applications. horizontalscalability is probably the most important missing feature which makes itchallenging to adapt traditional relational database systems to the evergrowing data sizes. due to the limited support of array data types and metadatamanagement, successful application of rdbms in science usually requires thedevelopment of custom extensions. while some of these extensions are specificto the field of science, the majority of them could easily be generalized andreused in other disciplines. with the graywulf project we intend to targetseveral goals. we are building a generic platform that offers reusablecomponents for efficient storage, transformation, statistical analysis andpresentation of scientific data stored in microsoft sql server. graywulf alsoaddresses the distributed computational issues arising from current rdbmstechnologies. the current version supports load balancing of simple queries andparallel execution of partitioned queries over a set of mirrored databases.uniform user access to the data is provided through a web based query interfaceand a data surface for software clients. queries are formulated in a slightlymodified syntax of sql that offers a transparent view of the distributed data.the software library consists of several components that can be reused todevelop complex scientific data warehouses: a system registry, administrationtools to manage entire database server clusters, a sophisticated workflowexecution framework, and a sql parser library.

1408.0500	flashgraph: processing billion-node graphs on an array of commodity ssds	graph analysis performs many random reads and writes, thus, these workloadsare typically performed in memory. traditionally, analyzing large graphsrequires a cluster of machines so the aggregate memory exceeds the graph size.we demonstrate that a multicore server can process graphs with billions ofvertices and hundreds of billions of edges, utilizing commodity ssds withminimal performance loss. we do so by implementing a graph-processing engine ontop of a user-space ssd file system designed for high iops and extremeparallelism. our semi-external memory graph engine called flashgraph storesvertex state in memory and edge lists on ssds. it hides latency by overlappingcomputation with i/o. to save i/o bandwidth, flashgraph only accesses edgelists requested by applications from ssds; to increase i/o throughput andreduce cpu overhead for i/o, it conservatively merges i/o requests. thesedesigns maximize performance for applications with different i/ocharacteristics. flashgraph exposes a general and flexible vertex-centricprogramming interface that can express a wide variety of graph algorithms andtheir optimizations. we demonstrate that flashgraph in semi-external memoryperforms many algorithms with performance up to 80% of its in-memoryimplementation and significantly outperforms powergraph, a popular distributedin-memory graph engine.

1408.4648	the redshift-space galaxy two-point correlation function and baryon  acoustic oscillations	future galaxy surveys will measure baryon acoustic oscillations (baos) withhigh significance, and a complete understanding of the anisotropies of baos inredshift space will be important to exploit the cosmological information inbaos. here we describe the anisotropies that arise in the redshift-space galaxytwo-point correlation function (2pcf) and elucidate the origin of features thatarise in the dependence of the baos on the angle between the orientation of thegalaxy pair and the line of sight. we do so with a derivation of theconfiguration-space 2pcf using streaming model. we find that, contrary tocommon belief, the locations of bao peaks in the redshift-space 2pcf areanisotropic even in the linear theory. anisotropies in bao depend strongly onthe method of extracting the peak, showing maximum 3 % angular variation. wealso find that extracting the bao peak of $r^2\xi(r,\mu)$ significantly reducesthe anisotropy to sub-percent level angular variation. when subtracting thetilt due to the broadband behavior of the 2pcf, the bao bump is enhanced alongthe line of sight because of local infall velocities toward the bao bump.precise measurement of the angular dependence of the redshift-space 2pcf willallow new geometrical tests of dark energy beyond the bao.

1501.01556	simulating deep hubble images with semi-empirical models of galaxy  formation	we simulate deep images from the hubble space telescope (hst) usingsemi-empirical models of galaxy formation with only a few basic assumptions andparameters. we project our simulations all the way to the observational domain,adding cosmological and instrumental effects to the images, and analyze them inthe same way as real hst images ("forward modeling"). this is a powerful toolfor testing and comparing galaxy evolution models, since it allows us to makeunbiased comparisons between the predicted and observed distributions of galaxyproperties, while automatically taking into account all relevant selectioneffects.  our semi-empirical models populate each dark matter halo with a galaxy ofdetermined stellar mass and scale radius. we compute the luminosity andspectrum of each simulated galaxy from its evolving stellar mass using stellarpopulation synthesis models. we calculate the intrinsic scatter in the stellarmass-halo mass relation that naturally results from enforcing a monotonicallyincreasing stellar mass along the merger history of each halo. the simulatedgalaxy images are drawn from cutouts of real galaxies from the sloan digitalsky survey, with sizes and fluxes rescaled to match those of the modelgalaxies.  the distributions of galaxy luminosities, sizes, and surface brightnessesdepend on the adjustable parameters in the models, and they agree well withobservations for reasonable values of those parameters. measured galaxymagnitudes and sizes have significant magnitude-dependent biases, with bothbeing underestimated near the magnitude detection limit. the fraction ofgalaxies detected and fraction of light detected also depend sensitively on thedetails of the model.

1506.07566	optimize unsynchronized garbage collection in an ssd array	solid state disks (ssds) have advanced to outperform traditional hard drivessignificantly in both random reads and writes. however, heavy random writestrigger fre- quent garbage collection and decrease the performance of ssds. inan ssd array, garbage collection of individ- ual ssds is not synchronized,leading to underutilization of some of the ssds.  we propose a software solution to tackle the unsyn- chronized garbagecollection in an ssd array installed in a host bus adaptor (hba), whereindividual ssds are exposed to an operating system. we maintain a long i/oqueue for each ssd and flush dirty pages intelligently to fill the long i/oqueues so that we hide the performance imbalance among ssds even when there arefew parallel application writes. we further define a policy of select- ingdirty pages to flush and a policy of taking out stale flush requests to reducethe amount of data written to ssds. we evaluate our solution in a real system.experi- ments show that our solution fully utilizes all ssds in an array underrandom write-heavy workloads. it improves i/o throughput by up to 62% underrandom workloads of mixed reads and writes when ssds are under active garbagecollection. it causes little extra data writeback and increases the cache hitrate.

0805.2612	galaxy zoo: the dependence of morphology and colour on environment	we analyse the relationships between galaxy morphology, colour, environmentand stellar mass using data for over 100,000 objects from galaxy zoo, thelargest sample of visually classified morphologies yet compiled. weconclusively show that colour and morphology fractions are very differentfunctions of environment. both are sensitive to stellar mass; however, at fixedstellar mass, while colour is also highly sensitive to environment, morphologydisplays much weaker environmental trends. only a small part of both relationscan be attributed to variation in the stellar mass function with environment.galaxies with high stellar masses are mostly red, in all environments andirrespective of their morphology. low stellar-mass galaxies are mostly blue inlow-density environments, but mostly red in high-density environments, againirrespective of their morphology. the colour-density relation is primarilydriven by variations in colour fractions at fixed morphology, in particular thefraction of spiral galaxies that have red colours, and especially at lowstellar masses. we demonstrate that our red spirals primarily include galaxieswith true spiral morphology. we clearly show there is an environmentaldependence for colour beyond that for morphology. before using the galaxy zoomorphologies to produce the above results, we first quantify a luminosity-,size- and redshift-dependent classification bias that affects this dataset, andprobably most other studies of galaxy population morphology. a correction forthis bias is derived and applied to produce a sample of galaxies with reliablemorphological type likelihoods, on which we base our analysis.

1507.07824	toward accurate modeling of the nonlinear matter bispectrum: standard  perturbation theory and transients from initial conditions	accurate modeling of nonlinearities in the galaxy bispectrum, the fouriertransform of the galaxy three-point correlation function, is essential to fullyexploit it as a cosmological probe. in this paper, we present numerical andtheoretical challenges in modeling the nonlinear bispectrum. first, we test therobustness of the matter bispectrum measured from n-body simulations usingdifferent initial conditions generators. we run a suite of n-body simulationsusing the zel'dovich approximation and second-order lagrangian perturbationtheory (2lpt) at different starting redshifts, and find that transients frominitial decaying modes systematically reduce the nonlinearities in the matterbispectrum. to achieve 1% accuracy in the matter bispectrum for $z\le3$ onscales $k&lt;1$ $h$/mpc, 2lpt initial conditions generator with initial redshiftof $z\gtrsim100$ is required. we then compare various analytical formulas andempirical fitting functions for modeling the nonlinear matter bispectrum, anddiscuss the regimes for which each is valid. we find that the next-to-leadingorder (one-loop) correction from standard perturbation theory matches withn-body results on quasi-linear scales for $z\ge1$. we find that the fittingformula in gil-mar\'{\i}n et al. (2012) accurately predicts the matterbispectrum for $z\le1$ on a wide range of scales, but at higher redshifts, thefitting formula given in scoccimarro &amp; couchman (2001) gives the best agreementwith measurements from n-body simulations.

0705.3323	measuring the baryon acoustic oscillation scale using the sdss and  2dfgrs	we introduce a method to constrain general cosmological models using baryonacoustic oscillation (bao) distance measurements from galaxy samples coveringdifferent redshift ranges, and apply this method to analyse samples drawn fromthe sdss and 2dfgrs. bao are detected in the clustering of the combined 2dfgrsand sdss main galaxy samples, and measure the distance--redshift relation atz=0.2. bao in the clustering of the sdss luminous red galaxies measure thedistance--redshift relation at z=0.35. the observed scale of the bao calculatedfrom these samples and from the combined sample are jointly analysed usingestimates of the correlated errors, to constrain the form of the distancemeasure d_v(z)=[(1+z)^2d_a^2cz/h(z)]^(1/3). here d_a is the angular diameterdistance, and h(z) is the hubble parameter. this givesr_s/d_v(0.2)=0.1980+/-0.0058 and r_s/d_v(0.35)=0.1094+/-0.0033 (1sigma errors),with correlation coefficient of 0.39, where r_s is the comoving sound horizonscale at recombination. matching the bao to have the same measured scale at allredshifts then gives d_v(0.35)/d_v(0.2)=1.812+/-0.060. the recovered ratio isroughly consistent with that predicted by the higher redshift snls supernovaedata for lambda cosmologies, but does require slightly stronger cosmologicalacceleration at low redshift. if we force the cosmological model to be flatwith constant w, then we find om_m=0.249+/-0.018 and w=-1.004+/-0.089 aftercombining with the snls data, and including the wmap measurement of theapparent acoustic horizon angle in the cmb.

astro-ph;0004314	spectral templates from multicolor redshift surveys	understanding how the physical properties of galaxies (e.g. their spectraltype or age) evolve as a function of redshift relies on having an accuraterepresentation of galaxy spectral energy distributions. while it has been knownfor some time that galaxy spectra can be reconstructed from a handful oforthogonal basis templates, the underlying basis is poorly constrained. thelimiting factor has been the lack of large samples of galaxies (covering a widerange in spectral type) with high signal-to-noise spectrophotometricobservations. to alleviate this problem we introduce here a new technique forreconstructing galaxy spectral energy distributions directly from samples ofgalaxies with broadband photometric data and spectroscopic redshifts.exploiting the statistical approach of the karhunen-loeve expansion, ouriterative training procedure increasingly improves the eigenbasis, so that itprovides better agreement with the photometry. we demonstrate the utility ofthis approach by applying these improved spectral energy distributions to theestimation of photometric redshifts for the hdf sample of galaxies. we findthat in a small number of iterations the dispersion in the photometricredshifts estimator (a comparison between predicted and measured redshifts) candecrease by up to a factor of 2.

astro-ph;0010256	fast cmb analyses via correlation functions	we propose and implement a fast, universally applicable method for extractingthe angular power spectrum c_l from cmb temperature maps by first estimatingthe correlation function \xi(\theta). our procedure recovers the c_l's usingn^2 (but potentially n logn), operations, where n is the number of pixels. thisis in contrast with standard maximum likelihood techniques which require n^3operations. our method makes no special assumptions about the map, unlikepresent fast techniques which rely on symmetries of the underlying noisematrix, sky coverage, scanning strategy, and geometry. this enables for thefirst time the analysis of megapixel maps without symmetries. the key elementof our technique is the accurate multipole decomposition of \xi(\theta). thec_l error bars and cross-correlations are found by a monte-carlo approach. weapplied our technique to a large number of simulated maps with boomerang skycoverage in 81000 pixels. we used a diagonal noise matrix, with approximatelythe same amplitude as boomerang. these studies demonstrate that our techniqueprovides an unbiased estimator of the c_l's. even though our method isapproximate, the error bars obtained are nearly optimal, and converged onlyafter few tens of monte-carlo realizations. our method is directly applicablefor the non-diagonal noise matrix. this, and other generalizations, such asminimum variance weighting schemes, polarization, and higher order statisticsare also discussed.

astro-ph;0106036	photometric redshifts from reconstructed qso templates	from sdss commissioning photometric and spectroscopic data, we investigatethe utility of photometric redshift techniques to the task of estimating qsoredshifts. we consider empirical methods (e.g. nearest-neighbor searches andpolynomial fitting), standard spectral template fitting and hybrid approaches(i.e. training spectral templates from spectroscopic and photometricobservations of qsos). we find that in all cases, due to the presence of strongemission-lines within the qso spectra, the nearest-neighbor and templatefitting methods are superior to the polynomial fitting approach. applying anovel reconstruction technique, we can, from the sdss multicolor photometry,reconstruct a statistical representation of the underlying seds of the sdssqsos. although, the reconstructed templates are based on only broadbandphotometry the common emission lines present within the qso spectra can berecovered in the resulting spectral energy distributions. the technique shouldbe useful in searching for spectral differences among qsos at a given redshift,in searching for spectral evolution of qsos, in comparing photometric redshiftsfor objects beyond the sdss spectroscopic sample with those in the wellcalibrated photometric redshifts for objects brighter than 20th magnitude andin searching for systematic and time variable effects in the sdss broad bandphotometric and spectral photometric calibrations.

astro-ph;0107416	analysis of systematic effects and statistical uncertainties in angular  clustering of galaxies from early sdss data	the angular distribution of galaxies encodes a wealth of information aboutlarge scale structure. ultimately, the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) willrecord the angular positions of order 10^8 galaxies in five bands, addingsignificantly to the cosmological constraints. this is the first in a series ofpapers analyzing a rectangular stripe 2.5x90 degrees from early sdss data. wepresent the angular correlation function for galaxies in four separatemagnitude bins on angular scales ranging from 0.003 degrees to 15 degrees. muchof the focus of this paper is on potential systematic effects. we show that thefinal galaxy catalog -- with the mask accounting for regions of poor seeing,reddening, bright stars, etc. -- is free from external and internal systematiceffects for galaxies brighter than r* = 22. our estimator of the angularcorrelation function includes the effects of the integral constraint and themask. the full covariance matrix of errors in these estimates is derived usingmock catalogs with further estimates using a number of other methods.

astro-ph;0107417	the angular correlation function of galaxies from early sdss data	the sloan digital sky survey is one of the first multicolor photometric andspectroscopic surveys designed to measure the statistical properties ofgalaxies within the local universe. in this letter we present some of theinitial results on the angular 2-point correlation function measured from theearly sdss galaxy data. the form of the correlation function, over themagnitude interval 18&lt;r*&lt;22, is shown to be consistent with results fromexisting wide-field, photographic-based surveys and narrower ccd galaxysurveys. on scales between 1 arcminute and 1 degree the correlation function iswell described by a power-law with an exponent of ~ -0.7. the amplitude of thecorrelation function, within this angular interval, decreases with faintermagnitudes in good agreement with analyses from existing galaxy surveys. thereis a characteristic break in the correlation function on scales ofapproximately 1-2 degrees. on small scales, &lt; 1', the sdss correlation functiondoes not appear to be consistent with the power-law form fitted to the 1'&lt;theta &lt;0.5 deg data. with a data set that is less than 2% of the full sdsssurvey area, we have obtained high precision measurements of the power-lawangular correlation function on angular scales 1' &lt; theta &lt; 1 deg, which arerobust to systematic uncertainties. because of the limited area and the highlycorrelated nature of the error covariance matrix, these initial results do notyet provide a definitive characterization of departures from the power-law format smaller and larger angles. in the near future, however, the area of the sdssimaging survey will be sufficient to allow detailed analysis of the small andlarge scale regimes, measurements of higher-order correlations, and studies ofangular clustering as a function of redshift and galaxy type.

astro-ph;0107419	kl estimation of the power spectrum parameters from the angular  distribution of galaxies in early sdss data	we present measurements of parameters of the 3-dimensional power spectrum ofgalaxy clustering from 222 square degrees of early imaging data in the sloandigital sky survey. the projected galaxy distribution on the sky is expandedover a set of karhunen-loeve eigenfunctions, which optimize the signal-to-noiseratio in our analysis. a maximum likelihood analysis is used to estimateparameters that set the shape and amplitude of the 3-dimensional powerspectrum. our best estimates are gamma=0.188 +/- 0.04 and sigma_8l = 0.915 +/-0.06 (statistical errors only), for a flat universe with a cosmologicalconstant. we demonstrate that our measurements contain signal from scales at orbeyond the peak of the 3d power spectrum. we discuss how the results scale withsystematic uncertainties, like the radial selection function. we find that thecentral values satisfy the analytically estimated scaling relation. we havealso explored the effects of evolutionary corrections, various truncations ofthe kl basis, seeing, sample size and limiting magnitude. we find that theimpact of most of these uncertainties stay within the 2-sigma uncertainties ofour fiducial result.

astro-ph;0107421	the 3d power spectrum from angular clustering of galaxies in early sdss  data	early photometric data from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) containangular positions for 1.5 million galaxies. in companion papers, the angularcorrelation function $w(\theta)$ and 2d power spectrum $c_l$ of these galaxiesare presented. here we invert limber's equation to extract the 3d powerspectrum from the angular results. we accomplish this using an estimate of$dn/dz$, the redshift distribution of galaxies in four different magnitudeslices in the sdss photometric catalog. the resulting 3d power spectrumestimates from $w(\theta)$ and $c_l$ agree with each other and with previousestimates over a range in wavenumbers $0.03 &lt; k/{\rm h mpc}^{-1} &lt; 1$. thegalaxies in the faintest magnitude bin ($21 &lt; \rstar &lt; 22$, which have medianredshift $z_m=0.43$) are less clustered than the galaxies in the brightestmagnitude bin ($18 &lt; \rstar &lt; 19$ with $z_m=0.17$), especially on scales wherenonlinearities are important. the derived power spectrum agrees with that ofszalay et al. (2001) who go directly from the raw data to a parametric estimateof the power spectrum. the strongest constraints on the shape parameter$\gamma$ come from the faintest galaxies (in the magnitude bin $21 &lt; \rstar &lt;22$), from which we infer $\gamma = 0.14^{+0.11}_{-0.06}$ (95% c.l.).

astro-ph;0108097	evidence for reionization at z ~ 6: detection of a gunn-peterson trough  in a z=6.28 quasar	we present moderate resolution keck spectroscopy of quasars at z=5.82, 5.99and 6.28, discovered by the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we find that thely alpha absorption in the spectra of these quasars evolves strongly withredshift. to z~5.7, the ly alpha absorption evolves as expected from anextrapolation from lower redshifts. however, in the highest redshift object,sdssp j103027.10+052455.0 (z=6.28), the average transmitted flux is0.0038+-0.0026 times that of the continuum level over 8450 a &lt; lambda &lt; 8710 a(5.95&lt;z(abs)&lt;6.16), consistent with zero flux. thus the flux level drops by afactor of &gt;150, and is consistent with zero flux in the ly alpha forest regionimmediately blueward of the ly alpha emission line, compared with a drop by afactor of ~10 at z(abs)~5.3. a similar break is seen at ly beta; because of thedecreased oscillator strength of this transition, this allows us to put aconsiderably stronger limit, tau(eff) &gt; 20, on the optical depth to ly alphaabsorption at z=6.  this is a clear detection of a complete gunn-peterson trough, caused byneutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium. even a small neutral hydrogenfraction in the intergalactic medium would result in an undetectable flux inthe ly alpha forest region. therefore, the existence of the gunn-petersontrough by itself does not indicate that the quasar is observed prior to thereionization epoch. however, the fast evolution of the mean absorption in thesehigh-redshift quasars suggests that the mean ionizing background along the lineof sight to this quasar has declined significantly from z~5 to 6, and theuniverse is approaching the reionization epoch at z~6.

astro-ph;0305603	angular clustering with photometric redshifts in the sloan digital sky  survey: bimodality in the clustering properties of galaxies	understanding the clustering of galaxies has long been a goal of modernobservational cosmology. utilizing our photometric redshift technique a volumelimited sample containing more than 2 million galaxies is constructed from thesdss galaxy catalog. in the largest such analysis to date, we study the angularclustering as a function of luminosity and spectral type. using limber'sequation we calculate the clustering length for the full data set asr0=5.77+/-0.10 mpc/h. we find that r0 increases with luminosity by a factor of1.6 over the sampled luminosity range, in agreement with previous redshiftsurveys. we also find that both the clustering length and the slope of thecorrelation function depend on the galaxy type. in particular, by splitting thegalaxies in four groups by their rest-frame type we find a bimodal behavior intheir clustering properties. galaxies with spectral types similar to ellipticalgalaxies have a correlation length of 6.59 +/- 0.17 mpc/h and a slope of theangular correlation function of 0.96 +/- 0.05 while blue galaxies have aclustering length of 4.51 +/- 0.19 mpc/h and a slope of 0.68 +/- 0.09. the twointermediate color groups behave like their more extreme 'siblings', ratherthan showing a gradual transition in slope. we discuss these correlations inthe context of current cosmological models for structure formation.

astro-ph;0506194	fourier phase analysis of sdss galaxies	we present a first analysis of the clustering of sdss galaxies using thedistribution function of the sum of fourier phases. this statistic was recentlyproposed by one of authors as a new method to probe phase correlations ofcosmological density fields. since the fourier phases are statisticallyindependent of fourier amplitudes, the phase statistic plays a complementaryrole to the conventional two-point statistics of galaxy clustering. inparticular, we focus on the distribution functions of phase sum over threeclosed wavevectors as a function of the configurations of triangle wavevectors.we find that the observed distribution functions of phase sum are in goodagreement with the lowest-order approximation from perturbation theory. fordirect comparison with observations, we construct mock catalogs from n-bodysimulations taking account of several observational effects such as the surveygeometry, the redshift distortion, and the discreteness due to the limitednumber of data. indeed the observed phase correlations for the galaxies in therange of absolute magnitude -22&lt;mr&lt;-18 agree well with those for lambda cdmpredictions with sigma8=0.9 evolved from gaussian initial condition. thisagreement implies that the galaxy biasing is approximately linear in redshiftspace. instead, assuming that the galaxy biasing is described by a quadraticdeterministic function at scale larger than 30mpc/h, we can constrain the ratioof the quadratic biasing parameter b2 to the linear biasing parameter b1. wefind that resulting b2/b1 is mainly dependent on sigma8 and that it is wellfitted by b2/b1=0.54(+-0.06)-0.62(+-0.08)sigma8 in cdm models. indeed, b2/b1 isnearly zero when sigma8=0.9.

astro-ph;0506631	sdss j0246-0825: a new gravitationally lensed quasar from the sloan  digital sky survey	we report the discovery of a new two-image gravitationally lensed quasar,sdss j024634.11-082536.2 (sdss j0246-0825). this object was selected as alensed quasar candidate from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) by the samealgorithm that was used to discover other sdss lensed quasars (e.g., sdssj0924+0219). multicolor imaging with the magellan consortium's walter baade6.5-m telescope and the spectroscopic observations using the w. m. keckobservatory's keck ii telescope confirm that sdss j0246-0825 consists of twolensed images ($\delta{\theta}=$1\farcs04) of a source quasar at z=1.68.imaging observations with the keck telescope and the hubble space telescopereveal an extended object between the two quasar components, which is likely tobe a lensing galaxy of this system. from the absorption lines in the spectra ofquasar components and the apparent magnitude of the galaxy, combined with theexpected absolute magnitude from the faber-jackson relation, we estimate theredshift of the lensing galaxy to be z=0.724. a highly distorted ring isvisible in the hubble space telescope images, which is likely to be the lensedhost galaxy of the source quasar. simple mass modeling predicts the possibilitythat there is a small (faint) lensing object near the primary lensing galaxy.

astro-ph;0508564	photometric covariance in multi-band surveys: understanding the  photometric error in the sdss	in this paper we describe a detailed analysis of the photometricuncertainties present within the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) imaging surveybased on repeat observations of approximately 200 square degrees of the sky. weshow that, for the standard sdss aperture systems (petrocounts, counts_model,psfcounts and cmodel_counts), the errors generated by the sdss photometricpipeline under-estimate the observed scatter in the individual bands. thedegree of disagreement is a strong function of aperture and magnitude (rangingfrom 20% to more than a factor of 2). we also find that the photometry in thefive optical bands can be highly correlated for both point sources andgalaxies, although the correlation for point sources is almost entirely due tovariable objects. without correcting for this covariance the sdss color errorscould be in over-estimated by a factor of two to three. combining theseopposing effects, the sdss errors on the colors differ from the observed colorvariation by approximately 10-20% for most apertures and magnitudes. we providea prescription to correct the errors derived from the sdss photometric pipelineas a function of magnitude and a semi-analytic method for generating theappropriate covariance between the different photometric passbands. given theintrinsic nature of these correlations, we expect that all current and futuremulti-band surveys will also observe strongly covariant magnitudes. the abilityof these surveys to complete their science goals is largely dependent oncolor-based target selection and photometric redshifts; these results show theimportance of spending a significant fraction of early survey operations onre-imaging to empirically determine the photometric covariance of anyobserving/reduction pipeline.

astro-ph;0601434	the sdss quasar survey: quasar luminosity function from data release  three	we determine the number counts and z=0-5 luminosity function for awell-defined, homogeneous sample of quasars from the sloan digital sky survey(sdss). we conservatively define the most uniform statistical sample possible,consisting of 15,343 quasars within an effective area of 1622 deg^2 that wasderived from a parent sample of 46,420 spectroscopically confirmed broad-linequasars in the 5282 deg^2 of imaging data from sdss data release three. thesample extends from i=15 to i=19.1 at z&lt;3 and to i=20.2 for z&gt;3. the numbercounts and luminosity function agree well with the results of the 2df qsosurvey, but the sdss data probe to much higher redshifts than does the 2dfsample. the number density of luminous quasars peaks between redshifts 2 and 3,although uncertainties in the selection function in this range do not allow usto determine the peak redshift more precisely. our best fit model has a flatterbright end slope at high redshift than at low redshift. for z&lt;2.4 the data arebest fit by a redshift-independent slope of beta = -3.1 (phi(l) propto l^beta).above z=2.4 the slope flattens with redshift to beta=-2.37 at z=5. this slopechange, which is significant at a &gt;5-sigma level, must be accounted for inmodels of the evolution of accretion onto supermassive black holes.

astro-ph;0601558	spectral energy distributions and multiwavelength selection of type 1  quasars	we present an analysis of the mid-infrared (mir) and optical properties oftype 1 (broad-line) quasars detected by the spitzer space telescope. the mircolor-redshift relation is characterized to z=3, with predictions to z=7. wedemonstrate how combining mir and optical colors can yield even more efficientselection of active galactic nuclei (agn) than mir or optical colors alone.composite spectral energy distributions (seds) are constructed for 259 quasarswith both sloan digital sky survey and spitzer photometry, supplemented bynear-ir, galex, vla and rosat data where available. we discuss how the spectraldiversity of quasars influences the determination of bolometric luminositiesand accretion rates; assuming the mean sed can lead to errors as large as afactor of 2 for individual quasars. finally, we show that careful considerationof the shape of the mean quasar sed and its redshift dependence leads to alower estimate of the fraction of reddened/obscured agns missed by opticalsurveys as compared to estimates derived from a single mean mir to optical fluxratio.

astro-ph;0702214	clustering of high redshift ($z\ge 2.9$) quasars from the sloan digital  sky survey	(abridged) we study the two-point correlation function of a uniformlyselected sample of 4,426 luminous optical quasars with redshift $2.9 \le z\le5.4$ selected over 4041 deg$^2$ from the fifth data release of the sloandigital sky survey. for a real-space correlation function of the form$\xi(r)=(r/r_0)^{-\gamma}$, the fitted parameters in comoving coordinates are$r_0 = 15.2 \pm 2.7 h^{-1}$ mpc and $\gamma = 2.0 \pm 0.3$, over a scale range$4\le r_p\le 150 h^{-1}$ mpc. thus high-redshift quasars are appreciably morestrongly clustered than their $z \approx 1.5$ counterparts, which have acomoving clustering length $r_0 \approx 6.5 h^{-1}$ mpc. dividing our sampleinto two redshift bins: $2.9\le z\le 3.5$ and $z\ge 3.5$, and assuming apower-law index $\gamma=2.0$, we find a correlation length of $r_0 = 16.9 \pm1.7 h^{-1}$ mpc for the former, and $r_0 = 24.3 \pm 2.4 h^{-1}$ mpc for thelatter. following martini &amp; weinberg, we relate the clustering strength andquasar number density to the quasar lifetimes and duty cycle. using the sheth &amp;tormen halo mass function, the quasar lifetime is estimated to lie in the range$4\sim 50$ myr for quasars with $2.9\le z\le 3.5$; and $30\sim 600$ myr forquasars with $z\ge 3.5$. the corresponding duty cycles are $0.004\sim 0.05$ forthe lower redshift bin and $0.03\sim 0.6$ for the higher redshift bin. theminimum mass of halos in which these quasars reside is $2-3\times 10^{12}\h^{-1}m_\odot$ for quasars with $2.9\le z\le 3.5$ and $4-6\times 10^{12}\h^{-1}m_\odot$ for quasars with $z\ge 3.5$.

astro-ph;9601185	eigenmode analysis of galaxy redshift surveys i. theory and methods	we describe a method for estimating the power spectrum of densityfluctuations from galaxy redshift surveys that yields improvement in bothaccuracy and resolution over direct fourier analysis. the key feature of thisanalysis is expansion of the observed density field in the unique set ofstatistically orthogonal spatial functions which obtains for a given survey'sgeometry and selection function and the known properties of galaxy clustering(the karhunen-loeve transform). each of these eigenmodes of the observeddensity field optimally weights the data to yield the cleanest (highestsignal/noise) possible measure of clustering power as a function of wavelengthscale for any survey. using bayesian methods, we simultaneously estimate themean density, power spectrum of density fluctuations, and redshift distortionparameters that best fit the observed data. this method is particularlyimportant for analysis of surveys with small sky coverage, that are comprisedof disjoint regions (e.g., an ensemble of pencil beams or slices), or that havelarge fluctuations in sampling density. we present algorithms for practicalapplication of this technique to galaxy survey data.

astro-ph;9604113	redshift z ~ 1 field galaxies observed with the keck telescope and the  hst	we report results based on 35 new spectroscopic redshifts obtained with thekeck telescope for field galaxies that also have photometry and morphology fromsurvey images taken by the refurbished hst. a sample of 24 redshifts forgalaxies fainter than i = 22 has a median redshift of z ~ 0.81. this result isinconsistent with the lower median redshift of z ~ 0.6 predicted by the``maximal merger models'' of carlberg (1996), which otherwise fit existingdata. the data match an extrapolation of the cfrs, as well as predictions ofcertain mild luminosity-evolution models. nearly half of the redshifts lie intwo structures at z ~ 0.81 and z ~ 1.0, showing the presence of high densityconcentrations spanning scales of ~ 1/h mpc, i.e., the size of groups. we findemission lines or the presence of possible neighbors in 7 of 9 otherwiseluminous galaxies with red central regions at redshifts beyond z ~ 0.7. we alsonote a diversity of morphological types among blue galaxies at z ~ 1, includingsmall compact galaxies, ``chains,'' and ``blue nucleated galaxies.'' thesemorphologies are found among local, but generally less luminous, galaxies.distant blue galaxies also include apparently normal late-type spirals. thesefindings could imply modest bursts of star formation caused by mergers orinteractions of small, gas-rich galaxies with each other or with larger,well-formed galaxies. this first glimpse of very faint z ~ 1 field galaxies ofdiverse colors and morphologies suggests that a mixture of physical processesis at work in the formation and evolution of faint field galaxies.

astro-ph;9702015	cumulant correlators from the apm	this work presents a set of new statistics, the cumulant correlators, aimedat high precision analysis of the galaxy distribution. they form a symmetricmatrix, $q_{nm}$, related to moment correlators the same way as cumulants arerelated to the moments of the distribution. they encode more information thanthe usual cumulants, $s_n$'s, and their extraction from data is similar to thecalculation of the two-point correlation function. perturbation theory (pt),its generalization, the extended perturbation theory (ept), and thehierarchical assumption (ha) have simple predictions for these statistics. asan example, the factorial moment correlators measured by szapudi, dalton,efstathiou &amp; szalay (1996) in the apm catalog are reanalyzed using thistechnique. while the previous analysis assumed hierarchical structureconstants, this method can directly investigate the validity of ha, along withpt, and ept. the results in agreement with previous findings indicate that, atthe small scales used for this analysis, the apm data supports ha. when allnon-linear corrections are taken into account it is a good approximation at the20 percent level. it appears that pt, and a natural generalization of ept forcumulant correlators does not provide such a good fit for the apm at smallscales. once the validity the ha is approximately established, cumulantcorrelators can separate the amplitudes of different tree-types in thehierarchy up to fifth order. as an example, the weights for the fourth ordertree topologies are calculated including all non-linear corrections.

astro-ph;9908083	the unusual infrared object hdf-n j123656.3+621322	we describe an object in the hubble deep field north with very unusualnear-infrared properties. it is readily visible in hubble space telescopenicmos images at 1.6um and from the ground at 2.2um, but is undetected (withsignal-to-noise &lt;~ 2) in very deep wfpc2 and nicmos data from 0.3 to 1.1um. thef_nu flux density drops by a factor &gt;~ 8.3 (97.7% confidence) from 1.6 to1.1um. the object is compact but may be slightly resolved in the nicmos 1.6umimage. in a low-resolution, near-infrared spectrogram, we find a possibleemission line at 1.643um, but a reobservation at higher spectral resolutionfailed to confirm the line, leaving its reality in doubt. we consider varioushypotheses for the nature of this object. its colors are unlike those of knowngalactic stars, except perhaps the most extreme carbon stars or mira variableswith thick circumstellar dust shells. it does not appear to be possible toexplain its spectral energy distribution as that of a normal galaxy at anyredshift without additional opacity from either dust or intergalactic neutralhydrogen. the colors can be matched by those of a dusty galaxy at z &gt;~ 2, by amaximally old elliptical galaxy at z &gt;~ 3 (perhaps with some additionalreddening), or by an object at z &gt;~ 10 whose optical and 1.1um light have beensuppressed by the intergalactic medium. under the latter hypothesis, if theluminosity results from stars and not an agn, the object would resemble aclassical, unobscured protogalaxy, with a star formation rate &gt;~ 100 m_sun/yr.such uv-bright objects are evidently rare at 2 &lt; z &lt; 12.5, however, with aspace density several hundred times lower than that of present-day l* galaxies.

0809.3952	efficient photometric selection of quasars from the sloan digital sky  survey: ii. ~1,000,000 quasars from data release six	we present a catalog of 1,172,157 quasar candidates selected from thephotometric imaging data of the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). the objectsare all point sources to a limiting magnitude of i=21.3 from 8417 sq. deg. ofimaging from sdss data release 6 (dr6). this sample extends our previouscatalog by using the latest sdss public release data and probing both uv-excessand high-redshift quasars. while the addition of high-redshift candidatesreduces the overall efficiency (quasars:quasar candidates) of the catalog to~80%, it is expected to contain no fewer than 850,000 bona fide quasars -- ~8times the number of our previous sample, and ~10 times the size of the largestspectroscopic quasar catalog. cross-matching between our photometric catalogand spectroscopic quasar catalogs from both the sdss and 2df surveys, yields88,879 spectroscopically confirmed quasars. for judicious selection of the mostrobust uv-excess sources (~500,000 objects in all), the efficiency is nearly97% -- more than sufficient for detailed statistical analyses. the catalog'scompleteness to type 1 (broad-line) quasars is expected to be no worse than70%, with most missing objects occurring at z&lt;0.7 and 2.5&lt;z&lt;3.0. in addition toclassification information, we provide photometric redshift estimates(typically good to delta z +/- 0.3 [2 sigma]) and cross-matching with radio,x-ray, and proper motion catalogs. finally, we consider the catalog's utilityfor determining the optical luminosity function of quasars and are able toconfirm the flattening of the bright-end slope of the quasar luminosityfunction at z~4 as compared to z~2.

0810.3567	eight-dimensional mid-infrared/optical bayesian quasar selection	we explore the multidimensional, multiwavelength selection of quasars frommid-ir (mir) plus optical data, specifically from spitzer-irac and the sloandigital sky survey (sdss). we apply modern statistical techniques to combinedspitzer mir and sdss optical data, allowing up to 8-d color selection ofquasars. using a bayesian selection method, we catalog 5546 quasar candidatesto an 8.0 um depth of 56 ujy over an area of ~24 sq. deg; ~70% of thesecandidates are not identified by applying the same bayesian algorithm to4-color sdss optical data alone. our selection recovers 97.7% of known type 1quasars in this area and greatly improves the effectiveness of identifying3.5&lt;z&lt;5 quasars. even using only the two shortest wavelength irac bandpasses,it is possible to use our bayesian techniques to select quasars with 97%completeness and as little as 10% contamination. this sample has a photometricredshift accuracy of 93.6% (delta z +/-0.3), remaining roughly constant whenthe two reddest mir bands are excluded. while our methods are designed to findtype 1 (unobscured) quasars, as many as 1200 of the objects are type 2(obscured) quasar candidates. coupling deep optical imaging data with deepmid-ir data could enable selection of quasars in significant numbers past thepeak of the quasar luminosity function (qlf) to at least z~4. such a samplewould constrain the shape of the qlf and enable quasar clustering studies overthe largest range of redshift and luminosity to date, yielding significantgains in our understanding of quasars and the evolution of galaxies.

cs;0208013	petabyte scale data mining: dream or reality?	science is becoming very data intensive1. today's astronomy datasets withtens of millions of galaxies already present substantial challenges for datamining. in less than 10 years the catalogs are expected to grow to billions ofobjects, and image archives will reach petabytes. imagine having a 100gbdatabase in 1996, when disk scanning speeds were 30mb/s, and database toolswere immature. such a task today is trivial, almost manageable with a laptop.we think that the issue of a pb database will be very similar in six years. inthis paper we scale our current experiments in data archiving and analysis onthe sloan digital sky survey2,3 data six years into the future. we analyzethese projections and look at the requirements of performing data mining onsuch data sets. we conclude that the task scales rather well: we could do thejob today, although it would be expensive. there do not seem to be anyshow-stoppers that would prevent us from storing and using a petabyte datasetsix years from today.

cs;0403017	extending the sdss batch query system to the national virtual  observatory grid	the sloan digital sky survey science database is approaching 2tb. while thevast majority of queries normally execute in seconds or minutes, thisinteractive execution time can be disproportionately increased by a smallfraction of queries that take hours or days to run; either because they requirenon-index scans of the largest tables or because they request very large resultsets. in response to this, we added a multi-queue job submission and trackingsystem. the transfer of very large result sets from queries over the network isanother serious problem. statistics suggested that much of this data transferis unnecessary; users would prefer to store results locally in order to allowfurther cross matching and filtering. to allow local analysis, we implemented asystem that gives users their own personal database (mydb) at the portal site.users may transfer data to their mydb, and then perform further analysis beforeextracting it to their own machine.  we intend to extend the mydb and asynchronous query ideas to multiple nvonodes. this implies development, in a distributed manner, of several features,which have been demonstrated for a single node in the sdss batch query system(casjobs). the generalization of asynchronous queries necessitates some form ofmydb storage as well as workflow tracking services on each node andcoordination strategies among nodes.

0811.3970	galaxy zoo: disentangling the environmental dependence of morphology and  colour	we analyze the environmental dependence of galaxy morphology and colour withtwo-point clustering statistics, using data from the galaxy zoo, the largestsample of visually classified morphologies yet compiled, extracted from thesloan digital sky survey. we present two-point correlation functions of spiraland early-type galaxies, and we quantify the correlation between morphology andenvironment with marked correlation functions. these yield clear and preciseenvironmental trends across a wide range of scales, analogous to similarmeasurements with galaxy colours, indicating that the galaxy zooclassifications themselves are very precise. we measure morphology markedcorrelation functions at fixed colour and find that they are relatively weak,with the only residual correlation being that of red galaxies at small scales,indicating a morphology gradient within haloes for red galaxies. at fixedmorphology, we find that the environmental dependence of colour remains strong,and these correlations remain for fixed morphology \textit{and} luminosity. animplication of this is that much of the morphology--density relation is due tothe relation between colour and density. our results also have implications forgalaxy evolution: the morphological transformation of galaxies is usuallyaccompanied by a colour transformation, but not necessarily vice versa. aspiral galaxy may move onto the red sequence of the colour-magnitude diagramwithout quickly becoming an early-type. we analyze the significant populationof red spiral galaxies, and present evidence that they tend to be located inmoderately dense environments and are often satellite galaxies in the outskirtsof haloes. finally, we combine our results to argue that central and satellitegalaxies tend to follow different evolutionary paths.
