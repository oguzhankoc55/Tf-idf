0909.2938	na-o anticorrelation and hb. vii. the chemical composition of first and  second-generation stars in 15 globular clusters from giraffe spectra	we present abundances of fe, na, and o for 1409 red giant stars in 15galactic globular clusters, derived from the homogeneous analysis of highresolution flames/giraffe spectra. combining the present data with previousresults, we obtained a total sample of 1958 stars in 19 clusters, the largestand most homogeneous database of this kind to date. our gcs have [fe/h] from-2.4 to -0.4, with a wide variety of global parameters (morphology of thehorizontal branch, mass, concentration, etc). for all clusters we find the na-oanticorrelation, the classical signature of proton-capture reactions inh-burning at high temperature in a previous generation of more massive stars,now extinct. using quantitative criteria (from the morphology and extension ofthe na-o anticorrelation), we can define 3 components of the stellar populationin gcs: a primordial component (p) of first-generation stars, and 2 componentsof second-generation stars (intermediate i and extreme e populations from theirdifferent chemical composition). the p component is present in all gcs, and itsfraction is almost constant at about one third. the i component represents thebulk of the cluster population. the e component is not present in all gcs, andit is more conspicuous in some (but not in all) of the most massive ones. wediscuss the fractions and spatial distributions of these components in oursample and in two additional clusters (m3 and m13) from the literature. we alsofind that the slope of the anti-correlation (defined by the minimum o andmaximum na abundances) changes from cluster-to-cluster, a change that isrepresented well by a bilinear relation on cluster metallicity and luminosity.this second dependence suggests a correlation between average mass of pollutersand cluster mass.

1002.1963	m 54 + sagittarius = omega centauri	we derive homogeneous abundances of fe, o, na and alpha-elements from highresolution flames spectra for 76 red giant stars in ngc 6715 (m 54) and for 25red giants in the surrounding nucleus of the sagittarius (sgr) dwarf galaxy.our main findings are that: (i) we confirm that m 54 shows intrinsicmetallicity dispersion, ~0.19 dex r.m.s.; (ii) when the stars of the sgrnucleus are included, the metallicity distribution strongly resembles that inomega cen; the relative contribution of the most metal-rich stars is howeverdifferent in these two objects; (iii) in both gcs there is a very extended na-oanticorrelation, signature of different stellar generations born within thecluster, and (iv) the metal-poor and metal-rich components in m 54 (and omegacen) show clearly distinct extension of the na-o anticorrelation, the mostheavily polluted stars being those of the metal-rich component. we propose atentative scenario for cluster formation that could explain these features.finally, similarities and differences found in the two most massive gcs in ourgalaxy can be easily explained if they are similar objects (nuclear clusters indwarf galaxies) observed at different stages of their dynamical evolution.

1006.5866	detailed abundances of a large sample of giant stars in m 54 and in the  sagittarius nucleus	homogeneous abundances of light elements, alpha and fe-group elements fromhigh-resolution flames spectra are presented for 76 red giant stars in m54, amassive globular cluster (gc) lying in the nucleus of the sagittarius dwarfgalaxy. we also derived detailed abundances for 27 red giants belonging to thesgr nucleus. our abundances assess the intrinsic metallicity dispersion (~0.19dex, rms scatter) of m54, with the bulk of stars peaking at [fe/h]~-1.6 and along tail extending to higher metallicities, similar to omega cen. the spreadin these probable nuclear star clusters exceeds those of most gcs: thesemassive clusters are located in a region intermediate between normal gcs anddwarf galaxies. m54 shows the na-o anticorrelation, typical signature of gcs,which is instead absent in the sgr nucleus. the light elements (mg, al, si)participating to the high temperature mg-al cycle show that the pattern of(anti)correlations produced by proton-capture reactions in h-burning is clearlydifferent between the most metal-rich and most metal-poor components in the twomost massive gcs in the galaxy, confirming early result based on the na-oanticorrelation. as in omega cen, stars affected by most extreme processing,i.e. showing the signature of more massive polluters, are those of themetal-rich component. this can be understood if the burst of star formationgiving birth to the metal-rich component was delayed by as much as 10-30 myrwith respect to the metal-poor one. the evolution of these massive gcs can bereconciled in the general scenario for the formation of gcs sketched incarretta et al.(2010a) taking into account that omega cen could have alreadyincorporated the surrounding nucleus of its progenitor and lost the rest of thehosting galaxy while the two are still observable as distinct components in m54and the surrounding field.

1007.5299	x-shooter observations of main sequence stars in the globular cluster  ngc 2808: first chemical tagging of a he-normal and a he-rich dwarf	we present the first chemical composition study of two unevolved stars in theglobular cluster ngc 2808, obtained with the spectrograph x-shooter@vlt. ngc2808 shows three discrete, well separated main sequences. the most acceptedexplanation for this phenomenon is that their stars have different heliumcontents. we observed one star on the bluest main sequence, (bms, claimed tohave high helium content, y~0.4), and one on the reddest main sequence (rms,consistent with a canonical helium content, y=0.245). we analyzed features ofnh, ch, na, mg, al, and fe. while fe, ca, and other elements have the sameabundances in the two stars, the bms star shows a huge enhancement of n, adepletion of c, an enhancement of na and al, and small depletion of mg withrespect to the rms star. this is exactly what is expected if stars on the bmsformed from the ejecta produced by an earlier stellar generation in thecomplete cno and mgal cycles whose main product is helium. the elementalabundance pattern differences in these two stars are consistent with thedifferences in helium content suggested by the color-magnitude diagrampositions of the stars.

1007.5301	abundances for a large sample of red giants in ngc 1851: hints for a  merger of two clusters?	we present the abundance analysis of a sample of more than 120 red giants inthe globular cluster (gc) ngc 1851, based on flames spectra. we find a smallbut detectable metallicity spread. this spread is compatible with the presenceof two different groups of stars with a metallicity difference of 0.06-0.08dex, in agreement with earlier photometric studies. if stars are divided intothese two groups according to their metallicity, both components show a na-oanticorrelation (signature of a genuine gc nature) of moderate extension. themetal-poor stars are more concentrated than the metal-rich ones. we tentativelypropose the hypothesis that ngc 1851 formed from a merger of two individual gcswith a slightly different fe and alpha-element content, and possibly an agedifference up to 1 gyr. this is supported also by number ratios of stars on thesplit subgiant and on the bimodal horizontal branches. the distribution ofn-capture process elements in the two components also supports the idea thatthe enrichment must have occurred in each of the structures separately, and notas a continuum of events in a single gc. the most probable explanation is thatthe proto-clusters formed into a (now dissolved) dwarf galaxy and later mergedto produce the present gc.

1010.5913	the connection between missing agb stars and extended horizontal  branches	recent surveys confirm early results about a deficiency or even absence ofcn-strong stars on the asymptotic giant branch (agb) of globular clusters(gcs), although with quite large cluster-to-cluster variations. in general,this is at odds with the distribution of cn band strengths among first ascentred giant branch (rgb) stars. norris et al. proposed that the lack of cn-strongstars in some clusters is a consequence of a smaller mass of these stars thatcannot evolve through the full agb phase. in this short paper we found that therelative frequency of agb stars can change by a factor of two between differentclusters. we also find a very good correlation between the minimum mass ofstars along the horizontal branch (gratton et al. 2010) and the relativefrequency of agb stars, with a further dependence on metallicity. we concludethat indeed the stars with the smallest mass on the hb cannot evolve throughthe full agb phase, being agb-manque'. these stars likely had large he and ncontent, and large o-depletion. we then argue that there should not be agbstars with extreme o depletion, and few of them with a moderate one.

1109.0900	multiple stellar populations in 47 tucanae	we use hubble space telescope (hst) and ground-based imaging to study themultiple populations of 47 tuc, combining high-precision photometry withcalculations of synthetic spectra. using filters covering a wide range ofwavelengths, our hst photometry splits the main sequence (ms) into twobranches, and we find that this duality is repeated in the subgiant andred-giant regions (sgb, rgb), and on the horizontal branch (hb). we calculatetheoretical stellar atmospheres for ms stars, assuming different chemicalcomposition mixtures, and we compare their predicted colors through the hstfilters with our observed colors. we find that we can match the complex ofobserved colors with a pair of populations, one with primeval abundance andanother with enhanced nitrogen and a small helium enhancement, but withdepleted c and o. we confirm that models of rgb and red hb stars with that pairof compositions also give colors that fit our observations. we suggest that thedifferent strengths of molecular bands of oh, cn, ch and nh, falling indifferent photometric bands, are responsible for the color splits of the twopopulations. near the cluster center, in each portion of the color-magnitudediagram (cmd) the population with primeval abundances makes up only ~20% of thestars, a fraction that increases outwards, approachng equality in the outskirtsof the cluster, with a fraction ~30% averaged over the whole cluster. thus thesecond, he/n-enriched population is more concentrated and contributes themajority of the present-day stellar content of the cluster. we present evidencethat the cmd of 47 tuc consists of intertwined sequences of the twopopulations, whose separate identities can be followed continuously from the msup to the rgb, and thence to the hb. a third population is visible only in thesgb, where it includes ~8% of the stars.

1111.2688	na-o anticorrelation and hb. ix. kinematics of the program clusters. a  link between systemic rotation and hb morphology?	we use accurate radial velocities for 1981 member stars in 20 galacticglobular clusters, collected within our large survey aimed at the analysis ofthe na-o anti-correlation, to study the internal kinematics of the clusters. weperformed the first systematic exploration of the possible connections betweencluster kinematics and the multiple populations phenomenon in gcs. we did notfind any significant correlation between na abundance and either velocitydispersion or systemic rotation. we searched for systemic rotation in the eightclusters of our sample that lack such analysis from previous works in theliterature (ngc2808, ngc5904, ngc6171, ngc6254, ngc6397, ngc6388, ngc6441, andngc6838). these clusters are found to span a large range of rotationalamplitudes, from ~0.0 km/s (ngc6397) to ~13.0 km/s (ngc6441). we found asignificant correlation between the ratio of rotational velocity to centralvelocity dispersion (v_{rot}/sigma_0) and the horizontal branch morphologyparameter (b-r)/(b+r+v). v_{rot}/sigma_0 is found to correlate also withmetallicity, possibly hinting to a significant role of dissipation in theprocess of formation of globular clusters. v_{rot} is found to correlate wellwith (b-r)/(b+r+v), m_v, sigma_0 and [fe/h]. all these correlations stronglysuggest that systemic rotation may be intimately linked with the processes thatled to the formation of globular clusters and the stellar populations theyhost.

1201.1772	the na-o anticorrelation in horizontal branch stars. ii. ngc1851	we studied the na-o anti-correlation from moderately high resolution spectrafor 35 stars on the blue hb (bhb), one rr lyrae, and 55 stars are on the red hb(rhb) of ngc1851. we also derived abundances for he and n in bhb stars, and baand upper limits for n in rhb stars. the rhb stars clearly separate into twogroups: the vast majority are o-rich and na-poor, while about 10-15% arena-rich and moderately o-poor. most na-rich rhb stars are also ba-rich andthere is an overall correlation between na and ba abundances within the rhb.the group of ba-rich rhb stars resides on the warmer edge and includes ~10% ofthe rhb stars. we propose that they are the descendant of the stars on the rgbsequence with very red v-y colour. this sequence is known also to consist of baand perhaps cno-rich stars. however, the upper limit we obtain for n([n/fe]&lt;1.55) for one of the ba-rich stars coupled with the low c-abundancesfor rgb ba-rich stars from the literature suggests that the total cno might notbe particularly high ([(c+n+o)/fe]&lt;=0.15). the other na-rich rhb stars are alsoat the warm edge of the rhb and the only rr lyrae is na-rich and moderatelyo-poor. we also find a na-o anticorrelation among bhb stars, partiallyoverlapping that found among rhb stars, though generally bhb stars are morena-rich and o-poor. however, there is no clear correlation between temperatureand na and o abundances within the bhb. the average he abundance in bhb starsis y=0.29+/-0.05. n abundances are quite uniform at [n/fe]=1.16+/-0.14 amongbhb stars, with a small trend with temperature. this value is consistent withnormal cno abundance and excludes that bhb stars are very cno-rich: this leavesan age spread of ~1.5 gyr as the only viable explanation for the split of thesgb.

1205.5719	spectroscopic analysis of the two subgiant branches of the globular  cluster ngc1851	ngc1851 possibly shows a spread in [fe/h], but the relation between thisspread and the division in the sgb is unknown. we obtained blue (3950-4600 a)intermediate resolution (r~8,000) spectra for 47 stars on the bright and 30 onthe faint sgb of ngc 1851 (b-sgb and f-sgb, respectively). the determination ofthe atmospheric parameters to extremely high internal accuracy leads to smallerrors when comparing different stars in the cluster. we found that the b-sgbis slightly more metal-poor than the f-sgb, with [fe/h]=-1.227+/-0.009 and[fe/h]=-1.162+/- 0.012, respectively. this implies that the f-sgb is onlyslightly older by ~0.6 gyr than the b-sgb if the total cno abundance isconstant. there are more c-normal stars in the b-sgb than in the f-sgb. this isconsistent with what is found for hb stars, if b-sgb are the progenitors of redhb stars, and f-sgb those of blue hb ones. the abundances of the n-captureelements sr and ba have a bimodal distribution, reflecting the separationbetween f-sgb (sr and ba-rich) and b-sgb stars (sr and ba-poor). in bothgroups, there is a clear correlation between [sr/fe] and [ba/fe], suggestingthat there is a real spread in the abundances of n-capture elements. there issome correlation between c and ba abundances, while the same correlation for sris much more dubious. we identified six c-rich stars, which have a moderateoverabundance of sr and ba and rather low n abundances. this group of starsmight be the progenitors of these on the anomalous rgb in the (v, v-y) diagram.these results are discussed within different scenarios for the formation ofngc1851. it is possible that the two populations originated in differentregions of an inhomogeneous parent object. however, the striking similaritywith m22 calls for a similar evolution for these two clusters. derivingreliable cno abundances for the two sequences would be crucial.

1211.1142	searching for multiple stellar populations in the massive, old open  cluster berkeley 39	the most massive star clusters include several generations of stars with adifferent chemical composition (mainly revealed by an na-o anti-correlation)while low-mass star clusters appear to be chemically homogeneous. we areinvestigating the chemical composition of several clusters with masses of a few10^4 msun to establish the lower mass limit for the multiple stellar populationphenomenon. using flames@vlt spectra we determine abundances of fe, o, na, andseveral other elements (alpha, fe-peak, and neutron-capture elements) in theold open cluster berkeley 39. this is a massive open cluster: m~10^4 msun,approximately at the border between small globular clusters and large openclusters. our sample size of about 30 stars is one of the largest studied forabundances in any open cluster to date, and will be useful to determineimproved cluster parameters, such as age, distance, and reddening when coupledwith precise, well-calibrated photometry. we find that berkeley 39 is slightlymetal-poor, &lt;[fe/h]&gt;=-0.20, in agreement with previous studies of this cluster.more importantly, we do not detect any star-to-star variation in the abundancesof fe, o, and na within quite stringent upper limits. the r.m.s. scatter is0.04, 0.10, and 0.05 dex for fe, o, and na, respectively. this small spread canbe entirely explained by the noise in the spectra and by uncertainties in theatmospheric parameters. we conclude that berkeley 39 is a single-populationcluster.

1307.4085	ngc 362: another globular cluster with a split red giant branch	we obtained flames giraffe+uves spectra for both first and second-generationred giant branch (rgb) stars in the globular cluster (gc) ngc 362 and used themto derive abundances of 21 atomic species for a sample of 92 stars. thesurveyed elements include proton-capture (o, na, mg, al, si), alpha-capture(ca, ti), fe-peak (sc, v, mn, co, ni, cu), and neutron-capture elements (y, zr,ba, la, ce, nd, eu, dy). the analysis is fully consistent with that presentedfor twenty gcs in previous papers of this series. stars in ngc 362 seem to beclustered into two discrete groups along the na-o anti-correlation, with a gapat [o/na] 0 dex. na-rich, second generation stars show a trend to be morecentrally concentrated, although the level of confidence is not very high. whencompared to the classical second-parameter twin ngc 288, with similarmetallicity, but different horizontal branch type and much lower total mass,the proton-capture processing in stars of ngc 362 seems to be more extreme,confirming previous analysis. we discovered the presence of a secondary rgbsequence, redder than the bulk of the rgb: a preliminary estimate shows thatthis sequence comprises about 6% of rgb stars. our spectroscopic data andliterature photometry indicate that this sequence is populated almostexclusively by giants rich in ba, and probably rich in all s-process elements,as found in other clusters. in this regards, ngc 362 joins previously studiedgcs like ngc 1851, ngc 6656 (m 22), and ngc 7089 (m 2).

1409.8283	searching for chemical signatures of multiple stellar populations in the  old, massive open cluster ngc 6791	galactic open and globular clusters (ocs, gcs) appear to inhabit separateregions of the age-mass plane. however, the transition between them is noteasily defined because there is some overlap between high-mass, old ocs andlow-mass, young gcs. we are exploring the possibility of a clear-cut separationbetween ocs and gcs using an abundance feature that has been found so far onlyin gcs: (anti)correlations between light elements. among the coupled abundancetrends, the na-o anticorrelation is the most widely studied. theseanticorrelations are the signature of self-enrichment, i.e., of a formationmechanism that implies multiple generations of stars. here we concentrate onthe old, massive, metal-rich oc ngc 6791. we analyzed archival keck/hiresspectra of 15 ngc 6791 main sequence turn-off and evolved stars, concentratingon the derivation of c, n, o, and na abundances. we also used wiyn/hydraspectra of 21 evolved stars (one is in common). given the spectral complexityof the very metal-rich ngc 6791 stars, we employed spectrum synthesis tomeasure most of the abundances. we confirmed the cluster super-solarmetallicity and abundances of ca and ni that have been derived in past studies.more importantly, we did not detect any significant star-to-star abundancedispersion in c, n, o and na. based on the absence of a clear na-oanticorrelation, ngc 6791 can still be considered a true oc, hosting a singlegeneration of stars, and not a low-mass gc.

1503.05925	lithium abundances in globular cluster giants: ngc 1904, ngc 2808, and  ngc 362	the presence of multiple populations in globular clusters has been wellestablished thanks to high-resolution spectroscopy. it is widely accepted thatdistinct populations are a consequence of different stellar generations:intra-cluster pollution episodes are required to produce the peculiar chemistryobserved in almost all clusters. unfortunately, the progenitors responsiblehave left an ambiguous signature and their nature remains unresolved. toconstrain the candidate polluters, we have measured lithium and aluminiumabundances in more than 180 giants across three systems: ngc~1904, ngc~2808,and ngc~362. the present investigation along with our previous analysis of m12and m5 affords us the largest database of simultaneous determinations of li andal abundances. our results indicate that li production has occurred in each ofthe three clusters. in ngc~362 we detected an m12-like behaviour, with firstand second-generation stars sharing very similar li abundances favouring aprogenitor that is able to produce li, such as agb stars. multiple progenitortypes are possible in ngc~1904 and ngc~2808, as they possess both anintermediate population comparable in lithium to the first generation stars andalso an extreme population, that is enriched in al but depleted in li. a simpledilution model fails in reproducing this complex pattern. finally, the internalli variation seems to suggest that the production efficiency of this element isa function of the cluster's mass and metallicity - low-mass or relativelymetal-rich clusters are more adept at producing li.

1507.07562	ngc 6139: a normal massive globular cluster or a first-generation  dominated cluster? clues from the light elements	information on globular clusters (gc) formation mechanisms can be gathered bystudying the chemical signature of the multiple populations that compose thesestellar systems. in particular, we are investigating the anticorrelations amongo, na, al, and mg to explore the influence of cluster mass and environment ongcs in the milky way and in extragalactic systems. we present here the resultsobtained on ngc 6139 which, on the basis of its horizontal branch morphology,had been proposed to be dominated by first-generation stars. in our extensivestudy based on high resolution spectroscopy, the first for this cluster, wefound a metallicity of [fe/h]= -1.579 +/- 0.015 +/- 0.058 (rms=0.040 dex, 45bona fide member stars) on the uves scale defined by our group. the stars inngc 6139 show a chemical pattern normal for gcs, with a rather extended na-o(and mg-al) anticorrelation. ngc 6139 behaves like expected from its mass andcontains a large fraction (about two thirds) of second-generation stars.

1509.05014	the incidence of binaries in globular cluster stellar populations	binary fraction and orbital characteristics provide indications on theconditions of star formation, as they shed light on the environment they wereborn in. multiple systems are more common in low density environments ratherthan in higher density ones. in the current debate about the formation ofglobular clusters and their multiple populations, studying the binary incidencein the populations they host offers a crucial piece of information on theenvironment of their birth and their subsequent dynamical evolution.  through a multi-year observational campaign using flames at vlt, we monitoredthe radial velocity of 968 red-giant branch stars located around the half-lightradii in a sample of 10 galactic globular clusters. we found a total of 21radial velocity variables identified as {\it bona fide} binary stars, for abinary fraction of 2.2%$\pm$0.5%. when separating the sample into firstgeneration and second generation stars, we find a binary fraction of4.9%$\pm$1.3% and 1.2%$\pm$0.4% respectively. through simulations that takeinto account possible sources of bias in detecting radial velocity variationsin the two populations, we show that the difference is significant and onlymarginally affected by such effects.  such a different binary fraction strongly suggests different conditions inthe environment of formation and evolution of first and second generationsstars, with the latter being born in a much denser environment. our resulthence strongly supports the idea that the second generation forms in a densesubsystem at the center of the loosely distributed first generation, where(loose) binaries are efficiently destroyed.

astro-ph;0006174	cu comae: a new field double-mode rr lyrae, the most metal poor  discovered to date	we report the discovery of a new double-mode rr lyrae variable (rrd) in thefield of our galaxy: cu comae. cu comae is the sixth such rrd identified todate and is the most metal-poor rrd ever detected. based on bvi ccd photometryspanning eleven years of observations, we find that cu comae has periodsp0=0.5441641 +/-0.0000049d and p1=0.4057605 +/-0.0000018d. the amplitude of theprimary (first-overtone) period of cu comae is about twice the amplitude of thesecondary (fundamental) period. the combination of the fundamental period ofpulsation p0 and the period ratio of p1/p0=0.7457 places the variable on themetal-poor side of the petersen diagram, in the region occupied by m68 and m15rrd's. a mass of 0.83 solar masses is estimated for cu comae using an updatedtheoretical calibration of the petersen diagram. high resolution spectroscopy(r=30,000) covering the full pulsation cycle of cu comae was obtained with the2.7 m telescope of the mc donald observatory, and has been used to build up theradial velocity curve of the variable. abundance analysis done on the fourspectra taken near minimum light (phase: 0.54 -- 0.71) confirms the metal poornature of cu comae, for which we derive [fe/h]=-2.38 +/-0.20. this value placesthis new rrd at the extreme metal-poor edge of the metallicity distribution ofthe rr lyrae variables in our galaxy.

astro-ph;0103515	metallicities for double mode rr lyrae in the large magellanic cloud	metallicities for six double mode rr lyrae's (rrd's) in the large magellaniccloud have been estimated using the deltas method. the derived [fe/h] valuesare in the range [fe/h] = -1.09 to -1.78 (or -0.95 to -1.58, adopting adifferent calibration of [fe/h] vs deltas). two stars in our sample are at thevery metal rich limit of all rrd's for which metal abundance has beenestimated, either by direct measure (for field objects) or on the basis of thehosting system (for objects in globular clusters or external galaxies). thesemetal abundances, coupled with mass determinations from pulsational models andthe petersen diagram, are used to compare the mass-metallicity distribution offield and cluster rr lyrae variables. we find that field and cluster rrd's seemto follow the same mass-metallicity distribution, within the observationalerrors, strengthening the case for uniformity of properties between field andcluster variables at odds to what is usually assumed, we find no significativedifference in mass for rr lyrae's in globular clusters of different metallicityand oosterhoff types, or there may even be a difference contrary to thecommonly accepted one, depending on the metallicity scale adopted to derivemasses. this ``unusual'' result for the mass-metallicity relation is probablydue, at least in part, to the inclusion of updated opacity tables in thecomputation of metal-dependent pulsation models.

astro-ph;0603858	na-o anticorrelation and hb. iii. the abundances of ngc 6441 from  flames-uves spectra	the aim of the present work is to determine accurate metallicities for agroup of red giant branch stars in the field of the bulge globular cluster ngc6441. this is the third paper of a series resulting from a large project aimedat determining the extent of the na-o anticorrelation among globular clusterstars and exploring its relationship with hb morphology. we present an lteabundance analysis of these objects, based on data gathered with the flamesfiber facility and the uves spectrograph at vlt2. five of the thirteen starsobserved are members of the cluster. the average fe abundance for these fivestars is [fe/h]=$-0.39\pm 0.04\pm 0.05$~dex, where the first error bar includesthe uncertainties related to star-to-star random errors, and the second one thesystematic effects related to the various assumptions made in the analysis.theoverall abundance pattern is quite typical of globular clusters, with an excessof the $\alpha-$elements and of eu. there is evidence that the stars of ngc6441 are enriched in na and al, while they have been depleted of o and mg, dueto h-burning at high temperatures, in analogy with extensive observations forother globular clusters: in particular, one star is clearly na and al-rich ando and mg-poor. we obtained also quite high v abundances, but it is possiblethat this is an artifact of the analysis, since similar large v abundances arederived also for the field stars. these last are all more metal-rich than ngc6441 and probably belong to the bulge population.

astro-ph;0607438	old open clusters as key tracers of galactic chemical evolution. i. fe  abundances in ngc 2660, ngc 3960, and berkeley 32	we obtained high-resolution uves/flames observations of a sample of nine oldopen clusters spanning a wide range of ages and galactocentric radii. the goalof the project is to investigate the radial metallicity gradient in the disk,as well as the abundance of key elements (alpha and fe-peak elements). in thispaper we present the results for the metallicity of three clusters: ngc 2660(age ~1 gyr, galactocentric distance of 8.68 kpc), ngc 3960 (~ 1 gyr, 7.80kpc), and be 32 (~6-7 gyr, 11.30 kpc). for be 32 and ngc 2660, our studyprovides the first metallicity determination based on high-resolution spectra.we performed equivalent width analysis with the spectral code moog, whichallows us to define a metallicity scale and build a homogeneous sample. we findthat ngc 3960 and ngc 2660 have a metallicity that is very close to solar([fe/h]=+0.02 and +0.04, respectively), while the older be 32 turns out to have[fe/h]=$-$0.29.

astro-ph;0701175	na-o anticorrelation and hb. iv. detection of he-rich and he-poor  stellar populations in the globular cluster ngc 6218	we used the multifiber spectrograph flames on the eso very large telescopeut2 to derive atmospheric parameters, metallicities and abundances of o and nafor 79 red giant stars in the galactic globular cluster ngc 6218 (m 12). weanalyzed stars in the magnitude range from about 1 mag below the bump to thetip of the red giant branch. the average metallicity we derive is[fe/h]=-1.31+/-0.004+/-0.028 dex (random and systematic errors, respectively),with a very small star-to-star scatter (rms=0.033 dex), from moderatelyhigh-resolution giraffe spectra. this is the first extensive spectroscopicabundance analysis in this cluster. our results indicate that ngc 6218 is veryhomogeneous as far as heavy elements are concerned. on the other hand, lightelements involved in the well known proton-capture reactions of h-burning athigh temperature, such as o and na, show large variations, anticorrelated witheach other, at all luminosities along the red giant branch. the conclusion isthat the na-o anticorrelation must be established in early times at the clusterformation. we interpret the variation of na found near the rgb-bump as theeffect of two distinct populations having different bump luminosities, aspredicted for different he content. to our knowledge, ngc 6218 is the first gcwhere such a signature has been spectroscopically detected, when combined withconsistent and homogeneous data obtained for ngc 6752 to gain in statisticalsignificance.

astro-ph;0701176	na-o anticorrelation and hb. vi. the chemical composition of the  peculiar bulge globular cluster ngc 6388	we present the lte abundance analysis of high resolution spectra for redgiant stars in the peculiar bulge globular cluster ngc 6388. spectra of sevenmembers were taken using the uves spectrograph at the eso vlt2 and themultiobject flames facility. we exclude any intrinsic metallicity spread inthis cluster: on average, [fe/h]=-0.44+/-0.01+/-0.03 dex on the scale of thepresent series of papers, where the first error bar refers to individualstar-to-star errors and the second is systematic, relative to the cluster.elements involved in h-burning at high temperatures show large spreads,exceeding the estimated errors in the analysis. in particular, the pairs na ando, al and mg are anticorrelated and na and al are correlated among the giantsin ngc 6388, the typical pattern observed in all galactic globular clustersstudied so far. stars in ngc 6388 shows an excess of alpha-process elements,similar to the one found in the twin bulge cluster ngc 6441. mn is foundunderabundant in ngc 6388, in agreement with the average abundance ratio shownby clusters of any metallicity. abundances of neutron-capture elements arehomogeneously distributed within ngc 6388; the [eu/fe] ratio stands above thevalue found in field stars of similar metallicity.

astro-ph;0701179	na-o anticorrelation and horizontal branches. v. the na-o  anticorrelation in ngc 6441 from giraffe spectra	we present an analysis of flames-giraffe spectra for several bright giants inngc 6441, to investigate the presence and extent of the na-o anticorrelation inthis anomalous globular cluster. the field of ngc 6441 is very crowded, withsevere contamination by foreground (mainly bulge) field stars. appropriatemembership criteria were devised to identify a group of 25 likely clustermembers among the about 130 stars observed. combined with the uves dataobtained with the same observations, high dispersion abundance analyses are nowavailable for a total of 30 stars in ngc 6441, 29 of them having data for botho and na. the spectra were analyzed by a standard line analysis procedure; carewas taken to minimize the impact of the differential interstellar reddeningthroughout the cluster, and to extract reliable information from crowded, andmoderately high s/n (30-70), moderately high resolution (r ~ 23,000) spectra.ngc 6441 is very metal-rich ([fe/h]=$-0.34\pm 0.02\pm0.04$ dex). there is noclear sign of star-to-star scatter in the fe-peak elements. the alpha-elementsmg, si, ca, and ti are overabundant by rather large factors, suggesting thatthe cluster formed from material enriched by massive core collapse sne. theo-na anticorrelation is well defined, with about 1/4 of the stars being na-richand o-poor. one of the stars is a ba-rich and moderately c-rich star. thedistribution of [na/o] ratios among rgb stars in ngc 6441 appears similar tothe distribution of colors of stars along the horizontal branch. the fractionof na-poor, o-rich stars found in ngc 6441 agrees well with that of stars onthe red horizontal branch of this cluster (in both cases about 80%), with asloping distribution toward lower values of [o/na] (among rgb stars and bluercolors (among hb stars).

astro-ph;9507056	the composition of hb stars : rr lyrae variables	we used moderately high-resolution, high s/n spectra to study the chemicalcomposition of 10 field ab-type rr lyrae stars. a new temperature scale wasdetermined from literature infrared flux method measures of subdwarfs and thekurucz (1992) model atmospheres, and used to calibrate colors for both dwarfsand rr lyraes. the applicability of kurucz (1992) model atmospheres in theanalysis of rr lyraes at minimum light was analyzed: we found that they areable to reproduce colors, excitation and ionization equilibria as well as thewings of halpha. we derived abundances for 21 species. the metal abundances ofthe program stars span the range -2.50&lt;[fe/h]&lt;+0.17$. lines of most elementsare found to form in lte conditions. fe lines satisfy very well the excitationand ionization equilibria. rr lyraes share the typical abundance pattern ofother stars of similar [fe/h]: alpha-elements are overabundant by about 0.4dexand mn is underabundant by about 0.6dex in stars with [fe/h]&lt;-1. significantdepartures from lte are found only for a few species. we used our new [fe/h]abundances, as well as values from butler and coworkers (corrected to oursystem), and from high resolution spectroscopy of globular clusters giants, toobtain a new calibration of the deltas index: [fe/h]= -0.194(\pm 0.011)deltas-0.08(\pm 0.18) and to update the metallicity calibration of the ca ii k lineindex: [fe/h]= 0.65(\pm 0.17)w'(k) -3.49(\pm 0.39). finally, our newmetallicity scale was used to revise the [fe/h] dependence of the absolutemagnitude of rr lyrae stars, mv: mv = 0.20(\pm 0.03)[fe/h] + 1.06(\pm 0.04).

astro-ph;9603011	abundances of light elements in metal-poor stars. i. atmospheric  parameters and a new t_eff scale	we present atmospheric parameters for about 300 stars of different chemicalcomposition, whose spectra will be used to study the galactic enrichment of feand light elements. these parameters were derived using an homogenous iterativeprocedure, which considers new calibrations of colour-\teff\ relations for f, gand k-type stars based on infrared flux method (irfm) and interferometricdiameters for population~i stars, and the kurucz (1992) model atmospheres. wefound that these calibrations yield a self-consistent set of atmosphericparameters for \teff$&gt;4400$~k, representing a clear improvement over resultsobtained with older model atmospheres. using this \teff-scale and feequilibrium of ionization, we obtained very low gravities (implyingluminosities incompatible with that expected for rgb stars) for metal-poorstars cooler than 4400~k; this might be due either to a moderate feoverionization (expected from statistical equilibrium calculations) or toinadequacy of kurucz models to describe the atmospheres of very cool giants.our \teff\ scale is compared with other scales recently used for metal-poorstars; it agrees well with those obtained using kurucz (1992) models, but itgives much larger \teff's than those obtained using osmarcs models (edvardssonet al. 1993). this difference is attributed to the different treatment ofconvection in the two sets of models. for the sun, the kurucz (1992) modelappears to be preferable to the osmarcs ones because it better predicts thesolar limb darkening; furthermore, we find that our photometric \teff's formetal-poor stars agree well with both direct estimates based on the irfm, andwith \teff's derived from h$\alpha$\ wings when using kurucz models.

astro-ph;9607078	abundances for globular cluster giants: i. homogeneous metallicities for  24 clusters	we have obtained high-res, high s/n ratio ccd echelle spectra of 10 brightred giants in 3 gcs (47tuc, ngc6752 and ngc6397) roughly spanning the range ofmetallicities of the galactic gc system; they reveal no evidence of star tostar variation of [fe/h] in these 3 gcs. a large set of high quality literaturedata (ews from high-res ccd spectra) was re-analyzed in a self-consistent wayto integrate our data and derive new [fe/h] for more than 160 bright red giantsin 24 gcs. this set was used to define a new [fe/h] scale for gcs based on highquality, direct spectroscopic data, on updated model atmospheres from the gridof kurucz (1992) and on a careful fine abundance analysis (using a common setof atomic and atmospheric parameters for all stars). given the high internalhomogeneity, our new scale supersedes the discrepancies of previous attempts.the internal uncertainty in [fe/h] is very small: 0.06 dex (24 gcs) on average,that can be interpreted as the mean precision of cluster ranking. compared toour system, metallicities on the widely used zinn and west's scale are about0.10dex higher for [fe/h]$&gt;-1$, 0.23dex lower for $-1&lt;[fe/h]&lt;-1.9$ and 0.11dextoo high for [fe/h]$&lt;-1.9$: the non-linearity is significant at 3$\sigma$level. a quadratic transformation corrects older values to the new scale in therange of our calibrating gcs ($-2.24\le[fe/h]_{zw}\le-0.51$). a minordisagreement is found at low [fe/h] between the metallicity scale based onfield and cluster rr lyrae's (via a new calibration of the $\delta$s index) andour new gcs metallicities, that could be ascribed to non-linearity in the[fe/h]$-\delta$s relationship. the impact of new metallicities on majorastrophysical problems is exemplified through the oosterhoff effect in theclassical pair m3 and m15.

astro-ph;9704150	ages of globular clusters from hipparcos parallaxes of local subdwarfs	we report here initial but still strongly conclusive results on absolute agesof galactic globular clusters (ggcs). this study is based on high precisiontrigonometric parallaxes from the hipparcos satellite coupled with accuratemetal abundances ([fe/h], [o/fe], and [\alpha/fe]) from high resolutionspectroscopy for a sample of about thirty subdwarfs. systematic effects due tostar selection (lutz-kelker corrections to parallaxes) and to the possiblepresence of undetected binaries in the sample of bona fide single stars areexamined, and appropriate corrections are estimated. they are found to be smallfor our sample. the new data allowed us to reliably define the absolutelocation of the main sequence (ms) as a function of metallicity. these resultsare then used to derive distances and ages for a carefully selected sample ofnine globular clusters having metallicities determined from high dispersionspectra of individual giants according to a procedure totally consistent withthat used for the field subdwarfs. very precise and homogeneous reddeningvalues have also been independently determined for these clusters. we find thathipparcos parallaxes are smaller than the corresponding ground-basedmeasurements leading, in turn, to longer distance moduli ($\sim 0.2$ mag) andyounger ages ($\sim 2.8$ gyr). the relation between the zero age hb (zahb)absolute magnitude and metallicity for the nine programme clusters turns out tobe: $m_v(zahb) = (0.22\pm 0.09)([fe/h]+1.5) + (0.49\pm 0.04)$. thecorresponding lmc distance modulus is $(m-m)_0=18.60\pm 0.07$. the age of thebona fide old globular clusters (oosterhoff ii and bhb) based on the absolutemagnitude of the turn-off, a theoretically robust indicator, is: age ={11.8^{+2.1}_{-2.5}} gyr.

astro-ph;9909332	light curves and metal abundances of rr lyrae variables in the bar of  the large magellanic cloud	the large magellanic cloud (lmc) is widely considered a corner-stone of theastronomical distance scale, however a difference of 0.2-0.3 mag exists in itsdistance as predicted by the "short" and "long" distance scales. distances tothe lmc from population ii objects are founded on the rr lyrae variables. wehave undertaken an observational campaign devoted to the definition of theaverage apparent luminosity and to the study of the mass-metallicity relationfor rr lyraes in the bar of the lmc. these are compared with analogousquantities for cluster rr lyraes. the purpose is to see whether an intrinsicdifference in luminosity, possibly due to a difference in mass, might existbetween field and cluster rr lyraes, which could be responsible for thewell-known dichotomy between "short" and "long" distance scales. preliminaryresults are presented on the v and b-v light curves, the average apparentvisual magnitude, and the pulsational properties of 102 rr lyrae in the bar ofthe lmc, observed at eso in january 1999. the photometric data are accuratelytied to the johnson photometric system. comparison is presented with thephotometry of rr lyraes in the bar of the lmc obtained by the machocollaboration (alcock et al. 1996). our sample includes 9 double-mode rr lyraesselected from alcock et al.
