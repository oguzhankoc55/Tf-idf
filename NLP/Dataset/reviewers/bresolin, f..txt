1008.2674	ultra-bright optical transients are linked with type ic supernovae	recent searches by unbiased, wide-field surveys have uncovered a group ofextremely luminous optical transients. the initial discoveries of sn 2005ap bythe texas supernova search and scp-06f6 in a deep hubble pencil beam surveywere followed by the palomar transient factory confirmation of host redshiftsfor other similar transients. the transients share the common properties ofhigh optical luminosities (peak magnitudes ~ -21 to -23), blue colors, and alack of h or he spectral features. the physical mechanism that produces theluminosity is uncertain, with suggestions ranging from jet-driven explosion topulsational pair-instability. here we report the most detailed photometric andspectral coverage of an ultra-bright transient (sn 2010gx) detected in thepan-starrs 1 sky survey. in common with other transients in this family,early-time spectra show a blue continuum, and prominent broad absorption linesof o ii. however, about 25d after discovery, the spectra developed type icsupernova features, showing the characteristic broad fe ii and si ii absorptionlines. detailed, post-maximum follow-up may show that all sn 2005ap andscp-06f6 type transients are linked to supernovae ic. this poses problems inunderstanding the physics of the explosions: there is no indication fromlate-time photometry that the luminosity is powered by 56ni, the broadlightcurves suggest very large ejected masses, and the slow spectral evolutionis quite different from typical ic timescales. the nature of the progenitorstars and the origin of the luminosity are intriguing and open questions.

1008.3040	the araucaria project. first cepheid distance to the sculptor group  galaxy ngc 7793 from variables discovered in a wide-field imaging survey	we have detected, for the first time, cepheid variables in the sculptor groupspiral galaxy ngc 7793. from wide-field images obtained in the optical v and ibands on 56 nights in 2003-2005, we have discovered 17 long-period (24-62 days)cepheids whose periods and mean magnitudes define tight period-luminosityrelations. we use the (v-i) wesenheit index to determine a reddening-free truedistance modulus to ngc 7793 of 27.68 +- 0.05 mag (internal error) +- 0.08 mag(systematic error). the comparison of the reddened distance moduli in v and iwith the one derived from the wesenheit magnitude indicates that the cepheidsin ngc 7793 are affected by an average total reddening of e(b-v)=0.08 mag, 0.06of which is produced inside the host galaxy. as in the earlier cepheid studiesof the araucaria project, the reported distance is tied to an assumed lmcdistance modulus of 18.50. the quoted systematic uncertainty takes into accounteffects like blending and possible inhomogeneous filling of the cepheidinstability strip on the derived distance. the reported distance value does notdepend on the (unknown) metallicity of the cepheids according to recenttheoretical and empirical results. our cepheid distance is shorter, but withinthe errors consistent with the distance to ngc 7793 determined earlier with thetrgb and tully-fisher methods. the ngc 7793 distance of 3.4 mpc is almostidentical to the one our project had found from cepheid variables for ngc 247,another spiral member of the sculptor group located close to ngc 7793 on thesky. two other conspicuous spiral galaxies in the sculptor group, ngc 55 andngc 300, are much nearer (1.9 mpc), confirming the picture of a very elongatedstructure of the sculptor group in the line of sight put forward by jerjen etal. and others.

1106.4558	a strategy to measure the dark energy equation of state using the hii  galaxy hubble relation &amp; x-ray agn clustering: preliminary results	we explore the possibility of setting stringent constraints to the darkenergy equation of state using alternative cosmic tracers like: (a) the hubblerelation using hii galaxies, which can be observed at much higher redshifts(z~3.5) than those currently traced by snia samples, and (b) the large-scalestructure using the clustering of x-ray selected agn,which have a redshiftdistribution peaking at z~1.  we use extensive monte-carlo simulations to define the optimal strategy forthe recovery of the dark-energy equation of state using the high redshift (z~2)hubble relation, but accounting also for the effects of gravitational lensing,which for such high redshifts can significantly affect the derived cosmologicalconstraints. based on a "figure of merit" analysis, we provide estimates forthe number of 2&lt;z&lt;3.5 tracers needed to reduce the cosmological solution space,presently provided by the constitution snia set, by a desired factor. we findthat it is much more efficient to increase the number of tracers than to reducetheir individual uncertainties.  finally, we propose a framework to put constraints on the dark energyequation of state by using the joint likelihood of the x-ray agn clustering andof the hubble relation cosmological analyses. a preliminary joint analysisusing the x-ray agn clustering of the 2xmm survey and the hubble relation ofthe constitution snia set provide: omega_m= 0.31+-0.01 and w=-1.06+-0.05. wealso find that the joint snia-2xmm analysis provides significantly morestringent cosmological constraints, increasing the figure of merit by a factor~2, with respect to that of the joint snia-bao analysis.

1203.5115	the araucaria project: grid-based quantitative spectroscopic study of  massive blue stars in ngc55	the quantitative study of the physical properties and chemical abundances oflarge samples of massive blue stars at different metallicities is a powerfultool to understand the nature and evolution of these objects. their analysisbeyond the milky way is challenging, nonetheless it is doable and the best wayto investigate their behavior in different environments. fulfilling this taskin an objective way requires the implementation of automatic analysistechniques that can perform the analyses systematically, minimizing at the sametime any possible bias.  as part of the araucaria project we carry out the first quantitativespectroscopic analysis of a sample of 12 b-type supergiants in the galaxy ngc55at 1.94 mpc away. by applying the methodology developed in this work, we derivetheir stellar parameters, chemical abundances and provide a characterization ofthe present-day metallicity of their host galaxy.  based on the characteristics of the stellar atmosphere/line formation codefastwind, we designed and created a grid of models for the analysis of massiveblue supergiant stars. along with this new grid, we implemented a spectralanalysis algorithm. both tools were specially developed to perform fullyconsistent quantitative spectroscopic analyses of low spectral resolution ofb-type supergiants in a fast and objective way.  we present the main characteristics of our fastwind model grid and perform anumber of tests to investigate the reliability of our methodology. theautomatic tool is applied afterward to a sample of 12 b-type supergiant starsin ngc55, deriving the stellar parameters and abundances. the results indicatethat our stars are part of a young population evolving towards a red supergiantphase. the derived chemical composition hints to an average metallicity similarto the one of the large magellanic cloud, with no indication of a spatial trendacross the galaxy.

1207.3328	the unique na:o abundance distribution in ngc 6791: the first open(?)  cluster with multiple populations	almost all globular clusters investigated exhibit a spread in their lightelement abundances, the most studied being a na:o anticorrelation. in contrast,open clusters show a homogeneous composition and are still regarded as simplestellar populations. the most probable reason for this difference is thatglobulars had an initial mass high enough to retain primordial gas and ejectafrom the first stellar generation and thus formed a second generation with adistinct composition, an initial mass exceeding that of open clusters. ngc 6791is a massive open cluster, and warrants a detailed search for chemicalinhomogeneities. we collected high resolution, high s/n spectra of 21 memberscovering a wide range of evolutionary status and measured their na, o and fecontent. we found [fe/h]=+0.42$\pm 0.01$, in good agreement with previousvalues, and no evidence for a spread. however, the na:o distribution iscompletely unprecedented. it becomes the first open cluster to show intrinsicabundance variations that cannot be explained by mixing, and thus the firstdiscovered to host multiple populations. it is also the first star cluster toexhibit two subpopulations in the na:o diagram with one being chemicallyhomogeneous while the second has an intrinsic spread that follows theanticorrelation so far displayed only by globular clusters. ngc 6791 is uniquein many aspects, displaying certain characteristics typical of open clusters,others more reminiscent of globulars, and yet others, in particular its na:obehavior investigated here, that are totally unprecedented. it clearly had acomplex and fascinating history.

1301.5599	no temperature fluctuations in the giant hii region h 1013	while collisionally excited lines in hii regions allow one to easily probethe chemical composition of the interstellar medium in galaxies, the possiblepresence of important temperature fluctuations casts some doubt on the derivedabundances. to provide new insights into this question, we have carried out adetailed study of a giant hii region, h 1013, located in the galaxy m101, forwhich many observational data exist and which has been claimed to harbourtemperature fluctuations at a level of t^2 = 0.03-0.06. we have firstcomplemented the already available optical observational datasets with amid-infrared spectrum obtained with the spitzer space telescope. combined withoptical data, this spectrum provides unprecedented information on thetemperature structure of this giant hii region. a preliminary analysis based onempirical temperature diagnostics suggests that temperature fluctuations shouldbe quite weak. we have then performed a detailed modelling using the pycloudypackage based on the photoionization code cloudy. we have been able to producephotoionization models constrained by the observed hb surface brightnessdistribution and by the known properties of the ionizing stellar populationthan can account for most of the line ratios within their uncertainties. sincethe observational constraints are both strong and numerous, this argues againstthe presence of significant temperature fluctuations in h 1013. the oxygenabundance of our best model is 12 + log o/h = 8.57, as opposed to the values of8.73 and 8.93 advocated by esteban et al. (2009) and bresolin (2007),respectively, based on the significant temperature fluctuations they derived.however, our model is not able to reproduce the intensities of the oxygenrecombination lines . this cannot be attributed to observational uncertaintiesand requires an explanation other than temperature fluctuations.

1303.2063	an eclipsing binary distance to the large magellanic cloud accurate to 2  per cent	in the era of precision cosmology it is essential to determine the hubbleconstant with an accuracy of 3% or better. currently, its uncertainty isdominated by the uncertainty in the distance to the large magellanic cloud(lmc) which as the second nearest galaxy serves as the best anchor point of thecosmic distance scale. observations of eclipsing binaries offer a uniqueopportunity to precisely and accurately measure stellar parameters anddistances. the eclipsing binary method was previously applied to the lmc butthe accuracy of the distance results was hampered by the need to model thebright, early-type systems used in these studies. here, we present distancedeterminations to eight long-period, late- type eclipsing systems in the lmccomposed of cool giant stars. for such systems we can accurately measure boththe linear and angular sizes of their components and avoid the most importantproblems related to the hot early-type systems. our lmc distance derived fromthese systems is demonstrably accurate to 2.2 % (49.97 +/- 0.19 (statistical)+/- 1.11 (systematic) kpc) providing a firm base for a 3 % determination of thehubble constant, with prospects for improvement to 2 % in the future.

1305.4258	the araucaria project. a distance determination to the local group  spiral m33 from near-infrared photometry of cepheid variables	motivated by an amazing range of reported distances to the nearby local groupspiral galaxy m33, we have obtained deep near-infrared photometry for 26long-period cepheids in this galaxy with the eso vlt. from the data weconstructed period-luminosity relations in the j and k bands which togetherwith previous optical vi photometry for the cepheids by macri et al. were usedto determine the true distance modulus of m33, and the mean reddening affectingthe cepheid sample with the multiwavelength fit method developed in thearaucaria project. we find a true distance modulus of 24.62 for m33, with atotal uncertainty of +- 0.07 mag which is dominated by the uncertainty on thephotometric zero points in our photometry. the reddening is determined ase(b-v)=0.19 +- 0.02, in agreement with the value used by the hst key project offreedman et al. but in some discrepancy with other recent determinations basedon blue supergiant spectroscopy and an o-type eclipsing binary which yieldedlower reddening values. our derived m33 distance modulus is extremelyinsensitive to the adopted reddening law. we show that the possible effects ofmetallicity and crowding on our present distance determination are both at the1-2% level and therefore minor contributors to the total uncertainty of ourdistance result for m33.

0801.3609	detection of diffuse interstellar bands in m31	we investigate the diffuse interstellar band (dib) spectrum in theinterstellar medium of m31. the deimos spectrograph of the w. m. keckobservatory was used to make optical spectroscopic observations of twosupergiant stars, mag 63885 and mag 70817, in the vicinity of the ob78association in m31 where the metallicity is approximately equal to solar. the5780, 5797, 6203, 6283 and 6613 dibs are detected in both sightlines atvelocities matching the m31 interstellar na i absorption. the spectra areclassified and interstellar reddenings are derived for both stars. diffuseinterstellar band (dib) equivalent widths and radial velocities are presented.the spectrum of dibs observed in m31 towards mag 63885 is found to be similarto that observed in the milky way. towards mag 70817 the dib equivalent widthsper unit reddening are about three times the galactic average. compared toobservations elsewhere in the universe, relative to reddening the m31 ism inthe vicinity of ob78 is apparently a highly favourable environment for theformation of dib carriers.

1310.4417	the superluminous supernova ps1-11ap: bridging the gap between low and  high redshift	we present optical photometric and spectroscopic coverage of thesuperluminous supernova (slsn) ps1-11ap, discovered with the pan-starrs1 mediumdeep survey at z = 0.524. this intrinsically blue transient rose slowly toreach a peak magnitude of m_u = -21.4 mag and bolometric luminosity of 8 x10^43 ergs^-1 before settling onto a relatively shallow gradient of decline.the observed decline is significantly slower than those of the superluminoustype ic sne which have been the focus of much recent attention. spectroscopicsimilarities with the lower redshift sn2007bi and a decline rate similar to56co decay timescale initially indicated that this transient could be acandidate for a pair instability supernova (pisn) explosion. overall thetransient appears quite similar to sn2007bi and the lower redshift objectptf12dam. the extensive data set, from 30 days before peak to 230 days after,allows a detailed and quantitative comparison with published models of pisnexplosions. we find that the ps1-11ap data do not match these model explosionparameters well, supporting the recent claim that these sne are not pairinstability explosions. we show that ps1-11ap has many features in common withthe faster declining superluminous ic supernovae and the lightcurve evolutioncan also be quantitatively explained by the magnetar spin down model. at aredshift of z = 0.524 the observer frame optical coverage providescomprehensive restframe uv data and allows us to compare it with thesuperluminous sne recently found at high redshifts between z = 2-4. while thesehigh-z explosions are still plausible pisn candidates, they match thephotometric evolution of ps1-11ap and hence could be counterparts to this lowerredshift transient.

1310.4446	slowly fading super-luminous supernovae that are not pair-instability  explosions	super-luminous supernovae that radiate more than 10^44 ergs per second attheir peak luminosity have recently been discovered in faint galaxies atredshifts of 0.1-4. some evolve slowly, resembling models of 'pair-instability'supernovae. such models involve stars with original masses 140-260 times thatof the sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65-30 solar masses. in thesestars, the photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted toelectron-positron pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclearexplosions. many solar masses of 56ni are synthesized; this isotope decays to56fe via 56co, powering bright light curves. such massive progenitors areexpected to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early universe. recently,supernova 2007bi in a galaxy at redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years afterthe big bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the sun was observed to looklike a fading pair-instability supernova. here we report observations of twoslow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times andblue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability models. theirlate-time light-curve and spectral similarities to supernova 2007bi call thenature of that event into question. our early spectra closely resemble typicalfast-declining super-luminous supernovae, which are not powered byradioactivity. modelling our observations with 10-16 solar masses ofmagnetar-energized ejecta demonstrates the possibility of a common explosionmechanism. the lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests thattheir local rate of occurrence is less than 6x10^-6 times that of thecore-collapse rate.

1402.1631	selecting superluminous supernovae in faint galaxies from the first year  of the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey	the pan-starrs1 (ps1) survey has obtained imaging in 5 bands (grizy_p1) over10 medium deep survey (mds) fields covering a total of 70 square degrees. thispaper describes the search for apparently hostless supernovae (sne) within thefirst year of ps1 mds data with an aim of discovering new superluminoussupernovae (slsne). a total of 249 hostless transients were discovered down toa limiting magnitude of m_ab ~ 23.5, of which 76 were classified as type iasne. there were 57 sne with complete light curves that are likely core-collapsesne (ccsne) or slsne and 12 of these have had spectra taken. of these 12hostless, non-type ia sne, 7 were slsne of type ic at redshifts between0.5-1.4. this illustrates that the discovery rate of type ic slsne can bemaximised by concentrating on hostless transients and removing normal sne ia.we present data for two new possible slsne; ps1-10pm (z = 1.206) and ps1-10ahf(z = 1.1), and estimate the rate of slsne-ic to be between 3^{+3}_{-2} *10^{-5} and 8^{+2}_{-1} * 10^{-5} of the ccsne rate within 0.3 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.4 byapplying a monte-carlo technique. the rate of slowly evolving, sn2007bi-likeexplosions is estimated as a factor of 10 lower than this range.

1402.6181	the trace of the cno cycle in the ring nebula ngc6888	we present new results on the chemical composition of the galactic ringnebula ngc6888 surrounding the wn6(h) star wr136. the data are based on deepspectroscopical observations taken with the high dispersion spectrograph at the8.2m subaru telescope. the spectra cover the optical range from 3700 to 7400 a.the effect of the cno cycle is well identified in the abundances of he, n, ando, while elements not involved in the synthesis such as ar, s, and fe presentvalues consistent with the solar vicinity and the ambient gas. the majorachievement of this work is the first detection of the faint cii 4267recombination line in a wolf-rayet nebula. this allows to estimate the cabundance in ngc6888 and therefore investigate for the first time the trace ofthe cno cycle in a ring nebula around a wolf-rayet star. although the detectionof the cii line has a low signal-to-noise ratio, the c abundance seems to behigher than the predictions of recent stellar evolution models of massivestars. the ne abundance also show a puzzling pattern with an abundance of about0.5 dex lower than the solar vicinity, which may be related to the action ofthe nena cycle. attending to the constraints imposed by the dynamical timescaleand the he/h and n/o ratios of the nebula, the comparison with stellarevolution models indicates that the initial mass of the stellar progenitor ofngc6888 is between 25 msun and 40 msun.

0803.3654	quantitative spectroscopy of 24 a supergiants in the sculptor galaxy ngc  300: flux weighted gravity luminosity relationship, metallicity and  metallicity gradient	a quantitative spectral analysis of 24 a supergiants in the sculptor groupspiral galaxy ngc 300 at a distance of 1.9 mpc is presented. a new method isintroduced to analyze low resolution (~5 ae) spectra, which yieldsmetallicities accurate to 0.2 dex including the uncertainties arising from theerrors in teff (5%) and log g (0.2 dex). for the first time the stellarmetallicity gradient based on elements such as titanium and iron in a galaxybeyond the local group is investigated. solar metallicity is measured in thecenter and 0.3 solar in the outskirts and a logarithmic gradient of -0.08dex/kpc. an average reddening of e(b-v)~0.12 mag is obtained, however with alarge variation from 0.07 to 0.24 mag. we also determine stellar radii,luminosities and masses and discuss the evolutionary status. finally, theobserved relationship between absolute bolometric magnitudes m_{bol} and fluxweighted gravities g_{f} = g/teff^4 is investigated. at high temperatures thestrengths of the balmer lines depends solely on the flux-weighted gravity,which allows a precise direct determination of log g_{f} with an accuracy of0.05 to 0.1 dex. we find a tight relationship between m_{bol} and log g_{f} inagreement with stellar evolution theory. combining these new results withprevious work on local group galaxies we obtain a new flux weighted gravityluminosity relationship (fglr), which is very well defined and appears to be anexcellent alternative tool to determine distances to galaxies.

1409.7728	the host galaxy and late-time evolution of the super-luminous supernova  ptf12dam	super-luminous supernovae of type ic have a tendency to occur in faint hostgalaxies which are likely to have low mass and low metallicity. ptf12dam is oneof the closest and best studied super-luminous explosions that has a broad andslowly fading lightcurve similar to sn 2007bi. here we present new photometryand spectroscopy for ptf12dam from 200-500 days (rest-frame) after peak and adetailed analysis of the host galaxy (sdss j142446.21+461348.6 at z = 0.107).using deep templates and image subtraction we show that the full lightcurve canbe fit with a magnetar model if escape of high-energy gamma rays is taken intoaccount. the full bolometric lightcurve from -53 to +399 days (with respect topeak) cannot be fit satisfactorily with the pair-instability models. analternative model of interaction with a dense csm produces a good fit to thedata although this requires a very large mass (~ 13 m_sun) of hydrogen freecsm. the host galaxy is a compact dwarf (physical size ~ 1.9 kpc) and with m_g= -19.33 +/- 0.10, it is the brightest nearby slsn ic host discovered so far.the host is a low mass system (2.8 x 10^8 m_sun) with a star-formation rate(5.0 m_sun/year), which implies a very high specific star-formation rate (17.9gyr^-1). the remarkably strong nebular lines provide detections of the [o iii]\lambda 4363 and [o ii] \lambda\lambda 7320,7330 auroral lines and an accurateoxygen abundance of 12 + log(o/h) = 8.05 +/- 0.09. we show here that they areat the extreme end of the metallicity distribution of dwarf galaxies andpropose that low metallicity is a requirement to produce these rare andpeculiar supernovae.

astro-ph;0511323	us 708 - an unbound hyper-velocity subluminous o star	we report the discovery of an unbound hyper-velocity star, us 708, in themilky way halo, with a heliocentric radial velocity of +708+-15km/s. aquantitative nlte model atmosphere analysis of optical spectra obtained withlris at the keck i telescope shows that us 708 is an extremely helium-rich(n(he)/n(h)=10) subluminous o type star with teff=44500k, log g=5.23 at adistance of 19kpc. its galactic rest frame velocity is at least 751km/s, muchhigher than the local galactic escape velocity indicating that the star isunbound to the galaxy. it has been suggested that such hyper-velocity stars canbe formed by the tidal disruption of a binary through interaction with thesuper-massive black hole (smbh) at the galactic centre (gc). numericalkinematical experiments are carried out to reconstruct the path from the gc.u s708 needs about 32myrs to travel from the gc to its present position, less thanits evolutionary lifetime. its predicted proper motion mue(alpha)cos(delta)=-2.3mas/y and mue(delta)=-2.4mas/y should be measurable by futurespace missions. we conjecture that us 708 is formed by the merger of two heliumwhite dwarfs in a close binary induced by the interaction with the smbh in thegc and then escaped.

(from hst dataon 4 cepheids), and mcalary et al. (from ground-based h-band photometry of 10cepheids), but our result has reduced the total uncertainty on the distance toic 1613 (relative to the lmc) to less than 3%. with distances to nearbygalaxies from cepheid infrared photometry at this level of accuracy, which arecurrently being obtained in our araucaria project, it seems possible tosignificantly reduce the systematic uncertainty of the hubble constant asderived from the hst key project approach, by improving the calibration of themetallicity effect on pl relation zero points, and by improving the distancedetermination to the lmc.

astro-ph;9712055	the hst key project on the extragalactic distance scale xiii. the  metallicity dependence of the cepheid distance scale	uncertainty in the metal abundance dependence of the cepheid variable period-luminosity (pl) relation remains one of the outstanding sources of systematicerror in the extragalactic distance scale and hubble constant. to test for sucha metallicity dependence, we have used the wfpc2 camera on the hubble spacetelescope (hst) to observe cepheids in two fields in the nearby spiral galaxym101, which span a range in oxygen abundance of 0.7+-0.15 dex. a differentialanalysis of the pl relations in v and i in the two fields yields a marginallysignificant change in the inferred distance modulus on metal abundance, withd(m-m)/d[o/h] = -0.24+-0.16 mag/dex. the trend is in the theoreticallypredicted sense that metal-rich cepheids appear brighter and closer thanmetal-poor stars. external comparisons of cepheid distances with those derivedfrom three other distance indicators, in particular the tip of the red giantbranch method, further constrain the magnitude of any z-dependence of the plrelation at v and i. the overall effects of any metallicity dependence on thedistance scale derived with hst will be of the order of a few percent or lessfor most applications, though distances to individual galaxies at the extremesof the metal abundance range may be affected at the 10% level.
