0904.1896	episodic random accretion and the cosmological evolution of supermassive  black hole spins	the growth of supermassive black holes (bhs) located at the centers of theirhost galaxies comes mainly from accretion of gas, but how to fuel them remainsan outstanding unsolved problem in quasar evolution. this issue can beelucidated by quantifying the radiative efficiency parameter ($\eta$) as afunction of redshift, which also provides constraints on the average spin ofthe bhs and its possible evolution with time. we derive a formalism to link$\eta$ with the luminosity density, bh mass density, and duty cycle of quasars,quantities we can estimate from existing quasar and galaxy survey data. we findthat $\eta$ has a strong cosmological evolution: at z~2, $\eta \approx 0.3$,and by $z\approx 0$ it has decreased by an order of magnitude, to $\eta\approx0.03$. we interpret this trend as evolution in bh spin, and we appeal toepisodic, random accretion as the mechanism for reducing the spin. theobservation that the fraction of radio-loud quasars decreases with increasingredshift is inconsistent with the popular notion that bh spin is a criticalfactor for generating strong radio jets. in agreement with previous studies, weshow that the derived history of bh accretion closely follows the cosmichistory of star formation, consistent with other evidence that bhs and theirhost galaxies coevolve.

0906.3157	a deep hst h-band imaging survey of massive gas-rich mergers. ii. the  quest pg qsos	we report the results from a deep hst nicmos h-band imaging survey of 28 z &lt;0.3 qsos from the palomar-green (pg) sample. this program is part of quest(quasar / ulirg evolution study) and complements a similar set of data on 26highly-nucleated ulirgs presented in paper i. our analysis indicates that thefraction of qsos with elliptical hosts is higher among qsos with undetectedfar-infrared (fir) emission, small infrared excess, and luminous hosts. thehosts of fir-faint qsos show a tendency to have less pronounced merger-inducedmorphological anomalies and larger qso-to-host luminosity ratios on averagethan the hosts of fir-bright qsos, consistent with late-merger evolution fromfir-bright to fir-faint qsos. the spheroid sizes and total host luminosities ofthe radio-quiet pg qsos in our sample are statistically indistinguishable fromthe ulirg hosts presented in paper i, while those of radio-loud pg qsos aresystematically larger and more luminous. ulirgs and pg qsos with ellipticalhosts fall near, but not exactly on, the fundamental plane of inactivespheroids. we confirm the systematic trend noted in paper i for objects withsmall (&lt; 2 kpc) spheroids to be up to ~1 mag. brighter than inactive spheroids.the host colors and wavelength dependence of their sizes support the idea thatthese deviations are due at least in part to non-nuclear star formation.however, the amplitudes of these deviations does not depend on host r-h colors.taken at face value (i.e., no correction for extinction or the presence of ayoung stellar population), the h-band spheroid-host luminosities imply bhmasses ~5 -- 200 x 10^7 m_sun and sub-eddington mass accretion rates for bothqsos and ulirgs. these results are compared with published bh mass estimatesderived from other methods.

0910.1603	emission and absorption properties of low-mass type 2 active galaxies  with xmm-newton	we present xmm-newton observations of four low-redshift seyfert galaxiesselected to have low host luminosities (m_g&gt;-20 mag) and small stellar velocitydispersions (sigma_star&lt;45 km/s), which are among the smallest stellar velocitydispersions found in any active galaxies. these galaxies show weak or no broadoptical emission lines and have likely black hole masses &lt;10^6 m_sun. three outof four objects were detected with &gt;3sigma significance in ~25 ks exposures andtwo observations had high enough signal-to-noise ratios for rudimentaryspectral analysis. we calculate hardness ratios (-0.43 to 0.01) for the threedetected objects and use them to estimate photon indices in the range ofgamma=1.1-1.8. relative to [oiii], the type 2 objects are x-ray faint incomparison with seyfert 1 galaxies, suggesting that the central engines areobscured. we estimate the intrinsic absorption of each object under theassumption that the [oiii] emission line luminosities are correlated with theunabsorbed x-ray luminosity. the results are consistent with moderate(n_h~10^22 cm^-2) absorption over the galactic values in three of the fourobjects, which might explain the non-detection of broad-line emission inoptical spectra. one object in our sample, sdss j110912.40+612346.7, is a nearidentical type 2 counterpart of the late-type seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4395. whilethe two objects have very similar [oiii] luminosities, the type 2 object has anx-ray/[oiii] flux ratio nearly an order of magnitude lower than ngc 4395. themost plausible explanation for this difference is absorption of the primaryx-ray continuum of the type 2 object, providing an indication thatobscuration-based unified models of active galaxies can apply even at thelowest luminosities seen among seyfert nuclei, down to l_bol~10^40-10^41 erg/s.

1103.5514	the discovery and nature of optical transient css100217:102913+404220	we report on the discovery and observations of the extremely luminous opticaltransient css100217:102913+404220 (css100217 hereafter). spectroscopicobservations show this transient was coincident with a galaxy at redshiftz=0.147, and reached an apparent magnitude of v ~ 16.3. after correcting forforeground galactic extinction we determine the absolute magnitude to be m_v=-22.7 approximately 45 days after maximum light. based on our unfilteredoptical photometry the peak optical emission was l = 1.3 x 10^45 erg s^-1, andover a period of 287 rest-frame days had an integrated bolometric luminosity of1.2 x 10^52 erg. analysis of the pre-outburst sdss spectrum of the source showsfeatures consistent with a narrow-line seyfert1 (nls1) galaxy. high-resolutionhst and keck followup observations show the event occurred within 150pc ofnucleus of the galaxy, suggesting a possible link to the active nuclear region.however, the rapid outburst along with photometric and spectroscopic evolutionare much more consistent with a luminous supernova. line diagnostics suggestthat the host galaxy is undergoing significant star formation. we use extensivefollow-up of the event along with archival css and sdss data to investigate thethree most likely sources of such an event; 1) an extremely luminous supernova;2) the tidal disruption of a star by the massive nuclear black hole; 3)variability of the central agn. we find that css100217 was likely an extremelyluminous type iin supernova that occurred within range of the narrow-lineregion of an agn. we discuss how similar events may have been missed in pastsupernova surveys because of confusion with agn activity.

1107.3397	a view of the narrow-line region in the infrared: active galactic nuclei  with resolved fine-structure lines in the spitzer archive	we queried the spitzer archive for high-resolution observations with theinfrared spectrograph of optically selected active galactic nuclei (agn) forthe purpose of identifying sources with resolved fine-structure lines thatwould enable studies of the narrow-line region (nlr) at mid-infraredwavelengths. by combining 298 spitzer spectra with 6 infrared space observatoryspectra, we present kinematic information of the nlr for 81 z&lt;=0.3 agn. we usedthe [nev], [oiv], [neiii], and [siv] lines, whose fluxes correlate well witheach other, to probe gas photoionized by the agn. we found that the widths ofthe lines are, on average, increasing with the ionization potential of thespecies that emit them. no correlation of the line width with the criticaldensity of the corresponding transition was found. the velocity dispersion ofthe gas, sigma, is systematically higher than that of the stars, sigma_*, inthe agn host galaxy, and it scales with the mass of the central black hole,m_bh. further correlations between the line widths and luminosities l, andbetween l and m_bh, are suggestive of a three dimensional plane connectinglog(m_bh) to a linear combination of log(sigma) and log(l). such a plane can beunderstood within the context of gas motions that are driven by agn feedbackmechanisms, or virialized gas motions with a power-law dependence of the nlrradius on the agn luminosity. the m_bh estimates obtained for 35 type 2 agnfrom this plane are consistent with those obtained from the m_bh-sigma_*relation.

0710.5503	high-ionization mid-infrared lines as black hole mass and bolometric  luminosity indicators in active galactic nuclei	we present relations of the black hole mass and the optical luminosity withthe velocity dispersion and the luminosity of the [ne v] and the [o iv]high-ionization lines in the mid-infrared (mir) for 28 reverberation-mappedactive galactic nuclei. we used high-resolution spitzer infrared spectrographand infrared space observatory short wavelength spectrometer data to fit theprofiles of these mir emission lines that originate from the narrow-line regionof the nucleus. we find that the lines are often resolved and that the velocitydispersion of [ne v] and [o iv] follows a relation similar to that between theblack hole mass and the bulge stellar velocity dispersion found for localgalaxies. the luminosity of the [ne v] and the [o iv] lines in these sources iscorrelated with that of the optical 5100a continuum and with the black holemass. our results provide a means to derive black hole properties in varioustypes of active galactic nuclei, including highly obscured systems.

1206.5729	the absence of radio emission from the globular cluster g1	the detections of both x-ray and radio emission from the cluster g1 in m31have provided strong support for existing dynamical evidence for anintermediate mass black hole (imbh) of mass 1.8 +/- 0.5 x 10^4 solar masses atthe cluster center. however, given the relatively low significance andastrometric accuracy of the radio detection, and the non-simultaneity of thex-ray and radio measurements, this identification required furtherconfirmation. here we present deep, high angular resolution, strictlysimultaneous x-ray and radio observations of g1. while the x-ray emission (l_x= 1.74^{+0.53}_{-0.44} x 10^{36} (d/750 kpc)^2 erg/s in the 0.5-10 kev band)remained fully consistent with previous observations, we detected no radioemission from the cluster center down to a 3-sigma upper limit of 4.7microjy/beam. our favored explanation for the previous radio detection isflaring activity from a black hole low mass x-ray binary (lmxb). we performed anew regression of the fundamental plane of black hole activity, valid fordetermining black hole mass from radio and x-ray observations of sub-eddingtonblack holes, finding log m_{bh} = (1.638 +/- 0.070)log l_r - (1.136 +/-0.077)log l_x - (6.863 +/- 0.790), with an empirically-determined uncertaintyof 0.44 dex. this constrains the mass of the x-ray source in g1, if a blackhole, to be &lt;9700 solar masses at 95% confidence, suggesting that it is apersistent lmxb. this annuls what was previously the most convincing evidencefrom radiation for an imbh in the local group, though the evidence for an imbhin g1 from velocity dispersion measurements remains unaffected by theseresults.

0712.1308	outflow-dominated emission from the quiescent massive black holes in ngc  4621 and ngc 4697	the nearby elliptical galaxies ngc 4621 and ngc 4697 each host a supermassiveblack hole with a mass more than 1e8 solar masses. analysis of archival chandradata and new nrao very large array data shows that each galaxy contains alow-luminosity active galactic nucleus (llagn), identified as a faint, hardx-ray source that is astrometrically coincident with a faint 8.5-ghz source.the latter has a diameter less than 0.3 arcsec (26 pc for ngc 4621, 17 pc forngc 4697). the black holes energizing these llagns have eddington ratios l(2-10kev) / l(edd) ~ 1e-9, placing them in the so-called quiescent regime. theemission from these quiescent black holes is radio-loud, with log rx = lognulnu(8.5 ghz) / l(2-10 kev) ~ -2, suggesting the presence of a radio outflow.also, application of the radio-x-ray-mass relation from yuan &amp; cui forquiescent black holes predicts the observed radio luminosities nulnu(8.5 ghz)to within a factor of a few. significantly, that relation invokes x-rayemission from the outflow rather than from an accretion flow. the faint, butdetectable, emission from these two massive black holes is therefore consistentwith being outflow-dominated. observational tests of this finding aresuggested.

1304.6083	the impact of bars on disk breaks as probed by s4g imaging	we have analyzed the radial distribution of old stars in a sample of 218nearby face-on disks, using deep 3.6um images from the spitzer survey ofstellar structure in galaxies (s4g). in particular, we have studied thestructural properties of those disks with a broken or down-bending profile. wefind that, on average, disks with a genuine single exponential profile have ascale-length and a central surface brightness which are intermediate to thoseof the inner and outer components of a down-bending disk with the same totalstellar mass. in the case of barred galaxies, the ratio between the break andthe bar radii (rbr/rbar) depends strongly on the total stellar mass of thegalaxy. for galaxies more massive than 10^10 msun, the distribution is bimodal,peaking at rbr/rbar~2 and ~3.5. the first peak, which is the most populatedone, is linked to the outer lindblad resonance of the bar, whereas the secondone is consistent with a dynamical coupling between the bar and the spiralpattern. for galaxies below 10^10 msun, breaks are found up to ~10 rbar, but weshow that they could still be caused by resonances given the rising nature ofrotation curves in these low-mass disks. while not ruling out star formationthresholds, our results imply that radial stellar migration induced bynon-axysymmetric features can be responsible not only for those breaks at 2rbar, but also for many of those found at larger radii.

1305.3917	a statistical relation between the x-ray spectral index and eddington  ratio of active galactic nuclei in deep surveys	we present an investigation into how well the properties of the accretionflow onto a supermassive black hole may be coupled to those of the overlyinghot corona. to do so, we specifically measure the characteristic spectralindex, gamma, of a power-law energy distribution, over an energy range of 2 to10 kev, for x-ray selected, broad-lined radio-quiet agn up to z~2 in cosmos ande-cdf-s. we test the previously reported dependence between gamma and blackhole mass, fwhm and eddington ratio using a sample of agn covering a broadrange in these parameters based on both the mg ii and h-alpha emission lineswith the later afforded by recent near infrared spectroscopic observationsusing subaru/fmos. we calculate the eddington ratios, lambda_edd, for sourceswhere a bolometric luminosity (l_bol) has been presented in the literature,based on sed fitting, or, for sources where these data do not exist, wecalculate l_bol using a bolometric correction to the lx, derived from arelationship between the bolometric correction, and lx/l3000. from a sample of69 x-ray bright sources (&gt;250 counts), where gamma can be measured withgreatest precision, with an estimate of l_bol, we find a statisticallysignificant correlation between gamma and lambda_edd, which is highlysignificant with a chance probability of 6.59x10^-8. a statisticallysignificant correlation between gamma and the fwhm of the optical lines isconfirmed, but at lower significance than with lambda_edd indicating thatlambda_edd is the key parameter driving conditions in the corona. linearregression analysis reveals that gamma=(0.32+/-0.05)log10lambda_edd+(2.27+/-0.06) andgamma=(-0.69+/-0.11)log10(fwhm/km/s)+(4.44+/-0.42). our results ongamma-lambda_edd are in very good agreement with previous results.

(1999), which would make it the only tidal flarecandidate with reported euv observations and implies an early source luminosity1-2 orders of magnitude greater. if the host galaxy is a cluster member then itmust be a dwarf galaxy, an order of magnitude less massive than the quiescentgalaxy henize 2-10 which hosts a massive black hole that is difficult toreconcile with its low mass. the unusual faintness of the host galaxy may beexplained by tidal stripping in the cluster core.

1309.1444	morphological parameters of spitzer survey of stellar structure in  galaxies (s4g)	the morphology of galaxies can be quantified to some degree using a set ofscale-invariant parameters. concentration (c), asymmetry (a), smoothness (s),the gini index (g), relative contribution of the brightest pixels to the secondorder moment of the flux (m20), ellipticity (e), and the gini index of thesecond order moment (gm) have all been applied to morphologically classifygalaxies at various wavelengths. here we present a catalog of these parametersfor the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g), a volume-limitednear-infrared imaging survey of nearby galaxies using the 3.6 and 4.5 micronchannels of the irac camera. our goal is to provide a reference catalog ofnear-infrared quantified morphology for high-redshift studies and galaxyevolution models with enough detail to resolve stellar mass morphology.  we explore where normal, non-interacting galaxies -those typically found onthe hubble tuning fork- lie in this parameter space and show that there is atight relation between concentration and m20 for normal galaxies. m20 can beused to classify galaxies into earlier and later types (e.g., to separatespirals from irregulars). several criteria using these parameters exist toselect systems with a disturbed morphology, i.e., those that appear to beundergoing a tidal interaction. we examine the applicability of these criteriato spitzer near-infrared imaging. we find that four relations, based on theparameters a&amp;s, g&amp;m20, gm, and c&amp;m20, respectively, select outliers in themorphological parameter space, but each selects different subsets of galaxies.two criteria (gm &gt; 0.6, g &gt; -0.115 x m20 + 0.384) seem most appropriate toidentify possible mergers and the merger fraction in near-infrared surveys. wefind no strong relation between lopsidedness and most of these morphologicalparameters, except for a weak dependence of lopsidedness on concentration andm20.

1312.0866	arrakis: atlas of resonance rings as known in the s4g	resonance rings are the consequence of secular evolution processes thatredistribute material and angular momentum in discs. we produced a catalogueand an atlas of the rings detected in the spitzer survey of stellar structurein galaxies (s4g) and to conduct a statistical study of the data in thecatalogue.  we traced the contours of rings previously identified by buta et al. (inpreparation) and fitted them with ellipses. we found the orientation of bars bystudying the galaxy ellipse fits from s4g's pipeline 4. we used the galaxyorientation data obtained by s4g's pipeline 4 to obtain intrinsic ellipticitiesand orientations of rings and the bars.  arrakis contains data on 724 ringed galaxies in the s4g. the frequency ofresonance rings in the s4g is of 16+-1% and 35+-1% for outer and innerfeatures, respectively. outer rings are mostly found in hubble stages -1&lt;=t&lt;=4.inner rings are found in a distribution that covers the range -1&lt;=t&lt;=7. weconfirm that outer rings have two preferred orientations, parallel andperpendicular to the bar. we confirm a tendency for inner rings to be orientedparallel to the bar, but we find that a significant fraction (~50%) of themhave random orientations with respect to the bar. these misaligned inner ringsare mostly found in late-type galaxies (t&gt;=4). this may be due to spiral modesdecoupled from the bar dominating the fourier amplitude spectrum at the radiusof the inner ring.  we find that the fraction of barred galaxies hosting outer (inner) rings is~1.7 times (~1.3 times) that in unbarred galaxies. the fact that rings are onlymildly favoured by bars suggests that those in unbarred galaxies either formeddue to weak departures from the axisymmetry of the galactic potential or thatthey are born because of bars that have been destroyed after the ringformation.

1410.0009	the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s$^4$g): precise  stellar mass distributions from automated dust correction at 3.6 microns	the mid-infrared is an optimal window to trace stellar mass in nearbygalaxies and the 3.6$\mu m$ irac band has been exploited to this effect, butsuch mass estimates can be biased by dust emission. we present our pipeline toreveal the old stellar flux at 3.6$\mu m$ and obtain stellar mass maps for morethan 1600 galaxies available from the spitzer survey of stellar structure ingalaxies (s$^{4}$g). this survey consists of images in two infrared bands (3.6and 4.5$\mu m$), and we use the independent component analysis (ica) methodpresented in meidt et al. (2012) to separate the dominant light from old starsand the dust emission that can significantly contribute to the observed 3.6$\mum$ flux. we exclude from our ica analysis galaxies with low signal-to-noiseratio (s/n &lt; 10) and those with original [3.6]-[4.5] colors compatible with anold stellar population, indicative of little dust emission (mostly early hubbletypes, which can directly provide good mass maps). for the remaining 1251galaxies to which ica was successfully applied, we find that as much as 10-30%of the total light at 3.6$\mu m$ typically originates from dust, and locally itcan reach even higher values. this contamination fraction shows a correlationwith specific star formation rates, confirming that the dust emission that wedetect is related to star formation. additionally, we have used our largesample of mass estimates to calibrate a relationship of effective mass-to-lightratio ($m/l$) as a function of observed [3.6]-[4.5] color: $\log(m/l)=-0.339(\pm 0.057) \times ([3.6]-[4.5]) -0.336 (\pm 0.002)$. our final pipelineproducts have been made public through irsa, providing the astronomicalcommunity with an unprecedentedly large set of stellar mass maps ready to usefor scientific applications.

1410.5285	self-shadowing effects of slim accretion disks in active galactic  nuclei: diverse appearance of the broad-line region	supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (agns) undergo a widerange of accretion rates, which lead to diversity of appearance. we considerthe effects of anisotropic radiation from accretion disks on the broad-lineregion (blr), from the shakura-sunyaev regime to slim disks withsuper-eddington accretion rates. the geometrically thick funnel of the innerregion of slim disks produces strong self-shadowing effects that lead to verystrong anisotropy of the radiation field. we demonstrate that the degree ofanisotropy of the radiation fields grows with increasing accretion rate. as aresult of this anisotropy, blr clouds receive different spectral energydistributions depending on their location relative to the disk, resulting indiverse observational appearance of the blr. we show that the self-shadowing ofthe inner parts of the disk naturally produces two dynamically distinct regionsof the blr, depending on accretion rate. these two regions manifest themselvesas kinematically distinct components of the broad h$\beta$ line profile withdifferent line widths and fluxes, which jointly account for the lorentzianprofile generally observed in narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies. in the timedomain, these two components are expected reverberate with different time lagswith respect to the varying ionizing continuum, depending on the accretion rateand the viewing angle of the observer. the diverse appearance of the blr due tothe anisotropic ionizing energy source can be tested by reverberation mappingof h$\beta$ and other broad emission lines (e.g., \feii), providing a new toolto diagnose the structure and dynamics of the blr. other observationalconsequences of our model are also explored.

0807.3114	steep-spectrum radio emission from the low-mass active galactic nucleus  gh 10	gh 10 is a broad-lined active galactic nucleus (agn) energized by a blackhole of mass 800,000 solar masses. it was the only object detected by greene etal. in their very large array (vla) survey of 19 low-mass agns discovered bygreene &amp; ho. new vla imaging at 1.4, 4.9, and 8.5 ghz reveals that gh 10'semission has an extent of less than 320 pc, has an optically-thin synchrotronspectrum with a spectral index -0.76+/-0.05, is less than 11 percent linearlypolarized, and is steady - although poorly sampled - on timescales of weeks andyears. circumnuclear star formation cannot dominate the radio emission, becausethe high inferred star formation rate, 18 solar masses per year, isinconsistent with the rate of less than 2 solar masses per year derived fromnarrow halpha and [oii] 3727 emission. instead, the radio emission must bemainly energized by the low-mass black hole. gh 10's radio properties matchthose of the steep-spectrum cores of palomar seyfert galaxies, suggesting that,like those seyferts, the emission is outflow-driven. because gh 10 is radiatingclose to its eddington limit, it may be a local analog of the startingconditions, or seeds, for supermassive black holes. future imaging of gh 10 athigher resolution thus offers an opportunity to study the relative roles ofradiative versus kinetic feedback during black-hole growth.

astro-ph;0008273	the broad-line and narrow-line regions of the liner ngc 4579	we report the discovery of an extremely broad h-alpha emission line in theliner nucleus of ngc 4579. from ground-based observations, the galaxy waspreviously known to contain a type 1 nucleus with a broad h-alpha line of fwhm= 2300 km/s and fwzi ~ 5000 km/s. new spectra obtained with the hubble spacetelescope and a 0.2 arcsec-wide slit reveal an h-alpha component with fwzi ~18,000 km/s. the line is not obviously double-peaked, but it does possessshoulders on the red and blue sides which resemble the h-alpha profiles ofdouble-peaked emitters such as ngc 4203 and ngc 4450. this similarity suggeststhat the very broad h-alpha profile in ngc 4579 may represent emission from anaccretion disk. three such objects have been found recently in two hst programswhich have targeted a total of 30 galaxies, demonstrating that double-peaked orextremely broad-line emission in liners must be much more common than would beinferred from ground-based surveys. the ratio of the narrow [s ii] 6716, 6731lines shows a pronounced gradient indicating a steep rise in density toward thenucleus. the direct detection of a density gradient within the inner arcsecondof the narrow-line region confirms expectations from previous observations oflinewidth-critical density correlations in several liners.

astro-ph;0111472	extreme x-ray behavior in the low-luminosity active nucleus of ngc 4395	we present the results of a 17 ks chandra observation of the nearby dwarfspiral galaxy ngc 4395, focusing on the x-ray properties of the moderate-massblack hole that resides in its nucleus. chandra affords the first high-quality,broadband x-ray detection of this object that is free of contamination fromnearby sources in the field. we find that the nuclear x-ray emission isunresolved in the chandra image and confirm the rapid, large-amplitude x-rayvariability reported in previous studies. the spectrum of the nuclear sourceshows evidence for absorption by an ionized medium. there is also evidence forspectral variability over the course of the chandra observation, althoughcontrary to prior reports, it appears to be uncorrelated with fluctuations inthe hard x-ray count rate. it is possible that the short-term spectralvariability results from column density changes in the ionized absorber. by farthe most unusual high-energy property of ngc 4395 is the shape of its spectrumabove 1 kev. the chandra data indicate a power-law photon index of gamma\approx 0.6, which is much flatter than the gamma \approx 1.8 x-ray spectratypical of active galactic nuclei and the slope of the nuclear x-ray spectrummeasured from an earlier asca observation of ngc 4395. this extreme flatnessand dramatic long-term variability of the x-ray spectrum are unprecedentedamong active galactic nuclei. a variety of possibilities for the origin of theflat continuum slope are considered; none provides a fully satisfactoryexplanation.

astro-ph;0201064	stellar velocity dispersion and black hole mass in the blazar markarian  501	the recently discovered correlation between black hole mass and stellarvelocity dispersion provides a new method to determine the masses of blackholes in active galaxies. we have obtained optical spectra of markarian 501, anearby gamma-ray blazar with emission extending to tev energies. the stellarvelocity dispersion of the host galaxy, measured from the calcium triplet linesin a 2"x3.7" aperture, is 372 +/- 18 km/s. if mrk 501 follows the m-sigmacorrelation defined for local galaxies, then its central black hole has a massof (0.9-3.4)x10^9 solar masses. this is significantly larger than some previousestimates for the central mass in mrk 501 that have been based on models forits nonthermal emission. the host galaxy luminosity implies a black hole of6x10^8 solar masses, but this is not in severe conflict with the mass derivedfrom the m-sigma relation because the m_bh-l_bulge correlation has a largeintrinsic scatter. using the emission-line luminosity to estimate thebolometric luminosity of the central engine, we find that mrk 501 radiates atan extremely sub-eddington level of l/l_edd ~ 10^-4. further applications ofthe m-sigma relation to radio-loud active galactic nuclei may be useful forinterpreting unified models and understanding the relationship between radiogalaxies and bl lac objects.

astro-ph;0210391	emission and absorption in the m87 liner	the nucleus of m87 displays a liner spectrum at optical wavelengths, with anuclear disk of nebulosity that is resolved by the hubble space telescope. wepresent new results from optical and ultraviolet spectra of the central ~40pcas measured by hst. in contrast with previous results for the extended disk,the emission-line spectrum of the central region is best reproduced by amulti-component photoionization scenario, rather than shock heating. thenebular properties as well as energetic considerations suggest a transition onscales of several tens of parsecs, from predominantly photoionization by acentral accretion source, to shock ionization within the disk. if this sourceis at all representative, it suggests that many liners may be composite interms of the energetic processes that give rise to the emission spectrum. wealso report measurements of resonance-line absorption for the nucleus. theabsorption spectrum, like the emission lines, is characterized by lowionization. the absorption line measurements coupled with independentconstraints suggests a total hydrogen column density of 10^19 - 10^20 cm^-2,outflowing from the galaxy center with a velocity of ~126 km/s. the kinematicsignature of an outflow, along with evidence that the absorber covers thepower-law continuum source but not the emission-line clouds, suggests that theabsorbing matter is related to accretion phenomena in the nucleus. the presenceof such an outflow resembles similar behaviour in luminous agn, although thelow ionization that characterizes liners is probably indicative of a differentmode of accretion in these sources.

astro-ph;0309761	a hst census of nuclear star clusters in late-type spiral galaxies: ii.  cluster sizes and structural parameter correlations	we investigate the structural properties of nuclear star clusters inlate-type spiral galaxies. more specifically, we fit analytical models to hstimages of 39 nuclear clusters in order to determine their effective radii aftercorrection for the instrumental point spread function. we use the results ofthis analysis to compare the luminosities and sizes of nuclear star clusters tothose of other ellipsoidal stellar systems, in particular the milky wayglobular clusters. our nuclear clusters have a median effective radius of r_e =3.5 pc, with 50% of the sample falling between 2.4 pc &lt; r_e &lt; 5.0 pc. thisnarrow size distribution is statistically indistinguishable from that ofgalactic globular clusters, even though the nuclear clusters are on average 4magnitudes brighter than the old globulars. we discuss some possibleinterpretations of this result. from a comparison of nuclear clusterluminosities with various properties of their host galaxies, we confirm thatmore luminous galaxies harbor more luminous nuclear clusters. it remainsunclear whether this correlation mainly reflects the influence of galaxy size,mass, and/or star formation rate. since the brighter galaxies in our sampletypically have stellar disks with a higher central surface brightness, nuclearcluster luminosity also correlates with this property of their hosts. on theother hand, we find no evidence for a correlation between the presence of anuclear star cluster and the presence of a large-scale stellar bar.

(1997) sample. this is one of the largest atlases of hard x-ray spectra oflow-l active galaxies ever assembled. all nuclear sources except two sey 2s aredetected between 2-10 kev, half for the first time ever, and average spectraare obtained for all of them. nuclear luminosities reach values down to 10**38erg/s. the shape of the distribution of x-ray parameters is affected by thepresence of compton-thick objects (&gt; 30% among type 2s). the latter have beenidentified either directly from their intense fek line and flat x-ray spectra,or indirectly with flux diagnostic diagrams which use isotropic indicators.after taking into account these highly absorbed sources, we find that (i) theintrinsic x-ray spectral properties (i.e., spectral shapes and luminositiesabove 2 kev) are consistent between type 1 and type 2 sey, as expected from``unified models'', (ii) sey galaxies as a whole are distributed fairlycontinuously over the entire range of nh, between 10**20 and 10**25 cm**-2, and(iii) while sey 1s tend to have lower nh and sey 2s tend to have the highest,we find 30% and 10% exceptions, respectively. overall the sample wellrepresents the average intrinsic x-ray spectral properties of nearby agn,including a proper estimate of the distribution of their absorbing columns.finally, we conclude that, with the exception of a few cases, the present studyagrees with predictions of unified models of sey galaxies, and extends theirvalidity down to very low luminosities.

astro-ph;0601080	a radio census of nuclear activity in nearby galaxies	in order to determine the incidence of black hole accretion-driven nuclearactivity in nearby galaxies, as manifested by their radio emission, we havecarried out a high-resolution multi-element radio-linked interferometer network(merlin) survey of liners and composite liner/h{\sc ii} galaxies from acomplete magnitude-limited sample of bright nearby galaxies (palomar sample)with unknown arcsecond-scale radio properties. there are fifteen radiodetections, of which three are new subarcsecond-scale radio core detections,all being candidate agn. the detected galaxies supplement the already knownlow-luminosity agn -- low-luminosity seyferts, liners and composite liner/h{\scii} galaxies -- in the palomar sample. combining all radio-detected seyferts,liners and composite liner/h{\sc ii} galaxies (lts sources), we obtain anoverall radio detection rate of 54% (22% of all bright nearby galaxies) and weestimate that at least $\sim$50% ($\sim$20% of all bright nearby galaxies) aretrue agn. the radio powers of the lts galaxies allow the construction of alocal radio luminosity function. by comparing the luminosity function withthose of selected moderate-redshift agn, selected from the 2df/nvss survey, wefind that lts sources naturally extend the rlf of powerful agn down to powersof about 10 times that of sgr a*.

0809.1066	dynamical constraints on the masses of the nuclear star cluster and  black hole in the late-type spiral galaxy ngc 3621	ngc 3621 is a late-type (sd) spiral galaxy with an active nucleus, previouslydetected through mid-infrared [ne v] line emission. archival hubble spacetelescope (hst) images reveal that the galaxy contains a bright and compactnuclear star cluster. we present a new high-resolution optical spectrum of thisnuclear cluster, obtained with the esi spectrograph at the keck observatory.the nucleus has a seyfert 2 emission-line spectrum at optical wavelengths,supporting the hypothesis that a black hole is present. the line-of-sightstellar velocity dispersion of the cluster is sigma=43+/-3 km/s, one of thelargest dispersions measured for any nuclear cluster in a late-type spiralgalaxy. combining this measurement with structural parameters measured fromarchival hst images, we carry out dynamical modeling based on the jeansequation for a spherical star cluster containing a central point mass. themaximum black hole mass consistent with the measured stellar velocitydispersion is 3*10^6 solar masses. if the black hole mass is small comparedwith the cluster's stellar mass, then the dynamical models imply a totalstellar mass of ~1*10^7 solar masses, which is consistent with rough estimatesof the stellar mass based on photometric measurements from hst images. fromstructural decomposition of 2mass images, we find no clear evidence for a bulgein ngc 3621; the galaxy contains at most a very faint and inconspicuouspseudobulge component (m_k&gt;-17.6 mag). ngc 3621 provides one of the bestdemonstrations that very late-type spirals can host both active nuclei andnuclear star clusters, and that low-mass black holes can occur in disk galaxieseven in the absence of a substantial bulge.

astro-ph;0601565	hubble space telescope h-band imaging survey of massive gas-rich mergers	we report the results from a deep hst nicmos h-band imaging survey of acarefully selected sample of 33 luminous, late-stage galactic mergers at z &lt;0.3. signs of a recent galactic interaction are seen in all of the objects inthe hst sample, including all 7 ir-excess palomar-green (pg) qsos in thesample. unsuspected double nuclei are detected in 5 ulirgs. a detailedtwo-dimensional analysis of the surface brightness distributions in theseobjects indicates that the great majority (81%) of the single-nucleus systemsshow a prominent early-type morphology. however, low-surface-brightnessexponential disks are detected on large scale in at least 4 of these sources.the hosts of 'warm' agn-like systems are of early type and have less pronouncedmerger-induced morphological anomalies than the hosts of cool systems withliner or hii region-like nuclear optical spectral types. the host sizes andluminosities of the 7 pg~qsos in our sample are statistically indistinguishablefrom those of the ulirg hosts. in comparison, highly luminous quasars, such asthose studied by dunlop et al. (2003), have hosts which are larger and moreluminous. the hosts of ulirgs and pg qsos lie close to the locations ofintermediate-size (about 1 -- 2 l*) spheroids in the photometric projection ofthe fundamental plane of ellipticals, although there is a tendency in oursample for the ulirgs with small hosts to be brighter than normal spheroids.excess emission from a young stellar population in the ulirg/qso hosts may beat the origin of this difference. our results provide support for a possiblemerger-driven evolutionary connection between cool ulirgs, warm ulirgs, andpg~qsos although this sequence may break down at low luminosity.

astro-ph;0605236	on the x-ray, optical emission line and black hole mass properties of  local seyfert galaxies	we investigate the relation between x-ray nuclear emission, optical emissionline luminosities and black hole masses for a sample of 47 seyfert galaxies.the sample, which has been selected from the palomar optical spectroscopicsurvey of nearby galaxies (ho, filippenko &amp; sargent 1997), covers a wide rangeof nuclear powers, from l_{2-10 kev} ~ 10^{43} erg/s down to very lowluminosities (l_{2-10 kev} ~ 10^{38} erg/s). best available data from chandra,xmm-newton and, in a few cases, asca observations have been considered. thanksto the good spatial resolution available from these observations and a propermodeling of the various spectral components, it has been possible to obtainaccurate nuclear x-ray luminosities not contaminated by off-nuclear sourcesand/or diffuse emission. x-ray luminosities have then been corrected takinginto account the likely candidate compton thick sources, which are a highfraction (&gt; 30%) among type 2 seyferts in our sample. the main result of thisstudy is that we confirm strong linear correlations between 2-10 kev,[oiii]\lambda5007, h_{alpha} luminosities which show the same slope as quasarsand luminous seyfert galaxies, independent of the level of nuclear activitydisplayed. moreover, despite the wide range of eddington ratios (l/l_{edd})tested here (six orders of magnitude, from 0.1 down to ~ 10^{-7}), nocorrelation is found between the x-ray or optical emission line luminositiesand the black hole mass. our results suggest that seyfert nuclei in our sampleare consistent with being a scaled-down version of more luminous agn.

astro-ph;0701546	the x-ray and radio connection in low-luminosity active nuclei	we present the results of the correlation between the nuclear 2-10 kev x-rayand radio (at 2cm, 6cm and 20cm) luminosities for a well defined sample oflocal seyfert galaxies. we use a sample of low luminosity radio galaxies(llrgs) for comparison. in both seyfert and llrgs samples, x-ray and radioluminosities are significantly correlated over 8 orders of magnitude,indicating that the x-ray and radio emission sources are strongly coupled.moreover, both samples show a similar regression slope, l(x)$\propto$l(r)^(0.97), but seyfert galaxies are three orders of magnitude less luminousin the radio band than llrgs. this suggests that either similar physicalmechanisms are responsible for the observed emission or a combination ofdifferent mechanisms ends up producing a similar correlation slope. indeed, thecommon belief for llrg is that both the x-ray and radio emission are likelydominated by a relativistic jet component, while in seyfert galaxies the x-rayemission probably arises from a disk-corona system and the radio emission isattributed to a jet/outflow component. we investigate the radio loudness issuein the two samples and find that the seyfert galaxies and the llrgs show adifferent distribution of the radio loudness parameters. no correlation isfound between the luminosity and the radio loudness, however the latter isrelated to the black hole mass and anti-correlated with the eddington ratio.the dichotomy in the radio loudness between seyfert and llrg observed down tolow eddington ratios, l(2-10)/l(edd) $\sim$ 10^(-8), does not support the ideathat the origin of the radio loudness is due to a switch in the accretion mode.

astro-ph;9709034	ultraviolet emission from the liner nucleus of ngc 6500	as a step towards clarifying the ionization mechanism of liners, we have usedthe hubble space telescope faint object spectrograph to obtain an ultravioletspectrum of the nucleus of ngc 6500. compared with more luminous seyfertnuclei, the emission-line spectrum of ngc 6500 is remarkable for itslow-excitation character: c iii], c ii], and mg ii are the strongestcollisionally excited lines in the uv, and c iv is not detected. the fast shockmodels of dopita &amp; sutherland (1995, 1996) are a poor match to the observedspectrum, as they predict much stronger emission than is observed forhigh-excitation lines such as c iv. photoionization by an obscured nonstellarcontinuum source, or possibly ionization by slower (100 km/s) shocks, are morelikely explanations for the emission-line ratios. the origin of the uvcontinuum is unclear; its overall spectral shape is reasonably well matched byspectral evolution models for single-burst populations with ages in the range70-100 myr, but no definite absorption features from young stars are present.alternately, the uv continuum (or some fraction of it) may be scatteredradiation from a hidden active nucleus. we tentatively detect a broad he ii4686 emission feature, which may be due to wolf-rayet stars, although the uvspectrum does not show any clear wolf-rayet signatures. we also find that ngc6500 is weakly detected in an archival rosat hri image with a luminosity of 5 x10^40 erg/s in the 0.1-2.4 kev band, within the normal range for liners.

astro-ph;9710325	a search for ultraviolet emission from liners	we have obtained hubble space telescope wfpc2 2200 a and optical v-bandimages of 20 low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, most of which arespectroscopically classified as liners, in order to search for a possiblephotoionizing continuum. six (30%) of the galaxies are detected in the uv. twoof the detected galaxies (ngc 3642 and ngc 4203) have compact, unresolvednuclear uv sources, while the remaining four uv sources (in ngc 4569, ngc 5005,ngc 6500, and ngc 7743) are spatially extended. combining our sample with thatof maoz et al. (1995), we find that the probability of detection of a nuclearuv source is greatest for galaxies having low internal reddening and lowinclination, and we conclude that dust obscuration is the dominant factordetermining whether or not a uv source is detected. large emission-lineequivalent widths and the presence of broad-line emission also increase thelikelihood of detection of nuclear uv emission. our results suggest that themajority of liners harbor obscured nuclear uv sources, which may be eitheraccretion-powered active nuclei or young star clusters. under the assumptionthat the compact uv sources in ngc 3642 and ngc 4203 have nonstellar power-lawspectra extending into the extreme ultraviolet, the extrapolated ionizingfluxes are sufficiently strong to photoionize the narrow-line regions of theseobjects. the v-band images of many galaxies in our sample reveal remarkablystrong dust lanes which may be responsible for obscuring some uv sources.

astro-ph;9907269	polarized narrow-line emission from the nucleus of ngc 4258	the detection of polarized continuum and line emission from the nucleus ofngc 4258 by wilkes et al. (1995) provides an intriguing application of theunified model of seyfert nuclei to a galaxy in which there is known to be anedge-on, rotating disk of molecular gas surrounding the nucleus. unlike mostseyfert nuclei, however, ngc 4258 has strongly polarized narrow emission lines.to further investigate the origin of the polarized emission, we have obtainedspectropolarimetric observations of the ngc 4258 nucleus at the keck-iitelescope. the narrow-line polarizations range from 1.0% for [s ii] 6716 to13.9% for the [o ii] 7319,7331 blend, and the position angle of polarization isoriented nearly parallel to the projected plane of the masing disk. acorrelation between critical density and degree of polarization is detected forthe forbidden lines, indicating that the polarized emission arises fromrelatively dense (n_e &gt; 10^4 cm^-3) gas. an archival hubble space telescopenarrow-band [o iii] image shows that the narrow-line region has a compact,nearly unresolved core, implying a fwhm size of &lt;2.5 pc. we discuss thepossibility that the polarized emission might arise from the accretion diskitself and become polarized by scattering within the disk atmosphere. a morelikely scenario is an obscuring torus or strongly warped disk surrounding theinner portion of a narrow-line region which is strongly stratified in density.the compact size of the narrow-line region implies that the obscuring structuremust be smaller than ~2.5 pc in diameter.

astro-ph;9910375	the narrow-line regions of liners as resolved with the hubble space  telescope	liners exist in the nuclei of a large fraction of luminous galaxies, buttheir connection with the agn phenomenon has remained elusive. we presenthubble space telescope narrowband [o iii]5007 and h-alpha+[n ii] emission-lineimages of the central regions of 14 galaxies with liner nuclei. the compact, ~1arcsec-scale, unresolved emission that dominates the line flux in ground-basedobservations is mostly resolved by hst. the bulk of this emission comes fromregions with sizes of tens to hundreds of parsecs that are resolved into knots,filaments, and diffuse gas whose morphology differs from galaxy to galaxy. mostof the galaxies do not show clear linear structures or ionization conesanalogous to those often seen in seyfert galaxies. an exception is ngc 1052,the prototypical liner, in which we find a 3 arcsec-long (~ 250 pc) biconicalstructure that is oriented on the sky along the galaxy's radio jet axis. sevenof the galaxies have been shown in previously published hst images to have abright compact ultraviolet nuclear source, while the other seven do not have acentral uv source. our images find evidence of dust in the nuclear regions ofall 14 galaxies, with clear indications of nuclear obscuration in most of the"uv-dark" cases. the data suggest that the line-emitting gas in most liners isphotoionized by a central source (which may be stellar, nonstellar, or acombination thereof) but that this source is often hidden from direct view. wefind no obvious morphological differences between liners with detected weakbroad h-alpha wings in their spectra and those with only narrow lines.likewise, there is no clear morphological distinction between objects whose uvspectra are dominated by hot stars (e.g., ngc 4569) and those that are agn-like(e.g., ngc 4579).

astro-ph;9911340	asca observations of "type 2" liners: evidence for a stellar source of  ionization	we present asca observations of liners without broad h$\alpha$ emission intheir optical spectra. the sample of "type 2" liners consists of ngc 404, 4111,4192, 4457, and 4569. we have detected x-ray emission from all the objectsexcept for ngc 404; among the detected objects are two so-called transitionobjects (ngc 4192 and ngc 4569), which have been postulated to be compositenuclei having both an hii region and a liner component. the images of ngc 4111and ngc 4569 in the soft (0.5-2 kev) and hard (2-7 kev) x-ray bands areextended on scales of several kpc. the x-ray spectra of ngc 4111, ngc 4457 andngc 4569 are well fitted by a two-component model that consists of soft thermalemission with $kt\sim0.65$ kev and a hard component represented by a power law(photon index $\sim$ 2) or by thermal bremsstrahlung emission ($kt\sim$ severalkev). the extended hard x-rays probably come from discrete sources, while thesoft emission most likely originates from hot gas produced by active starformation in the host galaxy. we have found no clear evidence for the presenceof active galactic nuclei (agns) in the sample. if an agn component is theprimary ionization source of the optical emission lines, then it must beheavily obscured with a column density significantly larger than $10^{23}$cm$^{-2}$. alternatively, the optical emission could be ionized by a populationof exceptionally hot stars.

0812.1652	the xmm-newton view of agn with intermediate mass black holes	we have observed with xmm-newton four radiatively efficient active type 1galaxies with black hole masses &lt; 10^6 msun, selected optically from the sdss.we show here that their soft x-ray spectrum exhibits a soft excess with thesame characteristics as that observed ubiquitously in radio-quiet seyfert 1galaxies and type 1 quasars, both in terms of temperatures and strength.however, even when the soft x-ray excess is modelled with a pure thermal disc,its luminosity turns out to be much lower than that expected from accretiontheory for the given temperature, casting further doubts on a thermalinterpretation for soft excesses. while alternative scenarios for the nature ofthe soft excess (namely smeared ionized absorption and disc reflection) cannotbe distinguished on a pure statistical basis, we point out that the absorptionmodel produces a strong correlation between absorbing column density andionization state, which may be difficult to interpret and is most likelyspurious. as for reflection, it does only invoke standard ingredients of anyaccretion model for radiatively efficient sources such as a hard x-rays sourceand a relatively cold (though partially ionized) accretion disc, and thereforeseems the natural choice to explain the soft excess in most (if not all) cases.the reflection model is also consistent with the additional presence of athermal disc component with the theoretically expected temperature (although,again, with smaller-than-expected total luminosity). the observed activegalaxies are among the most variable in x-rays and their excess variance isamong the largest. this is in line with their relatively small black hole massand with expectations from simple power spectra models.
