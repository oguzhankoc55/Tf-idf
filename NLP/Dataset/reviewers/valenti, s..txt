0901.2075	sn 2005cs in m51 ii. complete evolution in the optical and the  near-infrared	we present the results of the one year long observational campaign of thetype ii-plateau sn 2005cs, which exploded in the nearby spiral galaxy m51 (thewhirlpool galaxy). this extensive dataset makes sn 2005cs the best observedlow-luminosity, 56ni-poor type ii-plateau event so far and one of the bestcore-collapse supernovae ever. the optical and near-infrared spectra shownarrow p-cygni lines characteristic of this sn family, which are indicative ofa very low expansion velocity (about 1000 km/s) of the ejected material. theoptical light curves cover both the plateau phase and the late-time radioactivetail, until about 380 days after core-collapse. numerous unfilteredobservations obtained by amateur astronomers give us the rare opportunity tomonitor the fast rise to maximum light, lasting about 2 days. in addition tooptical observations, we also present near-infrared light curves that (togetherwith already published uv observations) allow us to construct for the firsttime a reliable bolometric light curve for an object of this class. finally,comparing the observed data with those derived from a semi-analytic model, weinfer for sn 2005cs a 56ni mass of about 0.003 solar masses, a total ejectedmass of 8-13 solar masses and an explosion energy of about 3 x 10^50 erg.

0904.0119	evidence of asymmetry in sn 2007rt, a type iin supernova	an optical photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the slowly-evolving typeiin sn2007rt is presented, covering a duration of 481 days after discovery. itsearliest spectrum, taken approximately 100 days after the explosion epoch,indicates the presence of a dense circumstellar medium, with which thesupernova ejecta is interacting. this is supported by the slowly-evolving lightcurve. a notable feature in the spectrum of sn 2007rt is the presence of abroad he i 5875 line, not usually detected in type iin supernovae. this mayimply that the progenitor star has a high he/h ratio, having shed a significantportion of its hydrogen shell via mass-loss. an intermediate resolutionspectrum reveals a narrow halpha p-cygni profile, the absorption component ofwhich has a width of 128 km/s. this slow velocity suggests that the progenitorof sn 2007rt recently underwent mass-loss with wind speeds comparable to thelower limits of those detected in luminous blue variables. asymmetries in theline profiles of h and he at early phases bears some resemblance todouble-peaked features observed in a number of ib/c spectra. these asymmetriesmay be indicative of an asymmetric or bipolar outflow or alternatively dustformation in the fast expanding ejecta. in addition, the late time spectrum, atover 240 days post-explosion, shows clear evidence for the presence of newlyformed dust.

0904.4632	nebular emission-line profiles of type ib/c supernovae - probing the  ejecta asphericity	in order to assess qualitatively the ejecta geometry of stripped-envelopecore-collapse supernovae, we investigate 98 late-time spectra of 39 objects,many of them previously unpublished. we perform a gauss-fitting of the [o i]6300, 6364 feature in all spectra, with the position, full width at halfmaximum (fwhm) and intensity of the 6300 gaussian as free parameters, and the6364 gaussian added appropriately to account for the doublet nature of the [oi] feature. on the basis of the best-fit parameters, the objects are organisedinto morphological classes, and we conclude that at least half of all type ib/csupernovae must be aspherical. bipolar jet-models do not seem to be universallyapplicable, as we find too few symmetric double-peaked [o i] profiles. in someobjects the [o i] line exhibits a variety of shifted secondary peaks orshoulders, interpreted as blobs of matter ejected at high velocity and possiblyaccompanied by neutron-star kicks to assure momentum conservation. at phasesearlier than ~200d, a systematic blueshift of the [o i] 6300, 6364 linecentroids can be discerned. residual opacity provides the most convincingexplanation of this phenomenon, photons emitted on the rear side of the snbeing scattered or absorbed on their way through the ejecta. once modified toaccount for the doublet nature of the oxygen feature, the profile of mg i] 4571at sufficiently late phases generally resembles that of [o i] 6300, 6364,suggesting negligible contamination from other lines and confirming that o andmg are similarly distributed within the ejecta.

0911.3774	characteristic velocities of stripped-envelope core-collapse supernova  cores	the velocity of the inner ejecta of stripped-envelope core-collapsesupernovae (cc-sne) is studied by means of an analysis of their nebularspectra. stripped-envelope cc-sne are the result of the explosion of bare coresof massive stars ($\geq 8$ m$_{\odot}$), and their late-time spectra aretypically dominated by a strong [o {\sc i}] $\lambda\lambda$6300, 6363 emissionline produced by the innermost, slow-moving ejecta which are not visible atearlier times as they are located below the photosphere. a characteristicvelocity of the inner ejecta is obtained for a sample of 56 stripped-envelopecc-sne of different spectral types (iib, ib, ic) using direct measurements ofthe line width as well as spectral fitting. for most sne, this value shows asmall scatter around 4500 km s$^{-1}$. observations ($&lt; 100$ days) ofstripped-envelope cc-sne have revealed a subclass of very energetic sne, termedbroad-lined sne (bl-sne) or hypernovae, which are characterised by broadabsorption lines in the early-time spectra, indicative of outer ejecta movingat very high velocity ($v \geq 0.1 c$). sne identified as bl in the early phaseshow large variations of core velocities at late phases, with some having muchhigher and some having similar velocities with respect to regular cc-sne. thismight indicate asphericity of the inner ejecta of bl-sne, a possibility weinvestigate using synthetic three-dimensional nebular spectra.

1006.4259	the type ic sn 2007gr: a census of the ejecta from late-time  optical-infrared spectra	nebular spectra of supernovae (sne) offer an unimpeded view of the innerregion of the ejecta, where most nucleosynthesis takes place. optical spectracover most, but not all of the emitting elements, and therefore offer only apartial view of the products of the explosion. simultaneous optical-infraredspectra, on the other hand, contain emission lines of all important elements,from c and o through to the intermediate mass elements (ime) mg, si, s, ca, andto fe and ni. in particular, si and s are best seen in the ir. the availabilityof ir data makes it possible to explore in greater detail the results of theexplosion. sn\,2007gr is the first type ic sn for which such data areavailable. modelling the spectra with a nlte code reveals that the inner ejectacontain $\sim 1 \msun$ of material within a velocity of $\approx 4500$\,\kms.%the spectrum is powered by \nifs, in an amount ($0.076 \msun$) consistent withthat %derived from the early-time data. the same mass of \nifs\ derived fromthe light curve peak ($0.076 \msun$) was used to power the spectrum, yieldingconsistent results. oxygen is the dominant element, contributing $\sim 0.8\msun$. the c/o ratio is $&lt; 0.2$. ime account for $\sim 0.1 \msun$. thisconfirms that sn\,2007gr was the explosion of a low-mass co core, probably theresult of a star of main-sequence mass $\approx 15 \msun$. the ratios of the\caii\ lines, and of those of \feii, are sensitive to the assumed degree ofclumping. in particular, the optical lines of [\feii] become stronger, relativeto the ir lines, for higher degrees of clumping.

1008.2674	ultra-bright optical transients are linked with type ic supernovae	recent searches by unbiased, wide-field surveys have uncovered a group ofextremely luminous optical transients. the initial discoveries of sn 2005ap bythe texas supernova search and scp-06f6 in a deep hubble pencil beam surveywere followed by the palomar transient factory confirmation of host redshiftsfor other similar transients. the transients share the common properties ofhigh optical luminosities (peak magnitudes ~ -21 to -23), blue colors, and alack of h or he spectral features. the physical mechanism that produces theluminosity is uncertain, with suggestions ranging from jet-driven explosion topulsational pair-instability. here we report the most detailed photometric andspectral coverage of an ultra-bright transient (sn 2010gx) detected in thepan-starrs 1 sky survey. in common with other transients in this family,early-time spectra show a blue continuum, and prominent broad absorption linesof o ii. however, about 25d after discovery, the spectra developed type icsupernova features, showing the characteristic broad fe ii and si ii absorptionlines. detailed, post-maximum follow-up may show that all sn 2005ap andscp-06f6 type transients are linked to supernovae ic. this poses problems inunderstanding the physics of the explosions: there is no indication fromlate-time photometry that the luminosity is powered by 56ni, the broadlightcurves suggest very large ejected masses, and the slow spectral evolutionis quite different from typical ic timescales. the nature of the progenitorstars and the origin of the luminosity are intriguing and open questions.

1011.5665	high luminosity, slow ejecta and persistent carbon lines: sn 2009dc  challenges thermonuclear explosion scenarios	sn 2009dc shares similarities with normal type ia supernovae, but is clearlyoverluminous, with a (pseudo-bolometric) peak luminosity of log(l) = 43.47[erg/s]. its light curves decline slowly over half a year after maximum light,and the early-time near-ir light curves show secondary maxima, although theminima between the first and second peaks are not very pronounced. bluer bandsexhibit an enhanced fading after ~200 d, which might be caused by dustformation or an unexpectedly early ir catastrophe. the spectra of sn 2009dc aredominated by intermediate-mass elements and unburned material at early times,and by iron-group elements at late phases. strong c ii lines are present until~2 weeks past maximum, which is unprecedented in thermonuclear sne. the ejectavelocities are significantly lower than in normal and even subluminous sne ia.no signatures of csm interaction are found in the spectra. assuming that thelight curves are powered by radioactive decay, analytic modelling suggests thatsn 2009dc produced ~1.8 solar masses of 56ni assuming the smallest possiblerise time of 22 d. together with a derived total ejecta mass of ~2.8 solarmasses, this confirms that sn 2009dc is a member of the class of possiblesuper-chandrasekhar-mass sne ia similar to sne 2003fg, 2006gz and 2007if. astudy of the hosts of sn 2009dc and other superluminous sne ia reveals atendency of these sne to explode in low-mass galaxies. a low metallicity of theprogenitor may therefore be an important pre-requisite for producingsuperluminous sne ia. we discuss a number of explosion scenarios, ranging fromsuper-chandrasekhar-mass white-dwarf progenitors over dynamical white-dwarfmergers and type i 1/2 sne to a core-collapse origin of the explosion. none ofthe models seem capable of explaining all properties of sn 2009dc, so that thetrue nature of this sn and its peers remains nebulous.

1208.2599	supernova 2008j: early time observations of a heavily reddened sn  2002ic-like transient	we provide additional observational evidence that some type ia supernovae(sne ia) show signatures of circumstellar interaction (csi) with hydrogen-richmaterial. early phase optical and near-infrared (nir) light curves andspectroscopy of sn 2008j obtained by the carnegie supernova project are studiedand compared to those of sne 2002ic and 2005gj. our nir spectrum is the firstobtained for a 2002ic-like object extending up to 2.2 $\mu$m. a publishedhigh-resolution spectrum is used to provide insight on the circumstellarmaterial (csm). sn 2008j is found to be affected by $a_v\sim$ 1.9 mag ofextinction and to closely resemble sn 2002ic. spectral and color comparison tosne 2002ic and 2005gj suggests $r_v$ $&lt;$ 3.1. spectral decomposition revealsthe underlying sn emission matches a 1991t-like event and, since sn 2008j is asluminous as sn 2005gj ($v_{\rm max}$ $=$ $-$20.3 mag), we conclude that theircsi emissions are similarly robust. the high-resolution spectrum reveals narrowemission lines produced from un-shocked gas characterized by a wind velocity of$\sim$ 50 km s$^{-1}$. we conclude that sn 2008j best matches an explosion of asn ia that interacts with its csm.

1210.1411	moderately luminous type ii supernovae	core-collapse supernovae (cc-sne) descend from progenitors more massive thanabout 8 msun. because of the young age of the progenitors, the ejecta mayeventually interact with the circumstellar medium (csm) via highly energeticprocesses detectable in the radio, x-ray, ultraviolet (uv) and, sometimes, inthe optical domains. in this paper we present ultraviolet, optical and nearinfrared observations of five type ii sne, namely sne 2009dd, 2007pk, 2010aj,1995ad, and 1996w. together with few other sne they form a group of moderatelyluminous type ii events. we collected photometry and spectroscopy with severaltelescopes in order to construct well-sampled light curves and spectralevolutions from the photospheric to the nebular phases. both photometry andspectroscopy indicate a degree of heterogeneity in this sample. the lightcurves have luminous peak magnitudes ($-16.95&lt;m_{b}&lt;-18.70$). the ejectedmasses of ^56\ni for three sne span a wide range of values($2.8\times10^{-2}$msun$&lt;$m(\ni)$&lt;1.4\times10^{-1}$msun), while for a fourth(sn2010aj) we could determine a stringent upper limit ($7\times10^{-3}$msun).clues of interaction, such as the presence of high velocity (hv) features ofthe balmer lines, are visible in the photospheric spectra of sne 2009dd and1996w. for sn2007pk we observe a spectral transition from a type iin to astandard type ii sn. modelling the observations of sne 2009dd, 2010aj and1995ad with radiation hydrodynamics codes, we infer kinetic plus thermalenergies of about 0.2-0.5 foe, initial radii of 2-5$\times10^{13}$ cm andejected masses of $\sim$5.0-9.5 msun. these values suggest moderate-mass,super-asymptotic giant branch (sagb) or red super-giants (rsg) stars as snprecursors, in analogy with other luminous type iip sne 2007od and 2009bw.

1210.3568	interacting supernovae and supernova impostors. sn 2009ip, is this the  end?	we report the results of a 3 year-long dedicated monitoring campaign of arestless luminous blue variable (lbv) in ngc 7259. the object, named sn 2009ip,was observed photometrically and spectroscopically in the optical andnear-infrared domains. we monitored a number of erupting episodes in the pastfew years, and increased the density of our observations during eruptiveepisodes. in this paper we present the full historical data set from 2009-2012with multi-wavelength dense coverage of the two high luminosity events betweenaugust - september 2012. we construct bolometric light curves and measure thetotal luminosities of these eruptive or explosive events. we label them the2012a event (lasting ~50 days) with a peak of 3x10^41 erg/s, and the 2012bevent (14 day rise time, still ongoing) with a peak of 8x10^42 erg/s. thelatter event reached an absolute r-band magnitude of about -18, comparable tothat of a core-collapse supernova (sn). our historical monitoring has detectedhigh-velocity spectral features (~13000 km/s) in september 2011, one yearbefore the current sn-like event. this implies that the detection of such highvelocity outflows cannot, conclusively, point to a core-collapse sn origin. wesuggest that the initial peak in the 2012a event was unlikely to be due to afaint core-collapse sn. we propose that the high intrinsic luminosity of thelatest peak, the variability history of sn 2009ip, and the detection of broadspectral lines indicative of high-velocity ejecta are consistent with apulsational pair-instability event, and that the star may have survived thelast outburst. the question of the survival of the lbv progenitor star and itsfuture fate remain open issues, only to be answered with future monitoring ofthis historically unique explosion.

1302.0009	ps1-10afx at z=1.388: pan-starrs1 discovery of a new type of  superluminous supernova	we present the pan-starrs1 discovery of ps1-10afx, a uniquehydrogen-deficient superluminous supernova (slsn) at z=1.388. the light curvepeaked at z_p1=21.7 mag, making ps1-10afx comparable to the most luminous knownsne, with m_u = -22.3 mag. our extensive optical and nir observations indicatethat the bolometric light curve of ps1-10afx rose on the unusually fasttimescale of ~12 d to the extraordinary peak luminosity of 4.1e44 erg/s (m_bol= -22.8 mag) and subsequently faded rapidly. equally important, the sed isunusually red for a slsn, with a color temperature of 6800 k near maximumlight, in contrast to previous h-poor slsne, which are bright in the uv. thespectra more closely resemble those of a normal sn ic than any known slsn, witha photospheric velocity of 11,000 km/s and evidence for line blanketing in therest-frame uv. despite the fast rise, these parameters imply a very largeemitting radius (&gt;5e15 cm). we demonstrate that no existing theoretical modelcan satisfactorily explain this combination of properties: (i) a nickel-poweredlight curve cannot match the combination of high peak luminosity with the fasttimescale; (ii) models powered by the spindown energy of a rapidly-rotatingmagnetar predict significantly hotter and faster ejecta; and (iii) modelsinvoking shock breakout through a dense circumstellar medium cannot explain theobserved spectra or color evolution. the host galaxy is well detected inpre-explosion imaging with a luminosity near l*, a star formation rate of 15m_sun/yr, and is fairly massive (2e10 m_sun), with a stellar population age of1e8 yr, also in contrast to the dwarf hosts of known h-poor slsne. ps1-10afx isdistinct from known examples of slsne in its spectra, colors, light-curveshape, and host galaxy properties, suggesting that it resulted from a differentchannel than other hydrogen-poor slsne.

1302.2926	spectroscopic observations of sn 2012fr: a luminous normal type ia  supernova with early high velocity features and late velocity plateau	we present 65 optical spectra of the type ia supernova sn 2012fr, of which 33were obtained before maximum light. at early times sn 2012fr shows clearevidence of a high-velocity feature (hvf) in the si ii 6355 line which can becleanly decoupled from the lower velocity "photospheric" component. this si ii6355 hvf fades by phase -5; subsequently, the photospheric component exhibits avery narrow velocity width and remains at a nearly constant velocity ofv~12,000 km/s until at least 5 weeks after maximum brightness. the ca iiinfrared (ir) triplet exhibits similar evidence for both a photosphericcomponent at v~12,000 km/s with narrow line width and long velocity plateau, aswell as a high-velocity component beginning at v~31,000 km/s two weeks beforemaximum. sn 2012fr resides on the border between the "shallow silicon" and"core-normal" subclasses in the branch et al. (2009) classification scheme, andon the border between normal and "high-velocity" sne ia in the wang et al.(2009a) system. though it is a clear member of the "low velocity gradient"(lvg; benetii et al., 2005) group of sne ia and exhibits a very slowlight-curve decline, it shows key dissimilarities with the overluminous sn1991t or sn 1999aa subclasses of sne ia. sn 2012fr represents a well-observedsn ia at the luminous end of the normal sn ia distribution, and a keytransitional event between nominal spectroscopic subclasses of sne ia.

1302.2983	pessto monitoring of sn 2012hn: further heterogeneity among faint type i  supernovae	we present optical and infrared monitoring data of sn 2012hn collected by thepublic eso spectroscopic survey for transient objects (pessto). we show that sn2012hn has a faint peak magnitude (mr ~ -15.7) and shows no hydrogen and noclear evidence for helium in its spectral evolution. instead, we detectprominent ca ii lines at all epochs, which relates this transient to previouslydescribed 'ca-rich' or 'gap' transients. however, the photospheric spectra(from -3 to +32 d with respect to peak) of sn 2012hn show a series ofabsorption lines which are unique, and a red continuum that is likely intrinsicrather than due to extinction. lines of ti ii and cr ii are visible. this maybe a temperature effect, which could also explain the red photospheric colour.a nebular spectrum at +150d shows prominent caii, oi, ci and possibly mgi lineswhich appear similar in strength to those displayed by core-collapse sne. toadd to the puzzle, sn 2012hn is located at a projected distance of 6 kpc froman e/s0 host and is not close to any obvious starforming region. overall sn2012hn resembles a group of faint h-poor sne that have been discovered recentlyand for which a convincing and consistent physical explanation is stillmissing. they all appear to explode preferentially in remote locations offsetfrom a massive host galaxy with deep limits on any dwarf host galaxies,favouring old progenitor systems. sn 2012hn adds heterogeneity to this sampleof objects. we discuss potential explosion channels including he-shelldetonations and double detonations of white dwarfs as well as peculiarcore-collapse sne.

1304.3320	super luminous ic supernovae: catching a magnetar by the tail	we report extensive observational data for five of the lowest redshiftsuper-luminous type ic supernovae (sl-sne ic) discovered to date, namelyptf10hgi, sn2011ke, ptf11rks, sn2011kf and sn2012il. photometric imaging of thetransients at +50 to +230 days after peak combined with host galaxy subtractionreveals a luminous tail phase for four of these sl-sne. a high resolution,optical and near infrared spectrum from xshooter provides detection of a broadhe i $\lambda$10830 emission line in the spectrum (+50d) of sn2012il, revealingthat at least some sl-sne ic are not completely helium free. at first sight,the tail luminosity decline rates that we measure are consistent with theradioactive decay of \co, and would require 1-4m of \ni to produce theluminosity. these \ni masses cannot be made consistent with the short diffusiontimes at peak, and indeed are insufficient to power the peak luminosity. weinstead favour energy deposition by newborn magnetars as the power source forthese objects. a semi-analytical diffusion model with energy input from thespin-down of a magnetar reproduces the extensive lightcurve data well. themodel predictions of ejecta velocities and temperatures which are required arein reasonable agreement with those determined from our observations. we derivemagnetar energies of $0.4\lesssim e$($10^{51}$erg) $\lesssim6.9$ and ejectamasses of $2.3\lesssim m_{ej}$(\m) $\lesssim 8.6$. the sample of five sl-sne icpresented here, combined with sn 2010gx - the best sampled sl-sne ic so far -point toward an explosion driven by a magnetar as a viable explanation for allsl-sne ic.

1305.1851	optical and near-infrared observations of sn 2011dh - the first 100 days	we present optical and near-infrared (nir) photometry and spectroscopy of thetype iib supernova (sn) 2011dh for the first 100 days. we complement ourextensive dataset with swift ultra-violet (uv) and spitzer mid-infrared (mir)data to build a uv to mir bolometric lightcurve using both photometric andspectroscopic data. hydrodynamical modelling of the sn based on this bolometriclightcurve have been presented in bersten (2012). we find that the absorptionminimum for the hydrogen lines is never seen below ~11000 km/s but approachesthis value as the lines get weaker. this suggests that the interface betweenthe helium core and hydrogen rich envelope is located near this velocity inagreement with the bersten et al. (2012) he4r270 ejecta model. spectralmodelling of the hydrogen lines using this ejecta model supports the conclusionand we find a hydrogen mass of 0.01-0.04 solar masses to be consistent with theobserved spectral evolution. we estimate that the photosphere reaches thehelium core at 5-7 days whereas the helium lines appear between ~10 and ~15days, close to the photosphere and then move outward in velocity until ~40days. this suggests that increasing non-thermal excitation due to decreasingoptical depth for the gamma-rays is driving the early evolution of these lines.we also provide and discuss pre- and post-explosion observations of the sn sitewhich shows a reduction by 75 percent in flux at the position of the yellowsupergiant coincident with sn 2011dh. the b, v and r band decline rates of0.0073, 0.0090 and 0.0053 mag/day respectively are consistent with theremaining flux being emitted by the sn. hence we find that the star was indeedthe progenitor of sn 2011dh as previously suggested by maund et al. (2011) andwhich is also consistent with the results from the hydrodynamical modelling.

1305.5789	comparison of progenitor mass estimates for the type iip sn 2012a	we present the one-year long observing campaign of sn 2012a which exploded inthe nearby (9.8 mpc) irregular galaxy ngc 3239. the photometric evolution isthat of a normal type iip supernova. the absolute maximum magnitude, with mb =-16.23 +- 0.16 mag. sn2012a reached a peak luminosity of about 2x10**42 erg/s,which is brighter than those of other sne with a similar 56ni mass. the latterwas estimated from the luminosity in the exponential tail of the light curveand found to be m(56ni) = 0.011 +-0.004 msun. the spectral evolution of sn2012a is also typical of sn iip, from the early spectra dominated by a bluecontinuum and very broad (~10**4 km/s) balmer lines, to the late-photosphericspectra characterized by prominent p-cygni features of metal lines (fe ii, scii, ba ii, ti ii, ca ii, na id). the photospheric velocity is moderately low,~3x10**3 km/s at 50 days, for the low optical depth metal lines. the nebularspectrum obtained 394 days after the shock breakout shows the typical featuresof sne iip and the strength of the [o i] doublet suggests a progenitor ofintermediate mass, similar to sn 2004et (~15 msun). a candidate progenitor forsn 2012a has been identified in deep, pre-explosion k'-band gemini north (niri)images, and found to be consistent with a star with a bolometric magnitude-7.08+-0.36 (log l/lsun = 4.73 +- 0.14$ dex). the magnitude of the recoveredprogenitor in archival images points toward a moderate-mass 10.5 (-2/+4.5) msunstar as the precursor of sn 2012a. the explosion parameters and progenitor masswere also estimated by means of a hydrodynamical model, fitting the bolometriclight curve, the velocity and the temperature evolution. we found a best fitfor a kinetic energy of 0.48 foe, an initial radius of 1.8x10**13 cm and ejectamass of 12.5 msun.

1310.4417	the superluminous supernova ps1-11ap: bridging the gap between low and  high redshift	we present optical photometric and spectroscopic coverage of thesuperluminous supernova (slsn) ps1-11ap, discovered with the pan-starrs1 mediumdeep survey at z = 0.524. this intrinsically blue transient rose slowly toreach a peak magnitude of m_u = -21.4 mag and bolometric luminosity of 8 x10^43 ergs^-1 before settling onto a relatively shallow gradient of decline.the observed decline is significantly slower than those of the superluminoustype ic sne which have been the focus of much recent attention. spectroscopicsimilarities with the lower redshift sn2007bi and a decline rate similar to56co decay timescale initially indicated that this transient could be acandidate for a pair instability supernova (pisn) explosion. overall thetransient appears quite similar to sn2007bi and the lower redshift objectptf12dam. the extensive data set, from 30 days before peak to 230 days after,allows a detailed and quantitative comparison with published models of pisnexplosions. we find that the ps1-11ap data do not match these model explosionparameters well, supporting the recent claim that these sne are not pairinstability explosions. we show that ps1-11ap has many features in common withthe faster declining superluminous ic supernovae and the lightcurve evolutioncan also be quantitatively explained by the magnetar spin down model. at aredshift of z = 0.524 the observer frame optical coverage providescomprehensive restframe uv data and allows us to compare it with thesuperluminous sne recently found at high redshifts between z = 2-4. while thesehigh-z explosions are still plausible pisn candidates, they match thephotometric evolution of ps1-11ap and hence could be counterparts to this lowerredshift transient.

1310.4446	slowly fading super-luminous supernovae that are not pair-instability  explosions	super-luminous supernovae that radiate more than 10^44 ergs per second attheir peak luminosity have recently been discovered in faint galaxies atredshifts of 0.1-4. some evolve slowly, resembling models of 'pair-instability'supernovae. such models involve stars with original masses 140-260 times thatof the sun that now have carbon-oxygen cores of 65-30 solar masses. in thesestars, the photons that prevent gravitational collapse are converted toelectron-positron pairs, causing rapid contraction and thermonuclearexplosions. many solar masses of 56ni are synthesized; this isotope decays to56fe via 56co, powering bright light curves. such massive progenitors areexpected to have formed from metal-poor gas in the early universe. recently,supernova 2007bi in a galaxy at redshift 0.127 (about 12 billion years afterthe big bang) with a metallicity one-third that of the sun was observed to looklike a fading pair-instability supernova. here we report observations of twoslow-to-fade super-luminous supernovae that show relatively fast rise times andblue colours, which are incompatible with pair-instability models. theirlate-time light-curve and spectral similarities to supernova 2007bi call thenature of that event into question. our early spectra closely resemble typicalfast-declining super-luminous supernovae, which are not powered byradioactivity. modelling our observations with 10-16 solar masses ofmagnetar-energized ejecta demonstrates the possibility of a common explosionmechanism. the lack of unambiguous nearby pair-instability events suggests thattheir local rate of occurrence is less than 6x10^-6 times that of thecore-collapse rate.

1311.2525	sn 2009n: linking normal and subluminous type ii-p sne	we present ultraviolet, optical, near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy ofsn 2009n in ngc 4487. this object is a type ii-p supernova with spectraresembling those of subluminous ii-p supernovae, while its bolometricluminosity is similar to that of the intermediate luminosity sn 2008in. wecreated synow models of the plateau phase spectra for line identification andto measure the expansion velocity. in the near-infrared spectra we find signsindicating possible weak interaction between the supernova ejecta and thepre-existing circumstellar material. these signs are also present in thepreviously unpublished near-infrared spectra of sn 2008in. the distance to sn2009n is determined via the expanding photosphere method and the standardcandle method as $d= 21.6 \pm 1.1\,{\mathrm {mpc}}$. the produced nickel-massis estimated to be $\sim 0.020 \pm 0.004\,{\mathrm m_\odot}$. we infer thephysical properties of the progenitor at the explosion through hydrodynamicalmodelling of the observables. we find the values of the total energy as $\sim0.48 \times 10^{51}\, {\mathrm {erg}}$, the ejected mass as $\sim11.5\,{\mathrm m_\odot}$, and the initial radius as $\sim 287\,{\mathrmr_\odot}$.

1311.4525	optical and near-ir observations of the faint and fast 2008ha-like  supernova 2010ae	a comprehensive set of optical and near-infrared (nir) photometry andspectroscopy is presented for the faint and fast 2008ha-like supernova (sn)2010ae. contingent on the adopted value of host extinction, sn 2010ae reached apeak brightness of -13.8 &gt; m_v &gt; -15.3 mag, while modeling of the uvoir lightcurve suggests it produced 0.003--0.007 m_sun of (56)ni, ejected 0.30--0.60m_sun of material, and had an explosion energy of 0.04--0.30x10^51 erg. thevalues of these explosion parameters are similar to the peculiar sn 2008ha--for which we also present previously unpublished early phase optical and nirlight curves-- and places these two transients at the faint end of the2002cx-like sn population. detailed inspection of the post maximum nirspectroscopic sequence indicates the presence of a multitude of spectralfeatures, which are identified through synapps modeling to be mainly attributedto co ii. comparison with a collection of published and unpublished nir spectraof other 2002cx-like sne, reveals that a co ii footprint is ubiquitous to thissubclass of transients, providing a link to type ia sne. a visual-wavelengthspectrum of sn 2010ae obtained at +252 days past maximum shows a strikingresemblance to a similar epoch spectrum of sn 2002cx. however, subtledifferences in the strength and ratio of calcium emission features, as well asdiversity among similar epoch spectra of other 2002cx-like sne indicates arange of physical conditions of the ejecta, highlighting the heterogeneousnature of this peculiar class of transients.

1401.2368	sn2011hs: a fast and faint type iib supernova from a supergiant  progenitor	observations spanning a large wavelength range, from x-ray to radio, of thetype iib supernova 2011hs are presented, covering its evolution during thefirst year after explosion. the optical light curve presents a narrower shapeand a fainter luminosity at peak than previously observed for type iib sne.high expansion velocities are measured from the broad absorption h i and he ilines. from the comparison of the bolometric light curve and the time evolutionof the photospheric velocities with hydrodynamical models, we found that sn2011hs is consistent with the explosion of a 3-4 msun he-core progenitor star,corresponding to a main sequence mass of 12-15 msun, that ejected a mass of56ni of about 0.04 msun, with an energy of e= 8.5 x 10^50 erg. such a low-massprogenitor scenario is in full agreement with the modelling of the nebularspectrum taken at $\sim$215 days from maximum. from the modelling of theadiabatic cooling phase, we infer a progenitor radius of $\approx$500-600 rsun,clearly pointing to an extended progenitor star. the radio light curve of sn2011hs yields a peak luminosity similar to that of sn 1993j, but with a highermass loss rate and a wind density possibly more similar to that of sn 2001ig.although no significant deviations from a smooth decline have been found in theradio light curves, we cannot rule out the presence of a binary companion star.

1401.5426	underluminous type ii plateau supernovae: ii. pointing towards moderate  mass precursors	we present new data for five under-luminous type ii-plateau supernovae (sneiip), namely sn 1999gn, sn 2002gd, sn 2003z, sn 2004eg and sn 2006ov. this newsample of low-luminosity sne iip (ll sne iip) is analyzed together with similarobjects studied in the past. all of them show a flat light curve plateaulasting about 100 days, an under luminous late-time exponential tail, intrinsiccolours that are unusually red, and spectra showing prominent and narrowp-cygni lines. a velocity of the ejected material below 10^3 km/s is inferredfrom measurements at the end of the plateau. the 56ni masses ejected in theexplosion are very small (less than 10^-2 solar masses). we investigate thecorrelations among 56ni mass, expansion velocity of the ejecta and absolutemagnitude in the middle of the plateau, confirming the main findings of hamuy(2003), according to which events showing brighter plateau and larger expansionvelocities are expected to produce more 56ni. we propose that these faintobjects represent the low luminosity tail of a continuous distribution inparameters space of sne iip. the physical properties of the progenitors at theexplosion are estimated through the hydrodynamical modeling of the observablesfor two representative events of this class, namely sn 2005cs and sn 2008in. wefind that the majority of ll sne iip, and quite possibly all, originate in thecore-collapse of intermediate mass stars, in the mass range 10-15 solar masses.

1402.1631	selecting superluminous supernovae in faint galaxies from the first year  of the pan-starrs1 medium deep survey	the pan-starrs1 (ps1) survey has obtained imaging in 5 bands (grizy_p1) over10 medium deep survey (mds) fields covering a total of 70 square degrees. thispaper describes the search for apparently hostless supernovae (sne) within thefirst year of ps1 mds data with an aim of discovering new superluminoussupernovae (slsne). a total of 249 hostless transients were discovered down toa limiting magnitude of m_ab ~ 23.5, of which 76 were classified as type iasne. there were 57 sne with complete light curves that are likely core-collapsesne (ccsne) or slsne and 12 of these have had spectra taken. of these 12hostless, non-type ia sne, 7 were slsne of type ic at redshifts between0.5-1.4. this illustrates that the discovery rate of type ic slsne can bemaximised by concentrating on hostless transients and removing normal sne ia.we present data for two new possible slsne; ps1-10pm (z = 1.206) and ps1-10ahf(z = 1.1), and estimate the rate of slsne-ic to be between 3^{+3}_{-2} *10^{-5} and 8^{+2}_{-1} * 10^{-5} of the ccsne rate within 0.3 &lt;= z &lt;= 1.4 byapplying a monte-carlo technique. the rate of slowly evolving, sn2007bi-likeexplosions is estimated as a factor of 10 lower than this range.

1402.1765	clues to the nature of sn 2009ip from photometric and spectroscopic  evolution to late times	we present time series photometric and spectroscopic data for the transientsn 2009ip from the start of its outburst in september 2012 until november 2013.this data was collected primarily with the new robotic capabilities of the lascumbres observatory global telescope network, a specialized facility for timedomain astrophysics, and includes supporting high-resolution spectroscopy fromthe southern astrophysical research telescope, kitt peak national observatory,and gemini observatory. based on our nightly photometric monitoring, weinterpret the strength and timing of fluctuations in the light curve asinteractions between fast-moving ejecta and an inhomogeneous csm produced bypast eruptions of this massive luminous blue variable (lbv) star. our timeseries of spectroscopy in 2012 reveals that, as the continuum and narrowh-alpha flux from csm interactions declines, the broad component of h-alphapersists with sn-like velocities that are not typically seen in lbvs or snimpostor events. at late times we find that sn 2009ip continues to declineslowly, at &lt;0.01 magnitudes per day, with small fluctuations in slope similarto type iin supernovae (sne iin) or sn impostors, but no further lbv-likeactivity. the late time spectrum features broad calcium lines similar to bothlate time sne and sn impostors. in general, we find that the photometric andspectroscopic evolution of sn 2009ip is more similar to sne iin than eithercontinued eruptions of an lbv star or sn impostors. in this context, we discussthe implications for episodic mass loss during the late stages of massive starevolution.

1403.6708	the rise and fall of the type ib supernova iptf13bvn - not a massive  wolf-rayet star	we investigate iptf13bvn, a core-collapse (cc) supernova (sn) in the nearbyspiral galaxy ngc 5806. this object was discovered by the intermediate palomartransient factory very soon after the explosion and was classified as astripped-envelope cc sn, likely of type ib. a possible progenitor detection inpre-explosion hubble space telescope (hst) images was reported, making this theonly sn ib with such an identification. based on photometry of the progenitorcandidate and on early-time sn data, it was argued that the progenitorcandidate is consistent with a single, massive wolf-rayet (wr) star.  in this work we present follow-up multi-band light-curves and optical spectraof iptf13bvn. we perform spectral line analysis to track the evolution of thesn ejecta, construct a bolometric light curve and perform hydrodynamicalcalculations to model this light curve to constrain the synthesized radioactivenickel mass and the total ejecta mass of the sn. late-time photometry isanalyzed to constrain the amount of oxygen. furthermore, image registration ofpre- and post-explosion hst images is performed.  our hst astrometry confirms the location of the progenitor candidate, andfollow-up spectra securely classify iptf13bvn as a sn ib. our hydrodynamicalmodel indicates an ejecta mass of 1.9 solar masses and radioactive nickel massof 0.05 solar masses. the model fit requires the nickel to be highly mixed outin the ejecta. the late-time nebular r'-band luminosity is not consistent withpredictions based on the expected oxygen nucleosynthesis in very massive stars.  our bolometric light curve of iptf13bvn is not consistent with the previouslyproposed single massive wr-star progenitor scenario. the ejecta mass and thelate-time oxygen emission are both significantly lower than what would beexpected from a single wr progenitor with a main-sequence mass of at least 30solar masses.

1404.1002	early ultraviolet emission in the type ia supernova lsq12gdj: no  evidence for ongoing shock interaction	we present photospheric-phase observations of lsq12gdj, a slowly-declining,uv-bright type ia supernova. classified well before maximum light, lsq12gdj hasextinction-corrected absolute magnitude $m_b = -19.8$, and pre-maximumspectroscopic evolution similar to sn 1991t and the super-chandrasekhar-mass sn2007if. we use ultraviolet photometry from swift, ground-based opticalphotometry, and corrections from a near-infrared photometric template toconstruct the bolometric (1600-23800 \aa) light curve out to 45 days past$b$-band maximum light. we estimate that lsq12gdj produced $0.96 \pm 0.07$$m_\odot$ of $^{56}$ni, with an ejected mass near or slightly above thechandrasekhar mass. as much as 27% of the flux at the earliest observed phases,and 17% at maximum light, is emitted bluewards of 3300 \aa. the absence ofexcess luminosity at late times, the cutoff of the spectral energy distributionbluewards of 3000 \aa, and the absence of narrow line emission and strong na id absorption all argue against a significant contribution from ongoing shockinteraction. however, up to 10% of lsq12gdj's luminosity near maximum lightcould be produced by the release of trapped radiation, including kinetic energythermalized during a brief interaction with a compact, hydrogen-poor envelope(radius $&lt; 10^{13}$ cm) shortly after explosion; such an envelope arisesgenerically in double-degenerate merger scenarios.

1405.1325	super-luminous supernovae from pessto	we present optical spectra and light curves for three hydrogen-poorsuper-luminous supernovae followed by the public eso spectroscopic survey oftransient objects (pessto). time series spectroscopy from a few days aftermaximum light to 100 days later shows them to be fairly typical of this class,with spectra dominated by ca ii, mg ii, fe ii and si ii, which evolve slowlyover most of the post-peak photospheric phase. we determine bolometric lightcurves and apply simple fitting tools, based on the diffusion of energy inputby magnetar spin-down, 56ni decay, and collision of the ejecta with an opaquecircumstellar shell. we investigate how the heterogeneous light curves of oursample (combined with others from the literature) can help to constrain thepossible mechanisms behind these events. we have followed these events tobeyond 100-200 days after peak, to disentangle host galaxy light from fadingsupernova flux and to differentiate between the models, which predict diversebehaviour at this phase. models powered by radioactivity require unrealisticparameters to reproduce the observed light curves, as found by previousstudies. both magnetar heating and circumstellar interaction still appear to beviable candidates. a large diversity is emerging in observed tail-phaseluminosities, with magnetar models failing in some cases to predict the rapiddrop in flux. this would suggest either that magnetars are not responsible, orthat the x-ray flux from the magnetar wind is not fully trapped. the lightcurve of one object shows a distinct re-brightening at around 100d aftermaximum light. we argue that this could result either from multiple shells ofcircumstellar material, or from a magnetar ionisation front breaking out of theejecta.

1405.3970	early observations and analysis of the type ia sn 2014j in m82	we present optical and near infrared (nir) observations of the nearby type iasn 2014j. seventeen optical and twenty-three nir spectra were obtained from 10days before ($-$10d) to 10 days after (+10d) the time of maximum $b$-bandbrightness. the relative strengths of absorption features and their patterns ofdevelopment can be compared at one day intervals throughout most of thisperiod. carbon is not detected in the optical spectra, but we identify ci$\lambda$ 1.0693 in the nir spectra. we find that mgii lines with highoscillator strengths have higher initial velocities than other mgii lines. weshow that the velocity differences can be explained by differences in opticaldepths due to oscillator strengths. the spectra of sn 2014j show it is a normalsn ia, but many parameters are near the boundaries between normal andhigh-velocity subclasses. the velocities for oi, mgii, siii, sii, caii and feiisuggest that sn 2014j has a layered structure with little or no mixing. thatresult is consistent with the delayed detonation explosion models. we alsoreport photometric observations, obtained from $-$10d to +29d, in the $ubvrijh$and $k_s$ bands. sn 2014j is about 3 magnitudes fainter than a normal sn ia atthe distance of m82, which we attribute to extinction in the host. the templatefitting package snoopy is used to interpret the light curves and to derivephotometric parameters. using $r_v$ = 1.46, which is consistent with previousstudies, snoopy finds that $a_v = 1.80$ for $e(b-v)_{host}=1.23 \pm 0.01$ mag.the maximum $b$-band brightness of $-19.19 \pm 0.10$ mag was reached onfebruary 1.74 ut $ \pm 0.13$ days and the supernova had a decline parameter of$\delta m_{15}=1.11 \pm 0.02$ mag.

(2014) steady-state nlte models, and thepreferred 12 solar masses (initial mass) model shows a good overall agreementwith the observed lightcurves. we find an excess in the k and the mir bandsdeveloping between days 100 and 250, during which an increase in the opticaldecline rate is also observed. a local origin of the excess is suggested by thedepth of the hei 2.058 micron absorption. steady-state nlte models with amodest dust opacity in the core, turned on during this period, reproduce theobserved behaviour, but an additional excess in the spitzer 4.5 micron bandremains. co first-overtone band emission is detected at day 206, and possiblyat day 89, and assuming the additional excess to be dominated by co fundamentalband emission, we find fundamental to first-overtone band ratios considerablyhigher than observed in sn 1987a. this paper concludes our extensiveobservational and modelling work on sn 2011dh. the results from hydrodynamicalmodelling, steady-state nlte modelling, and stellar evolutionary progenitoranalysis are all consistent, and suggest an initial mass of 12 solar masses forthe progenitor.

1408.1093	comprehensive observations of the bright and energetic type iax sn  2012z: interpretation as a chandrasekhar mass white dwarf explosion	we present uv through nir broad-band photometry, and optical and nirspectroscopy of type iax supernova 2012z. the data set consists of both earlyand late-time observations, including the first late phase nir spectrumobtained for a spectroscopically classified sn iax. simple model calculationsof its bolometric light curve suggest sn 2012z produced ~0.3 m_sun of (56)ni,ejected about a chandrasekhar mass of material, and had an explosion energy of~10^51 erg, making it one of the brightest and most energetic sn iax yetobserved. the late phase nir spectrum of sn 2012z is found to broadly resemblesimilar epoch spectra of normal sne ia; however, like other sne iax,corresponding visual-wavelength spectra differ substantially compared to allsupernova types. constraints from the distribution of imes, e.g. silicon andmagnesium, indicate that the outer ejecta did not experience significant mixingduring or after burning, and the late phase nir line profiles suggests most ofthe (56)ni is produced during high density burning. the various observationalproperties of sn 2012z are found to be consistent with the theoreticalexpectations of a chandrasekhar mass white dwarf progenitor that experiences apulsational delayed detonation, which produced several tenths of a solar massof (56)ni during the deflagration burning phase and little (or no) (56)niduring the detonation phase. within this scenario only a moderate amount ofrayleigh-taylor mixing occurs both during the deflagration and fallback phaseof the pulsation, and the layered structure of the imes is a product of thesubsequent denotation phase. the fact that the sne iax population does notfollow a tight brightness-decline relation similar to sne ia can then beunderstood in the framework of variable amounts of mixing during pulsationalrebound and variable amounts of (56)ni production during the early subsonicphase of expansion.

1501.06491	supernova 2013by: a type iil supernova with a iip-like light curve drop	we present multi-band ultraviolet and optical light curves, as well asvisual-wavelength and near-infrared spectroscopy of the type ii linear (iil)supernova (sn) 2013by. we show that sn 2013by and other sne iil in theliterature, after their linear decline phase that start after maximum, have asharp light curve decline similar to that seen in type ii plateau (iip)supernovae. this light curve feature has rarely been observed in other sne iildue to their relative rarity and the intrinsic faintness of this particularphase of the light curve. we suggest that the presence of this drop could beused as a physical parameter to distinguish between subclasses of sne ii,rather than their light curve decline rate shortly after peak. close inspectionof the spectra of sn 2013by indicate asymmetric line profiles and signatures ofhigh-velocity hydrogen. late (less than 90 days after explosion) near-infraredspectra of sn 2013by exhibit oxygen lines, indicating significant mixing withinthe ejecta. from the late-time light curve, we estimate that 0.029 solar massof 56ni was synthesized during the explosion. it is also shown that the v -bandlight curve slope is responsible for part of the scatter in the luminosity (vmagnitude 50 days after explosion) vs. 56ni relation. our observations of sn2013by and other sne iil through the onset of the nebular phase indicate thattheir progenitors are similar to those of sne iip.

1502.04945	massive stars exploding in a he-rich circumstellar medium. v.  observations of the slow-evolving sn ibn ogle-2012-sn-006	we present optical observations of the peculiar type ibn supernova (sn ibn)ogle-2012-sn-006, discovered and monitored by the ogle-iv survey, andspectroscopically followed by pessto at late phases. stringent pre-discoverylimits constrain the explosion epoch with fair precision to jd = 2456203.8 +-4.0. the rise time to the i-band light curve maximum is about two weeks. theobject reaches the peak absolute magnitude m(i) = -19.65 +- 0.19 on jd =2456218.1 +- 1.8. after maximum, the light curve declines for about 25 dayswith a rate of 4 mag per 100d. the symmetric i-band peak resembles that ofcanonical type ib/c supernovae (sne), whereas sne ibn usually exhibitasymmetric and narrower early-time light curves. since 25 days past maximum,the light curve flattens with a decline rate slower than that of the 56co to56fe decay, although at very late phases it steepens to approach that rate. anearly-time spectrum is dominated by a blue continuum, with only a marginalevidence for the presence of he i lines marking this sn type. this spectrumshows broad absorptions bluewards than 5000a, likely o ii lines, which aresimilar to spectral features observed in super-luminous sne at early epochs.the object has been spectroscopically monitored by pessto from 90 to 180 daysafter peak, and these spectra show the typical features observed in a number ofsn 2006jc-like events, including a blue spectral energy distribution andprominent and narrow (v(fwhm) ~ 1900 km/s) he i emission lines. this suggeststhat the ejecta are interacting with he-rich circumstellar material. thedetection of broad (10000 km/s) o i and ca ii features likely produced in thesn ejecta (including the [o i] 6300a,6364a doublet in the latest spectra) lendssupport to the interpretation of ogle-2012-sn-006 as a core-collapse event.

1502.04946	massive stars exploding in a he-rich circumstellar medium. iv.  transitional type ibn supernovae	we present ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared data of the type ibnsupernovae (sne) 2010al and 2011hw. sn 2010al reaches an absolute magnitude atpeak of m(r) = -18.86 +- 0.21. its early light curve shows similarities withnormal sne ib, with a rise to maximum slower than most sne ibn. the spectra aredominated by a blue continuum at early stages, with narrow p-cygni he i linesindicating the presence of a slow-moving, he-rich circumstellar medium. atlater epochs the spectra well match those of the prototypical sn ibn 2006jc,although the broader lines suggest that a significant amount of he was stillpresent in the stellar envelope at the time of the explosion. sn 2011hw issomewhat different. it was discovered after the first maximum, but the lightcurve shows a double-peak. the absolute magnitude at discovery is similar tothat of the second peak (m(r) = -18.59 +- 0.25), and slightly fainter than theaverage of sne ibn. though the spectra of sn 2011hw are similar to those of sn2006jc, coronal lines and narrow balmer lines are cleary detected. thisindicates substantial interaction of the sn ejecta with he-rich, but noth-free, circumstellar material. the spectra of sn 2011hw suggest that it is atransitional sn ibn/iin event similar to sn 2005la. while for sn 2010al thespectro-photometric evolution favours a h-deprived wolf-rayet progenitor (ofwn-type), we agree with the conclusion of smith et al.

1502.04949	massive stars exploding in a he-rich circumstellar medium. vi.  observations of two distant type ibn supernova candidates discovered by la  silla-quest	we present optical observations of the peculiar stripped-envelope supernovae(sne) lsq12btw and lsq13ccw discovered by the la silla-quest survey. lsq12btwreaches an absolute peak magnitude of m(g) = -19.3 +- 0.2, and shows anasymmetric light curve. stringent prediscovery limits constrain its rise timeto maximum light to less than 4 days, with a slower post-peak luminositydecline, similar to that experienced by the prototypical sn~ibn 2006jc.lsq13ccw is somewhat different: while it also exhibits a very fast rise tomaximum, it reaches a fainter absolute peak magnitude (m(g) = -18.4 +- 0.2),and experiences an extremely rapid post-peak decline similar to that observedin the peculiar sn~ib 2002bj. a stringent prediscovery limit and an earlymarginal detection of lsq13ccw allow us to determine the explosion time with anuncertainty of 1 day. the spectra of lsq12btw show the typical narrow he~iemission lines characterising type ibn sne, suggesting that the sn ejecta areinteracting with he-rich circumstellar material. the he i lines in the spectraof lsq13ccw exhibit weak narrow emissions superposed on broad components. anunresolved halpha line is also detected, suggesting a tentative type ibn/iinclassification. as for other sne~ibn, we argue that lsq12btw and lsq13ccwlikely result from the explosions of wolf-rayet stars that experiencedinstability phases prior to core collapse. we inspect the host galaxies of sneibn, and we show that all of them but one are hosted in spiral galaxies, likelyin environments spanning a wide metallicity range.

1502.06034	a comparative study of type ii-p and ii-l supernova rise times as  exemplified by the case of lsq13cuw	we report on our findings based on the analysis of observations of the typeii-l supernova lsq13cuw within the framework of currently accepted physicalpredictions of core-collapse supernova explosions. lsq13cuw was discoveredwithin a day of explosion, hitherto unprecedented for type ii-l supernovae.this motivated a comparative study of type ii-p and ii-l supernovae withrelatively well-constrained explosion epochs and rise times to maximum(optical) light. from our sample of twenty such events, we find evidence of apositive correlation between the duration of the rise and the peak brightness.on average, sne ii-l tend to have brighter peak magnitudes and longer risetimes than sne ii-p. however, this difference is clearest only at the extremeends of the rise time versus peak brightness relation. using two differentanalytical models, we performed a parameter study to investigate the physicalparameters that control the rise time behaviour. in general, the modelsqualitatively reproduce aspects of the observed trends. we find that thebrightness of the optical peak increases for larger progenitor radii andexplosion energies, and decreases for larger masses. the dependence of the risetime on mass and explosion energy is smaller than the dependence on theprogenitor radius. we find no evidence that the progenitors of sne ii-l havesignificantly smaller radii than those of sne ii-p.

1505.01078	lsq14bdq: a type ic super-luminous supernova with a double-peaked light  curve	we present data for lsq14bdq, a hydrogen-poor super-luminous supernova (slsn)discovered by the la silla quest survey and classified by the public esospectroscopic survey of transient objects. the spectrum and light curve arevery similar to slow-declining slsne such as ptf12dam. however, detectionswithin ~1 day after explosion show a bright and relatively fast initial peak,lasting for ~15 days, prior to the usual slow rise to maximum light. thebroader, main peak can be fit with either central engine or circumstellarinteraction models. we discuss the implications of the precursor peak in thecontext of these models. it is too bright and narrow to be explained as anormal 56ni-powered sn, and we suggest that interaction models may struggle tofit the two peaks simultaneously. we propose that the initial peak may arisefrom the post-shock cooling of extended stellar material, and reheating by acentral engine drives the second peak. in this picture, we show that anexplosion energy of ~2x10^{52} erg and a progenitor radius of a few hundredsolar radii would be required to power the early emission. the competing enginemodels involve rapidly spinning magnetars (neutron stars) or fall-backaccretion onto a central black hole. the prompt energy required may favour theblack hole scenario. the bright initial peak effectively rules out a compactwolf-rayet star as a progenitor, since the inferred energies and ejected massesbecome unphysical.

1505.05780	explosion of a massive, he-rich star at z=0.16	we present spectroscopic and photometric data of the peculiar sn 2001gh,discovered by the 'southern intermediate redshift eso supernova search'(stress) at a redshift z=0.16. sn 2001gh has relatively high luminosity atmaximum (m_b = -18.55 mag), while the light curve shows a broad peak. anearly-time spectrum shows an almost featureless, blue continuum with a few weakand shallow p-cygni lines that we attribute to hei. hei lines remain the onlyspectral features visible in a subsequent spectrum, obtained one month later. aremarkable property of sn 2001gh is the lack of significant spectral evolutionover the temporal window of nearly one month separating the two spectra. inorder to explain the properties of sn 2001gh, three powering mechanism areexplored, including radioactive decays of a moderately large amount of 56ni,magnetar spin-down, and interaction of sn ejecta with circumstellar medium. wefavour the latter scenario, with a sn ib wrapped in a dense, circumstellarshell. the fact that no models provide an excellent fit with observations,confirms the troublesome interpretation of the nature of sn 2001gh. a rateestimate for sn 2001gh-like event is also provided, confirming the intrinsicrarity of these objects.

0805.1914	the type iib sn 2008ax: spectral and light curve evolution	we present spectroscopy and photometry of the he-rich supernova (sn) 2008ax.the early-time spectra show prominent p-cygni h lines, which decrease with timeand disappear completely about two months after the explosion. in the sameperiod he i lines become the most prominent spectral features. sn 2008axdisplays the ordinary spectral evolution of a type iib supernova. a stringentpre-discovery limit constrains the time of the shock breakout of sn 2008ax towithin only a few hours. its light curve, which peaks in the b band about 20days after the explosion, strongly resembles that of other he-richcore-collapse supernovae. the observed evolution of sn 2008ax is consistentwith the explosion of a young wolf-rayet (of wnl type) star, which had retaineda thin, low-mass shell of its original h envelope. the overall characteristicsof sn 2008ax are reminiscent of those of sn 1993j, except for a likely smallerh mass. this may account for the findings that the progenitor of sn 2008ax wasa wnl star and not a k supergiant as in the case of sn 1993j, that a prominentearly-time peak is missing in the light curve of sn 2008ax, and that halpha isobserved at higher velocities in sn 2008ax than in sn 1993j.

1509.03733	sn 2011fu: a type iib supernova with a luminous double-peaked light  curve	we present optical and near infrared observations of the type iib supernova(sn) 2011fu from a few days to $\sim300$ d after explosion. the sn presents adouble-peaked light curve (lc) similar to that of sn 1993j, although moreluminous and with a longer cooling phase after the primary peak. the spectralevolution is also similar to sn 1993j's, with hydrogen dominating the spectrato $\sim40$ d, then helium gaining strength, and nebular emission linesappearing from $\sim60$ d post-explosion. the velocities derived from thep-cygni absorptions are overall similar to those of other type iib sne. we havefound a strong similarity between the oxygen and magnesium line profiles atlate times, which suggests that these lines are forming at the same locationwithin the ejecta. the hydrodynamical modelling of the pseudo-bolometric lc andthe observed photospheric velocities suggest that sn 2011fu was the explosionof an extended star ($\rm r\sim450$ r$_\odot$), in which 1.3 $\times 10^{51}$erg of kinetic energy were released and 0.15 m$_{\rm \odot}$ of $^{56}$ni weresynthesised. in addition, a better reproduction of the observed earlypseudo-bolometric lc is achieved if a more massive h-rich-envelope than forother type iib sne is considered (0.3 m$_{\rm \odot}$). the hydrodynamicalmodelling of the lc and the comparison of our late-time spectra with nebularspectral models for type iib sne, point to a progenitor for sn 2011fu with azams mass of 13-18 m$_{\rm \odot}$.

astro-ph;0407216	death rate of massive stars at redshift ~0.3	we report the first result of a supernova search program designed to measurethe evolution of the supernova rate with redshift. to make the comparison withlocal rates more significant we copied, as much as possible, the samecomputation recepies as for the measurements of local rates. moreover, weexploited the multicolor images and the photometric redshift technique tocharacterize the galaxy sample and accurately estimate the detectionefficiency.  combining our data with the recently published meaurements of the sn ia rateat different redshifts, we derived the first, direct measurement of the corecollapse supernova rate at z = 0.26 as r_cc = 1.45^{+0.55}{-0.45} h^2 snu[h=h_0/75]. this is a factor three {+/- 50%)} larger than the local estimate.the increase for a look back time of "only" 2.8 gyr is more rapid thanpredicted by most of the published models of the sn rate evolution.core-collapse sn rates measure the death rate of massive star and, because ofthe short time scale of evolution, can be translated in a measurement of theongoing sfr. assuming a salpeter imf and the standard scenario forcore-collapse progenitors we derived to an estimate of the star formation rateat redshift 3.1^{+1.1}{-1.0} 10^-2 h^3 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^{-3} which compare verywell with a recent estimate based on the measurement of the halpha luminositydensity at the same redshift.

astro-ph;0604293	the properties of the "standard" type ic supernova 1994i from spectral  models	the properties of the type ic supernova sn 1994i are re-investigated. thisobject is often referred to as a "standard sn ic" although it exhibited anextremely fast light curve and unusually blue early-time spectra. in addition,the observations were affected by significant dust extinction. a series ofspectral models are computed based on the explosion model co21 (iwamoto et al.1994) using a monte carlo transport spectral synthesis code. overall thedensity structure and abundances of the explosion model are able to reproducethe photospheric spectra well. reddening is estimated to be e(b-v)=0.30 mag, alower value than previously proposed. a model of the nebular spectrum of sn1994i points toward a slightly larger ejecta mass than that of co21. thephotospheric spectra show a large abundance of iron-group elements at earlyepochs, indicating that mixing within the ejecta must have been significant. wepresent an improved light curve model which also requires the presence of 56niin the outer layers of the ejecta.

astro-ph;0703663	a giant outburst two years before the core-collapse of a massive star	the death of massive stars produces a variety of supernovae, which are linkedto the structure of the exploding stars. the detection of several precursorstars of type ii supernovae have been reported, however we do not yet havedirect information on the progenitors of the hydrogen deficient type ib and icsupernovae. here we report that the peculiar type ib supernova sn2006jc isspatially coincident with a bright optical transient that occurred in 2004.spectroscopic and photometric monitoring of the supernova leads us to suggestthat the progenitor was a carbon-oxygen wolf-rayet star embedded within ahelium-rich circumstellar medium. there are different possible explanations forthis pre-explosion transient. it appears similar to the giant outbursts ofluminous blue variables (lbv) of 60-100 solar mass stars, however theprogenitor of sn2006jc was helium and hydrogen deficient. an lbv-like outburstof a wolf-rayet star could be invoked, but this would be the firstobservational evidence of such a phenomenon. alternatively a massive binarysystem composed of an lbv which erupted in 2004, and a wolf-rayet starexploding as sn2006jc, could explain the observations.

0810.0635	sn 2006gy: was it really extra-ordinary?	we present an optical photometric and spectroscopic study of the veryluminous type iin sn 2006gy for a time period spanning more than one year. inphotometry, a broad, bright (m_r~-21.7) peak characterizes all bvri lightcurves. afterwards, a rapid luminosity fading is followed by a phase of slowluminosity decline between day ~170 and ~237. at late phases (&gt;237 days),because of the large luminosity drop (&gt;3 mag), only upper visibility limits areobtained in the b, r and i bands. in the near-infrared, two k-band detectionson days 411 and 510 open new issues about dust formation or ir echoesscenarios. at all epochs the spectra are characterized by the absence of broadp-cygni profiles and a multicomponent halpha profile, which are the typicalsignatures of type iin sne. after maximum, spectroscopic and photometricsimilarities are found between sn 2006gy and bright, interaction-dominated sne(e.g. sn 1997cy, sn 1999e and sn 2002ic). this suggests that ejecta-csminteraction plays a key role in sn 2006gy about 6 to 8 months after maximum,sustaining the late-time-light curve. alternatively, the late luminosity may berelated to the radioactive decay of ~3m_sun of 56ni. models of the light curvein the first 170 days suggest that the progenitor was a compact star (r~6-810^(12)cm, m_ej~5-14m_sun), and that the sn ejecta collided with massive(6-10m_sun), opaque clumps of previously ejected material. these clumps do notcompletely obscure the sn photosphere, so that at its peak the luminosity isdue both to the decay of 56ni and to interaction with csm. a supermassive staris not required to explain the observational data, nor is an extra-ordinarilylarge explosion energy.
