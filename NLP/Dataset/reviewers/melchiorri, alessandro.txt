0901.0919	a multi-parameter investigation of gravitational slip	a detailed analysis of gravitational slip, a new post-general relativitycosmological parameter characterizing the degree of departure of the laws ofgravitation from general relativity on cosmological scales, is presented. thisphenomenological approach assumes that cosmic acceleration is due to newgravitational effects; the amount of spacetime curvature produced per unit massis changed in such a way that a universe containing only matter and radiationbegins to accelerate as if under the influence of a cosmological constant.changes in the law of gravitation are further manifest in the behavior of theinhomogeneous gravitational field, as reflected in the cosmic microwavebackground, weak lensing, and evolution of large-scale structure. the newparameter, $\varpi_0$, is naively expected to be of order unity. however, amultiparameter analysis, allowing for variation of all the standardcosmological parameters, finds that $\varpi_0 = 0.09^{+0.74}_{-0.59} (2\sigma)$where $\varpi_0=0$ corresponds to a $\lambda$cdm universe under generalrelativity. future probes of the cosmic microwave background (planck) andlarge-scale structure (euclid) may improve the limits by a factor of four.

0904.3201	a constraint on planck-scale modifications to electrodynamics with cmb  polarization data	we show that the cosmic microwave background (cmb) polarization data gatheredby the boomerang 2003 flight and wmap provide an opportunity to investigate{\it in-vacuo} birefringence, of a type expected in some quantum pictures ofspace-time, with a sensitivity that extends even beyond the desiredplanck-scale energy. in order to render this constraint more transparent werely on a well studied phenomenological model of quantum-gravity-inducedbirefringence, in which one easily establishes that effects introduced at theplanck scale would amount to values of a dimensionless parameter, denoted by$\xi$, with respect to the planck energy which are roughly of order 1. bycombining boomerang and wmap data we estimate $\xi \simeq -0.110 \pm 0.076$ atthe 68% c.l. moreover, we forecast on the sensitivity to $\xi$ achievable byfuture cmb polarization experiments (planck, spider, epic), which, in theabsence of systematics, will be at the 1-$\sigma$ confidence of $8.5 \times10^{-4}$ (planck), $6.1 \times 10^{-3}$ (spider), and $1.0 \times 10^{-5}$(epic) respectively. the cosmic variance-limited sensitivity from cmb is$6.1\times 10^{-6}$.

0905.1651	cmb polarization systematics, cosmological birefringence and the  gravitational waves background	cosmic microwave background experiments must achieve very accuratecalibration of their polarization reference frame to avoid biasing thecosmological parameters. in particular, a wrong or inaccurate calibration mightmimic the presence of a gravitational wave background, or a signal fromcosmological birefringence, a phenomenon characteristic of severalnon-standard, symmetry breaking theories of electrodynamics that allow for\textit{in vacuo} rotation if the polarization direction of the photon.noteworthly, several authors have claimed that the boomerang 2003 (b2k)published polarized power spectra of the cmb may hint at cosmologicalbirefringence. such analyses, however, do not take into account the reportedcalibration uncertainties of the boomerang focal plane. we develop a formalismto include this effect and apply it to the boomerang dataset, finding acosmological rotation angle $\alpha=-4.3^\circ\pm4.1^\circ$. we alsoinvestigate the expected performances of future space borne experiment, findingthat an overall miscalibration larger then $1^\circ$ for planck and $0.2\circ$for epic, if not properly taken into account, will produce a bias on theconstraints on the cosmological parameters and could misleadingly suggest thepresence of a gw background.

0907.1917	determining the neutrino mass hierarchy with cosmology	the combination of current large scale structure and cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) anisotropies data can place strong constraints on the sum ofthe neutrino masses. here we show that future cosmic shear experiments, incombination with cmb constraints, can provide the statistical accuracy requiredto answer questions about differences in the mass of individual neutrinospecies. allowing for the possibility that masses are non-degenerate we combinefisher matrix forecasts for a weak lensing survey like euclid with those forthe forthcoming planck experiment. under the assumption that neutrino masssplitting is described by a normal hierarchy we find that the combinationplanck and euclid will possibly reach enough sensitivity to put a constraint onthe mass of a single species. using a bayesian evidence calculation we findthat such future experiments could provide strong evidence for either a normalor an inverted neutrino hierachy. finally we show that if a particular neutrinohierachy is assumed then this could bias cosmological parameter constraints,for example the dark energy equation of state parameter, by &gt; 1\sigma, and thesum of masses by 2.3\sigma.

0909.1837	non-gaussianity in wmap data due to the correlation of cmb lensing  potential with secondary anisotropies	we measure the skewness power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background(cmb) anisotropies optimized for a detection of the secondary bispectrumgenerated by the correlation of the cmb lensing potential with integratedsachs-wolfe effect and the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect. the covariance of ourmeasurements is generated by monte-carlo simulations of gaussian cmb fieldswith noise properties consistent with wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe(wmap) 5-year data. when interpreting multi-frequency measurements we also takeinto account the confusion resulting from unresolved radio point sources. weanalyze q, v and w-band wmap 5-year raw and foreground-cleaned maps using thekq75 mask out to l_max=600. we find no significant evidence for a non-zeronon-gaussian signal from the lensing-secondary correlation in all three bandsand we constrain the overall amplitude of the cross power spectrum between cmblensing potential and the sum of sz and isw fluctuations to be 0.42 \pm 0.86and 1.19 \pm 0.86 in combined v and w-band raw and foreground-cleaned mapsprovided by the wmap team, respectively. the point source amplitude at thebispectrum level measured with this skewness power spectrum is higher thanprevious measurements of point source non-gaussianity. we also consider ananalysis where we also account for the primordial non-gaussianity in additionto lensing-secondary bispectrum and point sources. the focus of this paper ison secondary anisotropies. consequently the estimator is not optimised forprimordial non-gaussianity and the limit we find on local non-gaussianity fromthe foreground-cleaned v+w maps is f_nl = -13 \pm 62, when marginalized overpoint sources and lensing-isw/sz constributions to the total bispectrum.

0909.2045	new constraints on parametrised modified gravity from correlations of  the cmb with large scale structure	we study the effects of modified theories of gravity on the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) anisotropies power spectrum, and in particular on its largescales, where the integrated sachs-wolfe (isw) effect is important. startingwith a general parametrisation, we then specialise to f(r) theories andtheories with yukawa-type interactions between dark matter particles. in thesemodels, the evolution of the metric potentials is altered, and the contributionto the isw effect can differ significantly from that in the standard model ofcosmology. we proceed to compare these predictions with observational data forthe cmb and the isw, performing a full monte carlo markov chain (mcmc)analysis. in the case of f(r) theories, the result is an upper limit on thelengthscale associated to the extra scalar degree of freedom characterisingthese theories. with the addition of data from the hubble diagram of type iasupernovae, we obtain an upper limit on the lengthscale of the theory of b_0 &lt;0.4, or correspondingly \lambda_1 &lt; 1900 mpc/h at 95% c.l. improving previouscmb constraints. for yukawa-type models we get a bound on the coupling 0.75 &lt;\beta_1 &lt; 1.25 at the 95% c.l. we also discuss the implications of the assumedpriors on the estimation of modified gravity parameters, showing that amarginally less conservative choice improves the f(r) constraints to \lambda_1&lt; 1400 mpc/h, corresponding to b_0 &lt; 0.2 at 95% c.l.

1003.0878	planck-scale modifications to electrodynamics characterized by a  space-like symmetry-breaking vector	in the study of planck-scale ("quantum-gravity induced") violations oflorentz symmetry, an important role was played by the deformed-electrodynamicsmodel introduced by myers and pospelov. its reliance on conventional effectivequantum field theory, and its description of symmetry-violation effects simplyin terms of a four-vector with nonzero component only in the time-direction,rendered it an ideal target for experimentalists and a natural concept-testingground for many theorists. at this point however the experimental limits on thesingle myers-pospelov parameter, after improving steadily over these past fewyears, are "super-planckian", {\it i.e.} they take the model out of actualinterest from a conventional quantum-gravity perspective. in light of this wehere argue that it may be appropriate to move on to the next level ofcomplexity, still with vectorial symmetry violation but adopting a genericfour-vector. we also offer a preliminary characterization of the phenomenologyof this more general framework, sufficient to expose a rather significantincrease in complexity with respect to the original myers-pospelov setup. mostof these novel features are linked to the presence of spatial anisotropy, whichis particularly pronounced when the symmetry-breaking vector is space-like, andthey are such that they reduce the bound-setting power of certain types ofobservations in astrophysics.

1004.1110	interplay between curvature and planck-scale effects in astrophysics and  cosmology	several recent studies have considered the implications for astrophysics andcosmology of some possible nonclassical properties of spacetime at the planckscale. the new effects, such as a planck-scale-modified energy-momentum(dispersion) relation, are often inferred from the analysis of some quantumversions of minkowski spacetime, and therefore the relevant estimates dependheavily on the assumption that there could not be significant interplay betweenplanck-scale and curvature effects. we here scrutinize this assumption, usingas guidance a quantum version of de sitter spacetime with known inonu-wignercontraction to a quantum minkowski spacetime. and we show that, contrary tocommon (but unsupported) beliefs, the interplay between planck-scale andcurvature effects can be significant. within our illustrative example, in theminkowski limit the quantum-geometry deformation parameter is indeed given bythe planck scale, while in the de sitter picture the parameter of quantizationof geometry depends both on the planck scale and the curvature scalar. for themuch-studied case of planck-scale effects that intervene in the observation ofgamma-ray bursts we can estimate the implications of "quantum spacetimecurvature" within robust simplifying assumptions. for cosmology at the presentstage of the development of the relevant mathematics one cannot go beyondsemiheuristic reasoning, and we here propose a candidate approximatedescription of a quantum frw geometry, obtained by patching together pieces(with different spacetime curvature) of our quantum de sitter. thissemiheuristic picture, in spite of its limitations, provides rather robustevidence that in the early universe the interplay between planck-scale andcurvature effects could have been particularly significant.

1103.4132	limits on dark radiation, early dark energy, and relativistic degrees of  freedom	recent cosmological data analyses hint at the presence of an extrarelativistic energy component in the early universe. this component is oftenparametrized as an excess of the effective neutrino number n_{eff} over thestandard value of 3.046. the excess relativistic energy could be an indicationfor an extra (sterile) neutrino, but early dark energy and barotropic darkenergy also contribute to the relativistic degrees of freedom. we examine thecapabilities of current and future data to constrain and discriminate betweenthese explanations, and to detect the early dark energy density associated withthem. we found that while early dark energy does not alter the currentconstraints on n_{eff}, a dark radiation component, such as that provided bybarotropic dark energy models, can substantially change current constraints onn_{eff}, bringing its value back to agreement with the theoretical prediction.both dark energy models also have implications for the primordial mass fractionof helium y_p and the scalar perturbation index n_s. the ongoing plancksatellite mission will be able to further discriminate between sterileneutrinos and early dark energy.

1111.3570	data-constrained reionization and its effects on cosmological parameters	we perform an analysis of the recent wmap7 data considering physicallymotivated and viable reionization scenarios with the aim of assessing theireffects on cosmological parameter determinations. the main novelties are: (i)the combination of cmb data with astrophysical results from quasar absorptionline experiments; (ii) the joint variation of both the cosmological andastrophysical [governing the evolution of the free electron fraction x_e(z)]parameters. including a realistic, data-constrained reionization history in theanalysis induces appreciable changes in the cosmological parameter valuesdeduced through a standard wmap7 analysis. particularly noteworthy are thevariations in omega_bh^2 = 0.02258^{+0.00057}_{-0.00056} (wmap7) vs.omega_bh^2$ = 0.02183\pm 0.00054 (wmap7 + astro), and the new constraints forthe scalar spectral index, for which wmap7 + astro excludes theharrison-zel'dovich value n_s=1 at more than 3\sigma. finally, the e.s. opticaldepth value is considerably decreased with respect to the standard wmap7, i.e.\tau_{e}=0.080\pm 0.012. we conclude that the inclusion of astrophysicaldatasets, allowing to robustly constrain the reionization history, in theextraction procedure of cosmological parameters leads to relatively importantdifferences in the final determination of their values.

1111.3810	future constraints on neutrino isocurvature perturbations in the  curvaton scenario	in the curvaton scenario, residual isocurvature perturbations can beimprinted in the cosmic neutrino component after the decay of the curvatonfield, implying in turn a non-zero chemical potential in the neutrinodistribution. we study the constraints that future experiments like planck,spider or cmbpol will be able to put on the amplitude of isocurvatureperturbations in the neutrino component. we express our results in terms of thesquare root \gamma of the non-adiabaticity parameter \alpha and of the extrarelativistic degrees of freedom \delta n_eff. assuming a fiducial model withpurely adiabatic fluctuations, we find that planck (spider) will be able to putthe following upper limits at the 1sigma level: \gamma &lt; 5.3x10^-3 (1.2x10^-2)and \delta n_eff &lt; 0.16 (0.40) . cmbpol will further improve these constraintsto \gamma &lt; 1.5x10^-3 and \delta n_eff &lt; 0.043. finally, we recast these boundsin terms of the background neutrino degeneracy parameter \xi\ and thecorresponding perturbation amplitude \sigma_\xi, and compare with the bounds on\xi\ that can be derived from big bang nucleosynthesis.

1112.3006	the impact of assuming flatness in the determination of neutrino  properties from cosmological data	cosmological data have provided new constraints on the number of neutrinospecies and the neutrino mass. however these constraints depend on assumptionsrelated to the underlying cosmology. since a correlation is expected betweenthe number of effective neutrinos n_{eff}, the neutrino mass \sum m_\nu, andthe curvature of the universe \omega_k, it is useful to investigate the currentconstraints in the framework of a non-flat universe. in this paper we updatethe constraints on neutrino parameters by making use of the latest cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) data from the act and spt experiments and considerthe possibility of a universe with non-zero curvature. we first place newconstraints on n_{eff} and \omega_k, with n_{eff} = 4.03 +/- 0.45 and 10^3\omega_k = -4.46 +/- 5.24. thus, even when \omega_k is allowed to vary, n_{eff}= 3 is still disfavored with 95% confidence. we then investigate thecorrelation between neutrino mass and curvature that shifts the 95% upper limitof \sum m_\nu &lt; 0.45 ev to \sum m_\nu &lt; 0.95 ev. thus, the impact of assumingflatness in neutrino cosmology is significant and an essential considerationwith future experiments.

1202.1476	the fine structure constant and the cmb damping scale	the recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies atarcminute angular scales performed by the act and spt experiments are probingthe damping regime of cmb fluctuations. the analysis of these datasetsunexpectedly suggests that the effective number of relativistic degrees offreedom is larger than the standard value of neff = 3.04, and inconsistent withit at more than two standard deviations. in this paper we study the role of amechanism that could affect the shape of the cmb angular fluctuations at thosescales, namely a change in the recombination process through variations in thefine structure constant. we show that the new cmb data significantly improvethe previous constraints on variations of {\alpha}, with {\alpha}/{\alpha}0 =0.984 \pm 0.005, i.e. hinting also to a more than two standard deviation fromthe current, local, value {\alpha}0. a significant degeneracy is presentbetween {\alpha} and neff, and when variations in the latter are allowed theconstraints on {\alpha} are relaxed and again consistent with the standardvalue. deviations of either parameter from their standard values would implythe presence of new, currently unknown physics.

0711.4119	testing cosmology with cosmic sound waves	wmap observations have accurately determined the position of the first twopeaks and dips in the cmb temperature power spectrum. these encode informationon the ratio of the distance to the last scattering surface to the soundhorizon at decoupling. however pre-recombination processes can contaminate thisdistance information. in order to assess the amplitude of these effects we usethe wmap data and evaluate the relative differences of the cmb peaks and dipsmultipoles. we find that the position of the first peak is largely displacedwith the respect to the expected position of the sound horizon scale atdecoupling. in contrast the relative spacings of the higher extrema arestatistically consistent with those expected from perfect harmonicoscillations. this provides evidence for a scale dependent phase shift of thecmb oscillations which is caused by gravitational driving forces affecting thepropagation of sound waves before recombination. by accounting for theseeffects we have performed a mcmc likelihood analysis to constrain incombination with recent bao data a constant dark energy equation w. for a flatuniverse we find at 95% upper limit w&lt;-1.10, and including the hst priorw&lt;-1.14, which are only marginally consistent with limits derived from thesupernova snls sample. larger limits are obtained for non-flat cosmologies.  from the full cmb likelihood analysis we also estimate the values of theshift parameter r and the multipole l_a of the acoustic horizon at decouplingfor several cosmologies to test their dependence on model assumptions. althoughthe analysis of the full cmb spectra should be always preferred, using theposition of the cmb peaks and dips provide a simple and consistent method forcombining cmb constraints with other datasets.

1403.4852	relic neutrinos, thermal axions and cosmology in early 2014	we present up to date cosmological bounds on the sum of active neutrinomasses as well as on extended cosmological scenarios with additional thermalrelics, as thermal axions or sterile neutrino species. our analyses considerall the current available cosmological data in the beginning of year 2014,including the very recent and most precise baryon acoustic oscillation (bao)measurements from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey. in the minimalthree active neutrino scenario, we find sum m_nu &lt; 0.22 ev at 95% cl from thecombination of cmb, bao and hubble space telescope measurements of the hubbleconstant. a non zero value for the sum of the three active neutrino masses ofabout 0.3 ev is significantly favoured at more than 3 standard deviations whenadding the constraints on sigma_8 and omega_m from the planck cluster catalogon galaxy number counts. this preference for non zero thermal relic massesdisappears almost completely in both the thermal axion and massive sterileneutrino schemes. extra light species contribute to the effective number ofrelativistic degrees of freedom, parameterised via neff. we found that when therecent detection of b mode polarization from the bicep2 experiment isconsidered, an analysis of the combined cmb data in the framework of lcdm+rmodels gives neff=4.00pm0.41, suggesting the presence of an extra relativisticrelic at more than 95 % c.l. from cmb-only data.

1404.7848	probing nuclear rates with planck and bicep2	big bang nucleosynthesis (bbn) relates key cosmological parameters to theprimordial abundance of light elements. in this paper, we point out that therecent observations of cosmic microwave background anisotropies by the plancksatellite and by the bicep2 experiment constrain these parameters with such ahigh level of accuracy that the primordial deuterium abundance can be inferredwith remarkable precision. for a given cosmological model, one can obtainindependent information on nuclear processes in the energy range relevant forbbn, which determine the eventual ^2h/h yield. in particular, assuming thestandard cosmological model, we show that a combined analysis of planck dataand of recent deuterium abundance measurements in metal-poor damped lyman-alphasystems provides independent information on the cross section of the radiativecapture reaction d(p,\gamma)^3he converting deuterium into helium.interestingly, the result is higher than the values suggested by a fit ofpresent experimental data in the bbn energy range (10 - 300 kev), whereas it isin better agreement with ab initio theoretical calculations, based on modelsfor the nuclear electromagnetic current derived from realistic interactions.due to the correlation between the rate of the above nuclear process and theeffective number of neutrinos neff, the same analysis points out a neff&gt;3 aswell. we show how this observation changes when assuming a non-minimalcosmological scenario. we conclude that further data on the d(p,\gamma)^3hecross section in the few hundred kev range, that can be collected byexperiments like luna, may either confirm the low value of this rate, or rathergive some hint in favour of next-to-minimal cosmological scenarios.

1406.7297	indications of a late-time interaction in the dark sector	we show that a general late-time interaction between cold dark matter andvacuum energy is favoured by current cosmological datasets. we characterize thestrength of the coupling by a dimensionless parameter $q_v$ that is free totake different values in four redshift bins from the primordial epoch up totoday. this interacting scenario is in agreement with measurements of cosmicmicrowave background temperature anisotropies from the planck satellite,supernovae ia from union 2.1 and redshift space distortions from a number ofsurveys, as well as with combinations of these different datasets. we show thata non-zero interaction is very likely at late times. we then focus on the case$q_v\not=0$ in a single low-redshift bin, obtaining a nested one parameterextension of the standard $\lambda$cdm model. we study the bayesian evidence,with respect to $\lambda$cdm, of this late-time interaction model, findingmoderate evidence for an interaction starting at $z=0.9$, dependent upon theprior range chosen for the interaction strength parameter $q_v$. for this casethe null interaction ($q_v=0$, i.e.$\lambda$cdm) is excluded at 99% c.l..

0804.1789	nonlinear corrections to the cosmological matter power spectrum and  scale-dependent galaxy bias: implications for parameter estimation	we explore and compare the performances of two nonlinear correction andscale-dependent biasing models for the extraction of cosmological informationfrom galaxy power spectrum data, especially in the context of beyond-lcdmcosmologies. the first model is the well known q model, first applied in theanalysis of 2dfgrs data. the second, the p model, is inspired by the halomodel, in which nonlinear evolution and scale-dependent biasing areencapsulated in a single non-poisson shot noise term. we find that while bothmodels perform equally well in providing adequate correction for a range ofgalaxy clustering data in standard lcdm cosmology and in extensions withmassive neutrinos, the q model can give unphysical results in cosmologiescontaining a subdominant free-streaming dark matter whose temperature dependson the particle mass, e.g., relic thermal axions, unless a suitable prior isimposed on the correction parameter. this last case also exposes the danger ofanalytic marginalisation, a technique sometimes used in the marginalisation ofnuisance parameters. in contrast, the p model suffers no undesirable effects,and is the recommended nonlinear correction model also because of its physicaltransparency.

1507.06646	beyond six parameters: extending $\lambda$cdm	cosmological constraints are usually derived under the assumption of a $6$parameters $\lambda$-cdm theoretical framework or simple one-parameterextensions. in this paper we present, for the first time, cosmologicalconstraints in a significantly extended scenario, varying up to $12$cosmological parameters simultaneously, including the sum of neutrino masses,the neutrino effective number, the dark energy equation of state, thegravitational waves background and the running of the spectral index ofprimordial perturbations. using the latest planck 2015 data release (withpolarization) we found no significant indication for extensions to the standard$\lambda$-cdm scenario, with the notable exception of the angular powerspectrum lensing amplitude, $a_{\rm lens}$ that is larger than the expectedvalue at more than two standard deviations even when combining the planck datawith bao and supernovae type ia external datasets. in our extended cosmologicalframework, we find that a combined planck+bao analysis constrains the value ofthe r.m.s. density fluctuation parameter to $\sigma_8=0.781_{-0.063}^{+0.065}$at $95 \%$ c.l., helping to relieve the possible tensions with the cfhtlenscosmic shear survey. we also find a lower value for the reionization opticaldepth $\tau=0.058_{-0.043}^{+0.040}$ at $95$ \% c.l. respect to the one derivedunder the assumption of $\lambda$-cdm. the scalar spectral index $n_s$ is nowcompatible with a harrison-zeldovich spectrum to within $2.5$ standarddeviations. combining the planck dataset with the hst prior on the hubbleconstant provides a value for the equation of state $w &lt; -1$ at more than twostandard deviations while the neutrino effective number is fully compatiblewith the expectations of the standard three neutrino framework.

1509.07501	cosmological hints of modified gravity ?	the recent measurements of cosmic microwave background temperature andpolarization anisotropies made by the planck satellite have provided impressiveconfirmation of the $\lambda$cdm cosmological model. however interesting hintsof slight deviations from $\lambda$cdm have been found, including a $95 \%$c.l. preference for a "modified gravity" structure formation scenario. in thispaper we confirm the preference for a modified gravity scenario from planck2015 data, find that modified gravity solves the so-called $a_{lens}$ anomalyin the cmb angular spectrum, and constrains the amplitude of matter densityfluctuations to $\sigma_8=0.815_{-0.048}^{+0.032}$, in better agreement withweak lensing constraints. moreover, we find a lower value for the reionizationoptical depth of $\tau=0.059\pm0.020$ (to be compared with the value of $\tau=0.079 \pm 0.017$ obtained in the standard scenario), more consistent withrecent optical and uv data. we check the stability of this result byconsidering possible degeneracies with other parameters, including the neutrinoeffective number, the running of the spectral index and the amount ofprimordial helium. the indication for modified gravity is still present atabout $95\%$ c.l., and could become more significant if lower values of $\tau$were to be further confirmed by future cosmological and astrophysical data.

0806.1742	impact of point source clustering on cosmological parameters with cmb  anisotropies	the faint radio point sources that are unresolved in cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) anisotropy maps are likely to be a biased tracer of thelarge-scale structure dark matter distribution. while the shot-noisecontribution to the angular power spectrum of unresolved radio point sources isincluded either when optimally constructing the cmb angular power spectrum, aswith wmap data, or when extracting cosmological parameters, we suggest thatclustering part of the point source power spectrum should also be included.this is especially necessary at high frequencies above 150 ghz, where theclustering of far-ir sources is expected to dominate the shot-noise level ofthe angular power spectrum at tens of arcminute angular scales of both radioand sub-mm sources. we make an estimate of source clustering of unresolvedradio sources in both wmap and acbar, and marginalize over the amplitude ofsource clustering in each cmb data set when model fitting for cosmologicalparameters. for the combination of wmap 5-year data and acbar, we find that thespectral index changes from the value of $0.963 \pm 0.014$ to $0.959 \pm 0.014$(at 68% c.l.) when the clustering power spectrum of point sources is includedin model fits. while we find that the differences are marginal with and withoutsource clustering in current data, it may be necessary to account for sourceclustering with future datasets such as planck, especially to properly modelfit anisotropies at arcminute angular scales. if clustering is not accountedand point sources are modeled with a shot-noise only out to $l \sim 2000$, thespectral index will be biased by about 1.5$\sigma$.

0807.1420	delayed recombination and cosmic parameters	current cosmological constraints from cosmic microwave background (cmb)anisotropies are typically derived assuming a standard recombination scheme,however additional resonance and ionizing radiation sources can delayrecombination, altering the cosmic ionization history and the cosmologicalinferences drawn from cmb data. we show that for recent observations of cmbanisotropy, from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe satellite mission5-year survey (wmap5) and from the acbar experiment, additional resonanceradiation is nearly degenerate with variations in the spectral index, n_s, andhas a marked effect on uncertainties in constraints on the hubble constant, ageof the universe, curvature and the upper bound on the neutrino mass. when amodified recombination scheme is considered, the redshift of recombination isconstrained to z_*=1078\pm11, with uncertainties in the measurement weaker byone order of magnitude than those obtained under the assumption of standardrecombination while constraints on the shift parameter are shifted by 1-sigmato r=1.734\pm0.028. although delayed recombination limits the precision ofparameter estimation from the wmap satellite, we demonstrate that this shouldnot be the case for future, smaller angular scales measurements, such as thoseby the planck satellite mission.

astro-ph;0007375	new constraints on inflation from the cosmic microwave background	the recent data from the boomerang and maxima-1 balloon flights have markedthe beginning of the precision era of cosmic microwave background anisotropy(cmb) measurements. we investigate the observational constraints from thecurrent cmb anisotropy measurements on the simplest inflation models,characterized by a single scalar field $\phi$, in the parameter spaceconsisting of scalar spectral index $n_s$ and tensor/scalar ratio $r$. if weinclude constraints on the baryon density from big bang nucleosynthesis (bbn),we show that the favored inflationary models have negligible tensor amplitudeand a ``red'' tilt, with a best fit of $n_s \simeq 0.93$, which is consistentwith the simplest ``small-field'' inflation models, but rules out large-fieldmodels at the $1\sigma$ level. without including bbn constraints, a broaderrange of models are consistent with the data. the best fit (assuming negligiblereionization) is a scale-invariant spectrum, $n_s \simeq 1$, which includeslarge-field and hybrid scenarios. large-field models (such as chaotic andpower-law inflation) with tilt $n_s &lt; 0.9$ are strongly disfavored in allcases.

astro-ph;0204250	small angular scale cmb anisotropies from cbi and bima: early universe  or local structures ?	the advent of high resolution cosmic microwave background (cmb) experimentsnow allows studies on the temperature fluctuations at scales corresponding tofew arcminutes and below. though the reported excess power at $\ell \sim 2000 -6000$ by cbi and bima is roughly consistent with a secondary contributionresulting from the sunyaev-zeldovich effect, this requires a highernormalization for the matter power spectrum than measured by other means. inaddition to a local red-shift contribution, another strong possibility foranisotropies at very small scales involve non-standard aspects of inflationarymodels. to distinguish between contributions from early universe and localstructures, including a potential point source contribution, and to understandthe extent to which structures at low red-shifts contribute to small scaletemperature anisotropies, it maybe necessary to perform a combined studyinvolving cmb and the large scale structure. we suggest a cross-correlation ofthe temperature data with a map of the large scale structure, such as thegalaxy distribution. for next generation small angular scale cmb experiments,multi-frequency observations may be a necessary aspect to allow an additionalpossibility to distinguish between these different scenarios.

astro-ph;0302361	current constraints on cosmological parameters from microwave background  anisotropies	we compare the latest observations of cosmic microwave background (cmb)anisotropies with the theoretical predictions of the standard scenario ofstructure formation. assuming a primordial power spectrum of adiabaticperturbations we found that the total energy density is constrained to be$\omega_{tot}=1.03\pm0.06$ while the energy density in baryon and cold darkmatter (cdm) are $\omega_bh^2=0.021\pm0.003$ and $\omega_{cdm}h^2=0.12\pm0.02$,(all at 68% c.l.) respectively. the primordial spectrum is consistent withscale invariance, ($n_s=0.97\pm0.04$) and the age of the universe is$t_0=14.6\pm0.9$ gyrs. adding informations from large scale structure andsupernovae, we found a strong evidence for a cosmological constant$\omega_{\lambda}=0.70_{-0.05}^{+0.07}$ and a value of the hubble parameter$h=0.69\pm0.07$. restricting this combined analysis to flat universes, we putconstraints on possible 'extensions' of the standard scenario. a gravity wavescontribution to the quadrupole anisotropy is limited to be $r \le 0.42$ (95%c.l.). a constant equation of state for the dark energy component is bound tobe $w_q \le -0.74$ (95% c.l.). we constrain the effective relativistic degreesof freedom $n_\nu \leq 6.2$ and the neutrino chemical potential $-0.01 \leq\xi_e \leq 0.18$ and $|\xi_{\mu,\tau}|\leq 2.3$ (massless neutrinos).

astro-ph;0511054	searching for integrated sachs-wolfe effect beyond temperature  anisotropies: cmb e-mode polarization-galaxy cross correlation	the cross-correlation between cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperatureanisotropies and the large scale structure (lss) traced by the galaxydistribution, or sources at different wavelengths, is now well known. thiscorrelation results from the integrated sachs-wolfe (isw) effect in cmbanisotropies generated at late times due to the dark energy component of theuniverse. in a reionized universe, the isw quadrupole rescatters andcontributes to the large-scale polarization signal. thus, in principle, thelarge-scale polarization bump in the e-mode should also be correlated with thegalaxy distribution. unlike cmb temperature-lss correlation that peaks fortracers at low redshifts this correlation peaks mostly at redshifts between 1and 3. under certain conditions, mostly involving a low optical depth toreionization, if the universe reionized at a redshift around 6, the crosspolarization-source signal is marginally detectable, though challenging as itrequires all-sky maps of the large scale structure at redshifts between 1 and3. if the universe reionized at a redshift higher than 10, it is unlikely thatthis correlation will be detectable even with no instrumental noise all-skymaps. while our estimates do not guarantee a detection unknown physics relatedto the dark energy as well as still uncertain issues related to the largeangular scale cmb and polarization anisotropies may motivate attempts tomeasure this correlation using upcoming cmb polarization e-mode maps.

astro-ph;0703375	constraints on a new post-general relativity cosmological parameter	a new cosmological variable is introduced which characterizes the degree ofdeparture from einstein's general relativity (gr) with a cosmological constant.the new parameter, \varpi, is the cosmological analog of \gamma, theparametrized post-newtonian variable which measures the amount of spacetimecurvature per unit mass. in the cosmological context, \varpi measures thedifference between the newtonian and longitudinal potentials in response to thesame matter sources, as occurs in certain scalar-tensor theories of gravity.equivalently, \varpi measures the scalar shear fluctuation in a dark energycomponent. in the context of a "vanilla" lcdm background cosmology, a non-zero\varpi signals a departure from gr or a fluctuating cosmological constant.using a phenomenological model for the time evolution \varpi=\varpi_0\rho_{de}/\rho_{m} which depends on the ratio of energy density in thecosmological constant to the matter density at each epoch, it is shown that theobserved cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature anisotropies limit theoverall normalization constant to be -0.4 &lt; \varpi_0 &lt; 0.1 at the 95%confidence level. existing measurements of the cross-correlations of the cmbwith large-scale structure further limit \varpi_0 &gt; -0.2 at the 95% cl. in thefuture, integrated sachs-wolfe and weak lensing measurements can more tightlyconstrain \varpi_0, providing a valuable clue to the nature of dark energy andthe validity of gr.

0810.5133	sterile neutrinos in light of recent cosmological and oscillation data:  a multi-flavor scheme approach	light sterile neutrinos might mix with the active ones and be copiouslyproduced in the early universe. in the present paper, a detailed multi-flavoranalysis of sterile neutrino production is performed. making some justifiedapproximations allows us to consider not only neutrino interactions with theprimeval medium and neutrino coherence breaking effects, but also oscillationeffects arising from the presence of three light (mostly-active) neutrinostates mixed with two heavier (mostly-sterile) states. first, we emphasize theunderlying physics via an analytical description of sterile neutrino abundancesthat is valid for cases with small mixing between active and sterile neutrinos.then, we study in detail the phenomenology of (3+2) sterile neutrino models inlight of short-baseline oscillation data, including the lsnd and minibooneresults. finally, by using the information provided by this analysis, we obtainthe expected sterile neutrino cosmological abundances and then contrast themwith the most recent available data from cosmic microwave background and largescale structure observations. we conclude that (3+2) models are significantlymore disfavored by the internal inconsistencies between sterile neutrinointerpretations of appearance and disappearance short-baseline data themselves,rather than by the used cosmological data.

hep-ph;0305130	wmapping inflationary physics	we extract parameters relevant for distinguishing among single-fieldinflation models from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) data set,and from a combination of the wmap data and seven other cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) experiments. we use only cmb data and perform a likelihoodanalysis over a grid of models including the full error covariance matrix. wefind that a model with a scale-invariant scalar power spectrum ($n=1$), notensor contribution, and no running of the spectral index, is within the1-$\sigma$ contours of both data sets. we then apply the monte carloreconstruction technique to both data sets to generate an ensemble ofinflationary potentials consistent with observations. none of the three basicclasses of inflation models (small-field, large-field, and hybrid) arecompletely ruled out, although hybrid models are favored by the best-fitregion. the reconstruction process indicates that a wide variety of smoothpotentials for the inflaton are consistent with the data, implying that thefirst-year wmap result is still too crude to constrain significantly either theheight or the shape of the inflaton potential. in particular, the lack ofevidence for tensor fluctuations makes it impossible to constrain the energyscale of inflation. nonetheless, the data rule out a large portion of theavailable parameter space for inflation. for instance, we find that potentialsof the form $v = \lambda \phi^4$ are ruled out to $3\sigma$ by the combineddata set, but not by the wmap data taken alone.

0812.3557	delayed recombination and standard rulers	measurements of baryonic acoustic oscillations in galaxy surveys have beenrecognized as a powerful tool for constraining dark energy. however, thismethod relies on the knowledge of the size of the acoustic horizon atrecombination derived from cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements.this estimate is typically derived assuming a standard recombination scheme;additional radiation sources can delay recombination altering the cosmicionization history and the cosmological inferences drawn from cmb and bao data.in this paper we quantify the effect of delayed recombination on thedetermination of dark energy parameters from future bao surveys such as bossand wfmos. we find the impact to be small but still not negligible. inparticular, if recombination is non-standard (to a level still allowed by cmbdata), but this is ignored, future surveys may incorrectly suggest the presenceof a redshift dependent dark energy component. on the other hand, in the caseof delayed recombination, adding to the analysis one extra parameter describingdeviations from standard recombination, does not significantly degrade theerror-bars on dark energy parameters and yields unbiased estimates.
