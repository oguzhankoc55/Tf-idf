0901.2051	post common envelope binaries from sdss. iv: sdssj121258.25-012310.1, a  new eclipsing system	from optical photometry we show that sdssj121258.25-012310.1 is a neweclipsing, post common-envelope binary with an orbital period of 8.06 hours andan eclipse length of 23 minutes. we observed the object over 11 nights indifferent bands and determined the ephemeris of the eclipse to hjd_mid =2454104. 7086(2) + 0.3358706(5) x e, where numbers in parenthesis indicate theuncertainties in the last digit. the depth of the eclipse is 2.85 +/- 0.17 magin the v band, 1.82 +/- 0.08 mag in the r band and 0.52 +/- 0.02 mag in the iband. from spectroscopic observations we measured the semi-amplitude of theradial velocity k_2 = 181 +/- 3 km/s for the secondary star. the stellar andbinary parameters of the system were constrained from a) fitting the sdsscomposite spectrum of the binary, b) using a k-band luminosty-mass relation forthe secondary star, and c) from detailed analyses of the eclipse light curve.the white dwarf has an effective temperature of 17700 +/- 300 k, and itssurface gravity is logg =7.53 +/- 0.2. we estimate that the spectral type ofthe red dwarf is m4 +/- 1 and the distance to the system is 230 +/- 20 parsec.the mass of the secondary star is estimated to be in the range msec = 0.26-0.29msun, while the mass of the white dwarf is most likely mwd = 0.46-0.48 msun.  from an empirical mass-radius relation we estimate the radius of the reddwarf to be in the range 0.28-0.31 rsun, whereas we get rwd = 0.016-0.018 rsunfrom a theoretical mass-radius realation. finally we discuss the spectralenergy distribution and the likely evolutionary state of sdss1212-0123.

0905.3476	sdss unveils a population of intrinsically faint cataclysmic variables  at the minimum orbital period	we discuss the properties of 137 cataclysmic variables (cvs) which areincluded in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) spectroscopic data base, andfor which accurate orbital periods have been measured. 92 of these systems arenew discoveries from sdss and were followed-up in more detail over the past fewyears. 45 systems were previously identified as cvs because of the detection ofoptical outbursts and/or x-ray emission, and subsequently re-identified fromthe sdss spectroscopy. the period distribution of the sdss cvs differsdramatically from that of all the previously known cvs, in particular itcontains a significant accumulation of systems in the orbital period range80--86 min. we identify this feature as the elusive "period minimum spike"predicted by cv population models, which resolves a long-standing discrepancybetween compact binary evolution theory and observations. we show that thisspike is almost entirely due to the large number of cvs with very low accretionactivity identified by sdss. the optical spectra of these systems are dominatedby emission from the white dwarf photosphere, and display little or nospectroscopic signature from the donor stars, suggesting very low-masscompanion stars. we determine the average absolute magnitude of theselow-luminosity cvs at the period minimum to be &lt;m_g&gt;=11.6+-0.7. comparison ofthe sdss cv sample to the cvs found in the hamburg quasar survey and thepalomar green survey suggests that the depth of sdss is the key ingredientresulting in the discovery of a large number of intrinsically faintshort-period systems.

0707.4107	post common envelope binaries from sdss. i: 101 white dwarf main  sequence binaries with multiple sdss spectroscopy	we present a detailed analysis of 101 white dwarf-main sequence binaries(wdms) from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) for which multiple sdss spectraare available. we detect significant radial velocity variations in 18 wdms,identifying them as post common envelope binaries (pcebs) or strong pcebcandidates. strict upper limits to the orbital periods are calculated, rangingfrom 0.43 to 7880 d. given the sparse temporal sampling and relatively lowspectral resolution of the sdss spectra, our results imply a pceb fraction of&gt;=15% among the wdms in the sdss data base. using a spectraldecomposition/fitting technique we determined the white dwarf effectivetemperatures and surface gravities, masses, and secondary star spectral typesfor all wdms in our sample. two independent distance estimates are obtainedfrom the flux scaling factors between the wdms spectra, and the white dwarfmodels and main sequence star templates, respectively. approximately one thirdof the systems in our sample show a significant discrepancy between the twodistance estimates. in the majority of discrepant cases, the distance estimatebased on the secondary star is too large. a possible explanation for thisbehaviour is that the secondary star spectral types that we determined from thesdss spectra are systematically too early by 1-2 spectral classes. thisbehaviour could be explained by stellar activity, if covering a significantfraction of the star by cool dark spots will raise the temperature of theinter-spot regions. finally, we discuss the selection effects of the wdmssample provided by the sdss project.

1003.5703	multi-site observations of pulsation in the accreting white dwarf sdss  j161033.64-010223.3 (v386 ser)	nonradial pulsations in the primary white dwarfs of cataclysmic variables cannow potentially allow us to explore the stellar interior of these accretorsusing stellar seismology. in this context, we conducted a multi-site campaignon the accreting pulsator sdss j161033.64-010223.3 (v386 ser) using sevenobservatories located around the world in may 2007 over a duration of 11 days.we report the best fit periodicities here, which were also previously observedin 2004, suggesting their underlying stability. although we did not uncover asufficient number of independent pulsation modes for a unique seismologicalfit, our campaign revealed that the dominant pulsation mode at 609s is anevenly spaced triplet. the even nature of the triplet is suggestive ofrotational splitting, implying an enigmatic rotation period of about 4.8 days.there are two viable alternatives assuming the triplet is real: either theperiod of 4.8 days is representative of the rotation period of the entire starwith implications for the angular momentum evolution of these systems, or it isperhaps an indication of differential rotation with a fast rotating exteriorand slow rotation deeper in the star. investigating the possibility that achanging period could mimic a triplet suggests that this scenario isimprobable, but not impossible.  using time-series spectra acquired in may 2009, we determine the orbitalperiod of sdss j161033.64-010223.3 to be 83.8 +/- 2.9 min. three of theobserved photometric frequencies from our may 2007 campaign appear to be linearcombinations of the 609s pulsation mode with the first harmonic of the orbitalperiod at 41.5min. this is the first discovery of a linear combination betweennonradial pulsation and orbital motion for a variable white dwarf.

1006.1621	post-common-envelope binaries from sdss. ix: constraining the  common-envelope efficiency	reconstructing the evolution of post-common-envelope binaries (pcebs) canconstrain current prescriptions of common-envelope (ce) evolution. analyzing anew sample of pcebs we derive constraints on one of the most importantparameters in the field of close compact binary formation, i.e. the ceefficiency alpha. after reconstructing the post-ce evolution and based on fitsto stellar evolution calculations as well as a parametrized energy equation force evolution that incorporates realistic approximations of the binding energyparameter lambda, we determine the possible evolutionary histories of theobserved pcebs. we also reconstruct ce evolution replacing the classical energyequation with a scaled angular momentum equation and compare the resultsobtained with both algorithms. we find that all pcebs in our sample can bereconstructed with the energy equation if the internal energy of the envelopeis included. although most individual systems have solutions for a broad rangeof values for alpha, only for alpha=0.2-0.3 do we find simultaneous solutionsfor all pcebs in our sample. if we adjust alpha to this range of values, thevalues of the angular momentum parameter gamma cluster in a small range ofvalues. in contrast if we fix gamma to a small range of values that allows usto reconstruct all our systems, the possible ranges of values for alpha remainsbroad for individual systems. the classical parametrized energy equation seemsto be an appropriate prescription of ce evolution and turns out to constrainthe outcome of the ce evolution much more than the alternative angular momentumequation. if there is a universal value of the ce efficiency, it should be inthe range of alpha=0.2-0.3. we do not find any indications for a dependence ofalpha on the mass of the secondary star or the final orbital period.

1108.4600	post-common-envelope binaries from sdss. xi: the white dwarf mass  distributions of cvs and pre-cvs	we have known for a long time that many of the measured white dwarf (wd)masses in cataclysmic variables (cvs) significantly exceed the mean mass ofsingle wds. this was thought to be related to observational biases, but recenthigh-precision measurements of wd masses in a great number of cvs arechallenging this interpretation. we review the measured wd masses of cvs,determine the wd-mass distribution of an extensive sample ofpost-common-envelope binaries (pcebs) that are representative for theprogenitors of the current cv population (pre-cvs) and compare bothdistributions. we calculate the cv formation time of the pcebs in our sample bydetermining the post common-envelope (ce) and the main-sequence evolution ofthe binary systems and define a pre-cv to be a pceb that evolves into asemi-detached configuration with stable mass transfer within less than the ageof the galaxy. possible observational biases affecting the wd-mass distributionfor the pre-cv and the cv samples are discussed. the mean wd mass among cvs is&lt;mwd&gt;=0.83\pm0.23 msun, much larger than that found for pre-cvs,&lt;mwd&gt;=0.67\pm0.21 msun. selection effects cannot explain the high wd massesobserved in cvs and we here suggest two possible explanations, both of whichimply substantial revisions to the standard model of cv evolution: either mostcvs have formed above the orbital-period gap (which requires a high wd mass toinitiate stable mass transfer or a previous phase of thermal-timescale masstransfer), or the mass of the wds in cvs grows through accretion (whichstrongly disagrees with the predictions of classical nova models). both optionsmay imply that cvs contribute to the single-degenerate progenitors of type iasupernovae. the number of he-core wds found in cvs (&lt;=10%) is roughlyconsistent with the number of he-core wds in pre-cvs (&lt;=17+-8%), whichindicates a low value of the ce efficiency.

1111.2512	post-common-envelope binaries from sdss. xiii: mass dependencies of the  orbital period distribution	post-common-envelope binaries (pcebs) consisting of a white dwarf (wd) and amain-sequence secondary star are ideal systems to constrain models ofcommon-envelope (ce) evolution. until very recently, observed samples of pcebshave been too small to fully explore this potential, however the recentlyidentified large and relatively homogenous sample of pcebs from the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) has significantly changed this situation. we hereanalyze the orbital period distributions of pcebs containing he- and c/o-corewds separately and investigate whether the orbital period of pcebs is relatedto the masses of their stellar components. we performed standard statisticaltests to compare the orbital period distributions and to determine theconfidence levels of possible relations. the orbital periods of pcebscontaining he-core wds are significantly shorter than those of pcebs containingc/o-core wds. while the he-core pceb orbital period distribution has a medianvalue of porb ~ 0.28 d, the median orbital period for pcebs containing c/o-corewds is porb ~ 0.57 d. we also find that systems containing more massivesecondaries have longer post-ce orbital periods, in contradiction to recentpredictions. our observational results provide new constraints on theories ofce evolution. however we suggest future binary population models to takeselection effects into account that still affect the current observed pcebsample.

1207.5393	an accurate mass and radius measurement for an ultracool white dwarf	studies of cool white dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood have placed a limiton the age of the galactic disk of 8-9 billion years. however, determiningtheir cooling ages requires the knowledge of their effective temperatures,masses, radii, and atmospheric composition. so far, these parameters could onlybe inferred for a small number of ultracool white dwarfs for which an accuratedistance is known, by fitting their spectral energy distributions (seds) inconjunction with a theoretical mass-radius relation. however, the mass-radiusrelation remains largely untested, and the derived cooling ages are hencemodel-dependent. here we report direct measurements of the mass and radius ofan ultracool white dwarf in the double-lined eclipsing binary sdssj013851.54-001621.6. we find m(wd)=0.529+/-0.010msol andr(wd)=0.0131+/-0.0003rsol. our measurements are consistent with the mass-radiusrelation and we determine a robust cooling age of 9.5 billion years for the3570k white dwarf. we find that the mass and radius of the low mass companionstar, m(sec)=0.132+/-0.003msol and r(sec)=0.165+/-0.001rsol, are in agreementwith evolutionary models. we also find evidence that this &gt;9.5 gyr old m5 staris still active, far beyond the activity lifetime for a star of its spectraltype. this is likely caused by the high tidally-enforced rotation rate of thestar. the companion star is close to filling its roche lobe and the system willevolve into a cataclysmic variable in only 70 myr. our direct measurementsdemonstrate that this system can be used to calibrate ultracool white dwarfatmospheric models.

1211.5356	origin of apparent period variations in eclipsing post-common-envelope  binaries	apparent period variations detected in several eclipsing, close-compactbinaries are frequently interpreted as being caused by circumbinary giantplanets. this interpretation raises the question of the origin of the potentialplanets that must have either formed in the primordial circumbinary disk,together with the host binary star, and survived its evolution into aclose-compact binary or formed in a post-common-envelope circumbinary disk thatremained bound to the post-common-envelope binary (pceb). here we combinecurrent knowledge of planet formation and the statistics of giant planetsaround primordial and evolved binary stars with the theory of close-compactbinary star evolution aiming to derive new constraints on possible formationscenarios. we compiled a comprehensive list of observed eclipsing pcebs,estimated the fraction of systems showing apparent period variations,reconstructed the evolutionary history of the pcebs, and performed binarypopulation models of pcebs to characterize their main sequence binaryprogenitors. we reviewed the currently available constraints on the fraction ofpceb progenitors that host circumbinary giant planets. we find that theprogenitors of pcebs are very unlikely to be frequent hosts of giant planets(&lt;~10 per cent), while the frequency of pcebs with observed apparent periodvariations is very high (~90 per cent). the variations in eclipse timingsmeasured in eclipsing pcebs are probably not caused by first-generation planetsthat survived common-envelope evolution. the remaining options for explainingthe observed period variations are second-generation planet formation orperhaps variations in the shape of a magnetically active secondary star. wesuggest observational tests for both options.

1212.4189	m dwarf companions to white dwarfs i: relating magnetic activity,  rotation and age	we make use of the largest and most homogeneous sample of white dwarf/m dwarf(wd/dm) binaries from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss dr7) to investigaterelations between magnetic activity, rotation, magnetic braking and age in mstars. these relations are studied separately for close wd/dm binaries thatunderwent a common envelope phase and thus contain tidally locked and hencerapidly rotating m dwarfs, and for wide wd/dm binaries that never interacted.for the wide wd/dm binary sample we find that the m dwarf activity fractionsare significantly higher than those measured in single m stars of spectral typem0 to m5. we attribute this effect as a consequence of m dwarfs in wide sdsswd/dm binaries being, on average, significantly younger and hence more activethan the field m dwarf population. the measured m dwarf activity fractions inwide wd/dm binaries show as well a significant increase from spectral types m3to m5, where these low-mass stars become fully convective. this providesadditional observational evidence for magnetic braking being less efficientbelow the fully convective boundary, in agreement with the hypothesis of fullyconvective stars having considerably longer activity lifetimes than partiallyconvective stars. the m dwarfs in all our close binaries are active,independently of the spectral type, giving robust observational evidence formagnetic activity being enhanced due to fast rotation. the rotationalvelocities of the m dwarfs in our close binary sample are significantly higherthan seen among field m dwarfs, however the strength of magnetic activityremains saturated at log lhalpha/lbol approximately -3.5. this unambiguouslyconfirms the m dwarf saturation-type rotation-activity relation.

1306.6379	near-infrared imaging polarimetry of hd142527	hd 142527 is a pre-transition disk with strong evidence for on-going planetformation. recent observations show a disrupted disk with spiral arms, adust-depleted inner cavity and the possible presence of gas streams driving gasfrom the outer disk towards the central star. we aim to derive the morphologyof the disk, as well as the distribution and properties of the dust at itssurface. we have obtained polarized differential images of hd 142527 at $h$ and$ks$ bands with naco at the vlt. combining these images with classicalpsf-subtraction, we are able to derive the polarization degree of this disk. at$h$ band the polarization degree of the disk varies between 10% and 25%. thisresult cannot be reproduced by dust distributions containing highly porousmaterial. the polarization is better matched by distributions of compactparticles, with maximum sizes at least up to a few microns, in agreement withprevious observations. we also observe two regions of low emission (nulls) intotal and in polarized intensity. in particular, one of these nulls is atroughly the same position as the maximum of the horse-shoe shape observed insub-millimeter continuum emission alma band-7 (345 ghz) observations. wediscuss the possible link between both features.

1311.5236	timing variations in the secondary eclipse of nn ser	the eclipsing white dwarf plus main-sequence binary nn serpentis provides oneof the most convincing cases for the existence of circumbinary planets aroundevolved binaries. the exquisite timing precision provided by the deep eclipseof the white dwarf has revealed complex variations in the eclipse arrival timesover the last few decades. these variations have been interpreted as theinfluence of two planets in orbit around the binary. recent studies have provedthat such a system is dynamically stable over the current lifetime of thebinary. however, the existence of such planets is by no means proven andseveral alternative mechanisms have been proposed that could drive similarvariations. one of these is apsidal precession, which causes the eclipse timesof eccentric binaries to vary sinusoidally on many year timescales. in thispaper we present timing data for the secondary eclipse of nn ser and show thatthey follow the same trend seen in the primary eclipse times, ruling outapsidal precession as a possible cause for the variations. this result leavesno alternatives to the planetary interpretation for the observed periodvariations, although we still do not consider their existence as proven. ourdata limits the eccentricity of nn ser to e&lt;0.001. we also detect a 3.3+/-1.0second delay in the arrival times of the secondary eclipses relative to thebest planetary model. this delay is consistent with the expected 2.84+/-0.04second romer delay of the binary, and is the first time this effect has beendetected in a white dwarf plus m dwarf system.

1404.5464	monte carlo simulations of post-common-envelope white dwarf + main  sequence binaries: comparison with the sdss dr7 observed sample	detached white dwarf + main sequence (wd+ms) systems represent the simplestpopulation of post-common envelope binaries (pcebs). since the ensembleproperties of this population carries important information about thecharacteristics of the common-envelope (ce) phase, it deserves close scrutiny.however, most population synthesis studies do not fully take into account theeffects of the observational selection biases of the samples used to comparewith the theoretical simulations. here we present the results of a set ofdetailed monte carlo simulations of the population of wd+ms binaries in thesloan digital sky survey (sdss) data release 7. we used up-to-date stellarevolutionary models, a complete treatment of the roche lobe overflow episode,and a full implementation of the orbital evolution of the binary systems.moreover, in our treatment we took into account the selection criteria and allthe known observational biases. our population synthesis study allowed us tomake a meaningful comparison with the available observational data. inparticular, we examined the ce efficiency, the possible contribution ofinternal energy, and the initial mass ratio distribution (imrd) of the binarysystems. we found that our simulations correctly reproduce the properties ofthe observed distribution of wd+ms pcebs. in particular, we found that once theobservational biases are carefully taken into account, the distribution oforbital periods and of masses of the wd and ms stars can be correctlyreproduced for several choices of the free parameters and different imrds,although models in which a moderate fraction (&lt;=10%) of the internal energy isused to eject the ce and in which a low value of ce efficiency is used (&lt;=0.3)seem to fit better the observational data. we also found that systems withhe-core wds are over-represented in the observed sample, due to selectioneffects.

1406.0553	sdssj001153.08-064739.2, a cataclysmic variable with an evolved donor in  the period gap	secondary stars in cataclysmic variables (cvs) follow a well definedperiod-density relation. thus, canonical donor stars in cvs are generallylow-mass stars of spectral type m. however, several cvs have been observedcontaining secondary stars which are too hot for their inferred masses. thisparticular configuration can be explained if the donor stars in these systemsunderwent significant nuclear evolution before they reached contact. in thispaper we present sdssj001153.08-064739.2 as an additional example belonging tothis peculiar type of cv and discuss in detail its evolutionary history. weperform spectroscopic and photometric observations and make use of availablecatalina real-time transient survey photometry to measure the orbital period ofsdssj001153.08-064739.2 as 2.4 hours and estimate the white dwarf(mwd&gt;0.65msun) and donor star (0.21msun&lt;mdon&lt;0.45msun) masses, the mass ratio(q = 0.32 +- 0.08), the orbital inclination (47 degrees &lt; i &lt; 70 degrees),derive an accurate orbital ephemeris (t0 = 2453383.578 + e x 0.10028081), andreport the detection of an outburst. we show that sdssj001153.08-064739.2 isone of the most extreme cases in which the donor star is clearly too hot forits mass. sdssj001153.08-064739.2 is therefore not only a peculiar cvcontaining an evolved donor star but also an accreting cv within the periodgap. intriguingly, approximately half of the total currently-observed sample ofthese peculiar cvs are located in the period gap with nearly the same orbitalperiod.

1407.3301	monte carlo simulations of post-common-envelope white dwarf + main  sequence binaries: the effects of including recombination energy	detached wd+ms pcebs are perhaps the most suitable objects for testingpredictions of close-compact binary-star evolution theories, in particular, ceevolution. the population of wd+ms pcebs has been simulated by several authorsin the past and compared with observations. however, most of those predictionsdid not take the possible contributions to the envelope ejection fromadditional sources of energy (mostly recombination energy) into account. herewe update existing binary population models of wd+ms pcebs by assuming that afraction of the recombination energy available within the envelope contributesto ejecting the envelope. we performed monte carlo simulations of 10^7 ms+msbinaries for 9 different models using standard assumptions for the initialprimary mass function, binary separations, and initial-mass-ratio distributionand evolved these systems using the publicly available bse code. including afraction of recombination energy leads to a clear prediction of a large numberof long orbital period (&gt;~10 days) systems mostly containing high-mass wds. thefraction of systems with he-core wd primaries increases with the ce efficiencyand the existence of very low-mass he wds is only predicted for high values ofthe ce efficiency (&gt;~0.5). all models predict on average longer orbital periodsfor pcebs containing c/o-core wds than for pcebs containing he wds. this effectincreases with increasing values of both efficiencies. longer periods after thece phase are also predicted for systems containing more massive secondarystars. the initial-mass-ratio distribution affects the distribution of orbitalperiods, especially the distribution of secondary star masses. our simulations,in combination with a large and homogeneous observational sample, can provideconstraints on the values of the ce efficiencies, as well as on theinitial-mass-ratio distribution for ms+ms binary stars.

1407.6615	the evolution of the self-lensing binary koi-3278: evidence of extra  energy sources during ce evolution	post-common-envelope binaries (pcebs) have been frequently used toobservationally constrain models of close-compact-binary evolution, inparticular common-envelope (ce) evolution. however, recent surveys havedetected pcebs consisting of a white dwarf (wd) exclusively with an m dwarfcompanion. thus, we have been essentially blind with respect to pcebs with moremassive companions. recently, the second pceb consisting of a wd and a g-typecompanion, the spectacularly self-lensing binary koi-3278, has been identified.this system is different from typical pcebs not only because of the g-typecompanion, but also because of its long orbital period. here we investigatewhether the existence of koi-3278 provides new observational constraints ontheories of ce evolution. we reconstruct its evolutionary history and predictits future using bse, clarifying the proper use of the binding energy parameterin this code. we find that a small amount of recombination energy, or any othersource of extra energy, is required to reconstruct the evolutionary history ofkoi-3278. using bse we derive progenitor system parameters of m1,i = 2.450msun, m2,i = 1.034 msun, and porb,i ~ 1300 d. we also find that in ~9 gyr thesystem will go through a second ce phase leaving behind a double wd, consistingof a c/o wd and a he wd with masses of 0.636 msun and 0.332 msun, respectively.after ik peg, koi-3278 is the second pceb that clearly requires an extra sourceof energy, beyond that of orbital energy, to contribute to the ce ejection.both systems are special in that they have long orbital periods and massivesecondaries. this may also indicate that the ce efficiency increases withsecondary mass.

1502.05116	the first science results from sphere: disproving the predicted brown  dwarf around v471 tau	variations of eclipse arrival times have recently been detected in severalpost common envelope binaries consisting of a white dwarf and a main sequencecompanion star. the generally favoured explanation for these timing variationsis the gravitational pull of one or more circumbinary substellar objectsperiodically moving the center of mass of the host binary. using the newextreme-ao instrument sphere, we image the prototype eclipsing post-commonenvelope binary v471 tau in search of the brown dwarf that is believed to beresponsible for variations in its eclipse arrival times. we report that anunprecedented contrast of 12.1 magnitudes in the h band at a separation of 260mas was achieved, but resulted in a non-detection. this implies that there isno brown dwarf present in the system unless it is three magnitudes fainter thanpredicted by evolutionary track models, and provides damaging evidence againstthe circumbinary interpretation of eclipse timing variations. in the case ofv471 tau, a more consistent explanation is offered with the applegatemechanism, in which these variations are prescribed to changes in thequadrupole moment within the main-sequence star

1503.05197	white dwarf masses in cataclysmic variables	the white dwarf (wd) mass distribution of cataclysmic variables (cvs) hasrecently been found to dramatically disagree with the predictions of thestandard cv formation model. the high mean wd mass among cvs is not imprintedin the currently observed sample of cv progenitors and cannot be attributed toselection effects. two possibilities have been put forward: either the wd growsin mass during cv evolution, or in a significant fraction of cases, cvformation is preceded by a (short) phase of thermal time-scale mass transfer(ttmt) in which the wd gains a sufficient amount of mass. we investigate ifeither of these two scenarios can bring theoretical predictions andobservations into agreement. we employed binary population synthesis models tosimulate the present intrinsic cv population. we incorporated aspects specificto cv evolution such as an appropriate mass-radius relation of the donor starand a more detailed prescription for the critical mass ratio for dynamicallyunstable mass transfer. we also implemented a previously suggested wind fromthe surface of the wd during ttmt and tested the idea of wd mass growth duringthe cv phase by arbitrarily changing the accretion efficiency. we compare themodel predictions with the characteristics of cvs derived from observedsamples. we find that mass growth of the wds in cvs fails to reproduce theobserved wd mass distribution. in the case of ttmt, we are able to produce alarge number of massive wds if we assume significant mass loss from the surfaceof the wd during the ttmt phase. however, the model still produces too many cvswith helium wds. moreover, the donor stars are evolved in many of thesepost-ttmt cvs, which contradicts the observations. we conclude that in ourcurrent framework of cv evolution neither ttmt nor wd mass growth can fullyexplain either the observed wd mass or the period distribution in cvs.

1504.05562	probing the final stages of protoplanetary disk evolution with alma	the evolution of a circumstellar disk from its gas-rich protoplanetary stageto its gas-poor debris stage is not understood well. it is apparent that diskclearing progresses from the inside-out on a short time scale and models ofphotoevaporation are frequently used to explain this. however, thephotoevaporation rates predicted by models differ by up to two orders ofmagnitude, resulting in uncertain time scales for the final stages of diskclearing. photoevaporation theories predict that the final stages ofdisk-clearing progress in objects that have ceased accretion but still possesconsiderable material at radii far from the star. weak-line t tauri stars(wtts) with infrared excess are likely in this configuration. we aim to provideobservational constraints on theories of disk-clearing by measuring the dustmasses and co content of a sample of young (1.8-26.3 myr) wtts. we used almaband 6 to obtain continuum and 12 co(2-1) line fluxes for a sample of 24 wttsstars with known infrared excess. we detect continuum emission in only four of24 wtts, and no 12 co(2-1) emission in any. for those wtts where no continuumwas detected, their ages and derived upper limits suggest they are debrisdisks, which makes them some of the youngest debris disks known. of those wherecontinuum was detected, three are possible photoevaporating disks, although thelack of co detection suggests a severely reduced gas-to-dust ratio. the lowfraction of continuum detections implies that, once accretion onto the starstops, the clearing of the majority of dust progresses very rapidly. most wttswith infrared excess are likely not in transition but are instead young debrisdisks, whose dust is either primordial and has survived disk-clearing, or is ofsecond-generation origin.

1505.01848	insights into internal effects of common-envelope evolution using the  extended kepler mission	we present an analysis of the binary and physical parameters of a uniquepulsating white dwarf with a main-sequence companion, sdss j1136+0409, observedfor more than 77 d during the first pointing of the extended kepler mission: k2campaign 1. using new ground-based spectroscopy, we show that thispost-common-envelope binary has an orbital period of 6.89760103(60) hr, whichis also seen in the photometry as a result of doppler beaming and ellipsoidalvariations of the secondary. we spectroscopically refine the temperature of thewhite dwarf to 12330(260) k and its mass to 0.601(36) msun. we detect sevenindependent pulsation modes in the k2 light curve. a preliminary asteroseismicsolution is in reasonable agreement with the spectroscopic atmosphericparameters. three of the pulsation modes are clearly rotationally splitmultiplets, which we use to demonstrate that the white dwarf is notsynchronously rotating with the orbital period but has a rotation period of2.49(53) hr. this is faster than any known isolated white dwarf, but slowerthan almost all white dwarfs measured in non-magnetic cataclysmic variables,the likely future state of this binary.

1506.02980	dynamical masses of a nova-like variable on the edge of the period gap	we present the first dynamical determination of the binary parameters of aneclipsing sw sextantis star in the 3-4 hour orbital period range during a lowstate. we obtained time-resolved optical spectroscopy and photometry of hs0220+0603 during its 2004-2005 low brightness state, as revealed in thecombined smarts, iac80 and m1 group long-term optical light curve.  the optical spectra taken during primary eclipse reveal a secondary starspectral type of m5.5 $\pm$ 0.5 as derived from molecular band-head indices.the spectra also provide the first detection of a dab white dwarf in acataclysmic variable. by modelling its optical spectrum we estimate a whitedwarf temperature of 30000 $\pm$ 5000 k.  by combining the results of modelling the white dwarf eclipse from ultracamlight curves with those obtained by simultaneously fitting the emission- andabsorption-line radial velocity curves and i-band ellipsoidal light curves, wemeasure the stellar masses to be m$_1 = 0.87 \pm 0.09$ m$_\odot$ and m$_2 =0.47 \pm 0.05$ m$_\odot$ for the white dwarf and the m dwarf, respectively, andan inclination of the orbital plane of $i \approx 79^\mathrm{o}$. a radius of$0.0103 \pm 0.0007$ r$_\odot$ is obtained for the white dwarf. the secondarystar in hs 0220+0603 is likely too cool and undersized for its mass.

1509.06745	non-azimuthal linear polarization in protoplanetary disks	several studies discussing imaging polarimetry observations of protoplanetarydisks use the so-called radial stokes parameters q_phi and u_phi to discuss theresults. this approach has the advantage of providing a direct measure of thenoise in the polarized images under the assumption that the polarization isazimuthal only, i.e., perpendicular to the direction towards the illuminatingsource. however, a detailed study of the validity of this assumption iscurrently missing. we aim to test whether departures from azimuthalpolarization can naturally be produced by scattering processes in opticallythick protoplanetary disks at near infrared wavelengths. we use the radiativetransfer code mcfost to create a generic model of a transition disk usingdifferent grain size distributions and dust masses. from these models wegenerate synthetic polarized images at 2.2\mum. we find that even for moderateinclinations (e.g., i = 40degr), multiple scattering alone can producesignificant (up to ~4.5% of the q_phi image) non-azimuthal polarizationreflected in the u_phi images. we also find that different grain populationscan naturally produce radial polarization (negative values in the q_phiimages). our results suggest that caution is recommended when interpretingpolarized images by only analyzing the q_phi and u_phi images. we find thatthere can be astrophysical signal in the u_phi images and negative values inthe q_phi images, which indicate departures from azimuthal polarization. ifsignificant signal is detected in the u_phi images, we recommend to check thestandard q and u images to look for departures from azimuthal polarization. onthe positive side, signal in the u_phi images once all instrumental anddata-reduction artifacts have been corrected for means that there is moreinformation to be extracted regarding the dust population and particle density.

astro-ph;0004279	the response of a dwarf nova disc to real mass transfer variations	we present simulations of dwarf nova outbursts taking into account realisticvariations of the mass loss rate from the secondary. the mass transfervariation has been derived from 20 years of visual monitoring and from x-rayobservations covering various accretion states of the discless cataclysmicvariable am herculis. we find that the outburst behaviour of a fictitious dwarfnova with the same system parameters as am her is strongly influenced by thesevariations of the mass loss rate. depending on the mass loss rate, the discproduces either long outbursts, a cycle of one long outburst followed by twoshort outbursts, or only short outbursts. the course of the transfer ratedominates the shape of the outbursts because the mass accreted during anoutburst cycle roughly equals the mass transferred from the secondary over theoutburst interval. only for less than 10% of the simulated time, when the masstransfer rate is nearly constant, the disc is in a quasi-stationary stateduring which it periodically repeats the same cycle of outbursts. consequently,assuming that the secondary stars in non-magnetic cv's do not differ from thosein magnetic ones, our simulation indicates that probably all dwarf novae arerarely in a stationary state and are constantly adjusting to the prevailingvalue of the mass transfer rate from the secondary.

astro-ph;0111267	implications of the hst/fgs parallax of ss cygni on the disc instability  model	we analyse the consequences of the recently measured parallax of ss cygni(harrison et al. 1999) on the accretion disc limit cycle model. using theobserved long term light curve of ss cyg and d=166 pc, we obtain for the meanmass transfer rate 4.2*10^(17)g/s. in addition, we calculate the verticalstructure of the accretion disc taking into account heating of the outer discby the stream impact. comparing the mean accretion rate derived from theobservations with the calculated critical mass transfer rate, we find that thedisc instability model disagrees with the observed long term light curve of sscyg as the mean mass transfer rate is greater or similar to the critical masstransfer rate. the failure of the model indicated by this result can beconfirmed by considering that the accretion rate at the onset of the declineshould be exactly equal to the value critical for stability. in contrast tothis prediction of the model, we find that the accretion rate required toexplain the observed visual magnitude at the onset of the decline must besignificantly higher than the critical mass transfer rate. our results stronglysuggest that either the usually assumed temperature dependence of the viscosityparameter alpha is not a realistic description of the disc viscosity, that themass transfer rate in ss cyg noticeably increases during the outbursts or,finally, that the hst distance of 166 pc, is too high.

astro-ph;0305531	the age, life expectancy, and space density of post common envelope  binaries	we present a sample of 30 well observed post common envelope binaries(pcebs). deriving the cooling age of the white dwarfs, we show that the pcebpopulation is dominated by young systems. having calculated the orbitalevolution of the systems under the assumption of two different prescriptionsfor the angular momentum loss, we find that most of the systems have not yetcompleted a significant fraction of their pceb life time. we therefore predictthe existence of a large population of old pcebs containing cold white dwarfs(t_eff&lt;15000 k). our calculations show that nearly half of the pcebs in oursample will evolve into a semi-detached configuration and start mass transferin less than the hubble-time. these systems are thus representative forprogenitors of the current cv population. only one of them (v471 tau) willevolve into a long-period (porb&gt;4h) cv, and a significant fraction of thesystems will start mass transfer in the period gap. having estimated thedistances of the pcebs in the sample, we derive a space density of ~6-30x1e-6[pc-3], depending on the assumed angular momentum loss prescription. takinginto account the evolutionary time scales we compute a lower limit for the cvspace density, predicted by the currently known pceb population of ~10 x 1e-5[pc-3]. finally, we discuss possible observational selection effects andconclude that the observed pceb population is probably highly incomplete.

astro-ph;0611461	understanding white dwarf binary evolution with white dwarf/main  sequence binaries: first results from segue	close white dwarf binaries make up a wide variety of objects such as doublewhite dwarf binaries, which are possible sn ia progenitors, cataclysmicvariables, super soft sources, or am cvn stars. the evolution and formation ofclose white dwarf binaries crucially depends on the rate at which angularmomentum is extracted from the binary orbit. the two most important sources ofangular momentum loss are the common envelope phase and magnetic braking. bothprocesses are so far poorly understood. observational population studies ofwhite dwarf/main sequence binaries provide the potential to significantlyprogress with this situation and to clearly constrain magnetic braking and thece-phase. however, the current population of white dwarf/main sequence binariesis highly incomplete and heavily biased towards young systems containing hotwhite dwarfs. the sdssii/segue collaboration awarded us with 5 fibers per platepair in order to fill this gap and to identify the required unbiased sample ofold white dwarf/main sequence binaries. the success rate of our selectioncriteria exceeds 65% and during the first 10 months we have identified 41 newsystems, most of them belonging to the missed old population.
