1001.2769	the acs fornax cluster survey. ix. the color-magnitude relation of  globular cluster systems	we investigate the color-magnitude relation for globular clusters (gcs) --the so-called "blue tilt" -- detected in the acs fornax cluster survey andusing the combined sample of gcs from the acs fornax and virgo cluster surveys.we find a tilt of gamma_z=d(g-z)/dz=-0.0257 +- 0.0050 for the full gc sample ofthe fornax cluster survey (~5800 gcs). this is slightly shallower than thevalue gamma_z=-0.0459 +- 0.0048 found for the virgo cluster survey gc sample(~11100 gcs). the slope for the merged fornax and virgo datasets (~16900 gcs)is gamma_z=-0.0293 +- 0.0085, corresponding to a mass-metallicity relation of z~ m^0.43. we find that the blue tilt sets in at gc masses in excess of m ~2*10^5 m_sun. the tilt is stronger for gcs belonging to high-mass galaxies (m_*&gt; 5 * 10^10 m_sun) than for those in low-mass galaxies (m_* &lt; 5 * 10^10 m_sun).it is also more pronounced for gcs with smaller galactocentric distances. ourfindings suggest a range of mass-metallicity relations z_gc ~ m_gc^(0.3-0.7)which vary as a function of host galaxy mass/luminosity. we compare ourobservations to a recent model of star cluster self-enrichment with generallyfavorable results. we suggest that, within the context of this model, theproto-cluster clouds out of which the gcs formed may have had density profilesslightly steeper than isothermal and/or star formation efficiencies somewhatbelow 0.3. we caution, however, that the significantly different appearance ofthe cmds defined by the gc systems associated with galaxies of similar mass andmorphological type pose a challenge to any single mechanism that seeks toexplain the blue tilt. we therefore suggest that the merger/accretion historiesof individual galaxies have played a non-negligible role determining thedistribution of gcs in the cmds of individual gc systems.

1101.2024	planck early results viii: the all-sky early sunyaev-zeldovich cluster  sample	we present the first all-sky sample of galaxy clusters detected blindly bythe planck satellite through the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) effect from its sixhighest frequencies. this early sz (esz) sample is comprised of 189 candidates,which have a high signal-to-noise ratio ranging from 6 to 29. its highreliability (purity above 95%) is further ensured by an extensive validationprocess based on planck internal quality assessments and by externalcross-identification and follow-up observations. planck provides the firstmeasured sz signal for about 80% of the 169 previously-known esz clusters.planck furthermore releases 30 new cluster candidates, amongst which 20 meetthe esz signal-to-noise selection criterion. at the submission date, twelve ofthe 20 esz candidates were confirmed as new clusters, with eleven confirmedusing xmm-newton snapshot observations, most of them with disturbedmorphologies and low luminosities. the esz clusters are mostly at moderateredshifts (86% with z below 0.3) and span more than a decade in mass, up to therarest and most massive clusters with masses above 10^15 msol.

1101.2027	planck early results: cluster sunyaev-zeldovich optical scaling  relations	we present the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal-to-richness scaling relation(y500-n200) for the maxbcg cluster catalogue. employing a multi-frequencymatched filter on the planck sky maps, we measure the sz signal for eachcluster by adapting the filter according to weak-lensing calibratedmass-richness relations (n200-m500). we bin our individual measurements anddetect the sz signal down to the lowest richness systems (n200=10) with highsignificance, achieving a detection of the sz signal in systems with mass aslow as m500~5e13 msolar. the observed y500-n200 relation is well modeled by apower law over the full richness range. it has a lower normalisation at givenn200 than predicted based on x-ray models and published mass-richnessrelations. an x-ray subsample, however, does conform to the predicted scaling,and model predictions do reproduce the relation between our measuredbin-average sz signal and measured bin-average x-ray luminosities. at fixedrichness, we find an intrinsic dispersion in the y500-n200 relation of 60%rising to of order 100% at low richness. thanks to its all-sky coverage, planckprovides observations for more than 13,000 maxbcg clusters and an unprecedentedsz/optical data set, extending the list of known cluster scaling laws toinclude sz-optical properties. the data set offers essential clues for modelsof galaxy formation. moreover, the lower normalisation of the sz-mass relationimplied by the observed sz-richness scaling has important consequences forcluster physics and cosmological studies with sz clusters.

1102.1316	the galex ultraviolet virgo cluster survey (guvics). i: the uv  luminosity function of the central 12 sq.deg	the galex ultraviolet virgo cluster survey (guvics) is a complete blindsurvey of the virgo cluster covering about 40 sq. deg. in the far uv (fuv,lambda_eff=1539a, delta-lambda=442a) and about 120 sq. deg. in the near uv(nuv, lambda_eff=2316a, delta-lambda=1060a). the goal of the survey is to studythe ultraviolet (uv) properties of galaxies in a rich cluster environment,spanning a wide luminosity range from giants to dwarfs, and regardless of priorknowledge of their star formation activity. the uv data will be combined withthose in other bands (optical: ngvs; far-infrared - submm: hevics; hi: alfalfa)and with our multizone chemo-spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution tomake a complete and exhaustive study of the effects of the environment on theevolution of galaxies in high density regions. we present here the scientificobjectives of the survey, describing the observing strategy and brieflydiscussing different data reduction techniques. using uv data already in-handfor the central 12 sq. deg. we determine the fuv and nuv luminosity functionsof the virgo cluster core for all cluster members and separately for early- andlate-type galaxies and compare it to the one obtained in the field and othernearby clusters (coma, a1367). this analysis shows that the fuv and nuvluminosity functions of the core of the virgo clusters are flatter (alpha about-1.1) than those determined in coma and a1367. we discuss the possible originof this difference

1103.0259	early-type galaxies at z~1.3. ii. masses and ages of early-type galaxies  in different environments and their dependence on stellar population model  assumptions	we have derived masses and ages for 79 early-type galaxies (etgs) indifferent environments at z~1.3 in the lynx supercluster and in the goods/cdf-sfield using multiwavelength (0.6-4.5 $\mu$m; kpno, palomar, keck, hst, spitzer)datasets. at this redshift the contribution of the tp-agb phase is importantfor etgs, and the mass and age estimates depend on the choice of the stellarpopulation model used in the spectral energy distribution fits. we describe indetail the differences among model predictions for a large range of galaxyages, showing the dependence of these differences on age. current models stillyield large uncertainties. while recent models from maraston and charlot &amp;bruzual offer better modeling of the tp-agb phase with respect to less recentbruzual &amp; charlot models, their predictions do not often match. the modeling ofthis tp-agb phase has a significant impact on the derived parameters forgalaxies observed at high-redshift. some of our results do not depend on thechoice of the model: for all models, the most massive galaxies are the oldestones, independent of the environment. when using maraston and charlot &amp; bruzualmodels, the mass distribution is similar in the clusters and in the groups,whereas in our field sample there is a deficit of massive (m $\gtrsim$ 10^11msun) etgs. according to those last models, etgs belonging to the clusterenvironment host on average older stars with respect to group and fieldpopulations. this difference is less significant than the age difference ingalaxies of different masses.

1103.0265	early-type galaxies at z ~ 1.3. iii. on the dependence of formation  epochs and star formation histories on stellar mass and environment	we study the environmental dependence of stellar population properties at z ~1.3. we derive galaxy properties (stellar masses, ages and star formationhistories) for samples of massive, red, passive early-type galaxies in twohigh-redshift clusters, rxj0849+4452 and rxj0848+4453 (with redshifts of z =1.26 and 1.27, respectively), and compare them with those measured for therdcs1252.9-2927 cluster at z=1.24 and with those measured for a similarlymass-selected sample of field contemporaries drawn from the goods-south field.robust estimates of the aforementioned parameters have been obtained bycomparing a large grid of composite stellar population models with extensive8-10 band photometric coverage, from the rest-frame far-ultraviolet to theinfrared. we find no variations of the overall stellar population propertiesamong the different samples of cluster early-type galaxies. however, whencomparing cluster versus field stellar population properties we find that, evenif the (star formation weighted) ages are similar and depend only on galaxymass, the ones in the field do employ longer timescales to assemble their finalmass. we find that, approximately 1 gyr after the onset of star formation, themajority (75%) of cluster galaxies have already assembled most (&gt; 80%) of theirfinal mass, while, by the same time, fewer (35%) field etgs have. thus weconclude that while galaxy mass regulates the timing of galaxy formation, theenvironment regulates the timescale of their star formation histories.

1109.0284	early-type galaxies at z~1.3. iv. scaling relations in different  environments	we present the kormendy and mass-size relations for early-type galaxies(etgs) as a function of environment at z~1.3. our sample includes 76 visuallyclassified etgs with masses 10^10 &lt; m/msun &lt; 10^11.5, selected in the lynxsupercluster and in the goods/cdf-s field, 31 etgs in clusters, 18 in groupsand 27 in the field, all with multi-wavelength photometry and hst/acsobservations. the kormendy relation, in place at z~1.3, does not depend on theenvironment. the mass-size relation reveals that etgs overall appear to be morecompact in denser environments: cluster etgs have sizes on average around30-50% smaller than those of the local universe, and a distribution with asmaller scatter, whereas field etgs show a mass-size relation with a similardistribution than the local one. our results imply that (1) the mass-sizerelation in the field did not evolve overall from z ~ 1.3 to present; this isinteresting and in contrast to the trend found at higher masses from previousworks; (2) in denser environments, either etgs have increased their size by30-50%, on average, and spread their distributions, or more etgs have beenformed within the dense environment from not etg progenitors or larger galaxieshave been accreted to a pristine compact population to reproduce the mass-sizerelation observed in the local universe. our results are driven by galaxieswith masses m&lt;2*10^11msun and those with masses m~10^11msun follow the sametrends that the entire sample. following valentinuzzi et al. definition ofsuperdense etgs, around 35-45% of our cluster sample is made of superdenseetgs.

0710.3192	the environment of m85 optical transient 2006-1: constraints on the  progenitor age and mass	m85 optical transient 2006-1 (m85 ot 2006-1) is the most luminous member ofthe small family of v838 mon-like objects, whose nature is still a mystery.this event took place in the virgo cluster of galaxies and peaked at anabsolute magnitude of i~-13. here we present hubble space telescope images ofm85 ot 2006-1 and its environment, taken before and after the eruption, alongwith a spectrum of the host galaxy at the transient location. we find that theprogenitor of m85 ot 2006-1 was not associated with any star forming region.the g and z-band absolute magnitudes of the progenitor were fainter than about-4 and -6 mag, respectively. therefore, we can set a lower limit of ~50 myr onthe age of the youngest stars at the location of the progenitor thatcorresponds to a mass of &lt;7 solar mass. previously published line indicessuggest that m85 has a mean stellar age of 1.6+/-0.3 gyr. if this mean age isrepresentative of the progenitor of m85 ot 2006-1, then we can furtherconstrain its mass to be less than 2 solar mass. we compare the energetics andmass limit derived for the m85 ot 2006-1 progenitor with those expected from asimple model of violent stellar mergers. combined with further modeling, thesenew clues may ultimately reveal the true nature of these puzzling events.

1207.4009	planck intermediate results. vi: the dynamical structure of  plckg214.6+37.0, a planck discovered triple system of galaxy clusters	the survey of galaxy clusters performed by planck through thesunyaev-zeldovich effect has already discovered many interesting objects,thanks to the whole coverage of the sky. one of the sz candidates detected inthe early months of the mission near to the signal to noise threshold,plckg214.6+37.0, was later revealed by xmm-newton to be a triple system ofgalaxy clusters. we have further investigated this puzzling system with amulti-wavelength approach and we present here the results from a deepxmm-newton re-observation. the characterisation of the physical properties ofthe three components has allowed us to build a template model to extract thetotal sz signal of this system with planck data. we partly reconciled thediscrepancy between the expected sz signal from x-rays and the observed one,which are now consistent at less than 1.2 sigma. we measured the redshift ofthe three components with the iron lines in the x-ray spectrum, and confirmedthat the three clumps are likely part of the same supercluster structure. theanalysis of the dynamical state of the three components, as well as the absenceof detectable excess x-ray emission, suggest that we are witnessing theformation of a massive cluster at an early phase of interaction.

1207.4061	planck intermediate results. v. pressure profiles of galaxy clusters  from the sunyaev-zeldovich effect	taking advantage of the all-sky coverage and broad frequency range of theplanck satellite, we study the sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) and pressure profiles of62 nearby massive clusters detected at high significance in the 14-monthnominal survey. careful reconstruction of the sz signal indicates that mostclusters are individually detected at least out to r500. by stacking the radialprofiles, we have statistically detected the radial sz signal out to 3 x r500,i.e., at a density contrast of about 50-100, though the dispersion about themean profile dominates the statistical errors across the whole radial range.our measurement is fully consistent with previous planck results on integratedsz fluxes, further strengthening the agreement between sz and x-raymeasurements inside r500. correcting for the effects of the planck beam, wehave calculated the corresponding pressure profiles. this new constraint fromsz measurements is consistent with the x-ray constraints from xmm-newton in theregion in which the profiles overlap (i.e., [0.1-1]r500), and is in fairly goodagreement with theoretical predictions within the expected dispersion. atlarger radii the average pressure profile is slightly flatter than mostpredictions from numerical simulations. combining the sz and x-ray observedprofiles into a joint fit to a generalised pressure profile gives best-fitparameters [p0, c500, gamma, alpha, beta] = [6.41, 1.81, 0.31, 1.33, 4.13].using a reasonable hypothesis for the gas temperature in the cluster outskirtswe reconstruct from our stacked pressure profile the gas mass fraction profileout to 3 x r500. within the temperature driven uncertainties, our planckconstraints are compatible with the cosmic baryon fraction and expected gasfraction in halos.

1208.3611	planck intermediate results. x. physics of the hot gas in the coma  cluster	we present an analysis of planck satellite data on the coma cluster observedvia the sunyaev-zeldovich effect. planck is able, for the first time, to detectsz emission up to r ~ 3 x r_500. we test previously proposed models for thepressure distribution in clusters against the azimuthally averaged data. wefind that the arnaud et al. universal pressure profile does not fit coma, andthat their pressure profile for merging systems provides a good fit of the dataonly at r&lt;r_500: by r=2xr_500 it underestimates the observed y profile by afactor of ~2. this may indicate that at these larger radii either i) thecluster sz emission is contaminated by unresolved sz sources along the line ofsight or ii) the pressure profile of coma is higher at r&gt;r_500 than the meanpressure profile predicted by the simulations. the planck image showssignificant local steepening of the y profile in two regions about half adegree to the west and to the south-east of the cluster centre. these featuresare consistent with the presence of shock fronts at these radii, and indeed thewestern feature was previously noticed in the rosat pspc mosaic as well as inthe radio. using planck y profiles extracted from corresponding sectors we findpressure jumps of 4.5+0.4-0.2 and 5.0+1.3-0.1 in the west and southeast,respectively. assuming rankine-hugoniot pressure jump conditions, we deducethat the shock waves should propagate with mach number m_w=2.03+0.09-0.04 andm_se=2.05+0.25-0.02 in the west and southeast, respectively. finally, we findthat the y and radio-synchrotron signals are quasi-linearly correlated on mpcscales with small intrinsic scatter. this implies either that the energydensity of cosmic-ray electrons is relatively constant throughout the cluster,or that the magnetic fields fall off much more slowly with radius thanpreviously thought.

1208.5911	planck intermediate results. viii. filaments between interacting  clusters	about half of the baryons of the universe are expected to be in the form offilaments of hot and low density intergalactic medium. most of these baryonsremain undetected even by the most advanced x-ray observatories which arelimited in sensitivity to the diffuse low density medium. the planck satellitehas provided hundreds of detections of the hot gas in clusters of galaxies viathe thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich (tsz) effect and is an ideal instrument forstudying extended low density media through the tsz effect. in this paper weuse the planck data to search for signatures of a fraction of these missingbaryons between pairs of galaxy clusters. cluster pairs are good candidates forsearching for the hotter and denser phase of the intergalactic medium (which ismore easily observed through the sz effect). using an x-ray catalogue ofclusters and the planck data, we select physical pairs of clusters ascandidates. using the planck data we construct a local map of the tsz effectcentered on each pair of galaxy clusters. rosat data is used to construct x-raymaps of these pairs. after having modelled and subtracted the tsz effect andx-ray emission for each cluster in the pair we study the residuals on both thesz and x-ray maps. for the merging cluster pair a399-a401 we observe asignificant tsz effect signal in the intercluster region beyond the virialradii of the clusters. a joint x-ray sz analysis allows us to constrain thetemperature and density of this intercluster medium. we obtain a temperature ofkt = 7.1 +- 0.9, kev (consistent with previous estimates) and a baryon densityof (3.7 +- 0.2)x10^-4, cm^-3. the planck satellite mission has provided thefirst sz detection of the hot and diffuse intercluster gas.

1211.6122	systematic effects on the size-luminosity relation: dependence on model  fitting and morphology	we quantify the systematics in the size-luminosity relation of galaxies inthe sdss main sample which arise from fitting different 1- and 2-componentmodel profiles to the images. in objects brighter than l*, fitting a singlesersic profile to what is really a two-component serexp system leads to biases:the half-light radius is increasingly overestimated as n of the fitted singlecomponent increases; it is also overestimated at b/t ~ 0.6. however, the neteffect on the r-l relation is small, except for the most luminous tail, whereit curves upwards towards larger sizes. we also study how this relation dependson morphological type. our analysis is one of the first to usebayesian-classifier derived weights, rather than hard cuts, to definemorphology. crudely, there appear to be only two relations: one for early-types(es, s0s and sa's) and another for late-types (sbs and scds). however, closerinspection shows that within the early-type sample s0s tend to be 15% smallerthan es of the same luminosity, and, among faint late types, sbs are more than25% smaller than scds. neither the early- nor the late-type relations are purepower-laws: both show significant curvature, which we quantify. however, ther-l relations of the bulges of early-types are almost pure power laws. ouranalysis confirms that two mass scales are special for early-type galaxies: m*= 3e10 and 2e11 msun. these same mass scales are also special for late types:there is almost no correlation between r and m* below the former, and almost nolate-types above the latter. we also show that the intrinsic scatter around therelation decreases at large luminosity and/or stellar mass; this should provideadditional constraints on models of how the most massive galaxies formed.

1212.4131	planck intermediate results. xi: the gas content of dark matter halos:  the sunyaev-zeldovich-stellar mass relation for locally brightest galaxies	we present the scaling relation between sunyaev-zeldovich (sz) signal andstellar mass for almost 260,000 locally brightest galaxies (lbgs) selected fromthe sloan digital sky survey (sdss). these are predominantly the centralgalaxies of their dark matter halos. we calibrate the stellar-to-halo massconversion using realistic mock catalogues based on the millennium simulation.applying a multi-frequency matched filter to the planck data for each lbg, andaveraging the results in bins of stellar mass, we measure the mean sz signaldown to $m_\ast\sim 2\times 10^{11} \msolar$, with a clear indication of signalat even lower stellar mass. we derive the scaling relation between sz signaland halo mass by assigning halo properties from our mock catalogues to the reallbgs and simulating the planck observation process. this relation shows noevidence for deviation from a power law over a halo mass range extending fromrich clusters down to $m_{500}\sim 2\times 10^{13} \msolar$, and there is aclear indication of signal down to $m_{500}\sim 4\times 10^{12} \msolar$.planck's sz detections in such low-mass halos imply that about a quarter of allbaryons have now been seen in the form of hot halo gas, and that this gas mustbe less concentrated than the dark matter in such halos in order to remainconsistent with x-ray observations. at the high-mass end, the measured szsignal is 20% lower than found from observations of x-ray clusters, adifference consistent with malmquist bias effects in the x-ray sample.

1303.5089	planck 2013 results. xxix. planck catalogue of sunyaev-zeldovich sources	we describe the all-sky planck catalogue of clusters and cluster candidatesderived from sunyaev--zeldovich (sz) effect detections using the first 15.5months of planck satellite observations. the catalogue contains 1227 entries,making it over six times the size of the planck early sz (esz) sample and thelargest sz-selected catalogue to date. it contains 861 confirmed clusters, ofwhich 178 have been confirmed as clusters, mostly through follow-upobservations, and a further 683 are previously-known clusters. the remaining366 have the status of cluster candidates, and we divide them into threeclasses according to the quality of evidence that they are likely to be trueclusters. the planck sz catalogue is the deepest all-sky cluster catalogue,with redshifts up to about one, and spans the broadest cluster mass range from(0.1 to 1.6) 10^{15}msun. confirmation of cluster candidates through comparisonwith existing surveys or cluster catalogues is extensively described, as is thestatistical characterization of the catalogue in terms of completeness andstatistical reliability. the outputs of the validation process are provided asadditional information. this gives, in particular, an ensemble of 813 clusterredshifts, and for all these planck clusters we also include a mass estimatedfrom a newly-proposed sz-mass proxy. a refined measure of the sz comptonparameter for the clusters with x-ray counter-parts is provided, as is an x-rayflux for all the planck clusters not previously detected in x-ray surveys.

1304.7778	the massive end of the luminosity and stellar mass functions: dependence  on the fit to the light profile	in addition to the large systematic differences arising from assumptionsabout the stellar mass-to-light ratio, the massive end of the stellar massfunction is rather sensitive to how one fits the light profiles of the mostluminous galaxies. we quantify this by comparing the luminosity and stellarmass functions based on sdss cmodel magnitudes, and pymorph single-sersic andsersic-exponential fits to the surface brightness profiles of galaxies in thesdss. the pymorph fits return more light, so that the predicted masses arelarger than when cmodel magnitudes are used. as a result, the total stellarmass density at z~0.1 is about 1.2x larger than in our previous analysis of thesdss. the differences are most pronounced at the massive end, where themeasured number density of objects having m* &gt; 6 x 10^{11} msun is ~5x larger.alternatively, at number densities of 10^{-6} mpc^{-3}, the limiting stellarmass is 2x larger. the differences with respect to fits by other authors,typically based on petrosian-like magnitudes, are even more dramatic, althoughsome of these differences are due to sky-subtraction problems, and aresometimes masked by large differences in the assumed $m_*/l$ (even afterscaling to the same imf). our results impact studies of the growth and assemblyof stellar mass in galaxies, and of the relation between stellar and halo mass,so we provide simple analytic fits to these new luminosity and stellar massfunctions and quantify how they depend on morphology, as well as the binnedcounts in electronic format.

1305.0882	the importance of major mergers in the build up of stellar mass in  brightest cluster galaxies at z=1	recent independent results from numerical simulations and observations haveshown that brightest cluster galaxies (bcgs) have increased their stellar massby a factor of almost two between z~0.9 and z~0.2. the numerical simulationsfurther suggest that more than half this mass is accreted through majormergers. using a sample of 18 distant galaxy clusters with over 600spectroscopically confirmed cluster members between them, we search forobservational evidence that major mergers do play a significant role. we find amajor merger rate of 0.38 +/- 0.14 mergers per gyr at z~1. while theuncertainties, which stem from the small size of our sample, are relativelylarge, our rate is consistent with the results that are derived from numericalsimulations. if we assume that this rate continues to the present day and thathalf of the mass of the companion is accreted onto the bcg during thesemergers, then we find that this rate can explain the growth in the stellar massof the bcgs that is observed and predicted by simulations. major mergerstherefore appear to be playing an important role, perhaps even the dominantone, in the build up of stellar mass in these extraordinary galaxies.

1307.0003	larger sizes of massive quiescent early-type galaxies in clusters than  in the field at 0.8 &lt; z &lt; 1.5	[abridged] the mass-size relation of early-type galaxies (etgs) has beenlargely studied in the last years to probe the mass assembly of the mostmassive objects in the universe. in this paper, we focus on the mass-sizerelation of quiescent massive etgs (mstar/msol &gt; 3*10^10) living in massiveclusters (m200 ~ 10^14 mstar) at 0.8&lt; z &lt;1.5, as compared to those living inthe field at the same epoch. our sample contains ~ 400 etgs in clusters and thesame number in the field. therefore, our sample is approximately an order ofmagnitude larger than previous studies in the same redshift range for galaxyclusters. we find that etgs living in clusters are between ~30-50% larger thangalaxies with the same stellar mass residing in the field. we parametrize thesize using the mass-normalized size, gamma=re/mstar^0.57. the gammadistributions in both environments peak at the same position but thedistributions in clusters are more skewed towards larger sizes. since this sizedifference is not observed in the local universe, the size evolution at fixedstellar mass from z~1.5 of cluster galaxies is less steep ((1+z)-0.53pm0.04)than the evolution of field galaxies ((1+z)-0.92pm0.04).  the size difference seems to be essentially driven by the galaxies residingin the clusters cores (r&lt;0.5*r200). if part of the size evolution is due tomergers, the difference we see between cluster and field galaxies could be dueto higher merger rates in clusters at higher redshift, probably during theformation phase of the clusters when velocity dispersions are lower. we cannotexclude however that the difference is driven by newly quenched galaxies whichare quenched more efficiently in clusters. the implications of these resultsfor the hierarchical growth of etgs will be discussed in a companion paper.

1307.5867	clash-vlt: the mass, velocity-anisotropy, and pseudo-phase-space density  profiles of the z=0.44 galaxy cluster macs 1206.2-0847	we use an unprecedented data-set of about 600 redshifts for cluster members,obtained as part of a vlt/vimos large programme, to constrain the mass profileof the z=0.44 cluster macs j1206.2-0847 over the radial range 0-5 mpc (0-2.5virial radii) using the mamposst and caustic methods. we then add externalconstraints from our previous gravitational lensing analysis. we invert thejeans equation to obtain the velocity-anisotropy profiles of cluster members.with the mass-density and velocity-anisotropy profiles we then obtain the firstdetermination of a cluster pseudo-phase-space density profile. the kinematicsand lensing determinations of the cluster mass profile are in excellentagreement. this is very well fitted by a nfw model with mass m200=(1.4 +- 0.2)10^15 msun and concentration c200=6 +- 1, only slightly higher than theoreticalexpectations. other mass profile models also provide acceptable fits to ourdata, of (slightly) lower (burkert, hernquist, and softened isothermal sphere)or comparable (einasto) quality than nfw. the velocity anisotropy profiles ofthe passive and star-forming cluster members are similar, close to isotropicnear the center and increasingly radial outside. passive cluster members followextremely well the theoretical expectations for the pseudo-phase-space densityprofile and the relation between the slope of the mass-density profile and thevelocity anisotropy. star-forming cluster members show marginal deviations fromtheoretical expectations. this is the most accurate determination of a clustermass profile out to a radius of 5 mpc, and the only determination of thevelocity-anisotropy and pseudo-phase-space density profiles of both passive andstar-forming galaxies for an individual cluster [abridged]

1404.0023	candidate clusters of galaxies at $z&gt;1.3$ identified in the spitzer spt  deep field survey	we present 279 galaxy cluster candidates at $z &gt; 1.3$ selected from the 94deg$^{2}$ spitzer south pole telescope deep field (ssdf) survey. we use asimple algorithm to select candidate high-redshift clusters of galaxies basedon spitzer/irac mid-infrared data combined with shallow all-sky optical data.we identify distant cluster candidates in ssdf adopting an overdensitythreshold that results in a high purity (80%) cluster sample based on tests inthe spitzer deep, wide-field survey of the bo\"otes field. our simple algorithmdetects all three $1.4 &lt; z \leq 1.75$ x-ray detected clusters in the bo\"otesfield. the uniqueness of the ssdf survey resides not just in its area, one ofthe largest contiguous extragalactic fields observed with spitzer, but also inits deep, multi-wavelength coverage by the south pole telescope (spt),herschel/spire and xmm-newton. this rich dataset will allow direct or stackedmeasurements of sunyaev-zel'dovich effect decrements or x-ray masses for manyof the ssdf clusters presented here, and enable systematic study of the mostdistant clusters on an unprecedented scale. we measure the angular correlationfunction of our sample and find that these candidates show strong clustering.employing the cosmos/ultravista photometric catalog in order to infer theredshift distribution of our cluster selection, we find that these clustershave a comoving number density $n_c = (0.7^{+6.3}_{-0.6}) \times 10^{-7} h^{3}\mathrm{mpc}^{-3}$ and a spatial clustering correlation scale length $r_0 = (32\pm 7) h^{-1} \rm{mpc}$. assuming our sample is comprised of dark matter halosabove a characteristic minimum mass, $m_{{\rm min}}$, we derive that at $z=1.5$these clusters reside in halos larger than $m_{{\rm min}} = 1.5^{+0.9}_{-0.7}\times 10^{14} h^{-1} m_{\odot}$.

1406.1175	measuring galaxy morphology at $z&gt;1$. i - calibration of automated  proxies	[abridged] new near-infrared surveys, using the hst, offer an unprecedentedopportunity to study rest-frame optical galaxy morphologies at z&gt;1 and tocalibrate automated morphological parameters that will play a key role inclassifying future massive datasets like euclid or lsst. we study automatedparameters (e.g. cas, gini, m20) of massive galaxies at 1&lt;z&lt;3, measure theirdependence on wavelength and evolution with redshift and quantify thereliability of these parameters in discriminating between visually-determinedmorphologies, using machine learning algorithms. we find that the relativetrends between morphological types observed in the low-redshift literature arepreserved at z&gt;1: bulge-dominated systems have systematically higherconcentration and gini coefficients and are less asymmetric and rounder thandisk-dominated galaxies. however, at z&gt;1, galaxies are, on average, 50% moreasymmetric and have gini and m20 values that are 10% higher and 20% lowerrespectively. in bulge-dominated galaxies, morphological parameters derivedfrom the rest-frame uv and optical wavelengths are well correlated; howeverlate-type galaxies exhibit higher asymmetry and clumpiness when measured in therest-frame uv. we find that broad morphological classes (e.g. bulge vs. diskdominated) can be distinguished using parameters with high (80%) purity andcompleteness of 80%. in a similar vein, irregular disks and mergers can also bedistinguished from bulges and regular disks with a contamination lower than20%. however, mergers cannot be differentiated from the irregular morphologicalclass using these parameters, due to increasingly asymmetry of non-interactinglate-type galaxies at z&gt;1. our automated procedure is applied to the candelsgoods-s field and compared with the visual classification recently released onthe same area getting similar results.

1407.8185	the role of major mergers in the size growth of intermediate-mass  spheroids	we study of the role of major mergers (mass ratios &gt;1:4) in driving sizegrowth in high-redshift (1&lt;z&lt;2) spheroidal galaxies (sgs) with stellar massesbetween 10^9.5 msun and 10^10.7 msun. this is a largely unexplored mass rangeat this epoch, containing the progenitors of more massive sgs on which the bulkof the size-evolution literature is based. we visually split our sgs intosystems that are relaxed and those that exhibit tidal features indicative of arecent merger. numerical simulations indicate that, given the depth of ourimages, only tidal features due to major mergers will be detectable at theseepochs (features from minor mergers being too faint), making the disturbed sgsa useful route for estimating major-merger-driven size growth. the disturbedsgs are offset in size from their relaxed counterparts, lying close to theupper envelope of the local size -- mass relation. the mean size ratio of thedisturbed sgs to their relaxed counterparts is ~2. combining this observed sizegrowth with empirical major-merger histories from the literature suggests thatthe size evolution of a significant fraction (around two-thirds) of sgs in thismass range could be driven by major mergers. if, as is likely, our galaxies areprogenitors of more massive m &gt; 10^10.7 msun sgs at z&lt;1, then major mergers arealso likely to play an important role in the size growth of at least somemassive sgs in this mass range.

0705.2171	discovery of a ringlike dark matter structure in the core of the galaxy  cluster cl 0024+17	we present a comprehensive mass reconstruction of the rich galaxy cluster cl0024+17 at z~0.4 from acs data, unifying both strong- and weak-lensingconstraints. the weak-lensing signal from a dense distribution of backgroundgalaxies (~120 per square arcmin) across the cluster enables the derivation ofa high-resolution parameter-free mass map. the strongly-lensed objects tightlyconstrain the mass structure of the cluster inner region on an absolute scale,breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy. the mass reconstruction of cl 0024+17obtained in such a way is remarkable. it reveals a ringlike dark mattersubstructure at r~75" surrounding a soft, dense core at r~50". we interpretthis peculiar sub-structure as the result of a high-speed line-of-sightcollision of two massive clusters 1-2 gyr ago. such an event is also indicatedby the cluster velocity distribution. our numerical simulation with purelycollisionless particles demonstrates that such density ripples can arise byradially expanding, decelerating particles that originally comprised thepre-collision cores. cl 0024+17 can be likened to the bullet cluster 1e0657-56,but viewed $along$ the collision axis at a much later epoch. in addition, weshow that the long-standing mass discrepancy for cl 0024+17 between x-ray andlensing can be resolved by treating the cluster x-ray emission as coming from asuperposition of two x-ray systems. the cluster's unusual x-ray surfacebrightness profile that requires a two isothermal sphere description supportsthis hypothesis.

1510.06725	thermal conductivity of iii-v semiconductor superlattices	this paper presents a semiclassical model for the anisotropic thermaltransport in iii-v semiconductor superlattices (sls). an effective interfacerms roughness is the only adjustable parameter. thermal transport inside alayer is described by the boltzmann transport equation in the relaxation timeapproximation and is affected by the relevant scattering mechanisms(three-phonon, mass-difference, and dopant and electron scattering of phonons),as well as by diffuse scattering from the interfaces captured via an effectiveinterface scattering rate. the in-plane thermal conductivity is obtained fromthe layer conductivities connected in parallel. the cross-plane thermalconductivity is calculated from the layer thermal conductivities in series withone another and with thermal boundary resistances (tbrs) associated with eachinterface; the tbrs dominate cross-plane transport. the tbr of each interfaceis calculated from the transmission coefficient obtained by interpolatingbetween the acoustic mismatch model (amm) and the diffuse mismatch model (dmm),where the weight of the amm transmission coefficient is the samewavelength-dependent specularity parameter related to the effective interfacerms roughness that is commonly used to describe diffuse interface scattering.the model is applied to multiple iii-arsenide superlattices, and the resultsare in very good agreement with experimental findings. the method is bothsimple and accurate, easy to implement, and applicable to complicated slsystems, such as the active regions of quantum cascade lasers. it is also validfor other sl material systems with high-quality interfaces and predominantlyincoherent phonon transport.

(1990) andthe m_i versus (v-i) calibration of tonry et al. (2000), a value of m_k =-6.18+/-0.09 mag was derived. relative to the average empirical m_k derived forgiant ellipticals by jensen et al. (1998) (m_k=-5.61 +/- 0.12 mag), thedetection of an anomalous k-band sbf in ngc 4489 is confirmed at the two sigmalevel. such anomalous fluctuations could be caused by an extended giant branch,consisting of either intermediate-age agb stars above the tip of thefirst-ascent giant branch or high-metallicity first-ascent giants, or by lackof a full understanding of the k-band sbf calibration. this result raisesquestions about the accuracy of k-band sbf distance measurements for ellipticalgalaxies with unknown stellar composition and underscores the need for m_kmeasurements over a larger range of color and luminosity.

astro-ph;0504344	firback iv: towards the nature of the 170microns source population	we present a detailed study of the brighter ($&gt; 4\sigma$ detections) sourcesin the 170$\mu$m firback northern n1 iso survey, with the help of complementarydata in the optical, radio, and mid-ir domain. for 82% of them, an opticalgalaxy counterpart is identified, either as the unique source of the iremission, or as part of a multiple identification. with less than 15% of agns,these sources are essentially local, moderate starbursters with a dominatingcold dust component. and represent a population of cold galaxies ratherneglected up to now. their colours do not match those of the far-ir cosmic irbackground (cib), to which they contribute less than 5%. the bulk of thesources contributing to the cib is thus to be searched for in more distantgalaxies, possibly counterparts of the fainter firback sources still understudy. these bright, local, galaxies however play an important role in theevolution of ir galaxies: they dominate the number counts at high 170 $\mu$mfluxes, and represent half of the contribution at 250 mjy. although notparticularly massive (typically m*), they form more stars than a typical spiralgalaxy and many are bulge dominated, that could represent the remnant of aformer merger. the fainter part of this population may represent the missinglink with the higher-z sources found in sub-mm observations.

astro-ph;0506273	properties of firback-elais 175 um sources in the elais n2 region	we report on a search for the optical counterparts of 175 um - selectedsources from the far-infrared background (firback) survey in the european largearea iso survey (elais) n2 field. applying a likelihood ratio technique tooptical catalogues from the isaac newton telescope - wide field survey(int--wfs), we found optical identifications for 33 out of 55 firback sourcesin this field. these were then reassessed in the light of associations with theelais final catalogue for the the n2 field, to yield a final set of 31associations. we have investigated the nature of this population through acomparison of their observed spectral energy distributions with predictionsfrom radiative transfer models which simulate the emission from both cirrus andstarburst components. we find the far-infrared sources to be 80 per cent starbursting galaxies with their starburst component at a high optical depth. theresulting seds were used to estimate far-infrared luminosities, star formationrates, dust temperatures and dust masses. the n2 firback population is found toconsist of four suspected ulirgs, a number of lirgs and a population of lowredshift quiescently star forming galaxies. we also discuss the implications ofthese results for current evolutionary models.

astro-ph;0509575	cluster evolution since z~1	we have used the advanced camera for surveys (acs) on the hst to obtainoptical imaging of a sample of 8 galaxy clusters in the redshift range 0.8 &lt; z&lt; 1.3. the acs data provides accurate photometry and the acs high angularresolution makes it possible to obtain crucial morphological information of thecluster galaxy populations. these data are supported by x-ray observations andby ground based imaging and multi-object spectroscopy. we will present resultsfrom this multi-wavelength study which is providing a comprehensive view of theevolution of structures in the universe since z~1. the structure of the icm,galaxy and dm components of the clusters are presented and compared. thespectrophotometric properties of cluster galaxies are investigated in thecontext of galaxy evolution and the formation epoch of massive early-typegalaxies in these clusters is estimated to be at z &gt; 2. we will also presentresults from our study of the evolution of the morphology-density relation inclusters since z~1 down to the present day universe. our cluster evolutionstudies are also being complemented by observations of protoclusters atredshift z&gt;~2.

astro-ph;0509650	imprints of environment on cluster and field late-type galaxies at z~1	we present a comparison of late-type galaxies (sa and later) in intermediateredshift clusters and the field using acs imaging of four cluster fields:cl0152-1357, cl1056-0337 (ms1054), cl1604+4304, and cl1604+4321. concentration,asymmetry, and clumpiness parameters are calculated for each galaxy in blue(f606w or f625w) and red (f775w or f814w) filters. galaxy half-light radii,disk scale lengths, color gradients, and overall color are compared. we findmarginally significant differences in the asymmetry distributions of spiral andirregular galaxies in the x-ray luminous and x-ray faint clusters. the massiveclusters contain fewer galaxies with large asymmetries. the physical sizes ofthe cluster and field populations are similar; no significant differences arefound in half-light radii or disk scale lengths. the most significantdifference is in rest-frame $u-b$ color. late-type cluster galaxies aresignificantly redder, $\sim 0.3$ magnitudes at rest-frame $u-b$, than theirfield counterparts. moreover, the intermediate-redshift cluster galaxies tendto have blue inward color gradients, in contrast to the field galaxies, butsimilar to late-type galaxies in low redshift clusters. these blue inward colorgradients are likely to be the result of enhanced nuclear star formation ratesrelative to the outer disk. based on the significant rest-frame colordifference, we conclude that late-type cluster members at $z\sim0.9$ are not apristine infalling field population; some difference in past and/or currentstar formation history is already present. this points to high redshift``groups'', or filaments with densities similar to present-day groups, as thesites where the first major effects of environment are imprinted.

astro-ph;0601223	lyman break galaxies, lya emitters and a radio galaxy in a protocluster  at z=4.1	we present deep hst/acs observations in g,r,i,z towards the z=4.1 radiogalaxy tn j1338-1942 and its overdensity of &gt;30 spectroscopically confirmed lyaemitters (laes). we select 66 g-band dropouts to z=27, 6 of which are also alae. although our color-color selection results in a relatively broad redshiftrange centered on z=4.1, the field of tn j1338-1942 is richer than the averagefield at the &gt;5 sigma significance, based on a comparison with goods. theangular distribution is filamentary with about half of the objects clusterednear the radio galaxy, and a small, excess signal (2 sigma) in the projectedpair counts at separations of &lt;10" is interpreted as being due to physicalpairs. the laes are young (a few x 10^7 yr), small (&lt;r_50&gt; = 0.13") galaxies,and we derive a mean stellar mass of ~10^8-9 msun based on a stacked k-bandimage. we determine star formation rates, sizes, morphologies, andcolor-magnitude relations of the g-dropouts and find no evidence for adifference between galaxies near tn j1338-1942 and in the field. we concludethat environmental trends as observed in clusters at much lower redshift areeither not yet present, or are washed out by the relatively broad selection inredshift. the large galaxy overdensity, its corresponding mass overdensity andthe sub-clustering at the approximate redshift of tn j1338-1942 suggest theassemblage of a &gt;10^14 msun structure, confirming that it is possible to findand study cluster progenitors in the linear regime at z&gt;4.

astro-ph;0601327	evolution of the color-magnitude relation in high-redshift clusters:  blue early-type galaxies and red pairs in rdcs j0910+5422	the color-magnitude relation has been determined for the rdcs j0910+5422cluster of galaxies at redshift z = 1.106. cluster members were selected fromhst acs images, combined with ground--based near--ir imaging and opticalspectroscopy. the observed early--type color--magnitude relation (cmr) in(i_775 -z_850) versus z_850 shows intrinsic scatters in color of 0.042 +/-0.010 mag and 0.044 +/- 0.020 mag for ellipticals and s0s, respectively. fromthe scatter about the cmr, a mean luminosity--weighted age t &gt; 3.3 gyr (z &gt; 3)is derived for the elliptical galaxies.  strikingly, the s0 galaxies in rdcs j0910+5422 are systematically bluer in(i_775 - z_850) by 0.07 +/- 0.02 mag, with respect to the ellipticals. theellipticity distribution as a function of color indicates that the face-on s0sin this particular cluster have likely been classified as elliptical. thus, ifanything, the offset in color between the elliptical and s0 populations may beeven more significant.  the color offset between s0 and e corresponds to an age difference of ~1 gyr,for a single-burst solar metallicity model. a solar metallicity model with anexponential decay in star formation will reproduce the offset for an age of 3.5gyr, i.e. the s0s have evolved gradually from star forming progenitors.  the early--type population in this cluster appears to be still forming. theblue early-type disk galaxies in rdcs j0910+5422 likely represent the directprogenitors of the more evolved s0s that follow the same red sequence asellipticals in other clusters.  thirteen red galaxy pairs are observed and the galaxies associated in pairsconstitute ~40% of the cmr galaxies in this cluster.

astro-ph;0602292	hst/acs multiband coronagraphic imaging of the debris disk around beta  pictoris	(abridged.) we present f435w (b), f606w (broad v), and f814w (broad i)coronagraphic images of the debris disk around beta pictoris obtained withhst's advanced camera for surveys. we confirm that the previously reported warpin the inner disk is a distinct secondary disk inclined by ~5 deg from the maindisk. the main disk's northeast extension is linear from 80 to 250 au, but thesouthwest extension is distinctly bowed with an amplitude of ~1 au over thesame region. both extensions of the secondary disk appear linear, but notcollinear, from 80 to 150 au. within ~120 au of the star, the main disk is ~50%thinner than previously reported. the surface-brightness profiles along thespine of the main disk are fitted with four distinct radial power laws between40 and 250 au, while those of the secondary disk between 80 and 150 au arefitted with single power laws. these discrepancies suggest that the two diskshave different grain compositions or size distributions. the f606w/f435w andf814w/f435w flux ratios of the composite disk are nonuniform and asymmetricabout both projected axes of the disk. within ~120 au, the m_f435w-m_f606w andm_f435w-m_f814w colors along the spine of the main disk are ~10% and ~20%redder, respectively, than those of beta pic. these colors increasingly reddenbeyond ~120 au, becoming 25% and 40% redder, respectively, than the star at 250au. we compare the observed red colors within ~120 au with the simulated colorsof non-icy grains having a radial number density ~r^-3 and differentcompositions, porosities, and minimum grain sizes. the observed colors areconsistent with those of compact or moderately porous grains of astronomicalsilicate and/or graphite with sizes &gt;0.15-0.20 um, but the colors areinconsistent with the blue colors expected from grains with porosities &gt;90%.

astro-ph;0603058	clusters at half hubble time: galaxy structure and colors in  rxj0152.7-1357 and ms1054-03	we study the photometric and structural properties of spectroscopicallyconfirmed members in the two massive x-ray--selected z=0.83 galaxy clustersms1054-03 and rxj0152-1357 using three-band mosaic imaging with the hubblespace telescope advanced camera for surveys. the samples include 105 and 140members of ms1054-03 and rxj0152-1357, respectively, with acs f775w magnitude &lt;24.0. we develop a promising new structural classification method, based on acombination of the best-fit sersic indices and the normalized root-mean-squareresiduals from the fits; the resulting classes agree well with the visual ones,but are less affected by galaxy orientation. we examine the color--magnituderelations in detail and find that the color residuals correlate with the localmass density measured from our weak lensing maps; we identify a thresholddensity of $\sigma \approx 0.1$, in units of the critical density, above whichthe star formation appears to cease. for rxj0152-1357, we also find a trend inthe color residuals with velocity, resulting from an offset of about 980 km/sin the mean redshifts of the early- and late-type galaxies. analysis of thecolor--color diagrams indicates that a range of star formation time-scales areneeded to reproduce the loci of the galaxy colors. we also identify somecluster galaxies whose colors can only be explained by large amounts, $a_v\approx 1$ mag, of internal dust extinction.

astro-ph;0604390	the formation epoch of early-type galaxies in the z ~ 0.9 cl1604  supercluster	we analyse the cluster color-magnitude relation (cmr) for early-type galaxiesin two of the richer clusters in the z ~ 0.9 supercluster system to deriveaverage ages and formation redshifts for the early-type galaxy population. bothclusters were observed with the advanced camera for surveys aboard the {\ithubble space telescope} through the f606w and f814w filters, which brackets therest-frame 4000 \aa break at the cluster redshifts of z\sim 0.9. we fit thezeropoint and slope of the red cluster sequence, and model the scatter aboutthis relation to estimate average galaxy ages and formation redshifts. we findintrinsic scatters of 0.038-0.053 mag in ($v_{606}-i_{814}$) for the e and e+s0populations, corresponding to average ages of 3.5-3.7 gyr and formationredshifts z_{f}=2.4-2.6. we find at least one significant difference betweenthe cl1604+4304 and cl1604+4321 early-type cmrs. cl1604+4321, the less x-rayluminous and massive of the two, lacks bright l^* ellipticals. we combine thegalaxy samples to fit a composite cmr down to 0.15l^*, and find that the slopeof the combined cluster cmr is significantly steeper than for rx j0152.7-1357but consistent with ms 1054-03, both at similar redshift. the slope of thecl1604 cmr at the bright end (l &gt; 0.5l^*) is flatter and consistent with thecmr slopes found for other high redshift clusters. we find evidence forincreasing scatter with increasing magnitude along the early-type cmr,consistent with a 'downsizing' scenario, indicating younger mean ages withdecreasing galaxy mass.

astro-ph;0703153	vlt and acs observations of rdcs j1252.9-2927: dynamical structure and  galaxy populations in a massive cluster at z=1.237	we present results from an extensive spectroscopic survey, carried out withvlt fors, and from an extensive multiwavelength imaging data set from the hstadvanced camera for surveys and ground based facilities, of the cluster ofgalaxies rdcs j1252.9-2927. we have spectroscopically confirmed 38 clustermembers in the redshift range 1.22 &lt; z &lt; 1.25. a cluster median redshift ofz=1.237 and a rest-frame velocity dispersion of 747^{+74}_{-84} km/s areobtained. using the 38 confirmed redshifts, we were able to resolve, for thefirst time at z &gt; 1, kinematic structure. the velocity distribution, which isnot gaussian at the 95% confidence level, is consistent with two groups thatare also responsible for the projected east-west elongation of the cluster. thegroups are composed of 26 and 12 galaxies with velocity dispersions of486^{+47}_{-85} km/s and 426^{+57}_{-105} km/s, respectively. the elongation isalso seen in the intracluster gas and the dark matter distribution. this leadsus to conclude that rdcs j1252.9-2927 has not yet reached a final virial state.we extend the analysis of the color-magnitude diagram of spectroscopic membersto more than 1 mpc from the cluster center. the scatter and slope ofnon-[oii]-emitting cluster members in the near-ir red sequence is similar tothat seen in clusters at lower redshift. furthermore, most of the galaxies withluminosities greater than ~ k_s*+1.5 do not show any [oii], indicating thatthese more luminous, redder galaxies have stopped forming stars earlier thanthe fainter, bluer galaxies. our observations provide detailed dynamical andspectrophotometric information on galaxies in this exceptional high-redshiftcluster, delivering an in-depth view of structure formation at this epoch only5 gyr after the big bang.

0811.1986	the ellipticities of cluster early-type galaxies from z~1 to z~0: no  evolution in the overall distribution of bulge-to-disk ratios	we have compiled a sample of early-type cluster galaxies from 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.3 andmeasured the evolution of their ellipticity distributions. our sample contains487 galaxies in 17 z&gt;0.3 clusters with high quality space-based imaging and acomparable sample of 210 galaxies in 10 clusters at z&lt;0.05. we selectearly-type galaxies (elliptical and s0 galaxies) that fall within the clusterr_{200}, and which lie on the red-sequence in the magnitude range -19.3 &gt; m_b &gt;-21, after correcting for luminosity evolution. our ellipticity measurementsare made in a consistent manner over our whole sample. we perform extensivesimulations to quantify the systematic and statistical errors, and find that itis crucial to use psf-corrected model fits. we find that neither the medianellipticity, nor the shape of the ellipticity distribution of clusterearly-type galaxies evolves with redshift from z ~ 0 to z &gt; 1. these resultsare strongly suggestive of an unchanging overall bulge-to-disk ratiodistribution for cluster early-type galaxies over the last ~8gyr. this resultcontrasts with that from visual classifications which show that the fraction ofmorphologically-selected disk-dominated early-type galaxies, or s0s, issignificantly lower at z&gt;0.4 than at z~0. taking the ellipticity measurementsand assuming, as in all previous studies, that the intrinsic ellipticitydistribution of both elliptical and s0 galaxies remains constant, then weconclude from the lack of evolution in the observed early-type ellipticitydistribution that the relative fractions of ellipticals and s0s do not evolvefrom z~1 to z=0 for a red-sequence selected samples of galaxies in the cores ofclusters of galaxies.
