0905.2417	on the generation of high energy photons detected by the fermi satellite  from gamma-ray bursts	observations of gamma-ray bursts by the fermi satellite, capable of detectingphotons in a very broad energy band: 8kev to &gt;300gev, have opened a new windowfor the study of these enigmatic explosions. it is widely assumed that photonsof energy larger than 100 mev are produced by the same source that generatedlower energy photons -- at least whenever the shape of the spectrum is a bandfunction. we report here a surprising discovery -- the fermi data for a brightburst, grb 080916c, unambiguously shows that the high energy photons (&gt;=100mev) were generated in the external shock via the synchrotron process, andthe lower energy photons had a distinctly different source. the magnetic fieldin the region where high energy photons were produced (and also the late timeafterglow emission region) is found to be consistent with shock compressedmagnetic field of the circum-stellar medium. this result sheds light on theimportant question of the origin of magnetic fields required for gamma-rayburst afterglows. the external shock model for high energy radiation makes afirm prediction that can be tested with existing and future observations.

0910.4989	collapsar accretion and the gamma-ray burst x-ray light curve	we present axisymmetric hydrodynamical simulations of the long-term accretionof a rotating grb progenitor star, a "collapsar," onto the central compactobject. the simulations were carried out with the adaptive mesh refinement codeflash in two spatial dimensions and with an explicit shear viscosity. theevolution of the central accretion rate exhibits phases reminiscent of the longgrb gamma-ray and x-ray light curve, which lends support to the proposal thatthe luminosity is modulated by the central accretion rate. after a few tens ofseconds, an accretion shock sweeps outward through the star. the formation andoutward expansion of the accretion shock is accompanied with a sudden and rapidpower-law decline in the central accretion rate mdot ~ t^{-2.8}, whichresembles the l_x ~ t^{-3} decline observed in the x-ray light curves. thecollapsed, shock-heated stellar envelope settles into a thick, low-massequatorial disk embedded within a massive, pressure-supported atmosphere. aftera few hundred seconds, the inflow of low-angular-momentum material in the axialfunnel reverses into an outflow from the surface of the thick disk. meanwhile,the rapid decline of the accretion rate slows down, or even settles a in steadystate with mdot ~ 5x10^{-5} msun/s, which resembles the "plateau" phase in thex-ray light curve. while the duration of the "prompt" phase depends on theresolution in our simulations, we provide an analytical model taking intoaccount neutrino losses that estimates the duration to be ~20 s. the modelsuggests that the steep decline in grb x-ray light curves is triggered by thecircularization of the infalling stellar envelope at radii where the virialtemperature is below ~10^{10} k, such that neutrino cooling shuts off and anoutward expansion of the accretion shock becomes imminent.

0910.5726	external forward shock origin of high energy emission for three grbs  detected by fermi	we analyze the &gt;100mev data for 3 grbs detected by fermi (grbs 080916c,090510, 090902b) and find that these photons were generated via synchrotronemission in the external forward shock. we arrive at this conclusion by fourdifferent methods as follows. (1) we check the light curve and spectralbehavior of the &gt;100mev data, and late time x-ray and optical data, and findthem consistent with the closure relations for the external forward shockradiation. (2) we calculate the expected external forward shock synchrotronflux at 100mev, and it matches the observed flux value. (3) we determine theexternal forward shock model parameters using the &gt;100mev data, and with thesewe calculate the expected x-ray and optical fluxes at late times (hours to daysafter the burst) and find these to be in good agreement with the observed data.(4) we calculate the external forward shock model parameters using only thelate time x-ray, optical and radio data and from these estimate the expectedflux at &gt;100 mev at the end of the sub-mev burst (and at subsequent times) andfind that to be entirely consistent with the high energy data obtained byfermi/lat. the ability of a simple external forward shock, to fit the entiredata from the end of the burst (1-50s) to about a week, covering more thaneight-decades in photon frequency provides compelling confirmation of theexternal forward shock synchrotron origin of the &gt;100mev radiation from thesefermi grbs. moreover, the parameters determined in points (3) and (4) show thatthe magnetic field required in these grbs is consistent with shock-compressedmagnetic field in the circum-stellar medium with pre-shocked values of a fewtens of micro-gauss.

0910.5727	the late jet in gamma-ray bursts and its interactions with a supernova  ejecta and a cocoon	late x-ray flares observed in x-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (grbs)suggest late central engine activities at a few minuets to hours after theburst. a few unambiguously confirmed cases of supernova associations withnearby long grbs imply that an accompanying supernova-like component might be acommon feature in all long grb events. these motivate us to study theinteractions of a late jet, responsible for a x-ray flare, with variouscomponents in a stellar explosion, responsible for a grb. these componentsinclude a supernova shell-like ejecta, and a cocoon that was produced when themain jet producing the grb itself was propagating through the progenitor star.we find that the interaction between the late jet and the supernova ejecta mayproduce a luminous (up to 10^49 erg s^-1) thermal x-ray transient lasting for ~10 s. the interaction between the late jet and the cocoon produces synchrotronself-absorbed non-thermal emission, with the observed peak x-ray flux densityfrom 0.001 micro jy to 1 mjy at 1 kev and a peak optical flux density from 0.01micro jy to 0.1 jy (for a redshift z= 2). the light curve due to the late jet -cocoon interaction has very small pulse-width-to-time ratio, \delta t / t\approx 0.01 - 0.5, where t is the pulse peak time since the burst trigger.identifying these features in current and future observations would open a newfrontier in the study of grb progenitor stars.

1002.0590	supernovae-induced accretion and star formation in the inner kiloparsec  of a gaseous disk	we consider the effects of supernovae (sne) on accretion and star formationin a massive gaseous disk in a large primeval galaxy. the gaseous disk weenvisage, roughly 1 kiloparsec (kpc) in size with &gt;~ 10^8 m_sun of gas, couldhave formed as a result of galaxy mergers where tidal interactions removedangular momentum from gas at larger radius and thereby concentrated it withinthe central ~ 1 kpc region. we find that sne lead to accretion in the disk at arate of roughly 0.1 - 1 m_sun per year and induce star formation at a rate of ~10 - 100 m_sun per year which contributes to the formation of a bulge; a partof the stellar velocity dispersion is due to the speed of sna shells from whichstars are formed and a part due to the repeated action of the stochasticgravitational field of the network of sna remnants on stars. the rate of sne inthe inner kpc is shown to be self- regulating, and it cycles through phases oflow and high activity. the supernova-assisted accretion transports gas fromabout one kpc to within a few pc of the center. if this accretion were tocontinue down to the central black hole (bh) then the resulting ratio of bhmass to the stellar mass in the bulge would be of order ~ 10^-2 - 10^-3, inline with the observed magorrian relation.

1003.5916	implications of electron acceleration for high-energy radiation from  gamma-ray bursts	in recent work we suggested that photons of energy &gt;100 mev detected fromgrbs by the fermi satellite are produced via synchrotron emission in theexternal forward shock with a weak magnetic field - consistent with shockcompressed upstream magnetic field of a few tens of micro-gauss. here weinvestigate whether electrons can be accelerated to energies such that theyradiate synchrotron photons with energy up to about 10 gev in this particularscenario. we do this using two methods: (i) we check if these electrons can beconfined to the shock front; and (ii) we calculate radiative losses while theyare being accelerated. we find that these electrons remain confined to theshock front, as long as the upstream magnetic field is &gt;~ 10 micro-gauss, anddon't suffer substantial radiative losses, the only condition required is thatthe external reverse shock emission be not too bright: peak flux less than 1 jyin order to produce photons of 100 mev, and less than ~100 mjy for producing1-gev photons. we also find that the acceleration time for electrons radiatingat 100 mev is a few seconds (in observer frame), and the acceleration time issomewhat longer for electrons radiating at a few gev. this could explain thelack of &gt;100 mev photons for the first few seconds after the trigger time forlong grbs reported by the fermi satellite, and also the slight lag betweenphotons of gev and 100 mev energies. we model the onset of the external forwardshock light curve in this scenario and find it consistent with the sharp riseobserved in the 100-mev light curve of grb080916c and similar bursts.

1007.0763	supernovae powered by collapsar accretion in gamma-ray burst sources	the association of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) with type icsupernovae presents a challenge to supernova explosion models. in the collapsarmodel for lgrbs, gamma rays are produced in an ultrarelativistic jet launchingfrom the magnetosphere of the black hole that forms in the aftermath of thecollapse of a rotating progenitor star. the jet is collimated along the star'srotation axis, but the concomitant luminous supernova should berelatively--though certainly not entirely--spherical, and should synthesize asubstantial mass of 56ni. our goal is to provide a qualitative assessment ofthe possibility that accretion of the progenitor envelope onto the black hole,which powers the lgrb, could also deposit sufficient energy and nickel mass inthe envelope to produce a luminous supernova. for this, the energy dissipatednear the black hole during accretion must be transported outward, where it candrive a supernova-like shockwave. here we suggest that the energy istransported by convection and develop an analytical toy model, relying onglobal mass and energy conservation, for the dynamics of stellar collapse. themodel suggests that a ~10,000 km/s shock can be driven into the envelope andthat ~10^51 erg explosions are possible. the efficiency with which theaccretion energy is being transferred to the envelope is governed by thecompetition of advection and convection at distances ~100-1,000 km from theblack hole and is sensitive to the values of the convective mixing length, themagnitude of the effective viscous stress, and the specific angular momentum ofthe infalling envelope. substantial masses of 56ni may be synthesized in theconvective accretion flow over the course of tens of seconds from the initialcircularization of the infalling envelope around the black hole. thesynthesized nickel is convectively mixed with a much larger mass of unburnedejecta.

1105.0003	constraints on cold magnetized shocks in gamma-ray bursts	we consider a model in which the ultra-relativistic jet in a gamma-ray burst(grb) is cold and magnetically accelerated. we assume that the energy flux inthe outflowing material is partially thermalized via internal shocks or areverse shock, and we estimate the maximum amount of radiation that could beproduced in such magnetized shocks. we compare this estimate with the availableobservational data on prompt gamma-ray emission in grbs. we find that, evenwith highly optimistic assumptions, the magnetized jet model is radiatively tooinefficient to be consistent with observations. one way out is to assume thatmuch of the magnetic energy in the post-shock, or even pre-shock, jet materialis converted to particle thermal energy by some unspecified process, and thenradiated. this can increase the radiative efficiency sufficiently to fitobservations. alternatively, jet acceleration may be driven by thermal pressurerather than magnetic fields. in this case, which corresponds to the traditionalfireball model, sufficient prompt grb emission could be produced either fromshocks at a large radius or from the jet photosphere closer to the center.

1107.1236	evidence for mild deviation from power-law distribution of electrons in  relativistic shocks: grb 090902b	many previous studies have determined that the long lasting emission atx-ray, optical and radio wavelengths from gamma-ray bursts (grbs), called theafterglow, is likely produced by the external forward shock model. in thismodel, the grb jet interacts with the circum-stellar medium and drives a shockthat heats the medium, which radiates via synchrotron emission. in this work,we carried out a detailed analysis of the late time afterglow data of grb090902b using a very careful accounting of the inverse compton losses. we findthat in the context of the external forward shock model, the only viable optionto explain the x-ray and optical data of grb 090920b is to have the electronenergy distribution deviate from a power-law shape and exhibit some slightcurvature immediately downstream of the shock front (we explored other modelsthat rely on a single power-law assumption, but they all fail to explain theobservations). we find the fraction of the energy of shocked plasma in magneticfield to be ~10^{-6} using late time afterglow data, which is consistent withthe value obtained using early gamma-ray data. studies like the present onemight be able to provide a link between grb afterglow modeling and numericalsimulations of particle acceleration in collisionless shocks. we also providedetailed calculations for the early (&lt; 10^3 s) high energy (&gt; 100 mev) emissionand confirm that it is consistent with origin in the external forward shock. weinvestigated the possibility that the ~10 kev excess observed in the spectrumduring the prompt phase also has its origin in the external shock and found theanswer to be negative.

1108.1415	simulations of accretion powered supernovae in the progenitors of gamma  ray bursts	observational evidence suggests a link between long duration gamma ray bursts(lgrbs) and type ic supernovae. here, we propose a potential mechanism for typeic supernovae in lgrb progenitors powered solely by accretion energy. wepresent spherically-symmetric hydrodynamic simulations of the long-termaccretion of a rotating gamma-ray burst progenitor star, a "collapsar," ontothe central compact object, which we take to be a black hole. the simulationswere carried out with the adaptive mesh refinement code flash in one spatialdimension and with rotation, an explicit shear viscosity, and convection in themixing length theory approximation. once the accretion flow becomesrotationally supported outside of the black hole, an accretion shock forms andtraverses the stellar envelope. energy is carried from the centralgeometrically thick accretion disk to the stellar envelope by convection.energy losses through neutrino emission and nuclear photodisintegration arecalculated but do not seem important following the rapid early drop of theaccretion rate following circularization. we find that the shock velocity,energy, and unbound mass are sensitive to convective efficiency, effectiveviscosity, and initial stellar angular momentum. our simulations show thatgiven the appropriate combinations of stellar and physical parameters,explosions with energies ~5x10^50 ergs, velocities 3000 km/s, and unboundmaterial masses &gt;6 solar masses are possible in a rapidly rotating 16 solarmass main sequence progenitor star. further work is needed to constrain thevalues of these parameters, to identify the likely outcomes in more plausibleand massive lrgb progenitors, and to explore nucleosynthetic implications.

1210.0647	model-dependent high-energy neutrino flux from gamma-ray bursts	the icecube collaboration recently reported a stringent upper limit on thehigh energy neutrino flux from grbs, which provides a meaningful constraint onthe standard internal shock model. recent broad band electromagneticobservations of grbs also challenge the internal shock paradigm for grbs, andsome competing models for gamma-ray prompt emission have been proposed. wedescribe a general scheme for calculating the grb neutrino flux, and comparethe predicted neutrino flux levels for different models. we point out that thecurrent neutrino flux upper limit starts to constrain the standard internalshock model. the dissipative photosphere models are also challenged if thecosmic ray luminosity from grbs is at least 10 times larger than the gamma-rayluminosity. if the neutrino flux upper limit continues to go down in the nextfew years, then it would suggest the following possibilities: 1. thephoton-to-proton luminosity ratio in grbs is anomalously high for shocks, whichmay be achieved in some dissipative photosphere models and magnetic dissipationmodels; or 2. the grb emission site is at a larger radius than the internalshock radius, as expected in some magnetic dissipation models such as theicmart model.

1210.7802	hadronic models for lat prompt emission observed in fermi gamma-ray  bursts	this paper examines the possibility that hadronic processes produce the &gt;100mev photons in the prompt phase of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) observed by thefermi-lat. we calculate analytically the radiation from protons and fromsecondary electron-positron pairs produced by high energy protons interactingwith gamma-rays inside of the grb jet. we consider both photo-pion andbethe-heitler pair production processes to create secondary electrons andpositrons that then radiate via inverse compton and synchrotron processes. wealso consider synchrotron radiation from the protons themselves. we calculatethe necessary energy in protons to produce typical fermi-lat fluxes of a fewmicrojy at 100 mev. for both of the photo-pion and bethe-heitler processes, wefind that the required energy in protons is larger than the observed gamma-rayenergy by a factor of a thousand or more. for proton synchrotron, the protonshave a minimum lorentz factor ~2x10^6. this is much larger than expected if theprotons are accelerated by relativistic collisionless shocks in grbs. we alsoprovide estimates of neutrino fluxes expected from photo-hadronic processes.although the flux from a single burst is below icecube detection limits, it maybe possible to rule out photo-hadronic models by adding up the contribution ofseveral bursts. therefore, photo-hadronic processes seem an unlikely candidatefor producing the fermi-lat radiation during the prompt phase of grbs.

1309.1762	radio synchrotron emission from the bow shock of g2	the radio flux from the synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated in theforward bow shock of g2 is expected to peak when the forward shock passespericenter, possibly 7 to 9 months before the center of mass of g2 reachespericenter ~3x10^15 cm from the galactic center (narayan et al. 2012; sadowskiet al. 2013a,b). in this letter, we calculate the radio emission from theforward and reverse shock if g2 is a momentum-supported bow shock of a faintstar with a high mass-loss rate as suggested by scoville &amp; burkert (2013);ballone et al. (2013). we show that the radio flux lies well below thequiescent radio flux of sgr a* and will be difficult to detect. by contrast, inthe cloud model of g2, the radio flux of the forward shock is predicted to bemuch larger than the quiescent radio flux and therefore should have alreadybeen detected (narayan et al. 2012; sadowski et al. 2013b). therefore, radiomeasurements can reveal the nature of g2 well before g2 completes its periapsispassage.

1309.3277	magnetic fields in relativistic collisionless shocks	we present a systematic study on magnetic fields in gamma-ray burst (grb)external forward shocks (fss). there are 60 (35) grbs in our x-ray (optical)sample, mostly from swift. we use two methods to study epsilon_b (fraction ofenergy in magnetic field in the fs). 1. for the x-ray sample, we use theconstraint that the observed flux at the end of the steep decline is $\ge$ thex-ray fs flux. 2. for the optical sample, we use the condition that theobserved flux arises from the fs (optical sample light curves decline as ~t^-1,as expected for the fs). making a reasonable assumption on e (jet isotropicequivalent kinetic energy), we converted these conditions into an upper limit(measurement) on epsilon_b n^{2/(p+1)} for our x-ray (optical) sample, where nis the circumburst density and p is the electron index. taking n=1 cm^-3, thedistribution of epsilon_b measurements (upper limits) for our optical (x-ray)sample has a range of ~10^-8 -10^-3 (~10^-6 -10^-3) and median of ~few x 10^-5(~few x 10^-5). to characterize how much amplification is needed, beyond shockcompression of a seed magnetic field ~10 mug, we expressed our results in termsof an amplification factor, af, which is very weakly dependent on n (af propton^0.21 ). the range of af measurements (upper limits) for our optical (x-ray)sample is ~ 1-1000 (~10-300) with a median of ~50 (~50). these results suggestthat some amplification, in addition to shock compression, is needed to explainthe afterglow observations.

0802.2704	a general scheme for modeling gamma-ray burst prompt emission	we describe a general method for modeling gamma-ray burst prompt emission. wefind that for the burst to be produced via the synchrotron process unphysicalconditions are required -- the distance of the source from the center of theexplosion ($r_\gamma$) must be larger than $\sim 10^{17}$cm and the sourcelorentz factor $\gta 10^3$; for such a high lorentz factor the decelerationradius ($r_d$) is less than $r_\gamma$ even if the number density of particlesin the surrounding medium is as small as $\sim 0.1$ cm$^{-3}$. the result,$r_\gamma &gt; r_d$, is in contradiction with the early x-ray and opticalafterglow data. the synchrotron-self-compton (ssc) process fares much better.there is a large solution space for a typical grb prompt emission to beproduced via the ssc process. the prompt optical emission accompanying theburst is found to be very bright ($\lta$ 14 mag; for $z\sim2$) in the sscmodel, which exceeds the observed flux (or upper limit) for most grbs.continuous acceleration of electrons can significantly reduce the optical fluxand bring it down to the observed limits.

1402.4856	a small, rapid optical-ir response gamma-ray burst space observatory  (the ngrg)	here we propose a new gamma-ray burst (grb) mission, the next generationrapid-response grb observatory (ngrg). as with swift, grbs are initiallylocated with a coded-mask x-ray camera. however, the ngrg has two new features:first, a beam-steering system to begin optical observations within ~ 1 s afterlocation; second, a near-ir (nir) camera viewing the same sky, for sensitivityto extinguished bursts. these features allow measurement of the rise phase ofgrb optical-nir emission. thus far, the rise time and transition between promptand afterglow in the optical and nir are rarely measured. rapid-responsemeasurements explore many science topics including optical emission mechanisms(synchrotron vs. ssc, photospheric emission) and jet characteristics (reversevs. forward shock emission, baryon-dominated vs. magnetic dominated). rapidoptical-nir response can measure dynamic evolution of extinction due tovaporization of dust, and separate star system and galaxy dust extinction. wediscuss these measurements, giving reliable detection rate estimates fromanalysis of swift data and scaled swift performance. the ngrg will exploreoptical/nir emission measured earlier than ever before, and potentiallyfainter, more extinguished grbs than ever before. in the current era, costs areimportant. our proposed modest ngrg can still produce new grb science, whileproviding rapid grb alerts for the entire community for post-swift grb science.we show that an x-ray instrument barely 1/5 the area of swift bat will yield asignificant fraction of swift's detection rate: more than 65 x-ray, and with a30 cm optical-ir telescope and modern cameras, more than 19 nir and 14 opticaldetections each year. in addition, active feedback control of the beam-steeringwould remove the need for arc sec stabilization of the spacecraft, for asubstantial cost saving.

1410.0679	the physics of gamma-ray bursts and relativistic jets	we provide a comprehensive review of major developments in our understandingof gamma-ray bursts, with particular focus on the discoveries made within thelast fifteen years when their true nature was uncovered. we describe theobservational properties of photons from the radio to multi-gev bands, both inthe prompt emission and the afterglow phases. mechanisms for the generation ofthese photons in grbs are discussed and confronted with observations to shedlight on the physical properties of these explosions, their progenitor starsand the surrounding medium. after presenting observational evidence that apowerful, collimated, jet moving at close to the speed of light is produced inthese explosions, we describe our current understanding regarding thegeneration, acceleration, and dissipation of the jet and compare theseproperties with jets associated with agns and pulsars. we discuss mountingobservational evidence that long duration grbs are produced when massive starsdie, and that at least some short duration bursts are associated with old,roughly solar mass, compact stars. the question of whether a black-hole or astrongly magnetized, rapidly rotating neutron star is produced in theseexplosions is also discussed. we provide a brief summary of what we havelearned about relativistic collisionless shocks and particle acceleration fromgrb afterglow studies, and discuss the current understanding of radiationmechanism during the prompt emission phase. we discuss theoretical predictionsof possible high-energy neutrino emission from grbs and the currentobservational constraints. finally, we discuss how these explosions may be usedto study cosmology, e.g. star formation, metal enrichment, reionizationhistory, as well as the formation of first stars and galaxies in the universe.

1410.8560	a novel paradigm for short gamma-ray bursts with extended x-ray emission	the merger of a binary of neutron stars provides natural explanations formany of the features of short gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs), such as the generationof a hot torus orbiting a rapidly rotating black hole, which can then build amagnetic jet and provide the energy reservoir to launch a relativistic outflow.yet, this scenario has problems explaining the recently discovered long-termand sustained x-ray emission associated with the afterglows of a subclass ofsgrbs. we propose a new model that explains how an x-ray afterglow can besustained by the product of the merger and how the x-ray emission is producedbefore the corresponding emission in the gamma-band, although it is observed tofollow it. overall, our paradigm combines in a novel manner a number ofwell-established features of the emission in sgrbs and results fromsimulations. because it involves the propagation of an ultra-relativisticoutflow and its interaction with a confining medium, the paradigm alsohighlights a unifying phenomenology between short and long grbs.

1501.07606	probing massive stars around gamma-ray burst progenitors	long gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are produced by ultra-relativistic jets launchedfrom core collapse of massive stars. most massive stars form in binaries and/orin star clusters, which means that there may be a significant external photonfield (epf) around the grb progenitor. we calculate the inverse-comptonscattering of epf by the hot electrons in the grb jet. three possible cases ofepfs are considered: the progenitor is (i) in a massive binary system, (ii)surrounded by a wolf-rayet-star wind, and (iii) in a dense star cluster.typical luminosities of 10^46 - 10^50 erg/s in the 1 - 100 gev band areexpected, depending on the stellar luminosity, binary separation (i), wind massloss rate (ii), stellar number density (iii), etc. we calculate the lightcurveand spectrum in each case, taking fully into account the equal-arrival timesurfaces and possible pair-production absorption with the prompt gamma-rays.observations can put constraints on the existence of such epfs (and hence onthe nature of grb progenitors) and on the radius where the jet internaldissipation process accelerates electrons.

1503.03193	how bad/good are the external forward shock afterglow models of  gamma-ray bursts?	the external forward shock (efs) models have been the standard paradigm tointerpret the broad-band afterglow data of gamma-ray bursts (grbs). oneprediction of the models is that some afterglow temporal breaks at differentenergy bands should be achromatic. observations in the swift era have revealedchromatic afterglow behaviors at least in some grbs, casting doubts on the efsorigin of grb afterglows. in this paper, we perform a systematic study toaddress the question: how bad/good are the external forward shock models? oursample includes 85 grbs well-monitored x-ray and optical lightcurves. based onhow well the data abide by the efs models, we categorize them as: gold sample:(grade i and ii) include 45/85 grbs. they show evidence of, or are consistentwith having, an achromatic break. the temporal/spectral behaviors in eachafterglow segment are consistent with the predictions (closure relations) ofthe efs models. silver sample: (grade iii and iv) include 37/85 grbs. they arealso consistent with having an achromatic break, even though one or moreafterglow segments do not comply with the closure relations. bad sample: (gradev), 3/85 shows direct evidence of chromatic behaviors, suggesting that the efsmodels are inconsistent with the data. these are included in the bad sample. wefurther perform statistical analyses of various observational properties($\alpha$, $\beta$, $t_b$ and model parameters (energy injection index q, p,$\theta_j$, $\eta_\gamma$, etc) of the grbs in the gold sample, and deriveconstraints on the magnetization parameter $\epsilon_b$ in the efs. overall, weconclude that the simplest efs models can account for the multi-wavelengthafterglow data of at least half of the grbs. when more advanced modeling (e.g.,long-lasting reverse shock, structured jets) is invoked, up to $&gt;90 \%$ of theafterglows may be interpreted within the framework of the esf models.

1512.00020	infrared emission from tidal disruption events --- probing the pc-scale  dust content around galactic nuclei	recent uv-optical surveys have been successful in finding tidal disruptionevents (tdes), in which a star is tidally disrupted by a supermassive blackhole (bh). these tdes release a huge amount of radiation energy ~ 10^51-52 erginto the circum-nuclear medium. if the medium is dusty, most of the radiationenergy will be absorbed by dust grains within ~ 1 pc from the bh andre-radiated in the infrared. we calculate the dust emission lightcurve from a1-d radiative transfer model, taking into account the time-dependent heating,cooling and sublimation of dust grains. we show that the dust emission peaks at3-10 microns and has typical luminosities ~ 10^42-43 erg/s (with sky coveringfactor of dusty clouds ranging from 0.1-1). this is detectable by currentgeneration of telescopes. in the near future, james webb space telescope willbe able to perform photometric and spectroscopic measurements, in whichsilicate or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) features may be found.  observations at rest-frame wavelength &gt; 2 microns have only been reportedfrom two tde candidates, sdss j0952+2143 and swift j1644+57. althoughconsistent with the dust emission from tdes, the mid-infrared fluxes of the twoevents may be from other sources. long-term monitoring is needed to draw a firmconclusion. we also point out two nearby tde candidates (assasn-14ae and -14li)where the dust emission may be currently detectable. the dust infrared emissioncan give a snapshot of the pc-scale dust content around weakly- or non-activegalactic nuclei, which is hard to probe otherwise.

1512.00463	monte carlo simulations of the photospheric process	we present a monte carlo (mc) code we wrote to simulate the photosphericprocess and to study the photospheric spectrum above the peak energy. oursimulations were performed with a photon to electron ratio $n_{\gamma}/n_{e} =10^{5}$, as determined by observations of the grb prompt emission. we searchedan exhaustive parameter space to determine if the photospheric process canmatch the observed high-energy spectrum of the prompt emission. if we do notconsider electron re-heating, we determined that the best conditions to producethe observed high-energy spectrum are low photon temperatures and high opticaldepths. however, for these simulations, the spectrum peaks at an energy below300 kev by a factor $\sim 10$. for the cases we consider with higher photontemperatures and lower optical depths, we demonstrate that additional energy inthe electrons is required to produce a power-law spectrum above thepeak-energy. by considering electron re-heating near the photosphere, thespectrum for these simulations have a peak-energy $\sim \mbox{300 kev}$ and apower-law spectrum extending to at least 10 mev with a spectral indexconsistent with the prompt emission observations. we also performed simulationsfor different values of $n_{\gamma}/n_{e}$ and determined that the simulationresults are very sensitive to $n_{\gamma}/n_{e}$. lastly, in addition tocomptonizing a blackbody spectrum, we also simulate the comptonization of a$f_{\nu} \propto \nu^{-1/2}$ fast cooled synchrotron spectrum. the spectrum forthese simulations peaks at $\sim 10^{4} \mbox{ kev}$, with a flat spectrum$f_{\nu} \propto \nu^{0}$ below the peak energy.

0806.3541	the dust scattering model can not explain the shallow x-ray decay in grb  afterglows	a dust scattering model was recently proposed to explain the shallow x-raydecay (plateau) observed prevalently in gamma-ray burst (grb) early afterglows.in this model the plateau is the scattered prompt x-ray emission by the dustlocated close (about 10 to a few hundred pc) to the grb site. in this paper wecarefully investigate the model and find that the scattered emission undergoesstrong spectral softening with time, due to the model's essential ingredientthat harder x-ray photons have smaller scattering angle thus arrive earlier,while softer photons suffer larger angle scattering and arrive later. the modelpredicts a significant change, i.e., $\delta \b \sim 2 - 3$, in the x-rayspectral index from the beginning of the plateau toward the end of the plateau,while the observed data shows close to zero softening during the plateau andthe plateau-to-normal transition phase. the scattering model predicts a bigdifference between the harder x-ray light curve and the softer x-ray lightcurve, i.e., the plateau in harder x-rays ends much earlier than in softerx-rays. this feature is not seen in the data. the large scattering opticaldepths of the dust required by the model imply strong extinction in optical,$a_v \gtrsim $ 10, which contradicts current findings of $a_v= 0.1 - 0.7$ fromoptical and x-ray afterglow observations. we conclude that the dust scatteringmodel can not explain the x-ray plateaus.

0807.0441	mass fall-back and accretion in the central engine of gamma-ray bursts	we calculate the rate of in-fall of stellar matter on an accretion diskduring the collapse of a rapidly rotating massive star, and estimate theluminosity of the relativistic jet that results from accretion on to thecentral black hole. we find that the jet luminosity remains high for about 100seconds, at a level comparable to the typical luminosity observed in gamma-raybursts (grbs). the luminosity then decreases rapidly with time for about 10^3seconds, roughly as ~ t^-3; the duration depends on the size and rotation speedof the stellar core. the rapid decrease of the jet power explains the steeplydeclining x-ray flux observed at the end of most long duration grbs. a x-rayplateau is also produced by continued fall-back of matter -- either from anextended stellar envelope or from material that failed to escape with thesupernova ejecta. in a few grbs, the x-ray light curve is observed to dropsuddenly at the end of the plateau phase, while in others the decline is ~ t^-1- t ^-2. these features arise naturally in the accretion model depending on theradius and mean specific angular momentum of the stellar envelope. theaccretion model thus provides a coherent explanation for the diverse andpuzzling features observed in the early x-ray light curves of grbs.

astro-ph;0003264	steepening of afterglow decay for jets interacting with stratified media	we calculate light-curves for gamma-ray burst afterglows when materialejected in the explosion is confined to a jet which propagates in a medium witha power-law density profile. the observed light-curve decay steepens by afactor of $\gamma^2$ when an observer sees the edge of the jet. in a uniformdensity medium the increase in the power-law index ($\beta$) of the light-curveas a result of this {\it edge effect} is $\sim0.7$ and is completed over onedecade in observer time. for a pre-ejected stellar wind ($\rho \propto r^{-2}$)$\beta$ increases by $\sim0.4$ over two decades in time due to the edge effectand the steepening of the light-curve due to the jet sideways expansion takesabout four decades in time. therefore, a break in the light-curve for a jet ina wind model is unlikely to be detected even for very narrow jets of openingangle of a few degrees or less, in which case the lateral expansion occurs atearly times when the afterglow is bright.  the light-curve for the afterglow of grb 990510, for which an increase in$\beta$ of approximately 1.35 was observed on a time scale of 3 days, cannot beexplained only by the sideways expansion and the edge effects in a jet in auniform ism -- the increase in $\beta$ is too large and too rapid. however, thepassage of the cooling or synchrotron peak frequencies through the observingband at about 0.1 -- 1 day together with jet edge effect explains the observeddata. the jet opening angle is found to be $\sim 5^o$ and the energy in theexplosion to be less than about $10^{50}$ erg.

astro-ph;0004240	tidal spin-up of stars in dense stellar cusps around massive black holes	we show that main-sequence stars in dense stellar cusps around massive blackholes are likely to rotate at a significant fraction of the centrifugal breakupvelocity due to spin-up by hyperbolic tidal encounters. we use realisticstellar structure models to calculate analytically the tidal spin-up in softencounters, and extrapolate these results to close and penetrating collisionsusing smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. we find that the spin-upfalls off only slowly with distance from the black hole because the increasedtidal coupling in slower collisions at larger distances compensates for thedecrease in the stellar density. we apply our results to the stars near themassive black hole in the galactic center. over their lifetime, ~1 msol mainsequence stars in the inner 0.3 pc of the galactic center are spun-up onaverage to ~10%--30% of the centrifugal breakup limit. such rotation is ~20--60times higher than is usual for such stars and may affect their subsequentevolution and their observed properties.

astro-ph;0006317	afterglow emission from naked gamma-ray bursts	we calculate the {\it afterglow} emission for gamma-ray bursts (grbs) goingoff in an extremely low density medium, referred to as {\it naked bursts}. ourresults also apply to the case where the external medium density falls offsharply at some distance from the burst. the observed afterglow flux in thiscase originates at high latitudes, i.e. where the angle between the fluidvelocity and the observer line of sight is greater than $\gamma^{-1}$. theobserved peak frequency of the spectrum for naked bursts decreases withobserver time as $t^{-1}$, and the flux at the peak of the spectrum falls offas $t^{-2}$. the 2--10 kev $x$-ray flux from a naked burst of average fluenceshould be observable by the swift satellite for time duration of about $10^3$longer than the burst variability timescale. the high latitude emissioncontributes to the early $x$-ray afterglow flux for any grb, not just nakedbursts, and can be separated from the shocked inter-stellar medium (ism)emission by their different spectral and temporal properties. measurements ofthe high latitude emission could be used to map the angular structure of grbproducing shells.

astro-ph;0012107	bepposax confirmation of beamed afterglow emission from grb990510	we compare the prompt x-ray (2-10 kev) emission of grb990510 measured by thebepposax wide field cameras (wfc) during the burst to the x-ray afterglowdetected by the bepposax narrow field instruments. a single power-law model forthe afterglow, f(t) ~ t^{-1.42}, is ruled out. provided the initial time of theafterglow is assumed to coincide with the last short pulse in the x-ray promptevent (i.e., 72 seconds after the grb trigger time), the x-ray emission from\~80 to 10^5 seconds after the grb trigger is well described by an externalshock expanding in a decelerating jet, in which synchrotron radiation takesplace. this model, represented by a double power-law of indices alpha_1 ~ 1 andalpha_2 ~ 2 before and after a jet collimation break time of ~0.5 days aftergrb, respectively, is consistent with the second and third upper limitsmeasured by the wfc, but not with the first. this may be related toinhomogeneities in the circumburst medium. our finding indicates that thetemporal behavior of the grb990510 x-ray afterglow is similar to that atoptical wavelengths, and thus strengthens the interpretation of themultiwavelength afterglow as synchrotron emission in a jet with decreasinglorentz factor. grb990510 is thus the only burst in which evidence of aspreading jet has been found in x-rays.

astro-ph;0103360	accretion models of gamma-ray bursts	many models of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) involve accretion onto a compactobject, usually a black hole, at a mass accretion rate of order a fraction of asolar mass per second. if the accretion disk is larger than a few tens orhundreds of schwarzschild radii, the accretion will proceed via aconvection-dominated accretion flow (cdaf) in which most of the matter escapesto infinity rather than falling onto the black hole. models involving themergers of black hole white dwarf binaries and black hole helium star binariesfall in this category. these models are unlikely to produce grbs since verylittle mass reaches the black hole. if the accretion disk is smaller, thenaccretion will proceed via neutrino cooling in a neutrino-dominated accretiondisk (ndaf) and most of the mass will reach the center. models involving themergers of double neutron star binaries and black hole neutron star binariesfall in this category and are capable of producing bright grbs. if theviscosity parameter $\alpha$ in the ndaf has a standard value $\sim0.1$, thesemergers can explain short grbs with durations under a second, but they areunlikely to produce long grbs with durations of tens or hundred of seconds. ifthe accretion disk is fed by fallback of material after a supernova explosion,as in the collapsar model, then the time scale of the burst is determined byfallback, not accretion. such a model can produce long grbs. fallback modelsagain require that the accretion should proceed via an ndaf rather than a cdafin order for a significant amount of mass to reach the black hole. thiscondition imposes an upper limit on the radius of injection of the gas.

astro-ph;0108132	observational prospects for afterglows of short duration gamma-ray  bursts	if the efficiency for producing $\gamma$-rays is the same in short duration($\siml 2$ s) gamma-ray bursts (grbs) as in long duration grbs, then theaverage kinetic energy of short grbs must be $\sim 20$ times less than that oflong grbs. assuming further that the relativistic shocks in short and longduration grbs have similar parameters, we show that the afterglows of shortgrbs will be on average 10--40 times dimmer than those of long grbs. we findthat the afterglow of a typical short grb will be below the detection limit($\siml 10 \microjy$) of searches at radio frequencies. the afterglow would bedifficult to observe also in the optical, where we predict $r \simg 23$ a fewhours after the burst. the radio and optical afterglow would be even fainter ifshort grbs occur in a low-density medium, as expected in ns-ns and ns-bh mergermodels. the best prospects for detecting short-grb afterglows are with early($\siml 1$ day) observations in x-rays.

astro-ph;0205488	x-ray lines from gamma-ray bursts	x-ray lines have been recently detected in the afterglows of a few gamma-raybursts. we derive constraints on the physical conditions in the line-emittinggas, using as an example the multiple k$_\alpha$ lines detected by reeves etal. (2002) in grb 011211. we argue that models previously discussed in theliterature require either a very extreme geometry or too much mass in theline-emitting region. we propose a new model in which gamma-rays and radiationfrom the early x-ray afterglow are back-scattered by an electron-positron pairscreen at a distance of about $10^{14}-10^{15}$ cm from the source andirradiate the expanding outer layers of the supernova ejecta, thereby producingx-ray lines. the model suffers from fewer problems compared to previous models.it also has the advantage of requiring only a single explosion to produce boththe grb and the supernova ejecta, in contrast to most other models for thelines which require the supernova to go off days or weeks prior to the grb. themodel, however, has difficulty explaining the $&gt;10^{48}$ ergs of energy emittedin the x-ray lines, which requires somewhat extreme choices of modelparameters. the difficulties associated with the various models are notparticular to grb 011211. they are likely to pose a problem for any grb withx-ray lines.

astro-ph;0301627	the jet angular profile and the afterglow light curves	we investigate how the angular structure of grb jets effects the afterglowlight curves at different viewing angles, $\theta_{v}$, from the jet symmetryaxis. a numerical hydrodynamical modeling for the evolution of a relativisticcollimated outflow, as it interacts with the surrounding medium, is carriedout, and compared to two simple models that make opposite and extremeassumptions for the degree of lateral energy transfer. the lorentz factor,$\gamma$, and kinetic energy per unit solid angle, $\epsilon$, are initiallytaken to be power laws of the angle $\theta$ from the jet axis. we find thatthe lateral velocity in the comoving frame, $v'_\theta$, is typically muchsmaller than the sound speed, $c_s$, as long as $\gamma\gg 1$, and the dynamicsof relativistic structured jets may be reasonably described by a simpleanalytic model where $\epsilon$ is independent of time, as long as$\gamma(\theta=0)\ga$ a few. we perform a qualitative comparison between theresulting light curves and afterglow observations. this constrains the jetstructure, and poses problems for a `universal' jet model, where all grb jetsare assumed to be intrinsically identical, and differ only by our viewingangle, $\theta_{v}$.

astro-ph;0303174	the evolution of a structured relativistic jet and grb afterglow  light-curves	we carry out a numerical hydrodynamical modeling for the evolution of arelativistic collimated outflow, as it interacts with the surrounding medium,and calculate the light-curve resulting from synchrotron emission of theshocked fluid. the hydrodynamic equations are reduced to 1-d by assuming axialsymmetry and integrating over the radial profile of the flow, thus considerablyreducing the computation time. we present results for a number of differentinitial jet structures, including several different power-laws and a gaussianprofile for the dependence of the energy per unit solid angle, $\epsilon$, andthe lorentz factor, $\gamma$, on the angle from the jet symmetry axis. ourchoice of parameters for the various calculations is motivated by the currentknowledge of relativistic outflows from gamma-ray bursts and the observedafterglow light-curves. comparison of the light curves for different jetprofiles with grb afterglow observations provides constraints on the jetstructure. one of the main results we find is that the transverse fluidvelocity in the comoving frame ($v_t$) and the speed of sideways expansion, forsmooth jet profiles, is typically much smaller than the speed of sound ($c_s$)throughout much of the evolution of the jet; $v_t$ approaches $c_s$ when$\gamma$ along the jet axis becomes of order a few (for large angular gradientof $\epsilon$, $v_t\sim c_s$ while $\gamma$ is still large). this resultsuggests that the dynamics of relativistic structured jets may be reasonablydescribed by a simple analytic model where $\epsilon$ is independent of time,as long as $\gamma$ along the jet-axis is larger than a few.

astro-ph;0305446	a unified treatment of the gamma-ray burst 021211 and its afterglow  emissions	the gamma-ray burst (grb) 021211 detected by the high energy transientexplorer (hete) ii had a simple light-curve in the x-ray and gamma-ray energybands containing one peak and little temporal fluctuation other than theexpected poisson variation. such a burst offers the best chance for a unifiedunderstanding of the gamma-ray burst and afterglow emissions. we provide adetailed modeling of the observed radiation from grb 021211 both during theburst and the afterglow phase. the consistency between early optical emission(prior to 11 minutes), which presumably comes from reverse shock heating of theejecta, and late afterglow emission from forward shock (later than 11 minutes)requires the energy density in the magnetic field in the ejecta, expressed asfraction of the equipartition value or $\epsilon_b$, to be larger than theforward shock at 11 minutes by a factor of about 10$^3$. we find that the onlyconsistent model for the gamma-ray emission in grb 021211 is the synchrotronradiation in the forward shock; to explain the peak flux during the grbrequires $\epsilon_b$ in forward shock at deceleration to be larger than thevalue at 11 minutes by a factor of about 10$^2$.  these results suggest that the magnetic field in the reverse shock and earlyforward shock is most likely frozen-in-field from the explosion, and thereforea large fraction of the energy in the explosion was initially stored inmagnetic field. we can rule out the possibility that the ejecta from the burstfor grb 021211 contained more than 10 electron-positron pairs per proton.

astro-ph;9401004	causality in strong shear flows	it is well known that the standard transport equations violate causality whengradients are large or when temporal variations are rapid. we derive a modifiedset of transport equations that satisfy causality. these equations are obtainedfrom the underlying boltzmann equation. we use a simple model for particlecollisions which enables us to derive moment equations non-perturbatively, i.e.without making the usual assumption that the distribution function deviatesonly slightly from its equilibrium value. we apply the model to two problems:particle diffusion and viscous transport. in both cases we show that signalspropagate at a finite speed and therefore that the formalism obeys causality.when the velocity gradient is large on the scale of a mean free path, theviscous shear stress is suppressed relative to the prediction of the standarddiffusion approximation. the shear stress reaches a maximum at a finite valueof the shear amplitude and then decreases as the velocity gradient increases.in the case of a steady keplerian accretion disk with hydrodynamic turbulentviscosity, the stress-limit translates to an upper bound on the shakura-sunyaev$\alpha$-parameter, namely $\alpha&lt;0.07$. the limit on $\alpha$ is muchstronger in narrow boundary layers where the velocity shear is larger thankeplerian.

astro-ph;9503053	tidal excitation of modes in binary systems with applications to binary  pulsars	we consider the tidal excitation of modes in a binary system of arbitraryeccentricity. for a circular orbit, the modes generally undergo forcedoscillation with a period equal to the orbital period ($t$). for an eccentricorbit, the amplitude of each tidally excited mode can be written approximatelyas the sum of an oscillatory term that varies sinusoidally with the modefrequency and a `static' term that follows the time dependence of the tidalforcing function. the oscillatory term falls off exponentially with increasing$\b$ (defined as the ratio of the periastron passage time to the mode period),whereas the `static' term is independent of $\b$. for small $\b$ modes ($\b\approx 1$), the two terms are comparable, and the magnitude of the modeamplitude is nearly constant over the orbit. for large $\b$ modes ($\b \gta$ afew), the oscillatory term is very small compared to the `static' term, inwhich case the mode amplitude, like the tidal force, varies as the distancecubed. for main sequence stars, $p$, $f$, and low order $g$-modes generallyhave large $\b$ and hence small amplitudes of oscillation. high overtone$g$-modes, however, have small overlap with the tidal forcing function. thus,we expect an intermediate overtone $g$-mode with $\b \sim 1$ to have thelargest oscillation amplitude. the dependence on mode damping and the stellarrotation rate is considered, as well as the effects of orbital evolution. weapply our work to the two binary pulsar system: psr j0045-7319 and psrb1259-63.

astro-ph;9509112	nonlinear damping of oscillations in tidal-capture binaries	we calculate the damping of quadrupole f and low order g modes (primarymodes) by nonlinear coupling to other modes of the star. this damping is ordersof magnitude more rapid than direct radiative damping when the primaryamplitude is large, as in tidal capture.  primary modes destabilize high degree g-modes of half their frequency(daughter modes) by 3-mode coupling in radiative zones. in sunlike stars, thegrowth time $\equiv\eta^{-1}\approx 4 e_{0,42}^{-1/2}$ days, where $e_{0,42}$is the initial energy of the primary mode in units of $10^{42}~$erg, and oforder $10^{10}e_{0,42}^{5/4}$ daughters are unstable. the growth rate isapproximately equal to the angular frequency of the primary mode times itsdimensionless radial amplitude, $\delta r/r_*\approx 0.002e_{0,42}^{1/2}$.although the daughter modes are limited by their own nonlinearities,collectively they absorb most of the primary mode's energy after a time $\sim10\eta^{-1}$ provided $e_{0}&gt; 10^{40}~\mbox{erg}$. in fact nonlinear modeinteraction may be the dominant damping process if $e_0\gtrsim10^{37}~\mbox{erg}$.  our results have application to tidally captured main sequence globularcluster stars of mass $\ge 0.5 m_{\sun}$; the tidal energy is dissipated in theradiative core of the star in about a month, which is less than the initialorbital period.

astro-ph;9509152	on the validity of the classical apsidal motion formula for tidal  distortion	we check the validity of the widely used classical apsidal motion formula asa function of orbital parameters, stellar structure, and stellar rotation rateby comparing dynamical calculations of the periastron advance with the statictidal formula. we find that the classical formula gives very accurate resultswhen the periods of the low order quadrupole g, f and p modes are smaller thanthe periastron passage time by a factor of about 7 or more. however, when thiscondition is not satisfied, the difference between the classical formula andthe exact result can be quite large, and even periastron recession can result.the largest difference arises when one of the low order modes of the star isnearly resonant with an integer multiple of the orbital frequency minus twicethe rotation rate of the star. the resonance of higher order g-modes (number ofradial nodes $\gta 4$) with the orbit is very unlikely to cause significantdeviation from the classical result because of their weak coupling to the tidalforce and thus their small contribution to the apsidal motion. resonancesinvolving rotational modes of the star are also unlikely to make muchcontribution to the apsidal motion because of their small overlap with thetidal force, even though they have periods comparable to the periastron passagetime.  we apply our work to two famous binary systems (as cam and di her) which showabnormally small apsidal motion, and conclude that dynamical effects areunimportant for these systems, i.e. the static tide assumption is an excellentapproximation.

astro-ph;9610254	asymmetries of solar p-mode line profiles	recent observations indicate that solar p-mode line profiles are not exactlylorentzian, but rather exhibit varying amounts of asymmetry about theirrespective peaks. we analyze p-mode line asymmetry using both a simplifiedone-dimensional model and a more realistic solar model. we find that the amountof asymmetry exhibited by a given mode depends on the location of the sourcesexciting the mode, the mode frequency, and weakly on the mode sphericalharmonic degree, but not on the particular mechanism or location of thedamping. we calculate the dependence of line asymmetry on source location forsolar p-modes, and provide physical explanations of our results in terms of thesimplified model. a comparison of our results to the observations of lineasymmetry in velocity spectra reported by duvall et al. (1993) for modes offrequency $\sim$ 2.3 mhz suggests that the sources for these modes are locatedmore than 325 km beneath the photosphere. this source depth is greater thanthat found by kumar (1994) for acoustic waves of frequency $\sim$ 6 mhz. thedifference may indicate that waves of different frequencies are excited atdifferent depths in the convection zone. we find that line asymmetry causes thefrequency obtained from a lorentzian fit to a peak in the power spectrum todiffer from the corresponding eigenfrequency by an amount proportional to adimensionless asymmetry parameter and to the mode linewidth.

astro-ph;9611005	differential rotation enhanced dissipation of tides in the psr  j0045-7319 binary	recent observations of psr j0045-7319, a radio pulsar in a close eccentricorbit with a massive b-star companion, indicate that the system's orbitalperiod is decreasing on a timescale of $\approx 5 \times10^{5}$ years, which ismuch shorter than the timescale of $\approx$ 10^9 years given by the standardtheory of tidal dissipation in radiative stars. observations also providestrong evidence that the b-star is rotating rapidly, perhaps at nearly itsbreak up speed. we show that the dissipation of the dynamical tide in a starrotating in the same direction as the orbital motion of its companion (prograderotation) with a speed greater than the orbital angular speed of the star atperiastron results in an increase in the orbital period of the binary systemwith time. thus, since the observed time derivative of the orbital period islarge and negative, the b-star in the psr j0045-7319 binary must haveretrograde rotation if tidal effects are to account for the orbital decay. wealso show that the time scale for the synchronization of the b-star's spin withthe orbital angular speed of the star at periastron is comparable to theorbital evolution time. from the work of goldreich and nicholson (1989) wetherefore expect that the b-star should be rotating differentially, with theouter layers rotating more slowly than the interior. we show that thedissipation of the dynamical tide in such a differentially rotating b-star isenhanced by almost three orders of magnitude leading to an orbital evolutiontime for the psr j0045-7319 binary that is consistent with the observations.

astro-ph;9611124	hi observations of two molecular clouds with extremely large velocity  dispersions	we have mapped two molecular clouds at (l, b) = (3.2 degrees, + 0.3 degrees)and (l, b) = (5.4 degrees, -0.5 degrees) in 21-cm line and continuum emission.these clouds show unusually large velocity dispersions of more than 100 km/s(fwhm) which has also been seen in $^{12}$co, $^{13}$co, and cs emissions. thisdispersion is roughly an order of magnitude larger compared to giant molecularclouds. from our hi observation we estimate that the atomic mass of the cloudat l = 3.2 degrees is about $1.5\times 10^5 m_\odot$ and the mass of the cloudat l = 5.4 degrees is $7\times 10^4 m_\odot$. the ratio of total molecular massto atomic mass for these clouds appears to be normal for clouds near thegalactic center. the main peculiar feature of these clouds is their abnormallylarge velocity dispersion; the extent in velocity is from about 0 km/s (lsr) to200 km/s. these clouds are connected, in the l-v plane, to high velocity ridgesthat extend over several degrees of the longitude. these properties, webelieve, provide important clues to the physical process responsible for theirlarge velocity dispersion.

astro-ph;9612189	on the orbital decay of the psr j0045-7319 binary	recent observations of psr j0045-7319, a radio pulsar in a close eccentricorbit with a massive main sequence b-star companion, indicate that the system'sorbital period is decreasing on a timescale $\sim 5 x 10^{5}$ years (kaspi etal. 1996). timing observations of psr j0045-7319 also indicate that the b-staris rotating rapidly, perhaps close to its breakup rotation rate. for rapid(super-synchronous) prograde rotation of the b-star, tidal dissipation leads toan increasing orbital period for the binary system, while for retrograderotation of any magnitude, the orbital period decreases with time. we show thatif tidal effects are to account for the observed orbital decay of the psrj0045-7319 binary, the b-star must have retrograde rotation. this implies thatthe supernova that produced the pulsar in this binary system likely had adipole anisotropy.  for a reasonably wide range of retrograde rotation rates, the energy in thedynamical tide of the b-star needs to be dissipated in about one orbital periodin order to account for the observed orbital evolution time for the psrj0045-7319 binary. we show, however, that the radiative dissipation of thedynamical tide in a rigidly rotating b-star is too inefficient by a factor of$\approx$ 10$^3$, regardless of the magnitude of the rotation rate. we describehow, when the surface of the b-star is rotating nearly synchronously (which isexpected from the work of goldreich and nicholson, 1989), the energy in thedynamical tide is dissipated in less than an orbital period, thus reconcilingthe theoretical and observed rates of orbital evolution.

astro-ph;9706063	gas accretion in a clumpy disk with application to agns	we analyze the collective gravitational interaction among gas clouds in theinner regions of galactic disks and find that it leads to accretion at a rate$\sim m_{mc}\omega (m_{mc}/m_t)^2$; where $m_{mc}$ is the molecular mass of thedisk, $m_t$ is sum of the central plus any axisymmetrically distributed mass,and $\omega$ is the mean angular speed of clumps. we discuss applications ofthis result to the mega-maser galaxy ngc 4258, for which we have observationalevidence that the maser spots are concentrated in a thin molecular disk whichis clumpy, and find the accretion rate to be about $1.5\times 10^{-3}$ solarmass per year. if the gravitational energy release of this inward falling gaswere to be radiated away efficiently, then the resulting luminosity wouldgreatly exceed the observed central luminosity of ngc 4258, indicating thatmost of the thermal energy of the gas is advected with the flow into theblackhole as proposed by lasota et al. (1996).  the gravitational interactions among molecular clouds lying within the innerkpc of our galaxy give an accretion rate of about $10^{-5}$ solar mass peryear, which is consistent with the value obtained by narayan et al. (1995) byfitting the spectrum of sagitarrius a$^*$. we also discuss possible applicationof this work to quasar evolution.

astro-ph;9707309	dissipation of a tide in a differentially rotating star	the orbital period of the binary pulsar psr j0045-7319, which is located inour neighbouring galaxy the small magellanic cloud (smc), appears to bedecreasing on a timescale of half a million year. this timescale is more thantwo orders of magnitude smaller than what is expected from the standard theoryof tidal dissipation. kumar and quataert (1997a) proposed that this rapidevolution can be understood provided that the neutron star's companion, a mainsequence b-star, has set up significant differential rotation. they showed thatthe spin synchronization time for the b-star is similar to the orbitcircularization time, whereas the time to synchronize the surface rotation ismuch shorter, and thus significant differential rotation in the star is indeedexpected. however, their calculation did not include the various processes thatcan redistribute angular momentum in the star, possibly forcing it into solidbody rotation; in that case the dissipation of the tide would not be enhanced.the goal of this paper is to include the redistribution of angular momentum inthe b-star due to meridional circulation and shear stresses and to calculatethe resulting rotation profile as a function of time. we find that althoughangular momentum redistribution is important, the b-star continues to havesufficient differential rotation so that tidal waves are entirely absorbed asthey arrive at the surface. the mechanism proposed by kumar and quataert tospeed up the orbital evolution of the smc binary pulsar should therefore workas suggested.

astro-ph;9808144	line asymmetry of solar p-modes: reversal of asymmetry in intensity  power spectra	the sense of line asymmetry of solar p-modes in the intensity power spectrais observed to be opposite of that seen in the velocity power spectra.theoretical calculations provide a good understanding and fit to the observedvelocity power spectra whereas the reverse sense of asymmetry in the intensitypower spectrum has been poorly understood. we show that when turbulent eddiesarrive at the top of the convection zone they give rise to an observableintensity fluctuation which is correlated with the oscillation they generate,thereby affecting the shape of the line in the p-mode power spectra andreversing the sense of asymmetry (this point was recognized by nigam et al. androxburgh &amp; vorontsov). the addition of the correlated noise displaces thefrequencies of peaks in the power spectrum. depending on the amplitude of thenoise source the shift in the position of the peak can be substantially largerthan the frequency shift in the velocity power spectra. in neither case are thepeak frequencies precisely equal to the eigenfrequencies of p-modes. we suggesttwo observations which can provide a test of the model discussed here.

astro-ph;9902308	the structure of the central disk of ngc 1068: a clumpy disk model	ngc 1068 is one of the best studied seyfert ii galaxies, for which theblackhole mass has been determined from the doppler velocities of water maser.we show that the standard $\alpha$-disk model of ngc 1068 gives disk massbetween the radii of 0.65 pc and 1.1 pc (the region from which water maseremission is detected) to be about 7x10$^7$ m$_\odot$ (for $\alpha=0.1$), morethan four times the blackhole mass, and a toomre q-parameter for the disk is$\sim$0.001. this disk is therefore highly self-gravitating and is subject tolarge-amplitude density fluctuations. we conclude that the standard$\alpha$-viscosity description for the structure of the accretion disk isinvalid for ngc 1068.  in this paper we develop a new model for the accretion disk. the disk isconsidered to be composed of gravitationally bound clumps; accretion in thisclumped disk model arises because of gravitational interaction of clumps witheach other and the dynamical frictional drag exerted on clumps from the starsin the central region of the galaxy. the clumped disk model provides aself-consistent description of the observations of ngc 1068. the computedtemperature and density are within the allowed parameter range for water maseremission, and the rotational velocity in the disk falls off as $r^{-0.35}$.

astro-ph;9902309	angular momentum redistribution by waves in the sun	we calculate the angular momentum transport by gravito-inertial-alfv\'enwaves and show that, so long as prograde and retrograde gravity waves areexcited to roughly the same amplitude, the sign of angular momentum deposit inthe radiative interior of the sun is such as to lead to an exponential growthof any existing small radial gradient of rotation velocity just below theconvection zone. this leads to formation of a strong thin shear layer (ofthickness about 0.3% r_\odot) near the top of the radiative zone of the sun ona time-scale of order 20 years. when the magnitude of differential rotationacross this layer reaches about 0.1 \mu hz, the layer becomes unstable to shearinstability and undergoes mixing, and the excess angular momentum deposited inthe layer is returned to the convection zone. the strong shear in this layergenerates toroidal magnetic field which is also deposited in the convectionzone when the layer becomes unstable. this could possibly start a new magneticactivity cycle seen at the surface.

astro-ph;9906002	some observational consequences of grb shock models	in the internal shock scenario for grbs we expect some fraction of the energyof the burst to be carried by slow moving shells that were ejected at latetimes. these slow shells collide with faster moving outer shells when the outershells have slowed down as a result of sweeping up material from the ism. thisgives rise to a forward shock that moves into the outer shell producing a bumpin the afterglow light curve of amplitude roughly proportional to the ratio ofthe energy in the inner and the outer shells. in addition, a reverse shockpropagates in the inner shell and produces emission at a characteristicfrequency that is typically much smaller than the peak of the emission from theouter shell by a factor of $\sim 7 \gamma_{0c}^2 (e_2/e_1)^{1.1}$, and theobserved flux at this frequency from the reverse shock is larger compared tothe flux from the outer shell by a factor of $\sim 8 (\gamma_{0c}e_2/e_1)^{5/3} $; where $\gamma_{0c}$ is the bulk lorentz factor of the outershell at the time of collision, and $e_1 &amp; e_2$ are the total energy in theouter and the inner shells respectively. the lorentz factor is related to theobserver time as $\sim 5 (t/day)^{3/8}$. the shell collision could produceinitial temporal variability in the early afterglow signal. the lack ofsignificant deviation from a power-law decline of the optical afterglow fromhalf a dozen bursts suggests that $e_2/e_1$ is small. future multi-wavelengthobservations should be able to either detect bumps in the light curvecorresponding to both the forward and the reverse shocks or further constrainthe late time release of energy in ejecta with small lorentz factor, which isexpected generically in the internal shock models for the gamma-ray bursts.

astro-ph;9909014	energetics and luminosity function of gamma-ray bursts	gamma-ray bursts are believed to be some catastrophic event in which materialis ejected at a relativistic velocity, and internal collisions within thisejecta produce the observed $\gamma$-ray flash. the angular size of a causallyconnected region within a relativistic flow is of the order the angular widthof the relativistic beaming, $\gamma^{-1}$. thus, different observers alongdifferent lines of sights could see drastically different fluxes from the sameburst. specifically, we propose that the most energetic bursts correspond toexceptionally bright spots along the line of sight on colliding shells, and donot represent much larger energy release in the explosion. we calculate thedistribution function of the observed fluence for random angular-fluctuation ofejecta. we find that the width of the distribution function for the observedfluence is about two orders of magnitude if the number of shells ejected alongdifferent lines of sight is ten or less. the distribution function becomesnarrower if number of shells along typical lines of sight increases. theanalysis of the $\gamma$-ray fluence and afterglow emissions for grbs withknown redshifts provides support for our model i.e. the large width of grbluminosity function is not due to a large spread in the energy release butinstead is due to large angular fluctuations in ejected material. we outlineseveral observational tests of this model. in particular, we predict littlecorrelation between the $\gamma$-ray fluence and the afterglow emission as infact is observed. we predict that the early (minutes to hours) afterglow woulddepict large temporal fluctuations whose amplitude decreases with time. finallywe predict that there should be many weak bursts with about average afterglowluminosity in this scenario.

0812.0021	gamma-ray burst 080319b: evidence for relativistic turbulence, not  internal shocks	we show that the excellent optical and gamma-ray data available for grb080319b rule out the internal shock model for the prompt emission. the datainstead point to a model in which the observed radiation was produced close tothe deceleration radius ($\sim10^{17}$ cm) by a turbulent source with randomlorentz factors $\sim10$ in the comoving frame. the optical radiation wasproduced by synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons, and thegamma-rays by inverse compton scattering of the synchrotron photons. thegamma-ray emission originated both in eddies and in an inter-eddy medium,whereas the optical radiation was mostly from the latter. therefore, thegamma-ray emission was highly variable whereas the optical was much lessvariable. the model explains all the observed features in the prompt opticaland gamma-ray data of grb 080319b. we are unable to determine with confidencewhether the energy of the explosion was carried outward primarily by particles(kinetic energy) or magnetic fields. consequently, we cannot tell whether theturbulent medium was located in the reverse shock (we can rule out the forwardshock) or in a poynting-dominated jet.
