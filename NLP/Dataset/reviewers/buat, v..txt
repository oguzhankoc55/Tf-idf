0907.2819	the infrared emission of ultraviolet selected galaxies from z = 0 to z=1	we select galaxies in uv rest-frame at z=0, z~0.7 and z~1 together with asample of lbgs at z~1, the samples are built in order to sample the same rangeof luminosity at any redshift. the evolution of the ir and uv luminosities withz is analysed for individual galaxies as well as in terms of luminosityfunctions. the l_ir/l_uv ratio is used to measure dust attenuation. this ratiodoes not exhibit a strong evolution with z for the bulk of our sample galaxiesbut some trends are found for galaxies with a strong dust attenuation and foruv luminous sources: galaxies with l_ir/l_uv&gt;10 are more frequent at z&gt;0 thanat z=0 and the largest values of l_ir/l_uv are found for uv faint objects;conversely the most luminous galaxies of our samples (l_uv&gt; 2 10^{10} l_sun$),detected at z=1, exhibit a lower dust attenuation than the fainter ones.l_ir/l_uv increases with the k rest-frame luminosity of the galaxies at all theredshifts considered and shows a residual anti-correlation with l_uv. the mostmassive and uv luminous galaxies exhibit quite large specific star formationrates. lbgs exhibit systematically lower dust attenuation than uv selectedgalaxies of same luminosity but similar specific star formation rates. theanalysis of the uv+ir luminosity functions leads to the conclusion that up to z= 1 most of the star formation activity of uv selected galaxies is emitted inir. whereas we are able to retrieve all the star formation from our uvselection at z=0.7, at z = 1 we miss a large fraction of galaxies more luminousthan ~ 10^{11} l_sun. the effect is found larger for lyman break galaxies.

0909.2648	radial distribution of stars, gas and dust in sings galaxies. i. surface  photometry and morphology	we present ultraviolet through far-infrared surface brightness profiles forthe 75 galaxies in the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey (sings). theimagery used to measure the profiles includes galex uv data, optical imagesfrom kpno, ctio and sdss, near-ir data from 2mass, and mid- and far-infraredimages from spitzer. along with the radial profiles, we also providemulti-wavelength asymptotic magnitudes and several non-parametric indicators ofgalaxy morphology: the concentration index (c_42), the asymmetry (a), the ginicoefficient (g) and the normalized second-order moment of the brightest 20% ofthe galaxy's flux (m_20). our radial profiles show a wide range of morphologiesand multiple components (bulges, exponential disks, inner and outer disktruncations, etc.) that vary not only from galaxy to galaxy but also withwavelength for a given object. in the optical and near-ir, the sings galaxiesoccupy the same regions in the c_42-a-g-m_20 parameter space as other normalgalaxies in previous studies. however, they appear much less centrallyconcentrated, more asymmetric and with larger values of g when viewed in the uv(due to star-forming clumps scattered across the disk) and in the mid-ir (dueto the emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at 8.0 microns and very hotdust at 24 microns).

0909.2658	radial distribution of stars, gas and dust in sings galaxies. ii.  derived dust properties	we present a detailed analysis of the radial distribution of dust propertiesin the sings sample, performed on a set of uv, ir and hi surface brightnessprofiles, combined with published molecular gas profiles and metallicitygradients. the internal extinction, derived from the tir-to-fuv luminosityratio, decreases with radius, and is larger in sb-sbc galaxies. the tir-to-fuvratio correlates with the uv spectral slope beta, following a sequence shiftedto redder uv colors with respect to that of starbursts. the star formationhistory (sfh) is identified as the main driver of this departure. we have alsoderived radial profiles of the total dust mass surface density, the fraction ofthe dust mass contributed by pahs, the fraction of the dust mass heated by veryintense starlight and the intensity of the radiation field heating the grains.the dust profiles are exponential, their radial scale-length being constantfrom sb to sd galaxies (only ~10% larger than the stellar scale-length). manys0/a-sab galaxies have central depressions in their dust radial distributions.the pah abundance increases with metallicity for 12+\log(o/h)&lt;9, and at largermetallicities the trend flattens and even reverses, with the sfh being aplausible underlying driver for this behavior. the dust-to-gas ratio is alsowell correlated with metallicity and therefore decreases with galactocentricradius.

0909.5439	analysis of galaxy seds from far-uv to far-ir with cigale: studying a  sings test sample	photometric data of galaxies covering the rest-frame wavelength range fromfar-uv to far-ir make it possible to derive galaxy properties with a highreliability by fitting the attenuated stellar emission and the related dustemission at the same time. for this purpose we wrote the code cigale (codeinvestigating galaxy emission) that uses model spectra composed of the maraston(or pegase) stellar population models, synthetic attenuation functions based ona modified calzetti law, spectral line templates, the dale &amp; helou dustemission models, and optional spectral templates of obscured agn. depending onthe input redshifts, filter fluxes are computed for the model set and comparedto the galaxy photometry by carrying out a bayesian-like analysis. cigale wastested by analysing 39 nearby galaxies selected from sings. the reliability ofthe different model parameters was evaluated by studying the resultingexpectation values and their standard deviations in relation to the input modelgrid. moreover, the influence of the filter set and the quality of photometricdata on the code results was estimated. for up to 17 filters between 0.15 and160 mum, we find robust results for the mass, star formation rate, effectiveage of the stellar population at 4000 a, bolometric luminosity, luminosityabsorbed by dust, and attenuation in the far-uv. a study of the mutualrelations between the reliable properties confirms the dependence of starformation activity on morphology in the local universe and indicates asignificant drop in this activity at about 10^11 m_sol towards higher totalstellar masses. the dustiest sample galaxies are present in the same massrange.

0910.3521	high mass star formation in normal late-type galaxies: observational  constraints to the imf	we use halpha and fuv galex data for a large sample of nearby objects tostudy the high mass star formation activity of normal late-type galaxies. thedata are corrected for dust attenuation using the most accurate techniques atpresent available, namely the balmer decrement and the total far-infrared tofuv flux ratio. the sample shows a highly dispersed distribution in the halphato fuv flux ratio indicating that two of the most commonly used star formationtracers give star formation rates with uncertainties up to a factor of 2-3. thehigh dispersion is due to the presence of agn, where the uv and the halphaemission can be contaminated by nuclear activity, highly inclined galaxies, forwhich the applied extinction corrections are probably inaccurate, or starburstgalaxies, where the stationarity in the star formation history required fortransforming halpha and uv luminosities into star formation rates is notsatisfied. excluding these objects we reach an uncertainty of ~50% on the sfr.the halpha to fuv flux ratio increases with their total stellar mass. iflimited to normal star forming galaxies, however, this relationship reduces toa weak trend that might be totally removed using different extinctioncorrection recipes. in these objects the halpha to fuv flux ratio seems alsobarely related with the fuv-h colour, the h band effective surface brightness,the total star formation activity and the gas fraction. the data are consistentwith a kroupa and salpeter initial mass function in the high mass stellar rangeand imply, for a salpeter imf, that the variations of the slope cannot exceed0.25, from g=2.35 for massive galaxies to g=2.60 in low luminosity systems. weshow however that these observed trends, if real, can be due to the differentmicro history of star formation in massive galaxies with respect to dwarf.

0912.5051	star formation and dust extinction properties of local galaxies from  akari-galex all-sky surveys: first results from most secure multiband sample  from fuv to fir	the akari all-sky survey provided the first bright point source catalogdetected at 90um. starting from this catalog, we selected galaxies by matchingakari sources with those in the iras pscz. next, we have measured total galexfuv and nuv flux densities. then, we have matched this sample with sdss and2mass galaxies. by this procedure, we obtained the final sample which consistsof 607 galaxies. if we sort the sample with respect to 90um, their average sedshows a coherent trend: the more luminous at 90um, the redder the global sedbecomes. the m_r--nuv-r color-magnitude relation of our sample does not showbimodality, and the distribution is centered on the green valley between theblue cloud and red sequence seen in optical surveys. we have establishedformulae to convert fir luminosity from akari bands to the total infrared (ir)luminosity l_tir. with these formulae, we calculated the star formationdirectly visible with fuv and hidden by dust. the luminosity related to starformation activity (l_sf) is dominated by l_tir even if we take into accountthe far-infrared (fir) emission from dust heated by old stars. at high starformation rate (sfr) (&gt; 20 msun yr^-1), the fraction of directly visible sfr,sfr_fuv, decreases. we also estimated the fuv attenuation a_fuv fromfuv-to-total ir (tir) luminosity ratio. we also examined the l_tir/l_fuv-uvslope (fuv- nuv) relation. the majority of the sample has l_tir/l_fuv ratios 5to 10 times lower than expected from the local starburst relation, while somelirgs and all the ulirgs of this sample have higher l_tir/l_fuv ratios. wefound that the attenuation indicator l_tir/l_fuv is correlated to the stellarmass of galaxies, m*, but there is no correlation with specific sfr (ssfr),sfr/m*, and dust attenuation l_tir/l_fuv.

0707.3415	uv to ir seds of uv selected galaxies in the elais fields: evolution of  dust attenuation and star formation activity from z=0.7 to z=0.2	we study the ultraviolet to far-infrared (hereafter uv-to-ir) seds of asample of intermediate redshift (0.2 &lt; z &lt; 0.7) uv-selected galaxies from theelais-n1 and elais-n2 fields by fitting a multi-wavelength dataset to a libraryof grasil templates. star formation related properties of the galaxies arederived from the library of models by using the bayesian statistics. we find adecreasing presence of galaxies with low attenuation and low total luminosityas redshift decreases, which does not hold for high total luminosity galaxies.in addition the dust attenuation of low mass galaxies increases as redshiftdecreases, and this trend seems to disappear for galaxies with m* &gt; 10^11m_sun. this result is consistent with a mass dependent evolution of the dust togas ratio, which could be driven by a mass dependent efficiency of starformation in star forming galaxies. the specific star formation rates (ssfr)decrease with increasing stellar mass at all redshifts, and for a given stellarmass the ssfr decreases with decreasing redshift. the differences in the slopeof the m*--ssfr relation found between this work and others at similar redshiftcould be explained by the adopted selection criteria of the samples which, fora uv selected sample, favours blue, star forming galaxies.

1001.5136	the herschel reference survey	the herschel reference survey is a guaranteed time herschel key project andwill be a benchmark study of dust in the nearby universe. the survey willcomplement a number of other herschel key projects including large cosmologicalsurveys that trace dust in the distant universe. we will use herschel toproduce images of a statistically-complete sample of 323 galaxies at 250, 350and 500 micron. the sample is volume-limited, containing sources with distancesbetween 15 and 25 mpc and flux limits in the k-band to minimize the selectioneffects associated with dust and with young high-mass stars and to introduce aselection in stellar mass. the sample spans the whole range of morphologicaltypes (ellipticals to late-type spirals) and environments (from the field tothe centre of the virgo cluster) and as such will be useful for other purposesthan our own. we plan to use the survey to investigate (i) the dust content ofgalaxies as a function of hubble type, stellar mass and environment, (ii) theconnection between the dust content and composition and the other phases of theinterstellar medium and (iii) the origin and evolution of dust in galaxies. inthis paper, we describe the goals of the survey, the details of the sample andsome of the auxiliary observing programs that we have started to collectcomplementary data. we also use the available multi-frequency data to carry outan analysis of the statistical properties of the sample.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.1526	spire imaging of m82: cool dust in the wind and tidal streams	m82 is a unique representative of a whole class of galaxies, starbursts withsuperwinds, in the very nearby galaxy survey with herschel. in addition, itsinteraction with the m81 group has stripped a significant portion of itsinterstellar medium from its disk. spire maps now afford bettercharacterization of the far-infrared emission from cool dust outside the disk,and sketch a far more complete picture of its mass distribution and energeticsthan previously possible. they show emission coincident in projection with thestarburst wind and in a large halo, much more extended than the pah bandemission seen with spitzer. some complex substructures coincide with thebrightest pah filaments, and others with tidal streams seen in atomic hydrogen.we subtract the far-infrared emission of the starburst and underlying disk fromthe maps, and derive spatially-resolved far-infrared colors for the wind andhalo. we interpret the results in terms of dust mass, dust temperature, andglobal physical conditions. in particular, we examine variations in the dustphysical properties as a function of distance from the center and the windpolar axis, and conclude that more than two thirds of the extraplanar dust hasbeen removed by tidal interaction, and not entrained by the starburst wind.

1005.2187	the hermes spire submillimeter local luminosity function	local luminosity functions are fundamental benchmarks for high-redshiftgalaxy formation and evolution studies as well as for models describing theseprocesses. determining the local luminosity function in the submillimeter rangecan help to better constrain in particular the bolometric luminosity density inthe local universe, and herschel offers the first opportunity to do so in anunbiased way by imaging large sky areas at several submillimeter wavelengths.  we present the first herschel measurement of the submillimeter 0&lt;z&lt;0.2 localluminosity function and infrared bolometric (8-1000 $\mu$m) local luminositydensity based on spire data from the hermes herschel key program over 14.7deg^2.  flux measurements in the three spire channels at 250, 350 and 500 \mum arecombined with spitzer photometry and archival data. we fit the observedoptical-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution of spire sources and usethe 1/v_{max} estimator to provide the first constraints on the monochromatic250, 350 and 500 \mum as well as on the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) localluminosity function based on herschel data.  we compare our results with modeling predictions and find a slightly moreabundant local submillimeter population than predicted by a number of models.our measurement of the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local luminosityfunction suggests a flat slope at low luminosity, and the inferred localluminosity density, 1.31_-0.21^+0.24 x 10^8 lsun mpc^-3, is consistent with therange of values reported in recent literature.

1005.2192	hermes: far-infrared properties of known agn in the hermes fields	nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly.herschel-spire provides sampling of the fir seds of type 1 and type 2 agn,allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust(starburst) emission. we study large samples of spectroscopically confirmedtype 1 and type 2 agn lying within the herschel multi-tiered extragalacticsurvey (hermes) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aimingto understand their fir colour distributions and constrain their starburstcontributions. we find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed agn inthe hermes fields have 5-sigma detections at 250um, in agreement with previous(sub)mm agn studies. their combined spitzer-mips and herschel-spire colours -specifically s(250)/s(70) vs. s(70)/s(24) - quite clearly separate them fromthe non-agn, star-forming galaxy population, as their 24-um flux is dominatedby the hot torus emission. however, their spire colours alone do not differfrom those of non-agn galaxies. sed fitting shows that all those agn need astarburst component to fully account for their fir emission. for objects at z &gt;2, we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to thestarburst component, l(sb), and the agn accretion luminosity, l(acc), withl(sb) propto l(acc)^0.35. type 2 agn detected at 250um show on average higherl(sb) than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establishwhether this trend indicates stronger star-formation activity.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1007.1857	measures of star formation rates from infrared (herschel) and uv (galex)  emissions of galaxies in the hermes fields	the reliability of infrared (ir) and ultraviolet (uv) emissions to measurestar formation rates in galaxies is investigated for a large sample of galaxiesobserved with the spire and pacs instruments on herschel as part of the hermesproject. we build flux-limited 250 micron samples of sources at redshift z&lt;1,cross-matched with the spitzer/mips and galex catalogues. about 60 % of theherschel sources are detected in uv. the total ir luminosities, l_ir, of thesources are estimated using a sed-fitting code that fits to fluxes between 24and 500 micron. dust attenuation is discussed on the basis of commonly-useddiagnostics: the l_ir/l_uv ratio and the slope, beta, of the uv continuum. amean dust attenuation a_uv of ~ 3 mag is measured in the samples. l_ir/l_uv isfound to correlate with l_ir. galaxies with l_ir &gt; 10 ^{11} l_sun and 0.5&lt; z&lt;1exhibit a mean dust attenuation a_uv about 0.7 mag lower than that found fortheir local counterparts, although with a large dispersion. our galaxy samplesspan a large range of beta and l_ir/l_uv values which, for the most part, aredistributed between the ranges defined by the relations found locally forstarburst and normal star-forming galaxies. as a consequence the recipecommonly applied to local starbursts is found to overestimate the dustattenuation correction in our galaxy sample by a factor ~2-3 .

1010.4770	on the origin of m81 group extended dust emission	galactic cirrus emission at far-infrared wavelengths affects manyextragalactic observations. separating this emission from that associated withextragalactic objects is both important and difficult. in this paper we discussa particular case, the m81 group, and the identification of diffuse structuresprominent in the infrared, but also detected at optical wavelengths. the originof these structures has previously been controversial, ranging from them beingthe result of a past interaction between m81 and m82 or due to more localgalactic emission. we show that over of order a few arcminute scales thefar-infrared (herschel 250 &amp;\mu&amp;m) emission correlates spatially very well witha particular narrow velocity (2-3 km/s) component of the galactic hi. we findno evidence that any of the far-infrared emission associated with thesefeatures actually originates in the m81 group. thus we infer that theassociated diffuse optical emission must be due to galactic light backscattered off dust in our galaxy. ultra-violet observations pick out youngstellar associations around m81, but no detectable far-infrared emission. weconsider in detail one of the galactic cirrus features, finding that thefar-infrared hi relation breaks down below arc minute scales and that atsmaller scales there can be quite large dust temperature variations.

1101.1080	sub-millimetre galaxies reside in dark matter halos with masses greater  than 3x10^11 solar masses	the extragalactic background light at far-infrared wavelengths originatesfrom optically-faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies in the universe withstar-formation rates at the level of a few hundred solar masses per year. dueto the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes, the faintsub-millimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually. instead, theiraverage properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular powerspectrum of the background intensity variations. a previous attempt atmeasuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clusteringamplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halomodel. here we report a clear detection of the excess clustering over thelinear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum ofbrightness fluctuations at 250, 350, and 500 microns. from this excess, we findthat sub-millimetre galaxies are located in dark matter halos with a minimummass of log[m_min/m_sun ]= 11.5^+0.7_-0.2 at 350 microns. this minimum darkmatter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for starformation in the universe, and is lower than that predicted by semi-analyticalmodels for galaxy formation.

1102.1571	spectral energy distributions of an akari-sdss-galex sample of galaxies	the nearby universe remains the best laboratory to understand physicalproperties of galaxies and is a reference for any comparison with high redshiftobservations. the all sky (or very large) surveys performed from theultraviolet (uv) to the far-infrared (far-ir) gives us large datasets with avery large wavelength coverage to perform a reference study. we want toinvestigate dust attenuation characteristics as well as star formation rate(sfr) calibrations on a sample of nearby galaxies observed over 13 bands from0.15 to 160 microns. a sample of 363 galaxies is built from the akari /fis allsky survey cross-correlated with sdss and galex surveys. broad band spectralenergy distributions are fitted with the cigale code optimized to analyzevariations in dust attenuation curves and sfr measurements and based on anenergetic budget between the stellar and dust emission. our galaxy sample isprimarily selected in far-ir and mostly constituted of massive, actively starforming galaxies. there is some evidence for a dust attenuation law slightlysteeper than that used for starburst galaxies but we are unable to constrainthe presence or not of a bump at 220 nm. we confirm that a time dependent dustattenuation is necessary to perform the best fits. various calibrations of thedust attenuation in the uv as a function of uv-optical colours are discussed. acalibration of the current star formation rate combining uv and total iremissions is proposed with an accurate estimation of dust heating by old stars:for the whole sample 17 % of the total dust luminosity is not related to therecent star formation

1105.0646	hermes: lyman break galaxies individually detected at 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 2.0 in  goods-n with herschel/spire	as part of the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey we haveinvestigated the rest-frame far-infrared (fir) properties of a sample of morethan 4800 lyman break galaxies (lbgs) in the great observatories origins deepsurvey north field. most lbgs are not detected individually, but we do detect asub-sample of 12 objects at 0.7 &lt; z &lt; 1.6 and one object at z ~ 2.0.  the ones detected by herschel spire have redder observed nuv-u and u-r colorsthan the others, while the undetected ones have colors consistent with averagelbgs at z &gt; 2.5. the uv-to-fir spectral energy distributions of the objectsdetected in the rest-frame fir are investigated using the code cigale toestimate physical parameters. we find that lbgs detected by spire are highmass, luminous infrared galaxies.  it appears that lbgs are located in a triangle-shaped region in the a_fuv vs.log l_fuv diagram limited by a_fuv=0 at the bottom and by a diagonal followingthe temporal evolution of the most massive galaxies from the bottom-right tothe top-left of the diagram. this upper envelop can be used as upper limits forthe uv dust attenuation as a function of l_fuv}. the limits of this region arewell explained using a closed-box model, where the chemical evolution ofgalaxies produces metals, which in turn lead to higher dust attenuation whenthe galaxies age.

1105.2537	goods-herschel: an infrared main sequence for star-forming galaxies	we present the deepest far-ir observations obtained with herschel and examinethe 3-500um seds of galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;2.5, supplemented by a local referencesample from iras, iso, spitzer and akari data. we find that the ratio of totalir luminosity to rest-frame 8um luminosity, ir8 (=lir/l8), follows a gaussiandistribution centered on ir8=4 and defines an ir main sequence (ms). a minoritypopulation (&lt;20 %) of outliers producing a tail skewed toward higher values ofir8 consist of starbursts (sb) with compact projected star formation densities.ir8 can be used to separate galaxies with normal and extended modes of starformation from compact sbs with high-ir8, high projected ir surface brightness(&gt;3x10^10 lsun kpc^-2) and a high specific sfr (i.e., sbs). the rest-frame,uv-2700a size of these distant sbs is typically half that of ms galaxies,supporting the correlation between star formation density and sb activity thatis measured for the local sample. locally, (u)lirgs are systematically in thesb mode, whereas most distant (u)lirgs form stars in the "normal" ms mode. thisconfusion between two modes of star formation is the cause of the so-called"mid-ir excess" population of galaxies found at z&gt;1.5 by previous studies. msgalaxies have strong pah emission line features, a broad far-ir bump resultingfrom a combination of dust temperatures (tdust~15-50 k), and an effectivetdust~31 k, as derived from the peak wavelength of their ir sed. galaxies inthe sb regime instead exhibit weak pah ew and a sharper far-ir bump with aneffective tdust~40 k. finally, we present evidence that the mid-to-far iremission of x-ray agns is predominantly produced by star formation and thatcandidate dusty agns with a power-law emission in the mid-ir systematicallyoccur in compact, dusty sbs. after correcting for the effect of sbs on ir8, weidentify new candidates for extremely obscured agns.

1107.1049	goods-herschel: evidence for a uv extinction bump in galaxies at z &gt; 1	dust attenuation curves in external galaxies are useful to study their dustproperties as well as to interpret their intrinsic spectral energydistributions. in particular the presence or absence of a uv bump at 2175 aremains an open issue which has consequences on the interpretation of broadband colours of distant galaxies. we study the dust attenuation curve in the uvrange at z &gt;1. in particular we search for the presence of a uv bump. we usedeep photometric data of the cdfs obtained with intermediate and broad bandfilters by the musyc project to sample the uv rest-frame of galaxies with 1&lt;z&lt;2. herschel/pacs and spitzer/mips data are used to measure the dust emission.30 galaxies were selected with high s/n in all bands. their seds from the uv tothe far-ir are fitted using the cigale code and the characteristics of the dustattenuation curve are obtained. the mean dust attenuation curve we deriveexhibits a uv bump at 2175a whose amplitude corresponds to 35 % (76%) that ofthe mw (lmc2 supershell) extinction curve. an analytical expression of theaverage attenuation curve is given, it is found slightly steeper than thecalzetti et al. one, although at a 1 sigma level. our galaxy sample is used tostudy the derivation of the slopes of the uv continuum from broad band colours,including the galex fuv-nuv colour. systematic errors induced by the presenceof the bump are quantified. we compare dust attenuation factors measured withcigale to the slope of the uv continuum and find that there is a large scatteraround the relation valid for local starbursts (0.7 mag). the uncertainties onthe determination of the uv slope lead to an extra systematic error of theorder of 0.3 to 0.7 mag on dust attenuation when a filter overlaps the uv bump.

1107.1373	herschel/hermes: the x-ray - infrared correlation for star-forming  galaxies at z~1	for the first time, we investigate the x-ray/infrared (ir) correlation forstar-forming galaxies at z~1, using spire submm data from the recently-launchedherschel space observatory and deep x-ray data from the 2ms chandra deep fieldnorth (cdfn) survey. we examine the x-ray/ir correlation in the soft x-ray (sx,0.5-2 kev) and hard x-ray (hx, 2-10 kev) bands by comparing our z~1spire-detected star-forming galaxies (sfgs) to equivalently ir-luminous (l_ir&gt;10^10 l_sun) samples in the local/low redshift universe. our results suggestthat the x-ray/ir properties of the spire sfgs are on average similar to thoseof their local counterparts, as we find no evidence for evolution in thel_sx/l_ir and l_hx/l_ir ratios with redshift. we note however, that at allredshifts, both l_sx/l_ir and l_hx/l_ir are strongly dependent on irluminosity, with luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs andulirgs,l_ir &gt;10^11 l_sun) having up to an order of magnitude lower values thannormal infrared galaxies (l_ir &lt;10^11 l_sun). we derive a l_sx-l_ir relationand confirm the applicability of an existing l_hx-l_ir relation for both localand distant lirgs and ulirgs, consistent with a scenario where x-ray luminosityis correlated with the star-formation rate (sfr).

1107.2653	goods-herschel measurements of the dust attenuation of typical  star-forming galaxies at high redshift: observations of uv-selected galaxies  at z~2	we take advantage of the sensitivity and resolution of herschel at 100 and160 micron to directly image the thermal dust emission and investigate theinfrared luminosities, l(ir), and dust obscuration of typical star-forming (l*)galaxies at high redshift. our sample consists of 146 uv-selected galaxies withspectroscopic redshifts 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.6 in the goods-north field. supplemented withdeep very large array (vla) and spitzer imaging, we construct median stacks atthe positions of these galaxies at 24, 100, and 160 micron, and 1.4 ghz. thecomparison between these stacked fluxes and a variety of dust templates andcalibrations implies that typical star-forming galaxies with uv luminositiesl(uv)&gt;1e10 lsun at z~2 are luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs) with a medianl(ir)=(2.2+/-0.3)e11 lsun. typical galaxies at 1.5&lt;z&lt;2.6 have a median dustobscuration l(ir)/l(uv) = 7.1+/-1.1, which corresponds to a dust correctionfactor, required to recover the bolometric star formation rate (sfr) from theunobscured uv sfr, of 5.2+/-0.6. this result is similar to that inferred fromprevious investigations of the uv, h-alpha, 24 micron, radio, and x-rayproperties of the same galaxies studied here. stacking in bins of uv slopeimplies that l* galaxies with redder spectral slopes are also dustier, and thatthe correlation between uv slope and dustiness is similar to that found forlocal starburst galaxies. hence, the rest-frame 30 and 50 micron fluxesvalidate on average the use of the local uv attenuation curve to recover thedust attenuation of typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift. in thesimplest interpretation, the agreement between the local and high redshift uvattenuation curves suggests a similarity in the dust production and stellar anddust geometries of starburst galaxies over the last 10 billion years.

1108.0838	goods-herschel a population of 24micron dropout sources at z &lt; 2	using extremely deep pacs 100- and 160um herschel data from thegoods-herschel program, we identify 21 infrared bright galaxies previouslymissed in the deepest 24um surveys performed by mips. these mips dropouts arepredominantly found in two redshift bins, centred at z ~0.4 and ~1.3. theirs_100/s_24 flux density ratios are similar to those of local lirgs and ulirgs,whose silicate absorption features at 18um (at z ~ 0.4) and 9.7um (at z ~ 1.3)are shifted into the 24um mips band at these redshifts. the high-z sub-sampleconsists of 11 infrared luminous sources, accounting for ~2% of the wholegoods-herschel sample and putting strong upper limits on the fraction oflirgs/ulirgs at 1.0&lt;z&lt;1.7 that are missed by the 24um surveys. we find that as_100/s_24 &gt; 43 colour cut selects galaxies with a redshift distributionsimilar to that of the mips dropouts and when combined with a second colourcut, s_16/s_8 &gt; 4, isolates sources at 1.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.7. we show that thesesources have elevated specific star formation rates (ssfr) compared to mainsequence galaxies at these redshifts and are likely to be compact starburstswith moderate/strong 9.7um silicate absorption features in their mid-irspectra. herschel data reveal that their infrared luminosities extrapolatedfrom the 24um flux density are underestimated, on average, by a factor of ~3.these silicate break galaxies account for 16% (8%) of the ulirg (lirg)population in the goods fields, indicating a lower limit in their space densityof 2.0 \times 10^(-5) mpc^(-3). finally, we provide estimates of the fractionof z &lt; 2 mips dropout sources as a function of the 24-, 100-, 160-, 250- and350um sensitivity limits, and conclude that previous predictions of apopulation of silicate break galaxies missed by the major 24um extragalacticsurveys have been overestimated.

1109.1937	goods-herschel: the impact of galaxy-galaxy interactions on the  far-infrared properties of galaxies	we study the impact of galaxy-galaxy interactions on the fir properties ofgalaxies and its evolution at 0&lt;z&lt;1.2. using the high-z galaxies in the fieldsof goods observed by herschel in the framework of the goods-herschel keyprogram and the local iras or akari-selected galaxies in the field of sdss dr7,we investigate the dependence of galaxy properties on the morphology of and thedistance to the nearest neighbor galaxy. we find that the sfrs and the ssfrs ofgalaxies, on average, depend on the morphology of and the distance to thenearest neighbor galaxy in this redshift range. when a late-type galaxy has aclose neighbor galaxy, the sfr and the ssfr increase as it approaches alate-type neighbor, which is supported by k-s and mc tests with a significancelevel of &gt;99%. however, the sfr and the ssfr decrease or do not change much asit approaches an early-type neighbor. the bifurcations of sfrs and ssfrsdepending on the neighbor's morphology seem to occur at r_n~0.5r_vir,nei, whichis supported by k-s and mc tests with a significance level of &gt;98%. for allredshift bins, the ssfrs of late-type galaxies interacting with late-typeneighbors are increased by factors of about 1.8+/-0.7 and 4.0+/-1.2 compared tothose of non-interacting galaxies when the pair separation is smaller than0.5r_vir,nei and 0.1r_vir,nei, respectively. the tdust of both local and high-zlate-type galaxies strongly interacting with late-type neighbors (i.e. r_n &lt;0.1r_vir,nei) appears to be higher than that of non-interacting galaxies with asignificance level of 96-99%. however, tdust of local late-type galaxiesstrongly interacting with early-type neighbors seems to be lower than orsimilar to that of non-interacting galaxies. our results suggest thatgalaxy-galaxy interactions and mergers have been strongly affecting the sfr andthe dust properties of star-forming galaxies over at least 8 billion years.

1201.2305	fir colours of nearby late-type galaxies in the herschel reference  survey	we study the far infrared (60-500 $\mu$m) colours of late-type galaxies inthe $herschel$ reference survey, a k-band selected, volume limited sample ofnearby galaxies. the far infrared colours are correlated with each other, withtighter correlations for the indices that are closer in wavelength. we alsocompare the different colour indices to various tracers of the physicalproperties of the target galaxies, such as the surface brightness of theionising and non-ionising stellar radiation, the dust attenuation and themetallicity. the emission properties of the cold dust dominating the farinfrared spectral domain are regulated by the properties of the interstellarradiation field. consistent with that observed in nearby, resolved galaxies,our analysis shows that the ionising and the non-ionising stellar radiation,including that emitted by the most evolved, cold stars, both contribute to theheating of the cold dust component. this work also shows that metallicity isanother key parameter characterising the cold dust emission of normal,late-type galaxies. a single modified black body with a grain emissivity index$\beta$=1.5 better fits the observed spire flux density ratios $s250/s350$ vs.$s350/s500$ than $\beta$=2, although values of $\beta$ $\simeq$ 2 are possiblein metal rich, high surface brightness galaxies. values of $\beta$ $\lesssim$1.5 better represent metal poor, low surface brightness objects. thisobservational evidence provides strong constraints for dust emission models ofnormal, late type galaxies.

1201.2405	the irx-beta relation on sub-galactic scales in star-forming galaxies of  the herschel reference survey	uv and optical surveys are essential to gain insight into the processesdriving galaxy formation and evolution. the rest-frame uv emission is key tomeasure the cosmic sfr. however, uv light is strongly reddened by dust. instarburst galaxies, the uv colour and the attenuation are linked, allowing tocorrect for dust extinction. unfortunately, evidence has been accumulating thatthe relation between uv colour and attenuation is different for normalstar-forming galaxies when compared to starburst galaxies. it is still notunderstood why star-forming galaxies deviate from the uv colour-attenuationrelation of starburst galaxies. previous work and models hint that the role ofthe shape of the attenuation curve and the age of stellar populations have animportant role. in this paper we aim at understanding the fundamental reasonsto explain this deviation. we have used the cigale sed fitting code to modelthe far uv to the far ir emission of a set of 7 reasonably face-on spiralgalaxies from the hrs. we have explored the influence of a wide range ofphysical parameters to quantify their influence and impact on the accuratedetermination of the attenuation from the uv colour, and why normal galaxies donot follow the same relation as starburst galaxies. we have found that thedeviation can be best explained by intrinsic uv colour differences betweendifferent regions in galaxies. variations in the shape of the attenuation curvecan also play a secondary role. standard age estimators of the stellarpopulations prove to be poor predictors of the intrinsic uv colour. theseresults are also retrieved on a sample of 58 galaxies when considering theirintegrated fluxes. when correcting the emission of normal star-forming galaxiesfor the attenuation, it is crucial to take into account possible variations inthe intrinsic uv colour as well as variations of the shape of the attenuationcurve.

1209.5844	star formation and dust extinction properties of local galaxies as seen  from akari and galex	an accurate estimation of the star formation-related properties of galaxiesis crucial for understanding the evolution of galaxies. in galaxies,ultraviolet (uv) light emitted by recently formed massive stars is attenuatedby dust, which is also produced by star formation (sf) activity, and isreemitted at mid- and far- infrared (ir) wavelengths. in this study, weinvestigate the star formation rate (sfr) and dust extinction using uv and irdata. we selected local galaxies which are detected at akari fis 90 um andmatched the iras iifscz 60 um select catalog. we measured fuv and nuv fluxdensities from galex images. we examined the sf and extinction of localgalaxies using four bands of akari. then, we calculated fuv and total irluminosities, and obtained the sf luminosity, l_{sf}, the total luminosityrelated to star formation activity, and the sfr. we find that in most galaxies,l_{sf} is dominated by l_{dust}. we also find that galaxies with higher sfactivity have a higher fraction of their sf hidden by dust. in fact, the sf ofgalaxies with sfrs &gt;20 m_{sun}/yr is almost completely hidden by dust. ourresults boast a significantly higher precision with respect to previouslypublished works, due to the use of much larger object samples from the akariand galex all sky surveys.

1211.4336	hermes: unveiling obscured star formation - the far infrared luminosity  function of ultraviolet-selected galaxies at z~1.5	we study the far-infrared (ir) and sub-millimeter properties of a sample ofultraviolet (uv) selected galaxies at z\sim1.5. using stacking at 250, 350 and500 um from herschel space observatory spire imaging of the cosmos fieldobtained within the hermes key program, we derive the mean ir luminosity as afunction of both uv luminosity and slope of the uv continuum beta. the ir to uvluminosity ratio is roughly constant over most of the uv luminosity range weexplore. we also find that the ir to uv luminosity ratio is correlated withbeta. we observe a correlation that underestimates the correlation derived fromlow-redshift starburst galaxies, but is in good agreement with the correlationderived from local normal star-forming galaxies. using these results wereconstruct the ir luminosity function of our uv-selected sample. thisluminosity function recovers the ir luminosity functions measured from irselected samples at the faintest luminosities (lir ~ 10^{11} l_sun), but mightunderestimate them at the bright-end (lir &gt; 5.10^{11} l_sun). for galaxies with10^{11}&lt;lir/l_sun&lt;10^{13}, the ir luminosity function of a uv selectionrecovers (given the differences in ir-based estimates) 52-65 to 89-112 per centof the star-formation rate density derived from an ir selection. the cosmicstar-formation rate density derived from this ir luminosity function is 61-76to 100-133 per cent of the density derived from ir selections at the sameepoch. assuming the latest herschel results and conservative stackingmeasurements, we use a toy model to fully reproduce the far ir luminosityfunction from our uv selection at z\sim 1.5. this suggests that a sample around4 magnitudes deeper (i.e. reaching u \sim 30 mag) and a large dispersion of their to uv luminosity ratio are required.

1211.5262	integrated spectroscopy of the herschel reference survey. the spectral  line properties of a volume-limited, k-band selected sample of nearby  galaxies	we present long-slit integrated spectroscopy of 238 late-type galaxiesbelonging to the herschel reference survey, a volume limited samplerepresentative of the nearby universe. this sample has a unique legacy valuesince ideally defined for any statistical study of the multifrequencyproperties of galaxies spanning a large range in morphological type andluminosity. the spectroscopic observations cover the spectral range 3600-6900 aat a resolution r ~ 1000 and are thus suitable for separating the underlyingabsorption from the emission of the hbeta line as well as the two [nii] linesfrom the halpha emission. we measure the fluxes and the equivalent widths ofthe strongest emission lines ([oii], hbeta, [oiii], [nii], halpha, and [sii]).the data are used to study the distribution of the equivalent width of all theemission lines, of the balmer decrement c(hbeta) and of the observed underlyingbalmer absorption under hbeta in this sample. combining these new spectroscopicdata with those available at other frequencies, we also study the dependence ofc(hbeta) and e.w.hbeta_{abs} on morphological type, stellar mass and stellarsurface density, star formation rate, birthrate parameter and metallicity ingalaxies belonging to different environments (fields vs. virgo). thedistribution of the equivalent width of all the emission lines, of c(hbeta) ande.w.hbeta_{abs} are systematically different in cluster and field galaxies. thebalmer decrement increases with stellar mass, stellar surface density,metallicity and star formation rate of the observed galaxies, while it isunexpectedly almost independent from the column density of the atomic andmolecular gas. the dependence of c(hbeta) on stellar mass is steeper than thatpreviously found in other works. the underlying balmer absorption does notsignificantly change with any of these physical parameters.

1211.6116	the complex physics of dusty star-forming galaxies at high redshifts as  revealed by herschel and spitzer	we combine far-infrared photometry from herschel (pep/hermes) with deepmid-infrared spectroscopy from spitzer to investigate the nature and the massassembly history of a sample of 31 luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxiesat z~1 and 2 selected in goods-s with 24 $\mu$m fluxes between 0.2 and 0.5 mjy.we model the data with a self-consistent physical model (grasil) which includesa state-of-the-art treatment of dust extinction and reprocessing. we find thatall of our galaxies appear to require massive populations of old (&gt;1 gyr) starsand, at the same time, to host a moderate ongoing activity of sf (sfr &lt; 100m$_{\odot}$/yr). the bulk of the stars appear to have been formed a few gyrbefore the observation in essentially all cases. only five galaxies of thesample require a recent starburst superimposed on a quiescent star formationhistory (sfh). we also find discrepancies between our results and those basedon optical-only sed fitting for the same objects; by fitting their observedspectral energy distributions with our physical model we find higherextinctions (by $\delta$a_{v} ~ 0.81 and 1.14) and higher stellar masses (by$\delta$log(m*) ~ 0.16 and 0.36 dex) for z~1 and z~2 (u)lirgs, respectively.the stellar mass difference is larger for the most dust obscured objects. wealso find lower sfrs than those computed from l_{ir} using the kennicuttrelation due to the significant contribution to the dust heating byintermediate-age stellar populations through 'cirrus' emission (~73% and ~66%of total l_{ir} for z~1 and z~2 (u)lirgs, respectively).

1212.1956	an investigation of star formation and dust attenuation in major mergers  using ultraviolet and infrared data	merger processes play an important role in galaxy formation and evolution. tostudy the influence of merger processes on the evolution of dust properties andcosmic star formation rate, we investigate a local sample of major mergergalaxies and a control sample of isolated galaxies using galex ultraviolet (uv)and spitzer infrared (ir) images. through a statistical study, we find thatdust attenuation in merger galaxies is enhanced with respect to isolatedgalaxies. we find this enhancement is contributed mainly by spiral galaxies inspiral-spiral (s-s) pairs, and increases with the increasing stellar mass of agalaxy. combining the ir and uv parts of star formation rates (sfrs), we thencalculated the total sfrs and specific star formation rates (ssfrs). we findthe ssfrs to be enhanced in merger galaxies. this enhancement depends on galaxystellar mass and the companion's morphology, but depends little on whether thegalaxy is a primary or secondary component or on the separation between twocomponents. these results are consistent with a previous study based only on irimages. in addition, we investigate the nuclear contributions to sfrs. sfrs inpaired galaxies are more concentrated in the central part of the galaxies thanin isolate galaxies. our studies of dust attenuation show that the nuclearparts of pairs most resemble ulirgs. including uv data in the present work notonly provides reliable information on dust attenuation, but also refinesanalyses of sfrs.

1302.4895	the herschel census of infrared seds through cosmic time	using herschel data from the deepest spire and pacs surveys (hermes and pep)in cosmos and goods (n+s), we examine the dust properties of ir-luminous(l_ir&gt;10^10 l_sun) galaxies at 0.1&lt;z&lt;2 and determine how these evolve withcosmic time. the unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of surveyselection effects, making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated,ir-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selectionbiases. we find that ir-luminous galaxies have seds with broad far-ir peakscharacterised by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures inthe 25-45k range. hot (t&gt;45k) seds and cold (t&lt;25k), cirrus-dominated seds arerare, with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts suchas m82 and cool spirals such as m51. we observe a luminosity-temperature (l-t)relation, where the average dust temperature of log[l_ir/l_sun]=12.5 galaxiesis about 10k higher than that of their log[l_ir/l_sun]=10.5 counterparts.however, although the increased dust heating in more luminous systems is thedriving factor behind the l-t relation, the increase in dust mass and/orstarburst size with luminosity plays a dominant role in shaping it. our resultsshow that the dust conditions in ir-luminous sources evolve with cosmic time:at high redshift, dust temperatures are on average up to 10k lower than what ismeasured locally. this is manifested as a flattening of the l-t relation,suggesting that (u)lirgs in the early universe are typically characterised by amore extended dust distribution and/or higher dust masses than local equivalentsources. interestingly, the evolution in dust temperature is luminositydependent, with the fraction of lirgs with t&lt;35k showing a 2-fold increase fromz~0 to z~2, whereas that of ulirgs with t&lt;35k shows a 6-fold increase.

1310.3227	hermes: dust attenuation and star formation activity in uv-selected  samples from z~4 to z~1.5	we study the link between observed ultraviolet luminosity, stellar mass, anddust attenuation within rest-frame uv-selected samples at z~ 4, 3, and 1.5. wemeasure by stacking at 250, 350, and 500 um in the herschel/spire images fromthe hermes program the average infrared luminosity as a function of stellarmass and uv luminosity. we find that dust attenuation is mostly correlated withstellar mass. there is also a secondary dependence with uv luminosity: at agiven uv luminosity, dust attenuation increases with stellar mass, while at agiven stellar mass it decreases with uv luminosity. we provide new empiricalrecipes to correct for dust attenuation given the observed uv luminosity andthe stellar mass. our results also enable us to put new constraints on theaverage relation between star formation rate and stellar mass at z~ 4, 3, and1.5. the star formation rate-stellar mass relations are well described by powerlaws (sfr~ m^0.7), with the amplitudes being similar at z~4 and z~3, anddecreasing by a factor of 4 at z~1.5 at a given stellar mass. we furtherinvestigate the evolution with redshift of the specific star formation rate.our results are in the upper range of previous measurements, in particular atz~3, and are consistent with a plateau at 3&lt;z&lt;4. current model predictions(either analytic, semi-analytic or hydrodynamic) are inconsistent with thesevalues, as they yield lower predictions than the observations in the redshiftrange we explore. we use these results to discuss the star formation historiesof galaxies in the framework of the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. ourresults suggest that galaxies at high redshift (2.5&lt;z&lt;4) stay around 1 gyr onthe main sequence. with decreasing redshift, this time increases such that z=1main sequence galaxies with 10^8&lt;m_*/msun&lt;10^10 stay on the main sequence untilz=0.

1310.4147	the suppression of star formation by powerful active galactic nuclei	the old, red stars which constitute the bulges of galaxies, and the massiveblack holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history whengalaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (agn)shone brightly from accretion onto black holes. it is widely suspected, butunproven, that the tight correlation in mass of the black hole and stellarcomponents results from the agn quenching the surrounding star formation as itapproaches its peak luminosity. x-rays trace emission from agn unambiguously,while powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and arebrightest at infrared to submillimetre wavelengths. here we report observationsin the submillimetre and x-ray which show that rapid star formation was commonin the host galaxies of agn when the universe was 2-6 gyrs old, but that themost vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an x-rayluminosity of 10^44 erg/s. this suppression of star formation in the hostgalaxies of powerful agn is a key prediction of models in which the agn drivesa powerful outflow, expelling the interstellar medium of its host galaxy andtransforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.

1310.7583	hermes: candidate high-redshift galaxies discovered with herschel/spire	we present a method for selecting $z&gt;4$ dusty, star forming galaxies (dsfgs)using herschel/spire 250/350/500 $\mu m$ flux densities to search for redsources. we apply this method to 21 deg$^2$ of data from the hermes survey toproduce a catalog of 38 high-$z$ candidates. follow-up of the first 5 of thesesources confirms that this method is efficient at selecting high-$z$ dsfgs,with 4/5 at $z=4.3$ to $6.3$ (and the remaining source at $z=3.4$), and thatthey are some of the most luminous dusty sources known. comparison withprevious dsfg samples, mostly selected at longer wavelengths (e.g., 850 $\mum$) and in single-band surveys, shows that our method is much more efficient atselecting high-$z$ dsfgs, in the sense that a much larger fraction are at$z&gt;3$. correcting for the selection completeness and purity, we find that thenumber of bright ($s_{500\,\mu m} \ge 30$ mjy), red herschel sources is $3.3\pm 0.8$ deg$^{-2}$. this is much higher than the number predicted by currentmodels, suggesting that the dsfg population extends to higher redshifts thanpreviously believed. if the shape of the luminosity function for high-$z$ dsfgsis similar to that at $z\sim2$, rest-frame uv based studies may be missing asignificant component of the star formation density at $z=4$ to $6$, even aftercorrection for extinction.

0803.0414	star formation history of galaxies from z=0 to z=0.7 a backward approach  to the evolution of star-forming galaxies	we investigate whether the mean star formation activity of star-forminggalaxies from z=0 to z=0.7 in the goods-s field can be reproduced by simpleevolution models of these systems. in this case, such models might be used asfirst order references for studies at higher z to decipher when and to whatextent a secular evolution is sufficient to explain the star formation historyin galaxies.  we selected star-forming galaxies at z=0 and at z=0.7 in ir and in uv to haveaccess to all the recent star formation. we focused on galaxies with a stellarmass ranging between 10^{10} and 10^{11} m_sun for which the results are notbiased by the selections. we compared the data to chemical evolution modelsdeveloped for spiral galaxies and originally built to reproduce the maincharacteristics of the milky way and nearby spirals without fine-tuning themfor the present analysis. we find a shallow decrease in the specific starformation rate (ssfr) when the stellar mass increases. the evolution of thessfr characterizing both uv and ir selected galaxies from z=0 to z=0.7 isconsistent with the models built to reproduce the present spiral galaxies.there is no need to strongly modify of the physical conditions in galaxies toexplain the average evolution of their star formation from z=0 to z=0.7. we usethe models to predict the evolution of the star formation rate and themetallicity on a wider range of redshift and we compare these predictions withthe results of semi-analytical models.

1405.1425	modeling the connection between ultraviolet and infrared galaxy  populations across cosmic times	using a phenomenological approach, we self-consistently model the redshiftevolution of the ultraviolet (uv) and infrared (ir) luminosity functions acrosscosmic time, as well as a range of observed ir properties of uv-selected galaxypopulation. this model is an extension of the 2sfm (2 star-formation modes)formalism, which is based on the observed "main-sequence" of star-forminggalaxies, i.e. a strong correlation between their stellar mass and their starformation rate (sfr), and a secondary population of starbursts with an excessof star formation. the balance between the uv light from young, massive starsand the dust-reprocessed ir emission is modeled following the empiricalrelation between the attenuation (irx for ir excess hereafter) and the stellarmass, assuming a scatter of 0.4\,dex around this relation. we obtain a goodoverall agreement with the measurements of the ir luminosity function up to z~3and the uv luminosity functions up to z~6, and show that a scatter on the irx-mrelation is mandatory to reproduce these observables. we also naturallyreproduce the observed, flat relation between the mean irx and the uvluminosity at l$_{\rm uv}&gt;$10$^{9.5}$ l$_\odot$. finally, we performpredictions of the uv properties and detectability of ir-selected samples andthe vice versa, and discuss the results in the context of the uv-rest-frame andsub-millimeter surveys of the next decade.

1407.4511	linking the x-ray and infrared properties of star-forming galaxies at  z&lt;1.5	we present the most complete study to date of the x-ray emission fromstar-formation in high redshift (median z=0.7; z&lt;1.5), ir-luminous(l_ir=10^10-10^13 l_sun) galaxies detected by herschel's pacs and spireinstruments. for our purpose we take advantage of the deepest x-ray data todate, the chandra deep fields (north and south). sources which host agn areremoved from our analysis by means of multiple agn indicators. we find an agnfraction of 18+/-2 per cent amongst our sample and note that agn entirelydominate at values of log[l_x/l_ir]&gt;-3 in both hard and soft x-ray bands. fromthe sources which are star-formation dominated, only a small fraction areindividually x-ray detected and for the bulk of the sample we calculate averagex-ray luminosities through stacking. we find an average soft x-ray to infraredratio of log[l_sx/l_ir]=-4.3 and an average hard x-ray to infrared ratio oflog[l_hx/l_ir]=-3.8. we report that the x-ray/ir correlation is approximatelylinear through the entire range of l_ir and z probed and, although broadlyconsistent with the local (z&lt;0.1) one, it does display some discrepancies. wesuggest that these discrepancies are unlikely to be physical, i.e. due to anintrinsic change in the x-ray properties of star-forming galaxies with cosmictime, as there is no significant evidence for evolution of the l_x/l_ir ratiowith redshift. instead they are possibly due to selection effects and remainingagn contamination. we also examine whether dust obscuration in the galaxy playsa role in attenuating x-rays from star-formation, by investigating changes inthe l_x/l_ir ratio as a function of the average dust temperature. we concludethat x-rays do not suffer any measurable attenuation in the host galaxy.

0803.3877	galex observations of low surface brightness galaxies: uv color and star  formation efficiency	we present galex uv observations of a sample of low surface brightness (lsb)galaxies for which hi data are available, allowing us to estimate their starformation efficiency. we find that the uv light extends to larger radii thanthe optical light (some galaxies, but not all, look similar to the recentlydiscovered xuv-disk galaxies). using a standard calibration to convert the uvlight into star formation rates, we obtain lower star formation efficiencies inlsb galaxies than in high surface brightness galaxies by about one order ofmagnitude.  we show however that standard calibrations may not apply to these galaxies,as the fuv-nuv color obtained from the two galex bands (fuv and nuv;lambda_eff= 1516 and 2267 a, respectively) is redder than expected for starforming galaxies. this color can be interpreted as a result of internalextinction, modified initial mass function or by star formation historiescharacterized by bursts followed by quiescent phases. our analysis favors thislatter hypothesis.

1504.00248	dust attenuation up to z~2 in the akari north ecliptic pole deep field	(abridged) we aim to study the evolution of dust attenuation in galaxiesselected in the ir in the redshift range in which they are known to dominatethe star formation activity in the universe. the comparison with othermeasurements of dust attenuation in samples selected using different criteriawill give us a global picture of the attenuation at work in star-forminggalaxies and its evolution with redshift. using multiple filters of ircinstrument, we selected more than 4000 galaxies from their rest-frame emissionat 8 microns, from z~0.2 to 2$. we built seds from the rest-frame uv to thefar-ir by adding data in the optical-nir and from galex and herschel surveys.we fit seds with the physically-motivated code cigale. we test differenttemplates for agns and recipes for dust attenuation and estimate stellarmasses, sfrs, amount of dust attenuation, and agn contribution to the total irluminosity. the agn contribution to the total ir luminosity is found to be onaverage approximately 10% with a slight increase with redshift. dustattenuation in galaxies dominating the ir luminosity function is found toincrease from z=0 to z=1 and to remain almost constant from z=1 to z=1.5.conversely, when galaxies are selected at a fixed ir luminosity, their dustattenuation slightly decreases as redshift increases but with a largedispersion. the attenuation in our mid-ir selected sample is found ~ 2 maghigher than that found globally in the universe or in uv and halpha lineselections in the same redshift range. this difference is well explained by anincrease of dust attenuation with the stellar mass, in global agreement withother recent studies. starbursting galaxies do not systematically exhibit ahigh attenuation

1504.01876	halpha imaging of the herschel reference survey. the star formation  properties of a volume-limited, k-band-selected sample of nearby late-type  galaxies	we present new halpha+[nii] imaging data of late-type galaxies in theherschel reference survey aimed at studying the star formation properties of ak-band-selected, volume-limited sample of nearby galaxies. the halpha+[nii]data are corrected for [nii] contamination and dust attenuation using differentrecipes based on the balmer decrement and the 24mic luminosities. we show thatthe l(halpha) derived with different corrections give consistent results onlywhenever the uncertainty on the estimate of the balmer decrement is &lt;=0.1. weuse these data to derive the sfr of the late-type galaxies of the sample, andcompare these estimates to those determined using independent monochromatictracers (fuv, radio) or the output of sed fitting codes. this comparisonsuggests that the 24mic based dust extinction correction for halpha might benon universal, and that it should be used with caution in all objects with asfa, where dust heating can be dominated by the old stellar population.furthermore, because of the sudden truncation of the sfa of cluster galaxiesoccurring after their interaction with the surrounding environment, thestationarity conditions required to transform monochromatic fluxes into sfrmight not always be satisfied in tracers other than l(halpha). in a similarway, the parametrisation of the sfh generally used in sed fitting codes mightnot be adequate for these recently interacting systems. we then study the sfrluminosity distribution and the typical scaling relations of late-typegalaxies. we observe a systematic decrease of the ssfr with increasing stellarmass, stellar mass surface density, and metallicity. we also observe anincrease of the asymmetry and smoothness parameters measured in the halpha-bandwith increasing ssfr, probably induced by an increase of the contribution ofgiant hii regions to the halpha luminosity function in sf low-luminositygalaxies.

1506.07397	the spectral energy distribution of galaxies at z &gt; 2.5: implications  from the herschel/spire color-color diagram	we use the herschel spire color-color diagram to study the spectral energydistribution (sed) and the redshift estimation of high-z galaxies. we compileda sample of 57 galaxies with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts and spiredetections in all three bands at $z=2.5-6.4$, and compared their average spirecolors with sed templates from local and high-z libraries. we find that localseds are inconsistent with high-z observations. the local calibrations of theparameters need to be adjusted to describe the average colors of high-zgalaxies. for high-z libraries, the templates with an evolution from z=0 to 3can well describe the average colors of the observations at high redshift.using these templates, we defined color cuts to divide the spire color-colordiagram into different regions with different mean redshifts. we tested thismethod and two other color cut methods using a large sample of 783herschel-selected galaxies, and find that although these methods can separatethe sample into populations with different mean redshifts, the dispersion ofredshifts in each population is considerably large. additional information isneeded for better sampling.

1510.07657	the imprint of rapid star formation quenching on the spectral energy  distributions of galaxies	[abridged] in high density environment, the gas content of galaxies isstripped, leading to a rapid quenching of their star formation activity. thisdramatic environmental effect is generally not taken into account in the sfhsusually assumed to perform spectral energy distribution (sed) fitting of thesegalaxies, yielding to a poor fit of their stellar emission and, consequently, abiased estimate of the sfr. we aim at reproducing the sfh of galaxies thatunderwent a rapid star formation quenching using a truncated delayed sfh thatwe implemented in the sed fitting code cigale. we show that the ratio betweenthe instantaneous sfr and the sfr just before the quenching ($r_{sfr}$) is wellconstrained as long as rest frame uv data are available. this sed modelling isapplied to the herschel reference survey (hrs) containing isolated galaxies andsources falling in the dense environment of the virgo cluster. the latter arehi-deficient due to ram pressure stripping. we show that the truncated delayedsfh successfully reproduces their sed while typical sfh assumptions fail. agood correlation is found between $r_{sfr}$ and hi-def, the parameterquantifying the gas deficiency of cluster galaxies, meaning that sed fittingresults can be used to provide a tentative estimate of the gas deficiency ofgalaxies for which hi observations are not available. the hrs galaxies areplaced on the sfr-$m_*$ diagram showing that the hi-deficient sources lie inthe quiescent region confirming previous studies. using the $r_{sfr}$parameter, we derive the sfr of these sources before quenching and show thatthey were previously on the main sequence relation. we show that the $r_{sfr}$parameter is also well recovered for deeply obscured high redshift sources, aswell as in absence of ir data. sed fitting is thus a powerful tool to identifygalaxies that underwent a rapid star formation quenching.

1511.06167	the hermes sub-millimetre local and low-redshift luminosity functions	we used wide area surveys over 39 deg$^2$ by the hermes collaboration,performed with the herschel observatory spire multi-wavelength camera, toestimate the low-redshift, $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.5$, monochromatic luminosity functions(lfs) of galaxies at 250, 350 and 500$\,\mu$m. spire flux densities were alsocombined with spitzer photometry and multi-wavelength archival data to performa complete sed fitting analysis of spire detected sources to calculate precisek-corrections, as well as the bolometric infrared (8-1000$\,\mu$m) luminosityfunctions and their low-$z$ evolution from a combination of statisticalestimators. integration of the latter prompted us to also compute the localluminosity density (lld) and the comoving star formation rate density (sfrd)for our sources, and to compare them with theoretical predictions of galaxyformation models. the luminosity functions show significant and rapidluminosity evolution already at low redshifts, $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.2$, with l$_{ir}^*\propto (1+z)^{6.0\pm0.4}$ and $\phi_{ir}^* \propto (1+z)^{-2.1\pm0.4}$,l$_{250}^* \propto (1+z)^{5.3\pm0.2}$ and $\phi_{250}^* \propto(1+z)^{-0.6\pm0.4}$ estimated using the ir bolometric and the 250$\,\mu$m lfsrespectively. converting our ir ld estimate into an sfrd assuming a standardsalpeter imf and including the unobscured contribution based on the uvdust-uncorrected emission from local galaxies, we estimate a sfrd scaling ofsfrd$_0+0.08 z$, where sfrd$_0\simeq (1.9\pm 0.03)\times 10^{-2}[\mathrm{m}_\odot\,\mathrm{mpc}^{-3}]$ is our total sfrd estimate at$z\sim0.02$.

astro-ph;0411196	mid-infrared luminosity as an indicator of the total infrared luminosity  of galaxies	the infrared (ir) emission plays a crucial role for understanding the starformation in galaxies hidden by dust. we first examined four estimators of their luminosity of galaxies, l_fir (helou et al. 1988), l_tir (dale et al. 2001),revised version of l_tir (dale &amp; helou 2002) (we denote l_tir2), and l_ir(sanders &amp; mirabel 1996) by using the observed seds of well-known galaxies. wefound that l_ir provides excellent estimates of the total ir luminosity for avariety of galaxy seds. the performance of l_tir2 was also found to be verygood. using l_ir, we then statistically analyzed the iras pscz galaxy sample(saunders et al. 2000) and found useful formulae relating the mir monochromaticluminosities [l(12um) and l(25um)], and l_ir. for this purpose we constructed asubsample of 1420 galaxies with all iras four band (12, 25, 60, and 100um) fluxdensities. we found linear relations between l_ir and mir luminosities, l(12um)and l(25um). the prediction error with 95-% confidence level is a factor of4-5. hence, these formulae are useful for the estimation of the total irluminosity only from 12um or 25um observations. we further tried to make an`interpolation' formula for galaxies at 0&lt;z&lt;1. for this purpose we constructthe formula of the relation between 15-um luminosity and the total irluminosity. we conclude that the 15-um formula can be used as an estimator ofthe total ir luminosity from 24um observation of galaxies at z \simeq 0.6.

astro-ph;0411390	galex uv spectroscopy and deep imaging of lirgs in the elais s1 field	the elais s1 field was observed by galex in both its wide spectroscopic anddeep imaging survey modes. this field was previously observed by the infraredspace observatory and we made use of the catalogue of multi-wavelength datapublished by the elais consortium to select galaxies common to the two samples.among the 959 objects with galex spectroscopy, 88 are present in the elaiscatalog and 19 are galaxies with an optical spectroscopic redshift. thedistribution of redshifts covers the range $0&lt;z&lt;1.6$. the selected galaxieshave bolometric ir luminosities $10&lt;log(l_{ir})&lt;13$ (deduced from the $15 \mum$ flux using isocam) which means that we cover a wide range of galaxies fromnormal to ultra luminous ir galaxies. the mean ($\sigma$) uv luminosity (notcorrected for extinction) amounts to $log(\lambda.l_{1530}) = 9.8 (0.6)$$l_\sun$ for the low-z ($z \le 0.35$) sample. the uv slope $\beta$ (assuming$f_\lambda \propto \lambda^\beta$) correlates with the galex fuv-nuv color ifthe sample is restricted to galaxies below $z &lt; 0.1$. taking advantage of theuv and ir data, we estimate the dust attenuation from the ir/uv ratio andcompare it to the uv slope $\beta$. we find that it is not possible to uniquelyestimate the dust attenuation from $\beta$ for our sample of galaxies. thesegalaxies are highly extinguished with a median value $a_{fuv} = 2.7 \pm 0.8$.once the dust correction applied, the uv- and ir-based sfrs correlate. for theclosest galaxy with the best quality spectrum, we see a feature consistent withbeing produced by a bump near 220nm in the attenuation curve.

astro-ph;0502040	galex uv observations of the interacting galaxy ngc 4438 in the virgo  cluster	we present galex nuv (2310 a) and fuv (1530 a) images of the interactinggalaxy ngc 4438 (arp 120) in the center of the virgo cluster. these images showan extended (20 kpc) tidal tail at the north-west edge of the galaxy previouslyundetected at other wavelengths, at 15-25 kpc from its nucleus. except in thenucleus, the uv morphology of ngc 4438 is totally different from thehalpha+[nii] one, more similar to the x-ray emission, confirming its gascooling origin. we study the star formation history of ngc 4438 combiningspectro-photometric data in the uv-visible-near-ir wavelength range withpopulation synthesis and galaxy evolution models. the data are consistent witha recent (~ 10 myr), instantaneous burst of star formation in the newlydiscovered uv north-western tail which is significantly younger than the age ofthe tidal interaction with ngc 4435, dated by dynamical models at ~ 100 myrago. recent star formation events are also present at the edge of the northernarm and in the southern tail, while totally lacking in the other regions, whichare dominated by the old stellar population perturbed during the dynamicalinteraction with ngc 4435. the contribution of this recent starburst to thetotal galaxy stellar mass is lower than 0.1%, an extremely low value for such aviolent interaction. high-velocity, off-center tidal encounters such as thatobserved in arp 120 are thus not sufficient to significantly increase the starformation activity of cluster galaxies.

astro-ph;0510165	uv dust attenuation in normal star forming galaxies: i. estimating the  l_tir/l_fuv ratio	we analyze the dust attenuation properties of a volume-limited,optically-selected sample of normal star forming galaxies in nearby clusters asobserved by galex. the internal attenuation is estimated using threeindependent indicators, namely: the ratio of the total infrared tofar-ultraviolet emission, the ultraviolet spectral slope beta and the balmerdecrement. we confirm that normal galaxies follow a l_tir/l_fuv-beta relationoffset from the one observed for starburst galaxies. this offset is found toweakly correlate with the birthrate parameter, thus with the galaxy starformation history. we study the correlations of dust attenuation with otherglobal properties, such as the metallicity, dynamical mass, ionized gasattenuation, halpha emission and mass surface density. metal-rich, massivegalaxies are, as expected, more heavily extinguished in the uv than are smallsystems. for the same gas metallicity normal galaxies have lower l_tir/l_fuvratio than starbursts, in agreement with the difference observed in thel_tir/l_fuv-beta relation. unexpectedly we find however that normal starforming galaxies follow exactly the same relationship between metallicity andultraviolet spectral slope beta determined for starbursts, complicating ourunderstanding of dust properties. this result might indicate a different dustgeometry between normal galaxies and starbursts, but it could also be due toaperture effects eventually present in the iue starbursts dataset. the presentmultiwavelength study allows us to provide some empirical relations from whichthe total infrared to far ultraviolet ratio (l_tir/l_fuv) can be estimated whenfar infrared data are absent.

astro-ph;0601123	ultraviolet-to-far infrared properties of lyman break galaxies and  luminous infrared galaxies at z ~ 1	we present the first large, unbiased sample of lyman break galaxies (lbgs) atz ~ 1. far ultraviolet-dropout (1530 a) galaxies in the chandra deep fieldsouth have been selected using galex data. this first large sample in the z ~ 1universe provides us with a high quality reference sample of lbgs. we analyzedthe sample from the uv to the ir using galex, spitzer, eso and hst data. themorphology (obtained from goods data) of 75 % of our lbgs is consistent with adisk. the vast majority of lbgs with an ir detection are also luminous infraredgalaxies (lirgs). as a class, the galaxies not detected at 24 microns are anorder of magnitude fainter relative to the uv compared with those detectedindividually, suggesting that there may be two types of behavior within thesample. for the ir-bright galaxies, there is an apparent upper limit for the uvdust attenuation and this upper limit is anti-correlated with the observed uvluminosity. previous estimates of dust attenuations based on the ultravioletslope are compared to new ones based on the fir/uv ratio (for lbgs detected at24 microns), which is usually a more reliable estimator. depending on thecalibration we use to estimate the total ir luminosity, beta-based attenuationsa_{fuv} are larger by 0.2 to 0.6 mag. than the ones estimated from fir/uvratio. finally, for ir-bright lbgs, median estimated beta-based sfrs are 2-3times larger than the total sfrs estimated as sfr_{tot} = sfr_{uv} + sfr_{ir}while ir-based sfrs provide values below sfr_{tot} by 15 - 20 %. we use astacking method to statistically constrain the 24 microns flux of lbgs nonindividually detected. the results suggest that these lbgs do not contain largeamounts of dust.

astro-ph;0601235	star formation in the nearby universe: the ultraviolet and infrared  points of view	this work presents the main ultraviolet (uv) and far-infrared (fir)properties of two samples of nearby galaxies selected from the galex ($\lambda= 2315$\aa, hereafter nuv) and iras ($\lambda = 60\mu$m) surveys respectively.they are built in order to get detection at both wavelengths for most of thegalaxies. star formation rate (sfr) estimators based on the uv and firemissions are compared. systematic differences are found between the sfrestimators for individual galaxies based on the nuv fluxes corrected for dustattenuation and on the total ir luminosity. a combined estimator based on nuvand ir luminosities seems to be the best proxy over the whole range of valuesof sfr. although both samples present similar average values of the birthrateparameter b, their star-formation-related properties are substantiallydifferent: nuv-selected galaxies tend to show larger values of $b$ for lowermasses, sfrs and dust attenuations, supporting previous scenarios for the starformation history (sfh). conversely, about 20% of the fir-selected galaxiesshow high values of $b$, sfr and nuv attenuation. these galaxies, most of thembeing lirgs and ulirgs, break down the downsizing picture for the sfh, howevertheir relative contribution per unit volume is small in the local universe.finally, the cosmic sfr density of the local universe is estimated in aconsistent way from the nuv and ir luminosities.

astro-ph;0604010	galaxy luminosity function per morphological type up to z=1.2	we have computed the evolution of the rest-frame b-band luminosity function(lf) for bulge and disk-dominated galaxies since z=1.2. we use a sample of 605spectroscopic redshifts with i_{ab}&lt;24 in the chandra deep field south from thevimos-vlt deep survey, 3555 galaxies with photometric redshifts from thecombo-17 multi-color data, coupled with multi-color hst/acs images from thegreat observatories origin deep survey. we split the sample in bulge- anddisk-dominated populations on the basis of asymmetry and concentrationparameters measured in the rest-frame b-band. we find that at z=0.4-0.8, the lfslope is significantly steeper for the disk-dominated population (\alpha=-1.19\pm 0.07) compared to the bulge-dominated population (\alpha=-0.53 \pm 0.13).the lf of the bulge-dominated population is composed of two distinctpopulations separated in rest-frame color: 68% of red (b-i)_{ab}&gt;0.9 and brightgalaxies showing a strongly decreasing lf slope \alpha=+0.55 \pm 0.21, and 32%of blue (b-i)_{ab}&lt;0.9 and more compact galaxies which populate the lffaint-end. we observe that red bulge-dominated galaxies are already well inplace at z~1, but the volume density of this population is increasing by afactor 2.7 between z~1 and z~0.6. it may be related to the building-up ofmassive elliptical galaxies in the hierarchical scenario. in addition, weobserve that the blue bulge-dominated population is dimming by 0.7 magnitudebetween z~1 and z~0.6. galaxies in this faint and more compact population couldpossibly be the progenitors of the local dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

astro-ph;0609020	the fate of spiral galaxies in clusters: the star formation history of  the anemic virgo cluster galaxy ngc 4569	we present a new method for studying the star formation history of late-type,cluster galaxies undergoing gas starvation or a ram-pressure stripping event bycombining bidimensional multifrequency observations with multi-zones models ofgalactic chemical and spectrophotometricevolution. this method is applied tothe virgo cluster anemic galaxy ngc 4569. we extract radial profiles fromrecently obtained uv galex images at 1530 and 2310 a, from visible and near-irnarrow (halpha) and broad band images at different wavelengths (u, b, g, v, r,i, z, j, h, k), from spitzer irac and mips images and from atomic and moleculargas maps. the model in the absence of interaction (characterized by itsrotation velocity and spin parameter) is constrained by the unperturbed h bandlight profile and by the halpha rotation curve. we can reconstruct the observedtotal-gas radial-density profile and the light surface-brightness profiles atall wavelengths in a ram-pressure stripping scenario by making simpleassumptions about the gas removal process and the orbit of ngc 4569 inside thecluster. the observed profiles cannot be reproduced by simply stopping gasinfall, thus mimicing starvation. gas removal is required, which is moreefficient in the outer disk, inducing a radial quenching in the star formationactivity, as observed and reproduced by the model. this observational result,consistent with theoretical predictions that a galaxy-cluster igm interactionis able to modify structural disk parameters without gravitationalperturbations, is discussed in the framework of the origin of lenticulars inclusters.

astro-ph;0609738	the local universe as seen in far-infrared and in far-ultraviolet: a  global point of view on the local recent star formation	we select far-infrared (fir-60 microns) and far-ultraviolet (fuv-1530 a)samples of nearby galaxies in order to discuss the biases encountered bymonochromatic surveys (fir or fuv). very different volumes are sampled by eachselection and much care is taken to apply volume corrections to all theanalyses. the distributions of the bolometric luminosity of young stars arecompared for both samples: they are found to be consistent with each other forgalaxies of intermediate luminosities but some differences are found for high(&gt;5 10^{10} l_sun) luminosities. the shallowness of the iras survey prevents usfrom securing comparison at low luminosities (&lt;2 10^9 l_sun). the ratio of thetotal infrared (tir) luminosity to the fuv luminosity is found to increase withthe bolometric luminosity in a similar way for both samples up to 5 10^{10}l_sun. brighter galaxies are found to have a different behavior according totheir selection: the l_tir/l_fuv ratio of the fuv-selected galaxies brighterthan 5 10^{10} l_sun reaches a plateau whereas l_tir/l_fuv continues toincrease with the luminosity of bright galaxies selected in fir. thevolume-averaged specific star formation rate (sfr per unit galaxy stellar mass,ssfr) is found to decrease toward massive galaxies within each selection. thessfr is found to be larger than that measured for optical and nir-selectedsample over the whole mass range for the fir selection, and for masses largerthan 10^{10} m_sun for the fuv selection. luminous and massive galaxiesselected in fir appear as active as galaxies with similar characteristicsdetected at z ~ 0.7.

astro-ph;0610688	an ultraviolet-to-radio broadband spectral atlas of nearby galaxies	the ultraviolet-to-radio continuum spectral energy distributions arepresented for all 75 galaxies in the spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey(sings). a principal component analysis of the sample shows that most of thesample's spectral variations stem from two underlying components, onerepresentative of a galaxy with a low infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio and onerepresentative of a galaxy with a high infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio. theinfluence of several parameters on the infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio is studied(e.g., optical morphology, disk inclination, far-infrared color, ultravioletspectral slope, and star formation history). consistent with our understandingof normal star-forming galaxies, the sings sample of galaxies in comparison tomore actively star-forming galaxies exhibits a larger dispersion in theinfrared-to-ultraviolet versus ultraviolet spectral slope correlation. earlytype galaxies, exhibiting low star formation rates and high optical surfacebrightnesses, have the most discrepant infrared-to-ultraviolet correlation.these results suggest that the star formation history may be the dominantregulator of the broadband spectral variations between galaxies. finally, a newdiscovery shows that the 24 micron morphology can be a useful tool forparametrizing the global dust temperature and ultraviolet extinction in nearbygalaxies. the dust emission in dwarf/irregular galaxies is clumpy and warmaccompanied by low ultraviolet extinction, while in spiral galaxies there istypically a much larger diffuse component of cooler dust and averageultraviolet extinction. for galaxies with nuclear 24 micron emission, the dusttemperature and ultraviolet extinction are relatively high compared to diskgalaxies.

astro-ph;0703014	the ultraviolet properties of luminous infrared galaxies at z ~ 0.7: is  there any evolution in their dust attenuation?	the tir and fuv luminosity functions of galaxies and the related luminositydensities rho(tir) and rho(fuv) are known to evolve from z=0 to z~1 but with adifferent rate: the galaxy populations appear brighter in the past at bothwavelengths but the evolution in tir is larger than in fuv. it leads to anincrease of the ratio of tir to fuv luminosity densities rho(tir)/rho(fuv)which can be interpreted as a global increase of the dust attenuation from z=0to z~1. our aim is to understand the origin of this increase. we focus oninfrared galaxies with l(tir&gt;10^{11} lsun at z~0.7 observed by spitzer/mips andwe measure their uv emission at 2310 a from galex. these luminous infraredgalaxies (lirgs) represent the bulk of the tir luminosity density atintermediate redshift. some evolution of l(tir)/l(fuv) and therefore of dustattenuation is found for these galaxies: lirgs at z=0.7 span a larger range ofl(tir)/l(fuv) ratios than at z=0 and their mean dust attenuation at fuv isfound ~0.5 mag lower than for their local counterparts. the decrease of dustattenuation is found lower than that reported in other studies for brightgalaxies selected in uv rest-frame at z=1 and 2. from a semi-quantitativeanalysis we find that the slight decrease of dust attenuation for lirgs atz=0.7 remains consistent with the increase of rho(tir)/rho(fuv) with redshift.

0706.0810	lyman break galaxies at z~1 and the evolution of the dust attenuation in  star-forming galaxies with the redshift	ultraviolet (uv) galaxies have been selected from galex. the presence of afuv-dropout in their spectral energy distributions proved to be a very complete(83.3%) but not very efficient (21.4%) tool for identifying lyman breakgalaxies (lbgs) at z~1. we divide the lbg sample into two sub-classes: red lbgs(rlbgs) detected at 24 micron which are mainly luminous ir galaxies (lirgs) andblue lbgs (blbgs) undetected at 24 microns down to 83 microjy. two of the rlbgsare also detected at 70 micron. the median sed of the rlbgs is similar (abovelambda~1 micron) to the dusty starburst hr10. however, unlike local (u)lirgs,rlbgs are uv bright objects. we suggest that these objects contain a largeamount of dust but that some bare stellar populations are also directlyvisible. the median sed of the blbgs is consistent with their containing thesame stellar population as the rlbgs but with a lower dust content. theluminosity function of our lbg sample at z~1 is similar to the luminosityfunction of nuv-selected galaxies at the same redshift. the integratedluminosity densities of z~1 lbgs and nuv-selected galaxies are very consistent.we show that star formation rates (sfrs) estimated from uv measurements andcorrected using the irx-beta method provide average total sfr_tot in agreementwith sfr_uv + sfr_dust. however, irx-beta-based sfr_tot shows a largedispersion. summing up the detected uv (1150a rest-frame) and ir-based starformation rates of the detected objects, we find that only one third of thetotal (i.e. uv + dust) lbg sfr resides in blbgs and two thirds in rlbgs, eventhough most lbgs at z~1 are blbgs. on the other hand, the total sfr of lbgsaccounts for only 11% of the total sfr at z~1. finally, we observe a regulardecrease of l_tir / l_fuv from z=0 to z~2 for uv-selected samples.
