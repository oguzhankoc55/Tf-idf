0904.3318	a relativistically smeared spectrum in the neutron star x-ray binary 4u  1705-44: looking at the inner accretion disc with x-ray spectroscopy	iron emission lines at 6.4-6.97 kev, identified with fluorescent kalphatransitions, are among the strongest discrete features in the x-ray band. theseare therefore one of the most powerful probes to infer the properties of theplasma in the innermost part of the accretion disc around a compact object. inthis paper we present a recent xmm observation of the x-ray burster 4u 1705-44,where we clearly detect a relativistically smeared iron line at about 6.7 kev,testifying with high statistical significance that the line profile isdistorted by high velocity motion in the accretion disc. as expected from discreflection models, we also find a significant absorption edge at about 8.3 kev;this feature appears to be smeared, and is compatible with being produced inthe same region where the iron line is produced. from the line profile wederive the physical parameters of the inner accretion disc with largeprecision. the line is identified with the kalpha transition of highly ionisediron, fe xxv, the inner disc radius is rin = (14 \pm 2) r_g (where r_g is thegravitational radius, gm/c^2), the emissivity dependence from the disc radiusis r^{-2.27 \pm 0.08}, the inclination angle with respect to the line of sightis i = (39 \pm 1) degrees. finally, the xmm spectrum shows evidences of otherlow-energy emission lines, which again appear broad and their profiles arecompatible with being produced in the same region where the iron line isproduced.

0908.2387	role of emission angular directionality in spin determination of  accreting black holes with broad iron line	spin of an accreting black hole can be determined by spectroscopy of theemission and absorption features produced in the inner regions of an accretiondisc. we discuss the method employing the relativistic line profiles of iron inthe x-ray domain, where the emergent spectrum is blurred by generalrelativistic effects. precision of spectra fitting procedure could becompromised by inappropriate account of the angular distribution of the discemission. often a unique profile is assumed, invariable over the entire rangeof radii in the disc and energy in the spectral band. we study how sensitivethe spin determination is to the assumptions about the intrinsic angulardistribution of the emitted photons. we find that the uncertainty of thedirectional emission distribution translates to 20% uncertainty indetermination of the marginally stable orbit. by assuming a rotating black holein the centre of an accretion disc, we perform radiation transfer computationsof an x-ray irradiated disc atmosphere to determine the directionality ofoutgoing x-rays in the 2-10 kev energy band. we implemented the simulationresults as a new extension to the ky software package for x-ray spectra fittingof relativistic accretion disc models. although the parameter space is rathercomplex, leading to a rich variety of possible outcomes, we find that onaverage the isotropic directionality reproduces our model data to the bestprecision. our results also suggest that an improper usage of limb darkeningcan partly mimic a steeper profile of radial emissivity. we demonstrate theseresults on the case of xmm-newton observation of the seyfert galaxymcg-6-30-15, for which we construct confidence levels of chi squaredstatistics, and on the simulated data for the future x-ray ixo mission.

0911.4659	near infrared flares of sagittarius a*: importance of near infrared  polarimetry	we report on the results of new simulations of near-infrared (nir)observations of the sagittarius a* (sgr a*) counterpart associated with thesuper-massive black hole at the galactic center. the observations have beencarried out using the naco adaptive optics (ao) instrument at the europeansouthern observatory's very large telescope and ciao nir camera on the subarutelescope (13 june 2004, 30 july 2005, 1 june 2006, 15 may 2007, 17 may 2007and 28 may 2008). we used a model of synchrotron emission from relativisticelectrons in the inner parts of an accretion disk. the relativistic simulationshave been carried out using the karas-yaqoob (ky) ray-tracing code. we probethe existence of a correlation between the modulations of the observed fluxdensity light curves and changes in polarimetric data. furthermore, we confirmthat the same correlation is also predicted by the hot spot model. correlationsbetween intensity and polarimetric parameters of the observed light curves aswell as a comparison of predicted and observed light curve features through apattern recognition algorithm result in the detection of a signature oforbiting matter under the influence of strong gravity. this pattern is detectedstatistically significant against randomly polarized red noise. expectedresults from future observations of vlt interferometry like gravity experimentare also discussed.

1004.1963	a self-consistent approach to the hard and soft states of 4u 1705-44	we analyzed two xmm-newton observations of the bright atoll source 4u1705-44, which can be considered a prototype of the class of the persistent nslmxbs showing both hard and soft states. the first observation was performedwhen the source was in a hard low flux state, the second during a soft,high-flux state. both the spectra show broad iron emission lines. we fit thespectra using a two-component model, together with a reflection modelspecifically suited to the case of a neutron star, where the incident spectrumhas a blackbody shape. in the soft state, the reflection model, convolved witha relativistic smearing component, consistently describes the broad featurespresent in the spectrum, and we find a clear relation between the temperatureof the incident flux and the temperature of the harder x-ray component that weinterpret as the boundary layer emission. in this state we find convergingevidence that the boundary layer outer radius is ~ 2 times the neutron starradius. in the low flux state, we observe a change in the continuum shape ofthe spectrum with respect to the soft state. still, the broad local emissionfeatures can be associated with a disk reflecting matter, but in a lowerionization state, and possibly produced in an accretion disk truncated atgreater distance. our analysis provides strong evidence that the reflectioncomponent in soft states of lmxbs comes from to hard x-ray thermal irradiation,which we identify with the boundary layer emission, also present in thecontinuum model. in the hard state, the broad iron line if also produced byreflection, and the continuum disk emission can be self-consistently accountedif the disk is truncated at a greater distance than the soft state.

0708.2637	on the orientation of the sagittarius a* system	the near-infrared emission from the black hole at the galactic center (sgra*) has unique properties. the most striking feature is a suggestive periodicsub-structure that has been observed in a couple of flares so far. usingnear-infrared polarimetric observations and modelling the quasi-periodicity interms of an orbiting blob, we try to constrain the three dimensionalorientation of the sgr a* system. we report on so far unpublished polarimetricdata from 2003. they support the observations of a roughly constant meanpolarization angle of 60 degr \pm 20 degr from 2004-2006. prior investigationsof the 2006 data are deepened. in particular, the blob model fits are evaluatedsuch that constraints on the position angle of sgr a* can be derived.confidence contours in the position-inclination angle plane are derived. on a3sigma level the position angle of the equatorial plane normal is in the range60 degr - 108 degr (east of north) in combination with a large inclinationangle. this agrees well with recent independent work in which radiospectral/morphological properties of sgr a* and x-ray observations,respectively, have been used. however, the quality of the presently availabledata and the uncertainties in our model bring some ambiguity to ourconclusions.

0709.1356	iron lines from transient and persisting hot spots on agn accretion  disks	[abridged] we model the x-ray reprocessing from a strong co-rotating flareabove an accretion disk in active galactic nuclei. we explore the horizontalstructure and evolution of the underlying hot spot. to obtain the spectralevolution seen by a distant observer, we apply a general relativity ray-tracingtechnique. we concentrate on the energy band around the iron k-line, where therelativistic effects are most pronounced. persistent flares lasting for asignificant fraction of the orbital time scale and short, transient flares areconsidered. in our time-resolved analysis, the spectra recorded by a distantobserver depend on the position of the flare/spot with respect to the centralblack hole. if the flare duration significantly exceeds the light travel timeacross the spot, then the spot horizontal stratification is unimportant. on theother hand, if the flare duration is comparable to the light travel time acrossthe spot radius, the lightcurves exhibit a typical asymmetry in their timeprofiles. the sequence of dynamical spectra proceeds from more strongly to lessstrongly ionized re-emission. at all locations within the spot the spectralintensity increases towards edge-on emission angles, revealing the limbbrightening effect. future x-ray observatories with significantly largereffective collecting areas will enable to spectroscopically map out theazimuthal irradiation structure of the accretion disk and to localizepersistent flares. if the hot spot is not located too close to the marginallystable orbit of the black hole, it will be possible to probe the reflectingmedium via the sub-structure of the iron k-line. indications for transientflares will only be obtained from analyzing the observed lightcurves on thegravitational time scale of the accreting supermassive black hole.

1102.0775	near-infrared polarimetry as a tool for testing properties of accreting  super-massive black holes	several massive black holes exhibit flux variability on time scales thatcorrespond to source sizes of the order of few schwarzschild radii. we surveythe potential of near-infrared and x-ray polarimetry to constrain physicalproperties of such black hole systems, namely their spin and inclination. wehave focused on a model where an orbiting hot spot is embedded in an accretiondisk. a new method of searching for the time-lag between orthogonalpolarization channels is developed and applied to an ensemble of hot spotmodels that samples a wide range of parameter space. we found that the hot spotmodel predicts signatures in polarized light which are in the range to bemeasured directly in the near future. however, our estimations are predictedupon the assumption of a keplerian velocity distribution inside the flow wherethe dominant part of the magnetic field is toroidal. we also found that if theright model of the accretion flow can be chosen for each source (e.g. on thebasis of magnetohydrodynamics simulations) then the black hole spin andinclination can be constrained to a small two-dimensional area in thespin-inclination space. the results of the application of the method to theavailable near-infrared polarimetric data of sagittarius a* (sgr a*) ispresented. it is shown that even with the currently available data the spin andinclination of sgr a* can be constrained. next generations of near-infrared andx-ray polarimeters should be able to exploit this tool.

1102.4247	light bending scenario for accreting black holes in x-ray polarimetry	we discuss a model of an x-ray illuminating source above an accretion disk ofa rotating black hole. within the so called lamp-post scheme we compute theexpected (observed) polarization properties of the radiation reaching anobserver. we explore the dependencies on model parameters, employing montecarlo radiation transfer computations of the x-ray reflection on the accretiondisk and taking general relativity effects into account. in particular, wediscuss the role of the black hole spin, of the observer viewing angle, and ofthe primary x-ray source distance from the black hole. we give several examplesof the resulting polarization degree for two types of exemplary objects -active galactic nuclei and galactic black holes. in order to assess potentialobservability of the polarization features, we assume the sensitivity of theproposed new hard x-ray mission (nhxm).  we examine the energy range from several kev to ~50 kev, so the iron-linecomplex and the compton hump are included in our model spectra. we find theresultant polarization degree to increase at the higher end of the studiedenergy band, i.e. at &gt;~20 kev. thus, the best results for polarimetry ofreflection spectra should be achieved at the compton hump energy region. wealso obtain higher polarization degree for large spin values of the black hole,small heights of the primary source, and low inclination angles of theobserver.

1104.4181	the flare model for x-ray variability of ngc 4258	we study the variability mechanism of active galactic nuclei (agn) within theframework of the flare model. to this end we examine the case of seyfert/linergalaxy ngc 4258, which is observed at high inclination angle and exhibits rapidfluctuations of the x-ray light curve. we construct a model light curve basedon the assumption of magnetic flares localized in the equatorial plane andorbiting with keplerian speed at each given radius. we calculate the level ofvariability as a function of the inclination of an observer, taking intoaccount all effects of general relativity near a rotating supermassive blackhole. the variability level is a monotonic function of the source inclination.it rises more rapidly for larger values of the black hole spin (kerr parameter)and for steeper emissivity (index beta of the radial profile). we compare theexpected level of variability for the viewing angle 81.6 deg, as inferred forngc 4258, with the case of moderate viewing angles about 30 deg, typical forseyfert type-1 galaxies. highly inclined sources such as this one areparticularly suitable to test the flare model because the effects of orbitalmotion, doppler boosting and light bending are all expected to have maximumwhen the accretion disk is seen almost edge-on. the model is consistent withthe ngc 4258 variability, where the obscuring material is thought to belocalized mainly towards the equatorial plane rather than forming ageometrically thick torus. once the intrinsic time-scales of the flare durationare determined to better precision, this kind of highly inclined objects with aprecisely known mass of the black hole can be used to set independentconstraints on the spin parameter.

0709.3836	flares from spiral waves by lensing and time-delay amplification?	episodically accreting black holes are thought to produce flares when a chunkof particles is accelerated to high velocity near the black hole horizon. thisalso seems to be the case of sagittarius a* in the galactic center, where thebroad-band radiation is produced, likely via the synchrotron self-comptonmechanism. it has been proposed that strong-field gravitational lensingmagnifies the flares. the effect of lensing is generally weak and requires afine-tuned geometrical arrangement, which occurs with only a low probability.however, there are several aspects that make sagittarius a* a promising targetto reveal strong gravity effects. unlike type ii (obscured) active galaxies,chances are that a flare is detected at high inclination, which would befavourable for lensing. time delays can then significantly influence theobserved flare duration and the form of light-curve profiles. here we discussan idea that the impact of lensing amplification should be considerablyenhanced when the shape of the flaring clump is appropriately elongated in theform of a spiral wave or a narrow filament, rather than a simple (circular)spot which we employed previously within the phenomenological `orbiting spotmodel'. by parameterizing the emission region in terms of the spiral shape andcontrast, we are able to extend the spot model to more complicated sources. inthe case of spirals, we notice a possibility that more photons reach a distantobserver at the same moment because of interplay between lensing andlight-travel time. the effect is not symmetrical with respect to leading versustrailing spirals, so in principle the source geometry can be constrained. inspite of this, the spot model seems to provide entirely adequate framework tostudy the currently available data.

0704.2781	enhanced activity of massive black holes by stellar capture assisted by  a self-gravitating accretion disc	we study the probability of close encounters between stars from a nuclearcluster and a massive black hole. the gravitational field of the system isdominated by the black hole in its sphere of influence. it is further modifiedby the cluster mean field (a spherical term) and a gaseous disc/torus (anaxially symmetric term) causing a secular evolution of stellar orbits via kozaioscillations. intermittent phases of large eccentricity increase the chancethat stars become damaged inside the tidal radius of the central hole. suchevents can produce debris and lead to recurring episodes of enhanced accretionactivity. we introduce an effective loss cone and associate it with tidaldisruptions during the high-eccentricity phases of the kozai cycle. bynumerical integration of the trajectories forming the boundary of the loss conewe determine its shape and volume. we also include the effect of relativisticadvance of pericentre. the potential of the disc has the efffect of enlargingthe loss cone and, therefore, the predicted number of tidally disrupted starsshould grow by factor of ~10^2. on the other hand, the effect of the clustermean potential together with the relativistic pericentre advance act againstthe eccentricity oscillations. in the end we expect the tidal disruption eventsto be approximately ten times more frequent in comparison with the model inwhich the three effects -- the cluster mean field, the relativistic pericentreadvance, and the kozai mechanism -- are all ignored. the competition ofdifferent influences suppresses the predicted star disruption rate as the blackhole mass increases. hence, the process under consideration is more importantfor intermediate-mass black holes, m_bh~10^4m_s.

1108.0545	black hole accretion rings revealed by future x-ray spectroscopy	spectral features can arise by reflection of coronal x-rays on a black holeaccretion disc. the resulting profile bears various imprints of stronggravitational field acting on the light emitting gas. the observed shape of thereflection line is formed by integrating contributions over a range of radiiacross the accretion disc plane, where the individual photons experiencedifferent level of energy shifts, boosting, and amplification by relativisticeffects. these have to be convolved with the intrinsic emissivity of the line,which is a function of radius and the emission angle in the local frame. westudy if the currently discussed instruments on-board x-ray satellites will beable to reveal the departure of the line radial emissivity from a simple smoothpower-law function, which is often assumed in data fitting and interpretation.such a departure can be a result of excess emission occurring at a certaindistance. this could be used to study variations with radius of the lineproduction or to constrain the position of the inner edge of the accretiondisc. by simulating artificial data from a bright active galactic nucleus of atype-1 seyfert galaxy (inclination ~ 30 deg, x-ray flux 1-2 mcrab in kev energyband) we show that the required sensitivity and energy resolution could bereached with large area detector of the proposed loft mission. galactic blackholes will provide another category of potentially suitable targets if therelativistic spectral features are indeed produced by reflection from theiraccretion discs.

1201.0009	influence of frame-dragging on magnetic null points near rotating black  hole	understanding the mechanisms of particle acceleration from the vicinity ofblack holes poses a challenge. electromagnetic effects are thought to be aprime suspect, but details still need an explanation. to this end, we study athree-dimensional structure of oblique magnetic fields near a rotating blackhole in vacuum. it has been proposed that such a set-up can lead to efficientacceleration when plasma is injected near a magnetic null point. we focus ourattention especially on the magnetic field in the immediate neighborhood of themagnetic null point, which was previously shown to occur in the equatorialplane. by employing the line-integral-convolution (lic) method, we visualizethe magnetic field lines and explore the electric lines rising out of theequatorial plane. we show the magnetic field structure near the boundary ofergosphere, depending on the spin of the black hole. electric field develops anon-vanishing component passing through the magnetic null point and ensuringefficient acceleration of charged particles from this particular location nearhorizon. we also examine the effect of translatory boost on the field lines.similarly to the frame-dragging by rotation, the linear motion carries fieldlines along with the black hole. position of the magnetic null point recedesfrom the black hole horizon as the spin parameter increases. for the extremevalue of a=1 the null point can occur outside the ergosphere.

1401.4468	power density spectra of modes of orbital motion in strongly curved  spacetime: obtaining the observable signal	high frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (hf qpos) appear in the x-rayvariability of several accreting low-mass binaries. in a series of works it wassuggested that these qpos may have connection to inhomogeneities orbiting closeto an inner edge of the accretion disc. in this paper we explore the appearanceof an observable signal generated by small radiating circular hot spots movingalong quasi-elliptic trajectories close to the innermost stable circular orbitin the schwarzschild spacetime. our consideration takes into account thecapabilities of observatories that have been operating in the past two decadesrepresented by the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte) and the proposed futureinstruments represented by the large observatory for x-ray timing (loft). forthese purposes we choose such model parameters that lead to lightcurvescomparable to those observed in galactic black hole sources, in particular themicroquasar grs 1915+105. we find that when a weak signal corresponding to thehot-spot keplerian frequency is around the limits of the rxte detectability,the loft observations can clearly reveal its first and second harmonics.moreover, in some specific situations the radial epicyclic frequency of thespot can be detected as well. finally, we also compare the signal produced bythe spots to the signal produced by axisymmetric epicyclic disc-oscillationmodes and discuss the key differences that could be identified via the proposedfuture technology. we conclude that the ability to recognize the harmoniccontent of the signal can help to distinguish between the different proposedphysical models.

1404.5495	inducing chaos by breaking axial symmetry in a black hole magnetosphere	while the motion of particles near a rotating, electrically-neutral (kerr),and charged (kerr--newman) black hole is always strictly regular, aperturbation in the gravitational or the electromagnetic field generally leadsto chaos. the transition from regular to chaotic dynamics is relatively gradualif the system preserves axial symmetry, whereas non-axisymmetry induces chaosmore efficiently. here we study the development of chaos in an oblique(electro-vacuum) magnetosphere of a magnetized black hole. besides the stronggravity of the massive source represented by the kerr metric we consider thepresence of a weak, ordered, large-scale magnetic field. an axially-symmetricmodel consisting of a rotating black hole embedded in an aligned magnetic fieldis generalized by allowing an oblique direction of the field having a generalinclination, with respect to the rotation axis of the system. the inclinationof the field acts as an additional perturbation to the motion of chargedparticles as it breaks the axial symmetry of the system and cancels the relatedintegral of motion. the axial component of angular momentum is no longerconserved and the resulting system thus has three degrees of freedom. ourprimary concern within this contribution is to find out how sensitive thesystem of bound particles is to the inclination of the field. we employ themethod of the maximal lyapunov exponent to distinguish between regular andchaotic orbits and to quantify their chaoticity. we find that even a smallmisalignment induces chaotic motion.

1405.0898	prospects of 3d mapping of the galactic centre clouds with x-ray  polarimetry	despite past panchromatic observations of the innermost part of the milkyway, the overall structure of the galactic centre (gc) remains enigmatic interms of geometry. in this paper, we aim to show how polarimetry can probe thethree-dimensional position of the molecular material in the central ~100 pc ofthe gc. we investigate a model where the central supermassive black hole sgr a*is radiatively coupled to a fragmented circumnuclear disc (cnd), an ellipticaltwisted ring representative of the central molecular zone (cmz), and the twomain, bright molecular clouds sgr b2 and sgr c. 8 -- 35 kev integratedpolarization mapping reveals that sgr b2 and sgr c, situated at the two sidesof the cmz, present the highest polarization degrees (66.5 and 47.8 per centrespectively), both associated with a polarization position angle psi = 90deg(normal to the scattering plane). the cnd shows a lower polarization degree,1.0 per cent with psi = -20.5deg, tracing the inclination of the cnd withrespect to the galactic plane. the cmz polarization is spatially variable. wealso consider a range of spatial locations for sgr a* and the reprocessingmedia, and investigate how the modeled three-dimensional geometry influencesthe resulting gc polarization. the two reflection nebulae are found to alwaysproduce high polarization degrees (&gt;&gt; 10 per cent). we show that a 500 ksobservation with a broadband polarimeter could constrain the location and themorphology of the scattering material with respect to the emitting source,revealing the past activity of sgr a*.

1408.0354	probing the galactic center with x-ray polarimetry	the galactic center (gc) holds the closest-to-earth supermassive black hole(smbh), which makes it the best laboratory to study the close environment ofextremely massive compact objects. polarimetry is sensitive to geometry of thesource, which makes it a particularly suitable technique to probe the mediumsurrounding the gc smbh. the detection of hard x-ray spectra and prominent ironk$\alpha$ fluorescence features coincident with localized gas clouds (e.g.sgr~b2, sgr~c) is known for nearly twenty years now and is commonly associatedwith a past outburst of the smbh whose radiation is reprocessing onto theso-called "reflection nebulae". since scattering leads to polarization, there-emitted signal from the giant molecular clouds in the first 100~pc of the gcis expected to be polarized. x-ray polarization measurement is thusparticularly adapted to probe the origin of the diffuse x-ray emission from thegc reflection nebulae and reveal the past activity of the central smbh. in thisresearch note, we summarize the results from past and current polarimetricsimulations in order to show how a future x-ray polarimeter equipped withimaging detectors could improve our understanding of high-energy astrophysics.

1409.3746	tidal disruption events from a nuclear star cluster as possible origin  of transient relativistic spectral lines near smbh	we discuss a possibility that a tidal disruption event near a dormantsupermassive black hole (smbh) can give rise to spectral features of iron in6-7 kev x-ray signal: a relativistic line profile emerges from debrisilluminated and ionised by an intense flash produced from the destroyed star.this could provide a unique way to determine parameters of the system. weconsider a model where the nuclear stellar population acquires an oblate shape(i.e., a flattened distribution) in the inner region near a supermassive blackhole, and also the primary irradiation flare is expected to occur more likelynear the equatorial plane, co-planar with the infalling material. this suggeststhat the reprocessing of primary x-rays results in a transient profile thatshould be relevant for tidal-disruption events (tde) in otherwiseunder-luminous (inactive) galactic nuclei, i.e. with no prior accretion disc.resonance mechanisms of the stellar motion can increase the orbitaleccentricity for some stars in the nuclear cluster and help to bring them closeto the tidal radius, where they can give rise to tdes. the proposed scenarioappears to be distinguishably different from the standard scheme of lamp-postmodel for the origin of the relativistic line in active galaxies, where thesource is thought to be located predominantly near the symmetry axis.

1410.0397	conditions for the thermal instability in the galactic centre  mini-spiral region	we explore the conditions for the thermal instability to operate in themini-spiral region of the galactic centre (sgr a*), where both the hot and coldmedia are known to coexist. the photoionisation cloudy calculations areperformed for different physical states of plasma. we neglect the dynamics ofthe material and concentrate on the study of the parameter ranges where thethermal instability may operate, taking into account the past history of sgr a*bolometric luminosity. we show that the thermal instability does not operate atthe present very low level of the sgr a* activity. however, sgr a* was muchmore luminous in the past. for the highest luminosity states the two-phasemedium can be created up to 1.4 pc from the centre. the presence of dust grainstends to suppress the instability, but the dust is destroyed in the presence ofstrong radiation field and hot plasma. the clumpiness is thus induced in thehigh activity period, and the cooling/heating timescales are long enough topreserve later the past multi-phase structure. the instability enhances theclumpiness of the mini-spiral medium and creates a possibility of episodes ofenhanced accretion of cold clumps towards sgr a*. the mechanism determines therange of masses and sizes of clouds; under the conditions of sgr a*, the likelyvalues come out $1$ - $10^2m_{\oplus}$ for the cloud typical mass.

1411.0006	polarized light from sgr a* in the near-infrared $k_{s}$-band	we present a statistical analysis of polarized near-infrared (nir) light fromsgr a*, the radio source associated with the supermassive black hole at thecenter of the milky way. the observations have been carried out using theadaptive optics instrument naco at the vlt ut4 in the infrared$k_\mathrm{s}$-band from 2004 to 2012. several polarized flux excursions wereobserved during these years. linear polarization at 2.2 $\mu m$, its statisticsand time variation, can be used constrain the physical conditions of theaccretion process onto this supermassive black hole. with an exponent of about4 for the number density histogram of fluxes above 5~mjy, the distribution ofpolarized flux density is closely linked to the single state power-lawdistribution of the total $k_\mathrm{s}$-band flux densities reported earlier.we find typical polarization degrees of the order of 20\%$\pm$10\% and apreferred polarization angle of 13$^o$$\pm$15$^o$. simulations show theuncertainties under a total flux density of $\sim 2\,{\rm mjy}$ are probablydominated by observational effects. at higher flux densities there areintrinsic variations of polarization degree and angle within rather wellconstrained ranges. since the emission is most likely due to optically thinsynchrotron radiation, this preferred polarization angle we find is very likelycoupled to the intrinsic orientation of the sgr a* system i.e. a disk orjet/wind scenario associated with the super massive black hole. if they areindeed linked to structural features of the source the data imply a ratherstable geometry and accretion process for the sgr a* system.

1502.04894	reflection nebulae in the galactic center: the case for soft x-ray  imaging polarimetry	the origin of irradiation and fluorescence of the 6.4 kev bright giantmolecular clouds surrounding sgr a*, the central supermassive black hole of ourgalaxy, remains enigmatic. testing the theory of a past active period of sgr a*requires x-ray polarimetry. in this paper, we show how modern imagingpolarimeters could revolutionize our understanding of the galactic center.through monte carlo modeling, we produce a 4-8 kev polarization map of thegalactic center, focusing on the polarimetric signature produced by sgr b1, sgrb2, g0.11-0.11, bridge e, bridge d, bridge b2, mc2, mc1, sgr c3, sgr c2, andsgr c1. we estimate the resulting polarization, include polarized flux dilutionby the diffuse plasma emission detected toward the gc, and simulate thepolarization map that modern polarimetric detectors would obtain assuming theperformances of a mission prototype. the eleven reflection nebulae investigatedin this paper present a variety of polarization signatures, ranging from nearlyunpolarized to highly polarized (about 77%) fluxes. a major improvement in oursimulation is the addition of a diffuse, unpolarized plasma emission thatstrongly impacts soft x-ray polarized fluxes. the dilution factor is in therange 50% - 70%, making the observation of the bridge structure unlikely evenin the context of modern polarimetry. the best targets are the sgr b and sgr ccomplexes, and the g0.11-0.11 cloud. an exploratory observation of a fewhundred kilo-seconds of the sgr b complex would allow a significant detectionof the polarization and be sufficient to derive hints on the primary source ofradiation. a more ambitious program (few ms) of mapping the giant molecularclouds could then be carried out to probe with great precision the turbulenthistory of sgr a*, and place important constraints on the composition andthree-dimensional position of the surrounding gas.

0807.0224	hot-spot model for accretion disc variability as random process	theory of random processes provides an attractive mathematical tool todescribe the fluctuating signal from accreting sources, such as active galacticnuclei and galactic black holes observed in x-rays. these objects exhibitfeatureless variability on different timescales, probably originating from anaccretion disc. we study the basic features of the power spectra in terms of ageneral framework, which permits semi-analytical determination of the powerspectral density (psd) of the resulting light curve. we consider the expectedsignal generated by an ensemble of spots randomly created on the accretion discsurface. spot generation is governed by poisson or by hawkes processes. weinclude general relativity effects shaping the signal on its propagation to adistant observer. we analyse the psd of a spotted disc light curve and show theaccuracy of our semi-analytical approach by comparing the obtained psd with theresults of monte carlo simulations. the asymptotic slopes of psd are 0 at lowfrequencies and they drop to -2 at high frequencies, usually with a singlefrequency break. more complex two-peak solutions also occur. the amplitude ofthe peaks and their frequency difference depend on the inherent timescales ofthe model. at intermediate frequencies, the intrinsic psd is influenced by theindividual light curve profile as well as by the type of the underlyingprocess. however, even in cases when two lorentzians seem to dominate the psd,it does not necessarily imply that two single oscillation mechanisms operatesimultaneously. instead, it may well be the manifestation of the avalanchemechanism. the main advantage of our approach is an insight in the modelfunctioning and the fast evaluation of the psd.

astro-ph;0107232	orbital decay of satellites crossing an accretion disc	motion of stellar-mass satellites is studied around a massive compact bodywhich is surrounded by a gaseous slab of a stationary accretion disc. thesatellites suffer an orbital decay due to hydrodynamical interaction with thedisc medium (transitions across the disc, gap opening in the disc, densitywaves) and gravitational radiation. arbitrary orbital eccentricities andinclinations are considered, and it is observed how the competing effectsdepend on the parameters of the model, namely, the mass and compactness of theorbiters, the osculating elements of their trajectories, and surface density ofthe disc. these effects have a visible impact on the satellites long-termmotion, and they can produce observational consequences with respect togalactic central clusters. it is shown that the satellite-disc collisions donot impose serious restrictions on the results of gravitational waveexperiments if the disc medium is diluted and the orbiter is compact but theyare important in the case of environments with relatively high density. we thusconcentrate on application to accretion flows in which the density is notnegligible. we discuss the expected quasi-stationary structure of the clusterthat is established on sub-parsec scales within the sphere of gravitationalinfluence of the central object. relevant to this region, we give the power-lawslopes defining the radial profile of modified clusters and we show that theirvalues are determined by satellite interaction with the accretion flow ratherthan their initial distribution.

astro-ph;0401345	gravitating discs around black holes	fluid discs and tori around black holes are discussed within differentapproaches and with the emphasis on the role of disc gravity. first reviewedare the prospects of investigating the gravitational field of a blackhole--disc system by analytical solutions of stationary, axially symmetriceinstein's equations. then, more detailed considerations are focused to middleand outer parts of extended disc-like configurations where relativistic effectsare small and the newtonian description is adequate.  within general relativity, only a static case has been analysed in detail.results are often very inspiring, however, simplifying assumptions must beimposed: ad hoc profiles of the disc density are commonly assumed and theeffects of frame-dragging and completely lacking. astrophysical discs (e.g.accretion discs in active galactic nuclei) typically extend far beyond therelativistic domain and are fairly diluted. however, self-gravity is stillessential for their structure and evolution, as well as for their radiationemission and the impact on the environment around. for example, a nuclear starcluster in a galactic centre may bear various imprints of mutual star--discinteractions, which can be recognised in observational properties, such as therelation between the central mass and stellar velocity dispersion.

astro-ph;0401607	relativistic spectral features from x-ray illuminated spots and the  measure of the black hole mass in agn	narrow spectral features in the 5--6 kev range were recently discovered inthe x-ray spectra of a few active galactic nuclei. we discuss the possibilitythat these features are due to localized spots which occur on the surface of anaccretion disc following its illumination by flares. we present detailed lineprofiles as a function of orbital phase of the spot and its radial distancefrom a central black hole. comparison of these computed profiles with observedfeatures can help to estimate parameters of the system. in principle thismethod can provide a powerful tool to measure the mass of super-massive blackholes in active galactic nuclei. by comparing our simulations with the chandraand xmm-newton results, we show, however, that spectra from present generationx-ray satellites are not of good enough quality to fully exploit the method anddetermine the black hole mass with sufficient accuracy. this task has to bedeferred to future missions with high throughput and high energy resolution,such as constellation-x and xeus.

astro-ph;0403541	an extended scheme for fitting x-ray data with accretion disk spectra in  the strong gravity regime	accreting black holes are believed to emit x-rays which then mediateinformation about strong gravity in the vicinity of the emission region. wereport on a set of new routines for the xspec package for analysing x-rayspectra of black-hole accretion disks. the new computational tool significantlyextends the capabilities of the currently available fitting procedures thatinclude the effects of strong gravity, and allows one to systematically explorethe constraints on more model parameters than previously possible (for exampleblack-hole angular momentum). moreover, axial symmetry of the disk intrinsicemissivity is not assumed, although it can be imposed to speed up thecomputations. the new routines can be used also as a stand-alone and flexiblecode with the capability of handling time-resolved spectra in the regime ofstrong gravity. we have used the new code to analyse the mean x-ray spectrumfrom the long xmm--newton 2001 campaign of the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg--6-30-15.consistent with previous findings, we obtained a good fit to the broad fe kline profile for a radial line intrinsic emissivity law in the disk which isnot a simple power law, and for near maximal value of black hole angularmomentum. however, equally good fits can be obtained also for small values ofthe black hole angular momentum. the code has been developed with the aim ofallowing precise modelling of relativistic effects. although we find thatcurrent data cannot constrain the parameters of black-hole/accretion disksystem well, the approach allows, for a given source or situation, detailedinvestigations of what features of the data future studies should be focused onin order to achieve the goal of uniquely isolating the parameters of suchsystems.

astro-ph;0501203	on highly eccentric stellar trajectories interacting with a  self-gravitating disc in sgr a*	we propose that kozai's phenomenon is responsible for the long-term evolutionof stellar orbits near a supermassive black hole. we pursue the idea that thisprocess may be driven by a fossil accretion disc in the centre of our galaxy,causing the gradual orbital decay of stellar trajectories, while setting somestars on highly elliptic orbits. we evolve model orbits that undergo repetitivetransitions across the disc over the period of ~10^7 years. we assume that thedisc mass is small compared to the central black hole, and its gravitationalfield comparatively weak, yet non-zero, and we set the present values oforbital parameters of the model star consistent with those reported for the s2star in sagittarius a*. we show how a model trajectory decays and circularizes,but at some point the mean eccentricity is substantially increased by kozai'sresonance. in consequence the orbital decay of highly eccentric orbits isaccelerated. a combination of an axially symmetric gravitational field anddissipative environment can provide a mechanism explaining the origin of starson highly eccentric orbits tightly bound to the central black hole. in thecontext of other s-stars, we can conclude that an acceptable mass of the disc(i.e., m_d&lt;=1 percent of the black hole mass) is compatible with theirsurprisingly young age and small pericentre distances, provided these starswere formed at r&lt;=10^5 gravitational radii.

0809.0418	thermal disc emission from a rotating black hole: x-ray polarization  signatures	thermal emission from the accretion disc around a black hole can bepolarized, due to thomson scattering in a disc atmosphere. in newtonian space,the polarization angle must be either parallel or perpendicular to theprojection of the disc axis on the sky. as first pointed out by stark andconnors in 1977, general relativity effects strongly modify the polarizationproperties of the thermal radiation as observed at infinity. among theseeffects, the rotation of the polarization angle with energy is particularlyuseful as a diagnostic tool.  in this paper, we extend the stark and connors calculations by including thespectral hardening factor, several values of the optical depth of thescattering atmosphere and rendering the results to the expected performances ofplanned x-ray polarimeters. in particular, to assess the perspectives for thenext generation of x-ray polarimeters, we consider the expected sensitivity ofthe detectors onboard the planned polarix and ixo missions. we assume the twocases of a schwarzschild and an extreme kerr black hole with a standard thindisc and a scattering atmosphere. we compute the expected polarization degreeand the angle as functions of the energy as they could be measured fordifferent inclinations of the observer, optical thickness of the atmosphere anddifferent values of the black hole spin. we assume the thermal emissiondominates the x-ray band. using the flux level of the microquasar grs 1915+105in the thermal state, we calculate the observed polarization.

astro-ph;0601053	twin-peak quasiperiodic oscillations as an internal resonance	two inter-related peaks occur in high-frequency power spectra of x-raylightcurves of several black-hole candidates. we further explore the idea thata non-linear resonance mechanism, operating in strong-gravity regime, isresponsible for these quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos). by extending themultiple-scales analysis of rebusco, we construct two-dimensional phase-spacesections, which enable us to identify different topologies governing the systemand to follow evolutionary tracks of the twin peaks. this suggests that theoriginal (abramowicz and kluzniak) parametric-resonance scheme can be viewed asan ingenuous account of the qpos model with an internal resonance. we show anexample of internal resonance in a system with up to two critical points, andwe describe a general technique that permits to treat other cases in asystematical manner. a separatrix divides the phase-space sections into regionsof different topology: inside the libration region the evolutionary tracksbring the observed twin-peak frequencies to an exact rational ratio, whereas inthe circulation region the observed frequencies remain off resonance. ourscheme predicts the power should cyclically be exchanged between the twooscillations. likewise the high-frequency qpos in neutron-star binaries, alsoin black-hole sources one expects, as a general property of the non-linearmodel, that slight detuning pushes the twin-peak frequencies out of sharpresonance.

(2004), we model thefractional variability amplitude due to distributions of hot spots co-orbitingon the accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. from defined radialdistributions, our code samples random positions for the hot spots across thedisk. the local spot emission is computed as reprocessed radiation coming froma compact primary source above the disk. the structure of the hot spot and theanisotropy of the re-emission are taken into account. we compute the fractionalvariability spectra expected from such spot ensembles and investigatedependencies on the parameters describing the radial spot distribution. weconsider the fractional variability f_var with respect to the spectral mean andalso the so-called point-to-point f_pp. our method includes relativisticcorrections for the curved space-time; the black hole angular momentum is afree parameter and subject to the fitting procedure. we confirm that therms-variability spectra involve intrinsic randomness at a significant levelwhen the number of flares appearing during the total observation time is toosmall. furthermore, f_var is not always compatible with f_pp. for mcg -6-30-15,we can reproduce the short-timescale variability and model the suppressedvariability in the energy range of the kalpha line without any need topostulate reprocessing farther away from the center. an increasing rate ofenergy production by the flares toward the center of the disk, a fast rotationof the central black hole, and considerable suppression of the primary flareemission are required. the modeled line remains consistent with the measuredequivalent width of the iron kalpha line complex.

astro-ph;0610104	near-infrared polarimetry setting constraints on the orbiting spot model  for sgr a* flares	context: recent near-infrared polarization measurements of sgra* show thatits emission is significantly polarized during flares and consists of a non- orweakly polarized main flare with highly polarized sub-flares. the flareactivity suggests a quasi-periodicity of ~20 minutes in agreement with previousobservations. aims: by simultaneous fitting of the lightcurve fluctuations andthe time-variable polarization angle, we address the question of whether thesechanges are consistent with a simple hot spot/ring model, in which theinterplay of relativistic effects plays the major role, or whether some morecomplex dependency of the intrinsic emissivity is required. methods: we discussthe significance of the 20min peak in the periodogram of a flare from 2003. weconsider all general relativistic effects that imprint on the polarizationdegree and angle and fit the recent polarimetric data, assuming that thesynchrotron mechanism is responsible for the intrinsic polarization andconsidering two different magnetic field configurations. results: within thequality of the available data, we think that the model of a single spot inaddition to an underlying ring is favoured. in this model the broadnear-infrared flares of sgr a* are due to a sound wave that travels around thembh once while the sub-flares, superimposed on the broad flare, are due totransiently heated and accelerated electrons which can be modeled as a plasmablob. within this model it turns out that a strong statement about the spinparameter is difficult to achieve, while the inclination can be constrained tovalues &gt; 35 deg on a 3sigma level.

astro-ph;0611020	magnetic flares in active galactic nuclei: modeling the iron kalpha-line	the x-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei (agn) are complex and varyrapidly in time as seen in recent observations. magnetic flares above theaccretion disk can account for the extreme variability of agn. they alsoexplain the observed iron kalpha fluorescence lines. we present radiativetransfer modeling of the x-ray reflection due to emission from magnetic flaresclose to the marginally stable orbit. the hard x-ray primary radiation comingfrom the flare source illuminates the accretion disk. a comptonreflection/reprocessed component coming from the disk surface is computed fordifferent emission directions. we assume that the density structure remainsadjusted to the hydrostatic equilibrium without external illumination becausethe flare duration is only a quarter-orbit. the model takes into account thevariations of the incident radiation across the hot spot underneath the flaresource. the integrated spectrum seen by a distant observer is computed forflares at different orbital phases close to the marginally stable orbit of aschwarzschild black hole and of a maximally rotating kerr black hole. thecalculations include relativistic and doppler corrections of the spectra usinga ray tracing technique. we explore the practical possibilities to map out theazimuthal irradiation pattern of the inner accretion disks and conclude thatthe next generation of x-ray satellites should reveal this structure from ironkalpha line profiles and x-ray lightcurves.

astro-ph;9701065	fourier-phase analysis of the orbiting bright-spot model for agn  variability	fourier power spectra and phases of a signal from a large number of radiatingsources orbiting around a black hole are investigated. it is assumed that theindividual sources (bright spots) are located in an accretion disc and theirlifetime exceeds the corresponding orbital period. this model is relevant forthe short-time x-ray variability of active galactic nuclei. previous works onthis subject were mostly concentrated on temporal characteristics and powerspectra of observed light curves. in our present contribution, fourier phasesare brought into consideration and studied systematically for a broad range ofinput parameters. in particular, conditions for the phase coherence arediscussed. it is shown that one can discriminate between the two classes ofmodels which are currently under consideration--orbital motion of a largenumber of sources versus short-lived independent flares--although parameters ofthe model are not completely arbitrary. it is also shown that predicted powerspectra depend rather strongly on the spot distribution across the disksurface. we conclude that the orbital motion of the spots cannot be the onlyreason for the source fluctuations, but it certainly influences observationalproperties of the source intrinsic variability.

astro-ph;9910401	an orbiter crossing an accretion disc	we further investigate the long-term evolution of a trajectory of astellar-mass orbiter which is gravitationally bound to a massive central body.the orbiter undergoes repetitionary collisions with an accretion disc. weconsider eccentric orbits intersecting the disc once or twice per eachrevolution, and we solve the equations for osculating elements. we findterminal radii of the orbits and time needed to bring the orbit into the discplane as function of initial parameters, and we show that previous simplifiedestimates (derived for the case of low eccentricity) remain valid within factorof two. the discussion presented in this paper offers a toy model of theorbital evolution of a satellite which passes through the rarefied gaseousenvironment of a stationary disc. we demonstrate that the drag on the satelliteshould be taken into account in calculations of the stellar distribution nearthe super-massive black hole in galactic centers. on the other hand, it doesnot impose serious restrictions on the results of gravitational waveexperiments, except for the case of discs with rather high surface density.

0810.0168	coordinated multi-wavelength observations of sgr a*	we report on recent near-infrared (nir) and x-ray observations of sagittariusa* (sgr a*), the electromagnetic manifestation of the ~4x10^6 solar massessuper-massive black hole (smbh) at the galactic center. the goal of thesecoordinated multi-wavelength observations is to investigate the variableemission from sgr a* in order to obtain a better understanding of theunderlying physical processes in the accretion flow/outflow. the observationshave been carried out using the naco adaptive optics (ao) instrument at theeuropean southern observatory's very large telescope (july 2005, may 2007) andthe acis-i instrument aboard the chandra x-ray observatory (july 2005). wereport on a polarized nir flare synchronous to a 8x1033 erg/s x-ray flare injuly 2005, and a further flare in may 2007 that shows the highest sub-flare toflare contrast observed until now. the observations can be interpreted in theframework of a model involving a temporary disk with a short jet. in the diskcomponent flux density variations can be explained due to hot spots onrelativistic orbits around the central smbh. the variations of thesub-structures of the may 2007 flare are interpreted as a variation of the hotspot structure due to differential rotation within the disk.
