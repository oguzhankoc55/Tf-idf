0902.0651	x-ray absorption and reflection in active galactic nuclei	x-ray spectroscopy offers an opportunity to study the complex mixture ofemitting and absorbing components in the circumnuclear regions of activegalactic nuclei, and to learn about the accretion process that fuels agn andthe feedback of material to their host galaxies. we describe the spectralsignatures that may be studied and review the x-ray spectra and spectralvariability of active galaxies, concentrating on progress from recent chandra,xmm-newton and suzaku data for local type 1 agn. we describe the evidence forabsorption covering a wide range of column densities, ionization and dynamics,and discuss the growing evidence for partial-covering absorption from data atenergies &gt; 10 kev. such absorption can also explain the observed x-ray spectralcurvature and variability in agn at lower energies and is likely an importantfactor in shaping the observed properties of this class of source.consideration of self-consistent models for local agn indicates that x-rayspectra likely comprise a combination of absorption and reflection effects frommaterial originating within a few light days of the black hole as well as onlarger scales. it is likely that agn x-ray spectra may be strongly affected bythe presence of disk-wind outflows that are expected in systems with highaccretion rates, and we describe models that attempt to predict the effects ofradiative transfer through such winds, and discuss the prospects for new datato test and address these ideas.

0906.0312	a compton-thick wind in the high luminosity quasar, pds 456	pds 456 is a nearby (z=0.184), luminous (l_bol ~10^47 erg/s) type i quasar. adeep 190 ks suzaku observation in february 2007 revealed the complex, broadband x-ray spectrum of pds 456. the suzaku spectrum exhibits highlystatistically significant absorption features near 9 kev in the quasarrest--frame. we show that the most plausible origin of the absorption is fromblue-shifted resonance (1s-2p) transitions of hydrogen-like iron (at 6.97 kevin the rest frame). this indicates that a highly ionized outflow may be presentmoving at near relativistic velocities (~0.25c). a possible hard x-ray excessis detected above 15 kev with hxd (at 99.8% confidence), which may arise fromhigh column density gas (nh&gt;10^24cm^-2) partially covering the x-ray emission,or through strong compton reflection. here we propose that the iron k-shellabsorption in pds 456 is associated with a thick, possibly clumpy outflow,covering about 20% of $4\pi$ steradian solid angle. the outflow is likelylaunched from the inner accretion disk, within 15-100 gravitational radii ofthe black hole. the kinetic power of the outflow may be similar to thebolometric luminosity of pds 456. such a powerful wind could have a significanteffect on the co-evolution of the host galaxy and its supermassive black hole,through feedback.

0907.3114	the absorption-dominated model for the x-ray spectra of type i active  galaxies: mcg-6-30-15	mcg-6-30-15 is the archetypal example of a type i active galaxy showing broad"red-wing" emission in its x-ray spectrum at energies below the 6.4 kev fek-alpha emission line and a continuum excess above 20 kev. miller et al. (2008)showed that these spectral features could be caused by clumpy absorbingmaterial, but reynolds et al. (2009) have argued that the observed fe k-alphaline luminosity is inconsistent with this explanation unless the globalcovering factor of the absorber(s) is very low. however, the reynolds et al.calculation effectively considers the only source of opacity to be the fe kbound-free transition and neglects the opacity at the line energy: correctionto realistic opacity decreases the predicted line flux by a large factor. wealso discuss the interpretation of the covering factor and the possible effectof occultation by the accretion disk. finally, we consider a model formcg-6-30-15 dominated by clumpy absorption, which is consistent with globalcovering factor 0.45, although models that include the effects of comptonscattering are required to reach a full understanding. variations in coveringfraction may dominate the observed x-ray spectral variability.

0909.0899	on the efficiency of production of the fe kalpha emission line in  neutral matter	the absolute luminosity of the fe kalpha emission line from matterilluminated by x-rays in astrophysical sources is nontrivial to calculateexcept when the line-emitting medium is optically-thin to absorption andscattering. we characterize the fe kalpha line flux using a dimensionlessefficiency, defined as the fraction of continuum photons above the fe k shellabsorption edge threshold energy that appear in the line. the optically-thinapproximation begins to break down even for column densities as small as 2 x10^22 cm^-2. we show how to obtain reliable estimates of the fe kalpha lineefficiency in the case of cold, neutral matter, even for the compton-thickregime. we find that, regardless of geometry and covering factor, the largestfe kalpha line efficiency is attained well before the medium becomescompton-thick. for cosmic elemental abundances it is difficult to achieve anefficiency higher than a few percent under the most favorable conditions andlines of sight. for a given geometry, compton-thick lines-of-sight may have fekalpha line efficiencies that are orders of magnitude less than the maximumpossible for that geometry. configurations that allow unobscured views of acompton-thick reflecting surface are capable of yielding the highestefficiencies. our results can be used to estimate the predicted flux of thenarrow fe kalpha line at ~6.4 kev from absorption models in agn. in particularwe show that contrary to a recent claim in the literature, absorption dominatedmodels for the relativistic fe kalpha emission line in mcg -6-30-15 do notover-predict the narrow fe kalpha line for any column density or coveringfactor.

0910.5365	a correlation between the spectral and timing properties of agn	we present the results from a combined study of the average x-ray spectraland timing properties of 14 nearby agn. for 11 of the sources in the sample, weused all the available data from the rxte archive, which were taken until theend of 2006. there are 7795 rxte observations in total for these agn, obtainedover a period of ~7-11 years. we extracted their 3-20 kev spectra and fittedthem with a simple power-law model, modified by the presence of a gaussian line(at 6.4 kev) and cold absorption, when necessary. we used these best-fit slopesto estimate the mean spectral slope for each object, while we used results fromthe literature to estimate the average spectral slope of the three objectswithout archival, monitorin rxte data. our results show that the agn averagespectral slopes are not correlated either with the black hole mass or thecharacteristic frequencies that were detected in the power spectra.they arepositively correlated, though, with the characteristic frequency whennormalised to the sources black hole mass. this is similar to thespectral-timing correlation that has been observed in cyg x-1, but not thesame.the agn spectral-timing correlation can be explained if we assume that theaccretion rate determines both the average spectral slope and thecharacteristic time scales in agn. the spectrum should steepen and thecharacteristic frequency should increase, proportionally, with increasingaccretion rate. we also provide a quantitative expression between spectralslope and accretion rate. thermal comptonisation models are broadly consistentwith our result, but only if the ratio of the soft photons' luminosity to thepower injected to the hot corona is proportionally related to the accretionrate.

0912.0456	spectral variability and reverberation time delays in the suzaku x-ray  spectrum of ngc 4051	long-exposure suzaku x-ray observations of the active galaxy ngc 4051 from2005 and 2008 are analysed, in an attempt to reach a self-consistentunderstanding of the spectral variability on long timescales and at high timeresolution. principal components analysis and a maximum likelihood method ofpower spectrum analysis are used. in common with other type i agn, the spectralvariability is dominated by a varying-normalisation power-law componenttogether with a quasi-steady, hard-spectrum offset component that contains fe katomic features. ngc 4051 displays a strong excess over a power-law at energiesabove 20 kev, some fraction of which also appears to vary with the power-lawcontinuum. the fast-timescale power spectrum has a shape consistent withprevious determinations, but significant differences are found between the lowand high flux states of the source, demonstrating that the power spectrum isnon-stationary. frequency-dependent time lags between the hard and soft bandsof up to 970+/-225s are measured. the existence of the observed lags excludesthe possibility that the hard spectral component originates as reflection fromthe inner accretion disk. we instead show that the frequency- andenergy-dependent time lags may be explained as reverberation, caused byreflection from a thick shell of material with maximum lags of about 10,000s.if the reflecting material surrounds the agn, it extends to a distance about1.5x10^14 cm, 600 gravitational radii, from the illuminating source and theglobal covering factor is c(g) &gt;~ 0.4, confirming suggestions that type i agnhave high covering factors of absorbing and reflecting material. given thespectral and timing similarities with other type i agn, we infer that thisstructure is common in the type i population.

1002.0082	significant x-ray line emission in the 5-6 kev band of ngc 4051	a suzaku x-ray observation of ngc 4051 taken during 2005 nov reveals lineemission at 5.44 kev in the rest-frame of the galaxy which does not have anobvious origin in known rest-frame atomic transitions. the improvement to thefit statistic when this line is accounted for establishes its reality at &gt;99.9%confidence: we have also verified that the line is detected in the three xisunits independently. comparison between the data and monte carlo simulationsshows that the probability of the line being a statistical fluctuation is p &lt;3.3 x 10^-4. consideration of three independent line detections in suzaku datataken at different epochs yields a probability p&lt; 3 x 10^-11 and thusconclusively demonstrates that it cannot be a statistical fluctuation in thedata. the new line and a strong component of fe ka emission from neutralmaterial are prominent when the source flux is low, during 2005. spectra from2008 show evidence for a line consistent with having the same flux and energyas that observed during 2005, but inconsistent with having a constantequivalent width against the observed continuum. the stability of the line fluxand energy suggests that it may not arise in transient hotspots, as has beensuggested for similar lines in other sources, but could arise from a speciallocation in the reprocessor, such as the inner edge of the accretion disk.alternatively, the line energy may be explained by spallation of fe into cr, asdiscussed in a companion paper.

1002.0544	multi-dimensional modelling of x-ray spectra for agn accretion-disk  outflows ii	highly-ionized fast accretion-disk winds have been suggested as anexplanation for a variety of observed absorption and emission features in thex-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei. simple estimates have suggested thatthese flows may be massive enough to carry away a significant fraction of theaccretion energy and could be involved in creating the link betweensupermassive black holes and their host galaxies. however, testing thesehypotheses, and quantifying the outflow signatures, requires high-qualitytheoretical spectra for comparison with observations. here we describeextensions of our monte carlo radiative transfer code that allow us to generaterealistic theoretical spectra for a much wider variety of disk wind models thanpossible in our previous work. in particular, we have expanded the range ofatomic physics simulated by the code so that l- and m-shell ions can now beincluded. we have also substantially improved our treatment of both ionizationand radiative heating such that we are now able to compute spectra for outflowscontaining far more diverse plasma conditions. we present example calculationsthat illustrate the variety of spectral features predicted by parametrizedoutflow models and demonstrate their applicability to the interpretation ofdata by comparison with observations of the bright quasar pg1211+143. we findthat the major features in the observed 2 - 10 kev spectrum of this object canbe well-reproduced by our spectra, confirming that it likely hosts a massiveoutflow.

0708.1338	the variable x-ray spectrum of markarian 766 - ii. time-resolved  spectroscopy	context: the variable x-ray spectra of agn systematically show steeppower-law high states and hard-spectrum low states. the hard low state haspreviously been found to be a component with only weak variability. the originof this component and the relative importance of effects such as absorption andrelativistic blurring are currently not clear. aims: in a follow-up of previousprincipal components analysis, we aim to determine the relative importance ofscattering and absorption effects on the time-varying x-ray spectrum of thenarrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy mrk~766. methods: time-resolved spectroscopy,slicing xmm and suzaku data down to 25 ks elements, is used to investigatewhether absorption or scattering components dominate the spectral variations inmrk 766.time-resolved spectroscopy confirms that spectral variability in mrk766 can be explained by either of two interpretations of principal componentsanalysis. detailed investigation confirm rapid changes in the relativestrengths of scattered and direct emission or rapid changes in absorbercovering fraction provide good explanations of most of the spectralvariability. however, a strong correlation between the 6.97 kev absorption lineand the primary continuum together with rapid opacity changes show thatvariations in a complex and multi-layered absorber, most likely a disk wind,are the dominant source of spectral variability in mrk 766

1006.1318	evidence for a truncated accretion disc in the low luminosity seyfert  galaxy, ngc 7213?	we present the broad-band 0.6-150 kev suzaku and swift bat spectra of the lowluminosity seyfert galaxy, ngc 7213. the time-averaged continuum emission iswell fitted by a single powerlaw of photon index gamma = 1.75 and fromconsideration of the fermi flux limit we constrain the high energy cutoff to be350 kev &lt; e &lt; 25 mev. line emission from both near-neutral iron k_alpha at 6.39kev and highly ionised iron, from fe_(xxv) and fe_(xxvi), is strongly detectedin the suzaku spectrum, further confirming the results of previous observationswith chandra and xmm-newton. we find the centroid energies for the fe_(xxv) andfe_(xxvi) emission to be 6.60 kev and 6.95 kev respectively, with the latterappearing to be resolved in the suzaku spectrum. we show that the fe_(xxv) andfe_(xxvi) emission can result from a highly photo-ionised plasma of columndensity n_(h) ~ 3 x 10^(23) cm^(-2). a compton reflection component, e.g.,originating from an optically-thick accretion disc or a compton-thick torus,appears either very weak or absent in this agn, subtending &lt; 1 sr to the x-raysource, consistent with previous findings. indeed the absence of either neutralor ionised compton reflection coupled with the lack of any relativistic fe ksignatures in the spectrum suggests that an inner, optically-thick accretiondisc is absent in this source. instead, the accretion disc could be truncatedwith the inner regions perhaps replaced by a compton-thin radiativelyinefficient accretion flow. thus, the fe_(xxv) and fe_(xxvi) emission couldboth originate in ionised material perhaps at the transition region between thehot, inner flow and the cold, truncated accretion disc on the order of 10^(3) -10^(4) gravitational radii from the black hole. the origin for the unresolvedneutral fe k_alpha emission is then likely to be further out, perhapsoriginating in the optical blr or a compton-thin pc-scale torus.

1006.3449	multi-dimensional modelling of x-ray spectra for agn accretion-disk  outflows iii: application to a hydrodynamical simulation	we perform multi-dimensional radiative transfer simulations to computespectra for a hydrodynamical simulation of a line-driven accretion disk windfrom an active galactic nucleus. the synthetic spectra confirm expectationsfrom parameterized models that a disk wind can imprint a wide variety ofspectroscopic signatures including narrow absorption lines, broad emissionlines and a compton hump. the formation of these features is complex withcontributions originating from many of the different structures present in thehydrodynamical simulation. in particular, spectral features are shaped both bygas in a successfully launched outflow and in complex flows where material islifted out of the disk plane but ultimately falls back. we also confirm thatthe strong fe kalpha line can develop a weak, red-skewed line wing as a resultof compton scattering in the outflow. in addition, we demonstrate that x-rayradiation scattered and reprocessed in the flow has a pivotal part in both thespectrum formation and determining the ionization conditions in the wind. wefind that scattered radiation is rather effective in ionizing gas which isshielded from direct irradiation from the central source. this effect likelymakes the successful launching of a massive disk wind somewhat more challengingand should be considered in future wind simulations.

1006.5035	x-ray reverberation in 1h0707-495 revisited	the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy 1h0707-495 has previously been identified asshowing time lags between flux variations in the soft- (0.3-1 kev) andmedium-energy (1-4 kev) x-ray bands that oscillate between positive andnegative values as a function of the frequency of the mode of variation. herewe measure and analyse the lags also between a harder x-ray band (4-7.5 kev)and the soft and medium bands, using existing xmm-newton data, and demonstratethat the entire spectrum of lags, considering both the full energy range,0.3-7.5 kev, and the full frequency range, 10^-5 &lt; nu &lt; 10^-2 hz, areinconsistent with previous claims of arising as reverberation associated withthe inner accretion disk. instead we demonstrate that a simple reverberationmodel, in which scattering or reflection is present in all x-ray bands,explains the full set of lags without requiring any ad hoc explanation for thetime lag sign changes. the range of time delays required to explain theobserved lags extends up to about 1800 s in the hard band. the results areconsistent with reverberation caused by scattering of x-rays passing through anabsorbing medium whose opacity decreases with increasing energy and thatpartially-covers the source. a high covering factor of absorbing and scatteringcircumnuclear material is inferred.

1007.2953	3d photometric cosmic shear	here we present a number of improvements to weak lensing 3d power spectrumanalysis, 3d cosmic shear, that uses the shape and redshift information ofevery galaxy to constrain cosmological parameters. we show how photometricredshift probability distributions for individual galaxies can be directlyincluded in this statistic with no averaging. we also include the limberapproximation, considerably simplifying full 3d cosmic shear analysis, and weinvestigate its range of applicability. finally we show the relationshipbetween weak lensing tomography and the 3d cosmic shear field itself; the stepsconnecting them being the limber approximation, a harmonic-space transform anda discretisation in wavenumber. each method has its advantages: 3d cosmic shearanalysis allows straightforward inclusion of all relevant modes, thus ensuringminimum error bars, and direct control of the range of physical wavenumbersprobed, to avoid the uncertain highly nonlinear regime. on the other hand,tomography is more convenient for checking systematics through directinvestigation of the redshift dependence of the signal. finally, fortomography, we suggest that the angular modes probed should beredshift-dependent, to recover some of the 3d advantages.

1102.1894	contemporaneous chandra hetg and suzaku x-ray observations of ngc 4051	we present the results of a deep 300 ks chandra hetg observation of thehighly variable narrow-line seyfert type 1 galaxy ngc 4051. the hetg spectrumreveals 28 significant soft x-ray ionised lines in either emission orabsorption; primarily originating from h-like and he-like k-shell transitionsof o, ne, mg and si (including higher order lines and strong forbidden emissionlines from o vii and ne ix) plus high ionisation l-shell transitions from fexvii to fe xxii and lower ionisation inner-shell lines (e.g. o vi). modellingthe data with xstar requires four distinct ionisation zones for the gas, alloutflowing with velocities &lt; 1000 km/s. a selection of the strongestemission/absorption lines appear to be resolved with fwhm of ~600 km/s. we alsopresent the results from a quasi-simultaneous 350 ks suzaku observation of ngc4051 where the xis spectrum reveals strong evidence for blueshifted absorptionlines at ~6.8 and ~7.1 kev, consistent with previous findings. modelling withxstar suggests that this is the signature of a highly ionised, high velocityoutflow (log \xi ~ 4.1; v ~ -0.02c) which potentially may have a significanteffect on the host galaxy environment via feedback. finally, we alsosimultaneously model the broad-band 2008 xis+hxd suzaku data with archivalsuzaku data from 2005 when the source was observed to have entered an extendedperiod of low flux in an attempt to analyse the cause of the long-term spectralvariability. we find that we can account for this by allowing for largevariations in the normalisation of the intrinsic power-law component which maybe interpreted as being due to significant changes in the covering fraction ofa compton-thick partial-coverer obscuring the central continuum emission.

1111.4434	cfhtlens: improving the quality of photometric redshifts with precision  photometry	here we present the results of various approaches to measure accurate coloursand photometric redshifts (photo-z's) from wide-field imaging data. we use datafrom the canada-france-hawaii-telescope legacy survey (cfhtls) which have beenre- processed by the cfht lensing survey (cfhtlens) team in order to carry outa number of weak gravitational lensing studies. an emphasis is put on thecorrection of systematic effects in the photo-z's arising from the differentpoint spread functions (psf) in the five optical bands. different ways ofcorrecting these effects are discussed and the resulting photo-z accuracies arequantified by comparing the photo-z's to large spectroscopic redshift (spec-z)data sets. careful homogenisation of the psf between bands leads to increasedoverall accuracy of photo-z's. the gain is particularly pronounced at faintermagnitudes where galaxies are smaller and flux measurements are affected moreby psf-effects. we also study possible re- calibrations of the photometriczeropoints (zps) with the help of galaxies with known spec-z's. we find that ifpsf-effects are properly taken into account, a re-calibration of the zpsbecomes much less important suggesting that previous such re-calibrationsdescribed in the literature could in fact be mostly corrections for psf-effectsrather than corrections for real inaccuracies in the zps. the implications ofthis finding for future surveys like kids, des, lsst, or euclid are mixed. onthe one hand, zp re-calibrations with spec-z's might not be as accurate aspreviously thought. on the other hand, careful psf homogenisation might providea way out and yield accurate, homogeneous photometry without the need for fullspectroscopic coverage. this is the first paper in a series describing thetechnical aspects of cfhtlens.

1204.2535	modeling the fe k line profiles in type i agn with a compton-thick disk  wind	we have modeled a small sample of seyfert galaxies that were previouslyidentified as having simple x-ray spectra with little intrinsic absorption. thesources in this sample all contain moderately broad components of fe k-shellemission and are ideal candidates for testing the applicability of acompton-thick accretion-disk wind model to agn emission components. viewingangles through the wind allow the observer to see the absorption signature ofthe gas, whereas face-on viewing angles allow the observer to see the scatteredlight from the wind. we find that the fe k emission line profiles are welldescribed with a model of a compton-thick accretion-disk wind of solarabundances, arising tens to hundred of gravitational radii from the centralblack hole. further, the fits require a neutral component of fe k alphaemission that is too narrow to arise from the inner part of the wind, andlikely comes from a more distant reprocessing region. our study demonstratesthat a compton-thick wind can have a profound effect on the observed x-rayspectrum of an agn, even when the system is not viewed through the flow.

1207.7194	synthetic x-ray spectra for simulations of the dynamics of an accretion  flow irradiated by a quasar	ultraviolet and x-ray observations show evidence of outflowing gas aroundmany active galactic nuclei. some of these outflows may be driven off gasinfalling towards the central black hole. we perform radiative transfercalculations to compute the gas ionization state and x-ray spectra for two- andthree-dimensional (3d) hydrodynamical simulations of this outflow-from-inflowscenario. by comparison with observations, our results can be used to test thetheoretical models and guide future numerical simulations. we predict bothabsorption and emission features, most of which are formed in a polar funnel ofoutflowing gas. this outflow causes strong absorption for observer orientationangles of &lt; 35 degrees. particularly in 3d, the strength of this absorptionvaries significantly for different lines-of-sight owing to the fragmentarystructure of the gas flow. although infalling material occupies a largefraction of the simulation volume, we do not find that it imprints strongabsorption features since the ionization state is very high. thus, an absenceof observed inflow absorption features does not exclude the models. the mainspectroscopic consequence of the infalling gas is a scattered continuumcomponent that partially re-fills the absorption features caused by theoutflowing polar funnel. fluorescence and scattering in the outflow ispredicted to give rise to several emission features for all observerorientations. for the hydrodynamical simulations considered we find bothionization states and column densities for the outflowing gas that are too highto be quantitatively consistent with well-observed x-ray absorption systems.nevertheless, our results are qualitatively encouraging and further explorationof the model parameter space is warranted.

1210.0469	direct measurement of the x-ray time-delay transfer function in active  galactic nuclei	the origin of the observed time lags, in nearby active galactic nuclei (agn),between hard and soft x-ray photons is investigated using new xmm-newton datafor the narrow-line seyfert i galaxy ark 564 and existing data for 1h0707-495and ngc 4051. these agn have highly variable x-ray light curves that containfrequent, high peaks of emission. the averaged light curve of the peaks isdirectly measured from the time series, and it is shown that (i) peaks occur atthe same time, within the measurement uncertainties, at all x-ray energies, and(ii) there exists a substantial tail of excess emission at hard x-ray energies,which is delayed with respect to the time of the main peak, and is particularlyprominent in ark 564. observation (i) rules out that the observed lags arecaused by comptonization time delays and disfavors a simple model ofpropagating fluctuations on the accretion disk. observation (ii) is consistentwith time lags caused by compton-scattering reverberation from material a fewthousand light-seconds from the primary x-ray source. the power spectraldensity and the frequency-dependent phase lags of the peak light curves areconsistent with those of the full time series. there is evidence fornon-stationarity in the ark 564 time series in both the fourier and peaksanalyses. a sharp `negative' lag (variations at hard photon energies lead softphoton energies) observed in ark 564 appears to be generated by the shape ofthe hard-band transfer function and does not arise from soft-band reflection ofx-rays. these results reinforce the evidence for the existence of x-rayreverberation in type i agn, which requires that these agn are significantlyaffected by scattering from circumnuclear material a few tens or hundreds ofgravitational radii in extent.

1210.8201	bayesian galaxy shape measurement for weak lensing surveys - iii.  application to the canada-france-hawaii telescope lensing survey	a likelihood-based method for measuring weak gravitational lensing shear indeep galaxy surveys is described and applied to the canada-france-hawaiitelescope (cfht) lensing survey (cfhtlens). cfhtlens comprises 154 sq deg ofmulticolour optical data from the cfht legacy survey, with lensing measurementsbeing made in the i' band to a depth i'(ab)&lt;24.7, for galaxies withsignal-to-noise ratio greater than about 10. the method is based on the lensfitalgorithm described in earlier papers, but here we describe a full analysispipeline that takes into account the properties of real surveys. the methodcreates pixel-based models of the varying point spread function (psf) inindividual image exposures. it fits psf-convolved two-component (disk plusbulge) models, to measure the ellipticity of each galaxy, with bayesianmarginalisation over model nuisance parameters of galaxy position, size,brightness and bulge fraction. the method allows optimal joint measurement ofmultiple, dithered image exposures, taking into account imaging distortion andthe alignment of the multiple measurements. we discuss the effects of noisebias on the likelihood distribution of galaxy ellipticity. two sets of imagesimulations that mirror the observed properties of cfhtlens have been created,to establish the method's accuracy and to derive an empirical correction forthe effects of noise bias.

1211.3403	the global implications of the hard x-ray excess in type 1 agn	recent evidence for a strong 'hard excess' of flux at energies &gt; 20 kev insome suzaku observations of type 1 active galactic nuclei (agn) has motivatedan exploratory study of the phenomenon in the local type 1 agn population. wehave selected all type 1 agn in the swift burst alert telescope (bat) 58-monthcatalog and cross-correlated them with the holdings of the suzaku publicarchive. we find the hard excess phenomenon to be a ubiquitous property of type1 agn. taken together, the spectral hardness and equivalent width of fe k alphaemission are consistent with reprocessing by an ensemble of compton-thickclouds that partially cover the continuum source. in the context of such amodel, ~ 80 % of the sample has a hardness ratio consistent with &gt; 50% coveringof the continuum by low-ionization, compton-thick gas. more detailed study ofthe three hardest x-ray spectra in our sample reveal a sharp fe k absorptionedge at ~ 7 kev in each of them, indicating that blurred reflection is notresponsible for the very hard spectral forms. simple considerations place thedistribution of compton-thick clouds at or within the optical broad lineregion.

1301.1863	cfhtlens: higher-order galaxy-mass correlations probed by  galaxy-galaxy-galaxy lensing	we present the first direct measurement of the galaxy-matter bispectrum as afunction of galaxy luminosity, stellar mass, and sed type. our analysis uses agalaxy-galaxy-galaxy lensing technique (g3l), on angular scales between 9arcsec to 50 arcmin, to quantify (i) the excess surface mass density aroundgalaxy pairs (excess mass hereafter) and (ii) the excess shear-shearcorrelations around single galaxies, both of which yield a measure of two typesof galaxy-matter bispectra. we apply our method to the state-of-the-artcanada-france-hawaii telescope lensing survey (cfhtlens), spanning 154 squaredegrees. this survey allows us to detect a significant change of the bispectrawith lens properties. measurements for lens populations with distinct redshiftdistributions become comparable by a newly devised normalisation technique.that will also aid future comparisons to other surveys or simulations. asignificant dependence of the normalised g3l statistics on luminosity within-23&lt;m_r&lt;-18 and stellar mass within 5x10^9 m_sol&lt;m_star&lt;2x10^11 m_sol is found(h=0.73). both bispectra exhibit a stronger signal for more luminous lenses orthose with higher stellar mass (up to a factor 2-3). this is accompanied by asteeper equilateral bispectrum for more luminous or higher stellar mass lensesfor the excess mass. importantly, we find the excess mass to be very sensitiveto galaxy type as recently predicted with semi-analytic galaxy models: luminous(m_r&lt;-21) late-type galaxies show no detectable signal, while all excess massdetected for luminous galaxies seems to be associated with early-type galaxies.we also present the first observational constraints on third-order stochasticgalaxy biasing parameters.

1301.3180	operational experience, improvements, and performance of the cdf run ii  silicon vertex detector	the collider detector at fermilab (cdf) pursues a broad physics program atfermilab's tevatron collider. between run ii commissioning in early 2001 andthe end of operations in september 2011, the tevatron delivered 12 fb-1 ofintegrated luminosity of p-pbar collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96 tev. many physicsanalyses undertaken by cdf require heavy flavor tagging with large chargedparticle tracking acceptance. to realize these goals, in 2001 cdf installedeight layers of silicon microstrip detectors around its interaction region.these detectors were designed for 2--5 years of operation, radiation doses upto 2 mrad (0.02 gy), and were expected to be replaced in 2004. the sensors werenot replaced, and the tevatron run was extended for several years beyond itsdesign, exposing the sensors and electronics to much higher radiation dosesthan anticipated. in this paper we describe the operational challengesencountered over the past 10 years of running the cdf silicon detectors, thepreventive measures undertaken, and the improvements made along the way toensure their optimal performance for collecting high quality physics data. inaddition, we describe the quantities and methods used to monitor radiationdamage in the sensors for optimal performance and summarize the detectorperformance quantities important to cdf's physics program, including vertexresolution, heavy flavor tagging, and silicon vertex trigger performance.

1303.4309	the hard x-ray spectrum of ngc 1365: scattered light, not black hole  spin	active galactic nuclei (agn) show excess x-ray emission above 10 kev comparedwith extrapolation of spectra from lower energies. risaliti et al. haverecently attempted to model the hard x-ray excess in the type 1.8 agn ngc 1365,concluding that the hard excess most likely arises from compton-scatteredreflection of x-rays from an inner accretion disk close to the black hole.their analysis disfavored a model in which the hard excess arises from a highcolumn density of circumnuclear gas partially covering a primary x-ray source,despite such components being required in the ngc 1365 data below 10 kev. usinga monte carlo radiative transfer approach, we demonstrate that this conclusionis invalidated by (i) use of slab absorption models, which have unrealistictransmission spectra for partial covering gas, (ii) neglect of the effect ofcompton scattering on transmitted spectra and (iii) inadequate modeling of thespectrum of scattered x-rays. the scattered spectrum is geometry dependent and,for high global covering factors, may dominate above 10 kev. we further showthat, in models of circumnuclear gas, the suppression of the observed hardx-ray flux by reprocessing may be no larger than required by the `lightbending' model invoked for inner disk reflection, and the expected emissionline strengths lie within the observed range. we conclude that thetime-invariant `red wing' in agn x-ray spectra is probably caused by continuumtransmitted through and scattered from circumnuclear gas, not by highlyredshifted line emission, and that measurement of black hole spin is notpossible.

1311.0734	variability of the high velocity outflow in the quasar pds 456	we present a comparison of two suzaku x-ray observations of the nearby(z=0.184), luminous ($l_{bol} \sim 10^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$) type i quasar,pds456. a new 125ks suzaku observation in 2011 caught the quasar during aperiod of low x-ray flux and with a hard x-ray spectrum, in contrast to aprevious 190ks suzaku observation in 2007 when the quasar appeared brighter andhad a steep ($\gamma&gt;2$) x-ray spectrum. the 2011 x-ray spectrum contains apronounced trough near 9\,kev in the quasar rest frame, which can be modeledwith blue-shifted iron k-shell absorption, most likely from the he and h-liketransitions of iron. the absorption trough is observed at a similar rest-frameenergy as in the earlier 2007 observation, which appears to confirm theexistence of a persistent high velocity wind in pds 456, at an outflow velocityof $0.25-0.30$c. the spectral variability between 2007 and 2011 can beaccounted for by variations in a partial covering absorber, increasing incovering fraction from the brighter 2007 observation to the hard and faint 2011observation. overall the low flux 2011 observation can be explained if pds 456is observed at relatively low inclination angles through a compton thick wind,originating from the accretion disk, which significantly attenuates the x-rayflux from the quasar.

1312.5618	probing the accelerating universe with radio weak lensing in the jvla  sky survey	we outline the prospects for performing pioneering radio weak gravitationallensing analyses using observations from a potential forthcoming jvla skysurvey program. a large-scale survey with the jvla can offer interesting andunique opportunities for performing weak lensing studies in the radio band, afield which has until now been the preserve of optical telescopes. inparticular, the jvla has the capacity for large, deep radio surveys withrelatively high angular resolution, which are the key characteristics requiredfor a successful weak lensing study. we highlight the potential advantages andunique aspects of performing weak lensing in the radio band. in particular, theinclusion of continuum polarisation information can greatly reduce noise inweak lensing reconstructions and can also remove the effects of intrinsicgalaxy alignments, the key astrophysical systematic effect that limits weaklensing at all wavelengths. we identify a vlass "deep fields" program (totalarea ~10-20 square degs), to be conducted at l-band and with high-resolution(a-array configuration), as the optimal survey strategy from the point of viewof weak lensing science. such a survey will build on the unique strengths ofthe jvla and will remain unsurpassed in terms of its combination of resolutionand sensitivity until the advent of the square kilometre array. we identify thebest fields on the jvla-accessible sky from the point of view of overlappingwith existing deep optical and near infra-red data which will provide crucialredshift information and facilitate a host of additional compellingmulti-wavelength science.

0802.1528	bayesian galaxy shape measurement for weak lensing surveys -ii.  application to simulations	we extend the bayesian model fitting shape measurement method presented inmiller et al. (2007) and use the method to estimate the shear from the sheartesting programme simulations (step). the method uses a fast model fittingalgorithm which uses realistic galaxy profiles and analytically marginalisesover the position and amplitude of the model by doing the model fitting infourier space. this is used to find the full posterior probability inellipticity so that the shear can be estimated in a fully bayesian way. thebayesian shear estimation allows measurement bias arising from the presence ofrandom noise to be removed. in this paper we introduce an iterative algorithmthat can be used to estimate the intrinsic ellipticity prior and show that thisis accurate and stable. by using the method to estimate the shear from thestep1 simulations we find the method to have a shear bias of m ~ 0.005 and avariation in shear offset with psf type of sigma_c ~ 0.0002. these values aresmaller than for any method presented in the step1 publication that behaveslinearly with shear. using the method to estimate the shear from the step2simulations we find than the shear bias and offset are m ~ 0.002 and c ~-0.0007 respectively. in addition we find that the bias and offset are stableto changes in magnitude and size of the galaxies. such biases should yield anycosmological constraints from future weak lensing surveys robust to systematiceffects in shape measurement.

1401.6842	3d cosmic shear: cosmology from cfhtlens	this paper presents the first application of 3d cosmic shear to a wide-fieldweak lensing survey. 3d cosmic shear is a technique that analyses weak lensingin three dimensions using a spherical harmonic approach, and does not bin datain the redshift direction. this is applied to cfhtlens, a 154 square degreeimaging survey with a median redshift of 0.7 and an effective number density of11 galaxies per square arcminute usable for weak lensing. to account for surveymasks we apply a 3d pseudo-cl approach on weak lensing data, and to avoiduncertainties in the highly non-linear regime, we separately analyse radialwave numbers k&lt;=1.5h/mpc and k&lt;=5.0h/mpc, and angular wavenumbers l~400-5000.we show how one can recover 2d and tomographic power spectra from the full 3dcosmic shear power spectra and present a measurement of the 2d cosmic shearpower spectrum, and measurements of a set of 2-bin and 6-bin cosmic sheartomographic power spectra; in doing so we find that using the 3d power in thecalculation of such 2d and tomographic power spectra from data naturallyaccounts for a minimum scale in the matter power spectrum. we use 3d cosmicshear to constrain cosmologies with parameters omegam, omegab, sigma8, h, ns,w0, wa. for a non-evolving dark energy equation of state, and assuming a flatcosmology, lensing combined with wmap7 results in h=0.78+/-0.12,omegam=0.252+/-0.079, sigma8=0.88+/-0.23 and w=-1.16+/-0.38 using only scalesk&lt;=1.5h/mpc. we also present results of lensing combined with first year planckresults, where we find no tension with the results from this analysis, but wealso find no significant improvement over the planck results alone. we findevidence of a suppression of power compared to lcdm on small scales 1.5 &lt; k &lt;5.0 h/mpc in the lensing data, which is consistent with predictions of theeffect of baryonic feedback on the matter power spectrum.

1402.3700	revealing the location and structure of the accretion disk-wind in  pds456	we present evidence for the rapid variability of the high velocity ironk-shell absorption in the nearby ($z=0.184$) quasar pds456. from a recent longsuzaku observation in 2013 ($\sim1$ms effective duration) we find that the theequivalent width of iron k absorption increases by a factor of $\sim5$ duringthe observation, increasing from $&lt;105$ev within the first 100ks of theobservation, towards a maximum depth of $\sim500$ev near the end. the impliedoutflow velocity of $\sim0.25$c is consistent with that claimed from earlier(2007, 2011) suzaku observations. the absorption varies on time-scales as shortas $\sim1$ week. we show that this variability can be equally well attributedto either (i) an increase in column density, plausibly associated with a clumpytime-variable outflow, or (ii) the decreasing ionization of a smoothhomogeneous outflow which is in photo-ionization equilibrium with the localphoton field. the variability allows a direct measure of absorber location,which is constrained to within $r=200-3500$$\rm{r_{g}}$ of the black hole. evenin the most conservative case the kinetic power of the outflow is $\gtrsim6\%$of the eddington luminosity, with a mass outflow rate in excess of $\sim40\%$of the eddington accretion rate. the wind momentum rate is directly equivalentto the eddington momentum rate which suggests that the flow may have beenaccelerated by continuum-scattering during an episode of eddington-limitedaccretion.

0803.0080	tracing a disk wind in ngc 3516	x-ray spectra of agn often contain signatures indicative of absorption inmultiple layers of gas whose ionization-state and covering fraction may varywith time. it has been unclear to date how much of the observed x-ray spectraland timing behavior in agn can be attributed to variations in absorption,versus variations in the strengths of emission or reflection components.diagnostics of the inner regions of agn cannot be reliably performed until theorigin of observed effects is understood. we investigate the role of the x-rayabsorbers in the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 3516. time-averaged and flux-selectedspectroscopy is used to examine the behavior of ngc 3516 observed in chandrahetg and xmm data from oct 2006. new h-like and he-like emission and absorptionfeatures discovered in the fe k regime reveal a previously unknown zone ofcircumnuclear gas in ngc 3516 with log xi ~ 4.3 and column density 1e23 cm^-2.a lower-ionization layer with log xi ~2 and of similar column density isconfirmed from previous observations, this layer has a covering fraction around50%, and changes in covering provide a simple explanation of a deep dip in thelight curve that we interpret as an eclipse of the continuum due to passage ofa cloud across the sight line within half a day. these inner zones of absorbinggas are detected to have outflow velocities in the range 1000-2000 km/s, this,and constraints on radial location are consistent with an origin as part of adisk wind in ngc 3516.

0803.1668	fourier-resolved energy spectra of the narrow line seyfert 1 mkn 766	we compute fourier-resolved x-ray spectra of the seyfert 1 markarian 766 tostudy the shape of the variable components contributing to the 0.3-10 kevenergy spectrum and their time-scale dependence. the fractional variabilityspectra peak at 1-3 kev, as in other seyfert 1 galaxies, consistent with eithera constant contribution from a soft excess component below 1 kev and comptonreflection component above 2 kev, or variable warm absorption enhancing thevariability in the 1-3 kev range. the rms spectra, which shows the shape of thevariable components only, is well described by a single power law with anabsorption feature around 0.7 kev, which gives it an apparent soft excess. thisspectral shape can be produced by a power law varying in normalisation,affected by an approximately constant (within each orbit) warm absorber, withparameters similar to those found by turner et al. for the warm-absorber layercovering all spectral components in their scattering scenario. the total softexcess in the average spectrum can therefore be produced by a combination ofconstant warm absorption on the power law plus an additional less variablecomponent. on shorter time-scales, the rms spectrum hardens and this evolutionis well described by a change in power law slope, while the absorptionparameters remain the same. the frequency dependence of the rms spectra can beinterpreted as variability arising from propagating fluctuations through anextended emitting region, whose emitted spectrum is a power law that hardenstowards the centre. this scenario reduces the short time-scale variability oflower energy bands making the variable spectrum harder on shorter time-scalesand at the same time explains the hard lags found in these data by markowitz etal.

0803.2680	an absorption origin for the x-ray spectral variability of mcg-6-30-15	the seyfert i galaxy mcg-6-30-15 shows one of the best examples of a broad"red wing" of emission in its x-ray spectrum at energies 2 &lt; e &lt; 6.4 kev,commonly interpreted as being caused by relativistically-blurred reflectionclose to the event horizon of the black hole. we aim to test an alternativemodel in which absorption creates the observed spectral shape, explains thepuzzling lack of variability of the red wing and reduces the high reflectionalbedo, substantially greater than unity, that is otherwise inferred atenergies e &gt; 20 kev. we compiled all the available long-exposure, high-qualitydata for mcg-6-30-15: 522 ks of chandra hetgs, 282 ks of xmm-newton pn/rgs and253 ks of suzaku xis/pin data. this is the first analysis of this full dataset.we investigated the spectral variability on timescales &gt;20 ks using principalcomponents analysis and fitted spectral models to "flux state" and mean spectraover the energy range 0.5-45 kev (depending on detector). the absorber modelwas based on the zones previously identified in the high-resolution gratingdata. joint fits were carried out to any data that were simultaneous. multipleabsorbing zones covering a wide range of ionisation are required by the gratingdata, including a highly ionised outflowing zone. a variable partial-coveringzone plus absorbed low-ionisation reflection, distant from the source, providesa complete description of the variable x-ray spectrum. a single model fits allthe data. we conclude that these zones are responsible for the red wing, itsapparent lack of variability, the absorption structure around the fe k-alphaline, the soft-band "excess" and the high flux seen in the hard x-ray band. arelativistically-blurred fe line is not required in this model. we suggest thepartial covering zone is a clumpy wind from the accretion disk.

1410.8769	cfhtlens: weak lensing calibrated scaling relations for low mass  clusters of galaxies	we present weak lensing and x-ray analysis of 12 low mass clusters from thecfhtlens and xmm-cfhtls surveys. we combine these systems with high-masssystems from cccp and low-mass systems from cosmos to obtain a sample of 70systems, spanning over two orders of magnitude in mass. we measure core-excisedlx-tx, m-lx and m-tx scaling relations and include corrections forobservational biases. by providing fully bias corrected relations, we give thecurrent limitations for lx and tx as cluster mass proxies. we demonstrate thattx benefits from a significantly lower intrinsic scatter at fixed mass than lx.by studying the residuals of the bias corrected relations, we show for thefirst time using weak lensing masses that galaxy groups seem more luminous andwarmer for their mass than clusters. this implies a steepening of the m-lx andm-tx relations at low masses. we verify the inferred steepening using adifferent high mass sample from the literature and show that variance betweensamples is the dominant effect leading to discrepant scaling relations. wedivide our sample into subsamples of merging and relaxed systems, and find thatmergers may have enhanced scatter in lensing measurements, most likely due tostronger triaxiality and more substructure. for the lx-tx relation, which isunaffected by lensing measurements, we find the opposite trend in scatter. wealso explore the effects of x-ray cross-calibration and find that chandracalibration leads to flatter lx-tx and m-tx relations than xmm-newton.

1502.02867	the galaxy-halo connection from a joint lensing, clustering and  abundance analysis in the cfhtlens/vipers field	we present new constraints on the relationship between galaxies and theirhost dark matter halos, measured from the location of the peak of thestellar-to-halo mass ratio (shmr), up to the most massive galaxy clusters atredshift $z\sim0.8$ and over a volume of nearly 0.1~gpc$^3$. we use a uniquecombination of deep observations in the cfhtlens/vipers field from the near-uvto the near-ir, supplemented by $\sim60\,000$ secure spectroscopic redshifts,analysing galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing and the stellar massfunction. we interpret our measurements within the halo occupation distribution(hod) framework, separating the contributions from central and satellitegalaxies. we find that the shmr for the central galaxies peaks at $m_{\rm h,peak} = 1.9^{+0.2}_{-0.1}\times10^{12} m_{\odot}$ with an amplitude of $0.025$,which decreases to $\sim0.001$ for massive halos ($m_{\rm h} &gt; 10^{14}m_{\odot}$). compared to central galaxies only, the total shmr (includingsatellites) is boosted by a factor 10 in the high-mass regime (cluster-sizehalos), a result consistent with cluster analyses from the literature based onfully independent methods. after properly accounting for differences inmodelling, we have compared our results with a large number of results from theliterature up to $z=1$: we find good general agreement, independently of themethod used, within the typical stellar-mass systematic errors at low tointermediate mass (${m}_{\star} &lt; 10^{11} m_{\odot}$) and the statisticalerrors above. we have also compared our shmr results to semi-analyticsimulations and found that the shmr is tilted compared to our measurements insuch a way that they over- (under-) predict star formation efficiency incentral (satellite) galaxies.

1502.04575	cfhtlens: a gaussian likelihood is a sufficient approximation for a  cosmological analysis of third-order cosmic shear statistics	we study the correlations of the shear signal between triplets of sources inthe canada-france-hawaii lensing survey (cfhtlens) to probe cosmologicalparameters via the matter bispectrum. in contrast to previous studies, weadopted a non-gaussian model of the data likelihood which is supported by oursimulations of the survey. we find that for state-of-the-art surveys, similarto cfhtlens, a gaussian likelihood analysis is a reasonable approximation,albeit small differences in the parameter constraints are already visible. forfuture surveys we expect that a gaussian model becomes inaccurate. ouralgorithm for a refined non-gaussian analysis and data compression is then ofgreat utility especially because it is not much more elaborate if simulateddata are available. applying this algorithm to the third-order correlations ofshear alone in a blind analysis, we find a good agreement with the standardcosmological model: $\sigma_8$=$\sigma_8$ $(\omega_{\rmm}/0.27)^{0.64}$=$0.79^{+0.08}_{-0.11}$ for a flat $\lambda\rm cdm$ cosmologywith $h=0.7\pm0.04$ ($68\%$ credible interval). nevertheless our models provideonly moderately good fits as indicated by $\chi^2/{\rm dof}=2.9$, including a$20\%$ r.m.s. uncertainty in the predicted signal amplitude. the models cannotexplain a signal drop on scales around 15 arcmin, which may be caused bysystematics. it is unclear whether the discrepancy can be fully explained byresidual psf systematics of which we find evidence at least on scales of a fewarcmin. therefore we need a better understanding of higher-order correlationsof cosmic shear and their systematics to confidently apply them as cosmologicalprobes.

1507.00735	dark matter halo properties of gama galaxy groups from 100 square  degrees of kids weak lensing data	the kilo-degree survey (kids) is an optical wide-field survey designed to mapthe matter distribution in the universe using weak gravitational lensing. inthis paper, we use these data to measure the density profiles and masses of asample of $\sim \mathrm{1400}$ spectroscopically identified galaxy groups andclusters from the galaxy and mass assembly (gama) survey. we detect a highlysignificant signal (signal-to-noise-ratio $\sim$ 120), allowing us to study theproperties of dark matter haloes over one and a half order of magnitude inmass, from $m \sim 10^{13}-10^{14.5} h^{-1}\mathrm{m_{\odot}}$. we interpretthe results for various subsamples of groups using a halo model framework whichaccounts for the mis-centring of the brightest cluster galaxy (used as thetracer of the group centre) with respect to the centre of the group's darkmatter halo. we find that the density profiles of the haloes are well describedby an nfw profile with concentrations that agree with predictions fromnumerical simulations. in addition, we constrain scaling relations between themass and a number of observable group properties. we find that the mass scaleswith the total r-band luminosity as a power-law with slope $1.16 \pm 0.13$(1-sigma) and with the group velocity dispersion as a power-law with slope$1.89 \pm 0.27$ (1-sigma). finally, we demonstrate the potential of weaklensing studies of groups to discriminate between models of baryonic feedbackat group scales by comparing our results with the predictions from thecosmo-overwhelmingly large simulations (cosmo-owls) project, ruling out modelswithout agn feedback.

0805.3413	a semi-empirical simulation of the extragalactic radio continuum sky for  next generation radio telescopes	we have developed a semi-empirical simulation of the extragalactic radiocontinuum sky suitable for aiding the design of next generation radiointerferometers such as the square kilometre array (ska). the emphasis is onmodelling the large-scale cosmological distribution of radio sources ratherthan the internal details of individual galaxies. here we provide a descriptionof the simulation to accompany the online release of a catalogue of 320 millionsimulated radio sources. the simulation covers 20x20 deg^2 - a plausible upperlimit to the instantaneous field of view attainable with future (e.g. ska)aperture array technologies - out to redshift z=20, and down to flux densitylimits of 10 njy at 151, 610 mhz, 1.4, 4.86 and 18 ghz. five distinct sourcetypes are included: radio-quiet agn, radio-loud agn of the fri and friistructural classes, and star-forming galaxies, the latter split intopopulations of quiescent and starbursting galaxies.  in our semi-empirical approach, the simulated sources are drawn from observed(or extrapolated) luminosity functions and grafted onto an underlying darkmatter density field with biases which reflect their measured large-scaleclustering. a numerical press-schechter-style filtering of the density field isused to identify and populate clusters of galaxies. radio source structures arebuilt from point source and elliptical sub-components, and for fri and friisources an orientation-based unification and beaming model is used to partitionflux between the core and extended lobes and hotspots. the simulation outputcan be post-processed to achieve more complete agreement with observationaldata in the years ahead, with the aim of using these 'idealised skies' intelescope simulators to optimise the design of the ska itself (abridged).

1511.07107	the global implications of the hard excess ii: analysis of the local  population of radio quiet agn	active galactic nuclei (agn) show evidence for reprocessing gas, outflowingfrom the accreting black hole. the combined effects of absorption andscattering from the circumnuclear material likely explains the `hard excess' ofx-ray emission above 20 kev, compared with extrapolation of spectra from lowerx-ray energies. in a recent {\it suzaku} study, we established the ubiquitoushard excess in hard x-ray-selected, radio-quiet type\,1 agns to be consistentwith reprocessing of the x-ray continuum an ensemble of clouds, located tens tohundreds of gravitational radii from the nuclear black hole. here we add hardx-ray-selected, type\,2 agn to extend our original study and show that thegross x-ray spectral properties of the entire local population of radio quietagn may be described by a simple unified scheme. we find a broad, continuousdistribution of spectral hardness ratio and fe\,k$\alpha$ equivalent widthacross all agn types, which can be reproduced by varying the observer'ssightline through a single, simple model cloud ensemble, provided the radiativetransfer through the model cloud distribution includes not only photoelectricabsorption but also 3d compton scattering. variation in other parameters of thecloud distribution, such as column density or ionisation, should be expectedbetween agn, but such variation is not required to explain the gross x-rayspectral properties.

0807.1155	constraining the quasar population with the broad-line width  distribution	we measure the width of the mgii $\lambda2799$ line in quasar spectra fromthe sdss, 2qz and 2slaq surveys and, by invoking an unnormalised virial massestimator, relate the scatter in line width to the scatter in mass in theunderlying black hole population. we find conclusive evidence for a trend suchthat there is less scatter in line width, and hence black hole mass, in moreluminous objects.  however, the most luminous objects in our sample show such a low degree ofscatter in line width that, when combined with measures for the intrinsicscatter in the radius-luminosity relation for the broad-line region in activegalaxies, an inconsistency arises in the virial technique for estimating blackhole masses. this analysis implies that, at least for the most luminousquasars, either there is little-to-no intrinsic scatter in theradius-luminosity relation or the mgii broad emission line region is nottotally dominated by virial velocities.  finally we exploit the measured scatter in line widths to constrain modelsfor the velocity field of the broad-line region. we show that the lack ofscatter in broad line-widths for luminous quasars is inconsistent with a pureplanar/disk-like geometry for the broad-line region...

astro-ph;0002328	an analytic model for the epoch of halo creation	in this paper we describe the bayesian link between the cosmological massfunction and the distribution of times at which isolated halos of a given massexist. by assuming that clumps of dark matter undergo monotonic growth on thetime-scales of interest, this distribution of times is also the distribution of`creation' times of the halos. this monotonic growth is an inevitable aspect ofgravitational instability. the spherical top-hat collapse model is used toestimate the rate at which clumps of dark matter collapse. this gives the priorfor the creation time given no information about halo mass. applying bayes'theorem then allows any mass function to be converted into a distribution oftimes at which halos of a given mass are created. this general result coversboth gaussian and non-gaussian models. we also demonstrate how the massfunction and the creation time distribution can be combined to give a jointdensity function, and discuss the relation between the time distribution ofmajor merger events and the formula calculated. finally, we determine thecreation time of halos within three n-body simulations, and compare the linkbetween the mass function and creation rate with the analytic theory.

astro-ph;0005368	the 2df qso redshift survey - i. the optical qso luminosity function	we present a determination of the optical qso luminosity function and itscosmological evolution with redshift for a sample of over 6000 qsos identifiedprimarily from the first observations of the 2df qso redshift survey (2qz). forqsos with -26 &lt; m_b &lt; -23 and 0.35 &lt; z &lt; 2.3, we find that pure luminosityevolution (ple) models provide an acceptable fit to the observed redshiftdependence of the luminosity function. the luminosity function is best fit by atwo-power-law function of the form. exponential luminosity evolution models,both as a function of look-back time, and as a general second-order polynomialwith redshift, were found to provide acceptable fits to the dataset comprisingthe 2qz and the large bright quasar survey. exponential evolution withlook-back time is prefered for q_0=0.05, while the polynomial evolution modelis prefered for q_0=0.5. the shape and evolution of the lf at low redshifts(z&lt;0.5) and/or high luminosities, not currently well sampled by the 2df qsosurvey, may show departures from pure luminosity evolution, but the resultspresented here show that over a significant range of redshift, ple is a gooddescription of qso evolution.

astro-ph;0012375	the 2df qso redshift survey - ii. structure and evolution at high  redshift	we present a clustering analysis of qsos over the redshift range z=0.3-2.9.we use a sample of 10558 qsos taken from the preliminary catalogue of the 2dfqso redshift survey (2qz). the two-point redshift-space correlation function ofqsos is shown to follow a power law on scales s~1-35h-1mpc. fitting a power lawto qso clustering averaged over the redshift interval 0.3&lt;z&lt;2.9 we finds_0=3.99+0.28-0.34h-1mpc and gamma=1.58+0.10-0.09 for an einstein-de sittercosmology (eds). with omega_0=0.3 and lambda_0=0.7 the power law extends tos~60h-1mpc with a best fit of s_0=5.69+0.42-0.50h-1mpc andgamma=1.56+0.10-0.09. these values, measured at a mean redshift of z=1.49, arecomparable to the clustering of local optically selected galaxies. we measurethe evolution of qso clustering as a function of redshift. for an eds cosmologythere is no evolution in comoving coordinates over the redshift range of the2qz. for omega_0=0.3 and lambda_0=0.7 qso clustering shows a marginal increaseat high redshift. although the clustering of qsos is measured on large scaleswhere linear theory should apply, the evolution of qso clustering does notfollow the linear theory predictions for growth via gravitational instability(rejected at the &gt;99 per cent confidence level). a redshift dependent bias isrequired to reconcile qso clustering observations with theory. a simple biasingmodel, in which qsos have cosmologically long lifetimes (or alternatively formin peaks above a constant threshold in the density field) is acceptable in aneds cosmology, but is only marginally acceptable if omega_0=0.3 andlambda_0=0.7. biasing models which assume qsos form over a range in redshift,based on the press-schechter formalism are approximately consistent with qsoclustering evolution (abridged).

astro-ph;0102163	the 2df qso redshift survey - iv. the qso power spectrum from the 10k  catalogue	(abridged) we present a power spectrum analysis of the 10k catalogue from the2df qso redshift survey. we compare the redshift-space power spectra of qsos tothose measured for galaxies and abell clusters at low redshift and find thatthey show similar shapes in their overlap range, 50-150h^{-1}mpc, withp_qso(k)\propto k^{-1.4}. the amplitude of the qso power spectrum at z~1.4 isalmost comparable to that of galaxies at the present day if omega_m=0.3 andomega_lambda=0.7 (the lambda cosmology), and a factor of ~3 lower if omega_m=1(the eds cosmology) is assumed. the amplitude of the qso power spectrum is afactor of ~10 lower than that measured for abell clusters at the present day.at larger scales, the qso power spectra continue to rise robustly to ~400h^{-1}mpc, implying more power at large scales than in the apm galaxy powerspectrum measured by baugh &amp; efstathiou.  we split the qso sample into two redshift bins and find little evolution inthe amplitude of the power spectrum. the qso power spectrum may show a spikefeature at ~90h^{-1}mpc assuming the lambda cosmology or ~65 h^{-1}mpc assumingan eds cosmology. although the spike appears to reproduce in both the north andsouth strips and in two independent redshift ranges, its statisticalsignificance is still marginal and more data is needed to test further itsreality.  we compare the qso power spectra to cdm models to obtain a constraint on theshape parameter, gamma. for two choices of cosmology (omega_m=1, omega_lambda=0and omega_m=0.3, omega_lambda=0.7), we find the best fit model has gamma~0.1+-0.1.

astro-ph;0106012	the 2df qso redshift survey - vi. measuring lambda and beta from  redshift-space distortions in the power spectrum	when the 2df qso redshift survey (2qz) is complete, a powerful geometric testfor the cosmological constant will be available. by comparing the clusteringalong and across the line of sight and modelling the effects of peculiarvelocities and bulk motions in redshift space, geometric distortions, whichoccur if the wrong cosmology is assumed, can be detected.  in this paper we investigate the effect of geometric and redshift-spacedistortions in the power spectrum parallel and perpendicular to the observer'sline of sight. ballinger et al. developed a model to estimate the cosmologicalconstant, $\lambda$, and the important parameter $\beta \approx\omega_m^{0.6}/b$ from these distortions. we apply this model to a detailedsimulation of the final 25k 2qz, produced using the virgo consortium's huge{\it hubble volume} n-body $\lambda$-cdm light cone simulation. we confirm theconclusions of ballinger et al.; the shape of the redshift-space and geometricdistortions are very similar. when all the uncertainties are taken into accountwe find that only a joint $\lambda - \beta$ constraint is possible.  by combining this result with a second constraint based on mass clusteringevolution, however, we can make significant progress. we predict that thismethod should allow us to constrain $\beta$ to approximately $\pm0.1$, and$\omega_{m}$ to $\pm0.25$ using the final catalogue. we apply the method to the2qz catalogue of 10000 qsos and find that this incomplete catalogue marginallyfavours a $\lambda$ cosmology.

astro-ph;0308436	the host galaxies of luminous quasars	we present results of a deep hst/wfpc2 imaging study of 17 quasars at z~0.4,designed to determine the properties of their host galaxies. the sampleconsists of quasars with absolute magnitudes in the range -24&gt;m_v&gt;-28, allowingus to investigate host galaxy properties across a decade in quasar luminosity,but at a single redshift. we find that the hosts of all the rlqs, and all therqqs with nuclear luminosities m_v&lt;-24, are massive bulge-dominated galaxies,confirming and extending the trends deduced from our previous studies. from thebest-fitting model host galaxies we have estimated spheroid and black-holemasses, and the efficiency (with respect to eddington luminosity) with whicheach quasar is radiating. the largest inferred black-hole mass in our sample is\~3.10^9 m_sun, comparable to those at the centres of m87 and cygnus a. we findno evidence for super-eddington accretion in even the most luminous objects. weinvestigate the role of scatter in the black-hole:spheroid mass relation indetermining the ratio of quasar to host-galaxy luminosity, by generatingsimulated populations of quasars lying in hosts with a schechter mass function.within the subsample of the highest luminosity quasars, the observed variationin nuclear-host luminosity ratio is consistent with being the result of thescatter in the black-hole:spheroid relation. quasars with high nuclear-hostratios can be explained by sub-eddington accretion onto black holes in thehigh-mass tail of the black-hole:spheroid relation. our results imply that,owing to the schechter cutoff, host mass should not continue to increaselinearly with quasar luminosity, at the very highest luminosities. any quasarsmore luminous than m_v=-27 should be found in massive elliptical hosts which atthe present day would have m_v ~ -24.5.

astro-ph;0403040	the 2df qso redshift survey - xii. the spectroscopic catalogue and  luminosity function	we present the final catalogue of the 2df qso redshift survey (2qz), based onanglo-australian telescope 2df spectroscopic observations of 44576colour-selected (u b_j r) objects with 18.25&lt;b_j&lt;20.85 selected from apm scansof uk schmidt telescope (ukst) photographic plates. the 2qz comprises 23338qsos, 12292 galactic stars (including 2071 white dwarfs) and 4558 compactnarrow-emission-line galaxies. we obtained a reliable spectroscopicidentification for 86 per cent of objects observed with 2df. we also report onthe 6df qso redshift survey (6qz), based on ukst 6df observations of 1564brighter 16&lt;b_j&lt;18.25 sources selected from the same photographic inputcatalogue. in total, we identified 322 qsos spectroscopically in the 6qz. thecompleted 2qz is, by more than a factor 50, the largest homogeneous qsocatalogue ever constructed at these faint limits (b_j&lt;20.85) and high qsosurface densities (35 qsos deg^-2). as such it represents an important resourcein the study of the universe at moderate-to-high redshifts. as an example ofthe results possible with the 2qz, we also present our most recent analysis ofthe optical qso luminosity function and its cosmological evolution withredshift. for a flat, omega_m=0.3 and omega_lam=0.7, universe, we find that adouble power law with luminosity evolution that is exponential in look-backtime, t, of the form l*(z) exp(6.15t), equivalent to an e-folding time of 2gyr,provides an acceptable fit to the redshift dependence of the qso luminosityfunction over the range 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 2.1 and m_bj&lt;-22.5. evolution described by aquadratic in redshift is also an acceptable fit, with l*(z)~10^(1.39z-0.29z^2).

astro-ph;0403065	200 mpc sized structure in the 2df qso redshift survey	the completed 2df qso redshift (2qz) survey has been used to search forextreme large-scale cosmological structure (around 200 mpc) over the redshiftrange 0&lt;z&lt;2.5. we demonstrate that statistically significant overdensities andunderdensities do exist and hence represent the detection of cosmologicalfluctuations on comoving scales that correspond to those presently detected inthe cosmic microwave background. however, the fractional overdensities onscales &gt;100mpc are in the linear or only weakly non-linear regime and do notrepresent collapsed non-linear structures. we compare the measurements with theexpectation of a standard lcdm model by measuring the variance of counts incells and find that, provided the distribution of qsos on large scales exhibitsa mild bias with respect to the distribution of dark matter, the observedfluctuations are found to be in good agreement with the model. there is noevidence on such scales for any extreme structures that might require, forexample, departures from the assumption of gaussian initial perturbations. thusthe power-spectrum derived from the 2qz survey appears to provide a completedescription of the distribution of qsos. the amount of bias and its redshiftdependence that is required is consistent with that found from studying theclustering of 2qz qsos on 10 mpc scales, and may be adequately described by anapproximately redshift-invariant power spectrum with normalisation sigma_8=1.0corresponding to a bias at z=0 of b=1.1 rising to b=2 at the survey's meanredshift z=1.5.

astro-ph;0409314	the 2df qso redshift survey - xiv. structure and evolution from the  two-point correlation function	we present a clustering analysis of qsos using over 20000 objects from thefinal catalogue of the 2df qso redshift survey (2qz), measuring the z-spacecorrelation function, xi(s). when averaged over the range 0.3&lt;z&lt;2.2 we findthat xi(s) is flat on small scales, steepening on scales above ~25h-1mpc. in awmap/2df cosmology we find a best fit power law with s_0=5.48+0.42-0.48h-1mpcand gamma=1.20+-0.10 on scales s=1-25h-1mpc. a cdm model assuming wmap/2dfcosmological parameters is a good description of the qso xi(s) after accountingfor non-linear clustering and z-space distortions, and a linear bias ofb_qso(z=1.35)=2.02+-0.07. we subdivide the 2qz into 10 redshift intervals fromz=0.53 to 2.48 and find a significant increase in clustering amplitude at highredshift in the wmap/2df cosmology. we derive the bias of the qsos which is astrong function of redshift with b_qso(z=0.53)=1.13+-0.18 andb_qso(z=2.48)=4.24+-0.53. we use these bias values to derive the mean darkmatter halo (dmh) mass occupied by the qsos. at all redshifts 2qz qsos inhabitapproximately the same mass dmhs with m_dh=(3.0+-1.6)x10^12h-1m_sun, which isclose to the characteristic mass in the press-schechter mass function, m*, atz=0. if the relation between black hole (bh) mass and m_dh or host velocitydispersion does not evolve, then we find that the accretion efficiency(l/l_edd) for l* qsos is approximately constant with redshift. thus the fadingof the qso population from z~2 to 0 appears to be due to less massive bhs beingactive at low redshift. we apply different methods to estimate, t_qso, theactive lifetime of qsos and constrain this to be in the range 4x10^6-6x10^8years at z~2.

astro-ph;0502481	on statistical lensing and the anti-correlation between 2df qsos and  foreground galaxies	we cross-correlate apm and sdss galaxies with background qsos from the 2dfqso redshift survey, and detect a significant (2.8sigma) anti-correlation. thelack of a signal between 2df stars and our galaxy samples suggests theanti-correlation is not due to a systematic error. the possibility that dust inthe foreground galaxies could produce the anti-correlation is marginallyrejected, at the 2sigma level through consideration of qso colours. it ispossible that dust that obscures qsos without reddening them, or preferentiallydiscards reddened qsos from the 2qz sample, could produce such ananti-correlation, however, such models are at odds with the positive qso-galaxycorrelations found at bright magnitudes by other authors. our detection of agalaxy-qso anti-correlation is consistent with statistical lensing theory. whencombined with earlier results that have reported a positive galaxy-qsocorrelation, a consistent, compelling picture emerges that spans faint andbright qso samples showing positive or negative correlations according to theqso n(m) slope. we find that galaxies are highly anti-biased on small scales.we consider two models that use different descriptions of the lensing matterand find they yield consistent predictions for the strength of galaxy bias on0.1mpc/h scales of b~0.1 (for lcdm). whilst the slope of our power-law fit tothe qso-galaxy cross-correlation does not rule out linear bias, when we compareour measurement of b on 100 kpc/h scales to independent methods that determineb~1 on mpc/h scales, we conclude that bias, on these small scales, isscale-dependent. these results indicate more mass, at least on the 100 kpc/hscales probed, than predicted by simple lcdm biasing prescriptions, and canthus constrain halo occupation models of the galaxy distribution.

astro-ph;0504438	the 2df qso redshift survey - xv. correlation analysis of redshift-space  distortions	we analyse the redshift-space (z-space) distortions of qso clustering in the2df qso redshift survey (2qz). to interpret the z-space correlation function,xi(sigma,pi), we require an accurate model for the qso real-space correlationfunction, xi(r). although a single power-law xi(r) model fits the projectedcorrelation function (wp(sigma)) at small scales, it implies somewhat tooshallow a slope for both wp(sigma) and the z-space correlation function, xi(s),at larger scales &gt; 20 h^(-1) mpc. motivated by the form for xi(r) seen in the2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) and in standard lcdm predictions, we use adouble power-law model for xi(r) which gives a good fit to xi(s) and wp(sigma).the model is parametrized by a slope of gamma=1.45 for 1&lt;r&lt;10 h^(-1) mpc andgamma=2.30 for 10&lt;r&lt;40 h^(-1) mpc. as found for 2dfgrs, the value of betadetermined from the ratio of xi(s)/xi(r) depends sensitively on the form ofxi(r) assumed. with our double power-law form for xi(r), we measurebeta(z=1.4)=0.32(+0.09)(-0.11). assuming the same model for xi(r) we thenanalyse the z-space distortions in the 2qz xi(sigma,pi) and put constraints onthe values of omega m and beta(z=1.4), using an improved version of the methodof hoyle et al. the constraints we derive are omega m=0.35(+0.19)(-0.13),beta(z=1.4)=0.50(+0.13)(-0.15), in agreement with our xi(s)/\xi(r) results atthe ~1 sigma level.

astro-ph;0506223	evidence for orbital motion of material close to the central black hole  of mrk 766	time-resolved x-ray spectroscopy has been obtained for the narrow lineseyfert galaxy mrk766 from xmm-newton observations. we present analysis in theenergy-time plane of epic pn data in the 4-8 kev band with energy resolutionr~50. a component of fe ka emission detected in the maps shows a variation ofphoton energy with time that appears both to be statistically significant andto be consistent with sinusoidal variation. we investigate the interpretationthat there exists a component of line emission from matter in a keplerian orbitaround a supermassive black hole. the orbit has a period ~165 ks and aline-of-sight velocity ~13,500 km/s. this yields a lower limit for the centralmass of m &gt; 4.9x10^5 solar masses within a radius of 3.6 x 10^13 cm (2.4 a.u.).the orbit parameters are consistent with higher black hole masses, but the lackof any substantial gravitational redshift of the orbit implies an upper limitto the black hole mass of 4.5x10^7 solar masses.

astro-ph;0608202	the cosmological history of accretion onto dark halos and supermassive  black holes	aims: we investigate the cosmological growth of dark halos and follow theconsequences of coeval growth for the accretion history of associatedsupermassive black holes. methods: the press-schechter approximation is used toobtain an analytic expression for the mean rate of growth of dark matter halos.dark halo accretion rates are compared with numerical work and the consequencesfor understanding agn evolution are described. results: the mean accretion rateonto dark matter halos is shown to have a simple analytic form that agrees withprevious numerical work and that may easily be calculated for a wide range ofhalo mass, redshift and cosmological parameters. the result offers asignificant improvement over published fitting formulae deduced from mergertrees. we then consider the growth of associated supermassive black holes, andmake a basic test of the simple hypothesis of `pure coeval evolution' (pce) inwhich, on average, black hole growth tracks dark halo growth. we demonstratethat both the absolute value of the integrated agn bolometric luminositydensity and its cosmological evolution derived from hard x-ray surveys arewell-reproduced by pce. excellent agreement is found at z &gt;~ 0.5, although theobserved luminosity density drops by a factor 2 compared with pce by z=0: blackhole growth appears to decouple from halo growth at low redshifts, and this maybe related to the phenomenon of `cosmic downsizing'. overall, agn evolutionappears either to be caused by or to be closely linked to the slow-down in thegrowth of cosmic structure. we also discuss the mean eddington ratio averagedover all galaxies, which is predicted to show strong evolution to higher valueswith redshift.

astro-ph;9906204	cosmological evolution &amp; hierarchical galaxy formation	we calculate the rate at which dark matter halos merge to form higher masssystems. two complementary derivations using press-schechter theory are given,both of which result in the same equation for the formation rate. first, aderivation using the properties of the brownian random walks within theframework of press-schechter theory is presented. we then use bayes' theorem toobtain the same result from the standard press-schechter mass function. therate obtained is shown to be in good agreement with results from monte-carloand n-body simulations. we illustrate the usefulness of this formula bycalculating the expected cosmological evolution in the rate of star formationthat is due to short-lived, merger-induced starbursts. the calculated evolutionis well-matched to the observed evolution in ultraviolet luminosity density, incontrast to the lower rates of evolution that are derived from semi-analyticmodels that do not include a dominant contribution from starbursts. hence wesuggest that the bulk of the observed ultraviolet starlight at z &gt; 1 arisesfrom short-lived, merger-induced starbursts. finally, we show that a simplemerging-halo model can also account for the bulk of the observed evolution inthe comoving quasar space density.
