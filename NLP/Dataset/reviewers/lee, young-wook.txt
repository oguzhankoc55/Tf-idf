0903.3015	the star formation law at low surface density	we investigate the nature of the star formation law at low gas surfacedensities using a sample of 19 low surface brightness (lsb) galaxies withexisting hi maps in the literature, uv imaging from the galaxy evolutionexplorer satellite, and optical images from the sloan digital sky survey. allof the lsb galaxies have (nuv-r) colors similar to those for higher surfacebrightness star-forming galaxies of similar luminosity indicating that theiraverage star formation histories are not very different. based upon four lsbgalaxies with both uv and fir data, we find fir/uv ratios significantly lessthan one, implying low amounts of internal uv extinction in lsb galaxies. weuse the uv images and hi maps to measure the star formation rate and hydrogengas surface densities within the same region for all of the galaxies. the lsbgalaxy star formation rate surface densities lie below the extrapolation of thepower law fit to the star formation rate surface density as a function of thetotal gas density for higher surface brightness galaxies. although there ismore scatter, the lsb galaxies also lie below a second version of the starformation law in which the star formation rate surface density is correlatedwith the gas density divided by the orbital time in the disk. the downturn seenin both star formation laws is consistent with theoretical models that predictlower star formation efficiencies in lsb galaxies due to the decliningmolecular fraction with decreasing density.

0706.3938	the uv-optical galaxy color-magnitude diagram i: basic properties	we have analyzed the bivariate distribution of galaxies as a function ofultraviolet-optical colors and absolute magnitudes in the local universe. thesample consists of galaxies with redshifts and optical photometry from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss) main galaxy sample matched with detections inthe near-ultraviolet (nuv) and far-ultraviolet (fuv) bands in the mediumimaging survey being carried out by the galaxy evolution explorer (galex)satellite. in the (nuv-r)_{0.1} vs. m_{r,0.1} galaxy color-magnitude diagram,the galaxies separate into two well-defined blue and red sequences. the(nuv-r)_{0.1} color distribution at each m_{r,0.1} is not well fit by the sumof two gaussians due to an excess of galaxies in between the two sequences. thepeaks of both sequences become redder with increasing luminosity with adistinct blue peak visible up to m_{r,0.1}\sim-23. the r_{0.1}-band luminosityfunctions vary systematically with color, with the faint end slope andcharacteristic luminosity gradually increasing with color. after correcting forattenuation due to dust, we find that approximately one quarter of the colorvariation along the blue sequence is due to dust with the remainder due to starformation history and metallicity. finally, we present the distribution ofgalaxies as a function of specific star formation rate and stellar mass. thespecific star formation rates imply that galaxies along the blue sequenceprogress from low mass galaxies with star formation rates that increasesomewhat with time to more massive galaxies with a more or less constant starformation rate. above a stellar mass of ~10^10.5 m_{sun}, galaxies with lowratios of current to past averaged star formation rate begin to dominate.

0707.1878	the young and the dustless: interpreting radio observations of  ultraviolet luminous galaxies	ultraviolet luminous galaxies (uvlgs) have been identified as intenselystar-forming, nearby galaxies. a subset of these, the supercompact uvlgs, arebelieved to be local analogs of high redshift lyman break galaxies. here weinvestigate the radio continuum properties of this important population for thefirst time. we have observed 42 supercompact uvlgs with the vla, all of whichhave extensive coverage in the uv/optical by galex and sdss. our analysisincludes comparison samples of multiwavelength data from the spitzer first looksurvey and from the sdss-galex matched catalogs. in addition we have spitzermips data for 24 of our galaxies and find that they fall on the radio-fircorrelation of normal star-forming galaxies. we find that our galaxies havelower radio-to-uv ratios and lower balmer decrements than other local galaxieswith similar (high) star formation rates. optical spectra show they have lowerdn(4000) and hdeltaa indices, higher hbeta emission-line equivalents widths,and higher [oiii]5007/hbeta emission-line ratios than normal star forminggalaxies. comparing these results to galaxy spectral evolution models weconclude that supercompact uvlgs are distinguished from normal star forminggalaxies firstly by their high specific star formation rates. moreover,compared to other types of galaxies with similar star formation rates, theyhave significantly less dust attenuation. in both regards they are similar tolyman break galaxies. this suggests that the process that causes star formationin the supercompact uvlgs differs from other local star forming galaxies, butmay be similar to lyman break galaxies.

0911.0690	the local hosts of type ia supernovae	we use multi-wavelength, matched aperture, integrated photometry from galex,sdss and the rc3 to estimate the physical properties of 166 nearby galaxieshosting 168 well-observed type ia supernovae (sne ia). our data corroboratewell-known features that have been seen in other sn ia samples. specifically,hosts with active star formation produce brighter and slower sne ia on average,and hosts with luminosity-weighted ages older than 1 gyr produce on averagemore faint, fast and fewer bright, slow sne ia than younger hosts. new resultsinclude that in our sample, the faintest and fastest sne ia occur only ingalaxies exceeding a stellar mass threshhold of ~10^10 m_sun, indicating thattheir progenitors must arise in populations that are older and/or more metalrich than the general sn ia population. a low host extinction sub-sample hintsat a residual trend in peak luminosity with host age, after correcting forlight-curve shape, giving the appearance that older hosts produceless-extincted sne ia on average. this has implications for cosmologicalfitting of sne ia and suggests that host age could be useful as a parameter inthe fitting. converting host mass to metallicity and computing 56ni mass fromthe supernova light curves, we find that our local sample is consistent with amodel that predicts a shallow trend between stellar metallicity and the 56nimass that powers the explosion, but we cannot rule out the absence of a trend.we measure a correlation between 56ni mass and host age in the local universethat is shallower and not as significant as that seen at higher redshifts. thedetails of the age -- 56ni mass correlations at low and higher redshift imply aluminosity-weighted age threshhold of ~3 gyr for sn ia hosts, above which theyare less likely to produce sne ia with 56ni masses above ~0.5 m_sun.

0911.4798	enrichment by supernovae in globular clusters with multiple populations	the most massive globular cluster in the milky way, omega centauri, isthought to be the remaining core of a disrupted dwarf galaxy, as expectedwithin the model of hierarchical merging. it contains several stellarpopulations having different heavy elemental abundances supplied by supernovae-- a process known as metal enrichment. although m22 appears to be similar toomega cen, other peculiar globular clusters do not. therefore omega cen and m22are viewed as exceptional, and the presence of chemical inhomogeneities inother clusters is seen as `pollution' from the intermediate-massasymptotic-giant-branch stars expected in normal globular clusters. here wereport ca abundances for seven globular clusters and compare them to omega cen.calcium and other heavy elements can only be supplied through numeroussupernovae explosions of massive stars in these stellar systems, but thegravitational potentials of the present-day clusters cannot preserve most ofthe ejecta from such explosions. we conclude that these globular clusters, likeomega cen, are most probably the relics of more massive primeval dwarf galaxiesthat merged and disrupted to form the proto-galaxy.

0911.5356	the presence of two distinct red giant branches in the globular cluster  ngc 1851	there is a growing body of evidence for the presence of multiple stellarpopulations in some globular clusters, including ngc 1851. for most of thesepeculiar globular clusters, however, the evidence for the multiple redgiant-branches (rgbs) having different heavy elemental abundances as observedin omega centauri is hitherto lacking, although spreads in some lighterelements are reported. it is therefore not clear whether they also share thesuggested dwarf galaxy origin of omega cen or not. here we show from the ctio4m uvi photometry of the globular cluster ngc 1851 that its rgb is clearlysplit into two in the u - i color. the two distinct rgb populations are alsoclearly separated in the abundance of heavy elements as traced by calcium,suggesting that the type ii supernovae enrichment is also responsible, inaddition to the pollutions of lighter elements by intermediate mass asymptoticgiant branch stars or fast-rotating massive stars. the rgb split, however, isnot shown in the v - i color, as indicated by previous observations. ourstellar population models show that this and the presence of bimodalhorizontal-branch distribution in ngc 1851 can be naturally reproduced if themetal-rich second generation stars are also enhanced in helium.

0912.3540	a wide-field photometric survey for extratidal tails around five  metal-poor globular clusters in the galactic halo	wide-field deep gri images obtained with the megacam of thecanada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht) are used to investigate the spatialconfiguration of stars around five metal-poor globular cluster m15, m30, m53,ngc 5053, and ngc 5466, in a field-of-view ~3 degree. applying a mask filteringalgorithm to the color-magnitude diagrams of the observed stars, we sortedcluster's member star candidates that are used to examine the characteristicsof the spatial stellar distribution surrounding the target clusters. thesmoothed surface density maps and the overlaid isodensity contours indicatethat all of the five metal-poor globular clusters exhibit strong evidence ofextratidal overdensity features over their tidal radii, in the form of extendedtidal tails around the clusters. the orientations of the observed extratidalfeatures show signatures of tidal tails tracing the clusters' orbits, inferredfrom their proper motions, and effects of dynamical interactions with thegalaxy. our findings include detections of a tidal bridge-like feature and anenvelope structure around the pair of globular clusters m53 and ngc 5053. theobserved radial surface density profiles of target clusters have a deviationfrom theoretical king models, for which the profiles show a break at0.5~0.7r_t, extending the overdensity features out to 1.5~2r_t. both radialsurface density profiles for different angular sections and azimuthal numberdensity profiles confirm the overdensity features of tidal tails around thefive metal-poor globular clusters. our results add further observationalevidence that the observed metal-poor halo globular clusters originate from anaccreted satellite system, indicative of the merging scenario of the formationof the galactic halo.

1004.3382	the uv-optical color dependence of galaxy clustering in the local  universe	we measure the uv-optical color dependence of galaxy clustering in the localuniverse. using the clean separation of the red and blue sequences madepossible by the nuv - r color-magnitude diagram, we segregate the galaxies intored, blue and intermediate "green" classes. we explore the clustering as afunction of this segregation by removing the dependence on luminosity and byexcluding edge-on galaxies as a means of a non-model dependent veto of highlyextincted galaxies. we find that \xi (r_p, \pi) for both red and green galaxiesshows strong redshift space distortion on small scales -- the "finger-of-god"effect, with green galaxies having a lower amplitude than is seen for the redsequence, and the blue sequence showing almost no distortion. on large scales,\xi (r_p, \pi) for all three samples show the effect of large-scale streamingfrom coherent infall. on scales 1 mpc/h &lt; r_p &lt; 10 mpc/h, the projectedauto-correlation function w_p(r_p) for red and green galaxies fits a power-lawwith slope \gamma ~ 1.93 and amplitude r_0 ~ 7.5 and 5.3, compared with \gamma~ 1.75 and r_0 ~ 3.9 mpc/h for blue sequence galaxies. compared to theclustering of a fiducial l* galaxy, the red, green, and blue have a relativebias of 1.5, 1.1, and 0.9 respectively. the w_p(r_p) for blue galaxies displayan increase in convexity at ~ 1 mpc/h, with an excess of large scaleclustering. our results suggest that the majority of blue galaxies are likelycentral galaxies in less massive halos, while red and green galaxies havelarger satellite fractions, and preferentially reside in virialized structures.if blue sequence galaxies migrate to the red sequence via processes likemergers or quenching that take them through the green valley, such atransformation may be accompanied by a change in environment in addition to anychange in luminosity and color.

1011.3512	the extreme hosts of extreme supernovae	we use galex ultraviolet (uv) and optical integrated photometry of the hostsof seventeen luminous supernovae (lsne, having peak m_v &lt; -21) and compare themto a sample of 26,000 galaxies from a cross-match between the sdss dr4 spectralcatalog and galex interim release 1.1. we place the lsne hosts on the galaxynuv-r versus m_r color magnitude diagram (cmd) with the larger sample toillustrate how extreme they are. the lsn hosts appear to favor low-densityregions of the galaxy cmd falling on the blue edge of the blue cloud toward thelow luminosity end. from the uv-optical photometry, we estimate the starformation history of the lsn hosts. the hosts have moderately low starformation rates (sfrs) and low stellar masses (m_*) resulting in high specificstar formation rates (ssfr). compared with the larger sample, the lsn hostsoccupy low-density regions of a diagram plotting ssfr versus m_* in the areahaving higher ssfr and lower m_*. this preference for low m_*, high ssfr hostsimplies the lsne are produced by an effect having to do with their localenvironment. the correlation of mass with metallicity suggests that perhapswind-driven mass loss is the factor that prevents lsne from arising inhigher-mass, higher-metallicity hosts. the massive progenitors of the lsne(&gt;100 m_sun), by appearing in low-sfr hosts, are potential tests for theoriesof the initial mass function that limit the maximum mass of a star based on thesfr.

1109.5178	nonlinear color-metallicity relations of globular clusters. iii. on the  discrepancy in metallicity between globular cluster systems and their parent  elliptical galaxies	one of the conundrums in extragalactic astronomy is the discrepancy inobserved metallicity distribution functions (mdfs) between the two primestellar components of early-type galaxies-globular clusters (gcs) and halofield stars. this is generally taken as evidence of highly decoupledevolutionary histories between gc systems and their parent galaxies. here weshow, however, that new developments in linking the observed gc colors to theirintrinsic metallicities suggest nonlinear color-to-metallicity conversions,which translate observed color distributions into strongly-peaked, unimodalmdfs with broad metal-poor tails. remarkably, the inferred gc mdfs are similarto the mdfs of resolved field stars in nearby elliptical galaxies and thoseproduced by chemical evolution models of galaxies. the gc mdf shape,characterized by a sharp peak with a metal-poor tail, indicates a virtuallycontinuous chemical enrichment with a relatively short timescale. thecharacteristic shape emerges across three orders of magnitude in the hostgalaxy mass, suggesting a universal process of chemical enrichment amongvarious gc systems. given that gcs are bluer than field stars within the samegalaxy, it is plausible that the chemical enrichment processes of gcs ceasedsomewhat earlier than that of field stellar population, and if so, gcspreferentially trace the major, vigorous mode of star formation events ingalactic formation. we further suggest a possible systematic age differenceamong gc systems, in that the gc systems in more luminous galaxies are older.this is consistent with the downsizing paradigm of galaxies and supportsadditionally the similar nature shared by gcs and field stars. our findingssuggest that gc systems and their parent galaxies have shared a more commonorigin than previously thought, and hence greatly simplify theories of galaxyformation.

0704.3611	uv star formation rates in the local universe	we measure star formation rates of ~50,000 optically-selected galaxies in thelocal universe (z~0.1), spanning a range from gas-rich dwarfs to massiveellipticals. we obtain dust-corrected sfrs by fitting the galex (uv) and sdss(optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that includedust attenuation. for star-forming galaxies, our uv-based sfrs compareremarkably well with those derived from sdss h alpha. deviations from perfectagreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dustattenuation estimates. in contrast to h alpha, uv provides reliable sfrs forgalaxies with weak or no h alpha emission, and where h alpha is contaminatedwith an emission from an agn. we use full-sed sfrs to calibrate a simpleprescription that uses galex uv magnitudes to produce good sfrs for normalstar-forming galaxies. the specific sfr is considered as a function of stellarmass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no agn, (2) those hosting an agn, andfor (3) galaxies without h alpha emission. we find that the three have distinctstar formation histories, with agn lying intermediate between the star-formingand the quiescent galaxies. normal star forming galaxies (without an agn) lieon a relatively narrow linear sequence. remarkably, galaxies hosting a strongagn appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. weak agn,while also massive, have lower sfr, sometimes extending to the realm ofquiescent galaxies. we propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxiesthat smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence)galaxies via strong and weak agn. we confirm that some galaxies with no h alphaemission show signs of sf in the uv. we derive a uv-based cosmic sfr density atz=0.1 with smaller total error than previous measurements (abridged).

1301.2323	wide-field multiband photometry of globular cluster systems in the  fornax galaxy cluster	we present wide-field multiband photometry of globular cluster (gc) systemsin ngc 1399, ngc 1404, and ngc 1387 located at the central region of the fornaxgalaxy cluster. observation was carried out through u, b, v, and i bands, whichmarks one of the widest and deepest u-band studies on extragalactic gc systems.the present u-band photometry enables us to significantly reduce thecontamination by a factor of two for faint sources (vo~23.5). the main resultsbased on some 2000 gc candidates around ngc 1399, ngc 1404, and ngc 1387 are asfollows: (1) the gc system in each galaxy exhibits bimodal color distributionsin all colors examined, but the shape of color histograms varies systematicallydepending on colors; (2) ngc 1399 shows that the mean colors of both blue andred gcs become bluer with increasing galactocentric radius; (3) ngc 1399 showsoverabundance of gcs in the directions of ngc 1404 and ngc 1387, indicatingtheir ongoing interactions; and (4) ngc 1399 also exhibits a ~0.5' offsetbetween the center of the inner gc distribution and the galaxy's opticalcenter, suggesting that ngc 1399 is not yet dynamically relaxed and may beundergoing merger events.

0704.0486	kinematic decoupling of globular clusters with extended  horizontal-branch	about 25% of the milky way globular clusters (gcs) exhibit unusually extendedcolor distribution of stars in the horizontal-branch (hb) phase. thisphenomenon is now best understood as due to the presence of helium enhancedsecond generation subpopulations, which has raised a possibility that thesepeculiar gcs might have a unique origin. here we show that these gcs withextended hb are clearly distinct from other normal gcs in kinematics and mass.the gcs with extended hb are more massive than normal gcs, and are dominated byrandom motion with no correlation between kinematics and metallicity.surprisingly, however, when they are excluded, most normal gcs in the innerhalo show clear signs of dissipational collapse that apparently led to theformation of the disk. normal gcs in the outer halo share their kinematicproperties with the extended hb gcs, which is consistent with the accretionorigin. our result further suggests heterogeneous origins of gcs, and weanticipate this to be a starting point for more detailed investigations ofmilky way formation, including early mergers, collapse, and later accretion.

0712.3051	ultraviolet, optical, and infrared constraints on models of stellar  populations and dust attenuation	the color of galaxies is a fundamental property, easily measured, thatconstrains models of galaxies and their evolution. dust attenuation and starformation history (sfh) are the dominant factors affecting the color ofgalaxies. here we explore the empirical relation between sfh, attenuation, andcolor for a wide range of galaxies, including early types. these galaxies havebeen observed by galex, sdss, and spitzer, allowing the construction ofmeasures of dust attenuation from the ratio of infrared (ir) to ultraviolet(uv) flux and measures of sfh from the strength of the 4000a break. theempirical relation between these three quantities is compared to models thatseparately predict the effects of dust and sfh on color. this comparisondemonstrates the quantitative consistency of these simple models with the dataand hints at the power of multiwavelength data for constraining these models.the uv color is a strong constraint; we find that a milky way extinction curveis disfavored, and that the uv emission of galaxies with large 4000a breakstrengths is likely to arise from evolved populations. we perform fits to therelation between sfh, attenuation, and color. this relation links theproduction of starlight and its absorption by dust to the subsequent reemissionof the absorbed light in the ir. galaxy models that self-consistently treatdust absorption and emission as well as stellar populations will need toreproduce these fitted relations in the low-redshift universe.

0712.3555	a search for extended ultraviolet disk (xuv-disk) galaxies in the local  universe	we have initiated a search for extended ultraviolet disk (xuv-disk) galaxiesin the local universe. herein, we compare galex uv and visible--nir images of189 nearby (d$&lt;$40 mpc) s0--sm galaxies included in the galex atlas of nearbygalaxies and present the first catalogue of xuv-disk galaxies. we find thatxuv-disk galaxies are surprisingly common but have varied relative (uv/optical)extent and morphology. type~1 objects ($\ga$20% incidence) have structured,uv-bright/optically-faint emission features in the outer disk, beyond thetraditional star formation threshold. type~2 xuv-disk galaxies ($\sim$10%incidence) exhibit an exceptionally large,uv-bright/optically-low-surface-brightness (lsb) zone having blue $uv-k_s$outside the effective extent of the inner, older stellar population, but notreaching extreme galactocentric distance. if the activity occuring in xuv-disksis episodic, a higher fraction of present-day spirals could be influenced bysuch outer disk star formation. type~1 disks are associated with spirals of alltypes, whereas type~2 xuv-disks are predominantly found in late-type spirals.type~2 xuv-disks are forming stars quickly enough to double their [presentlylow] stellar mass in the next gyr (assuming a constant sf rate). xuv-diskgalaxies of both types are systematically more gas-rich than the general galaxypopulation. minor external perturbation may stimulate xuv-disk incidence, atleast for type~1 objects. xuv-disks are the most actively evolving galaxiesgrowing via inside-out disk formation in the current epoch, and may constitutea segment of the galaxy population experiencing significant, continued gasaccretion from the intergalactic medium or neighboring objects.

0712.3573	ultraviolet through infrared spectral energy distributions from 1000  sdss galaxies: dust attenuation	the meaningful comparison of models of galaxy evolution to observations iscritically dependent on the accurate treatment of dust attenuation. toinvestigate dust absorption and emission in galaxies we have assembled a sampleof ~1000 galaxies with ultraviolet (uv) through infrared (ir) photometry fromgalex, sdss, and spitzer and optical spectroscopy from sdss. the ratio of ir touv emission (irx) is used to constrain the dust attenuation in galaxies. we usethe 4000a break as a robust and useful, although coarse, indicator of starformation history (sfh). we examine the relationship between irx and the uvspectral slope (a common attenuation indicator at high-redshift) and findlittle dependence of the scatter on 4000a break strength. we construct averageuv through far-ir spectral energy distributions (seds) for different ranges ofirx, 4000a break strength, and stellar mass (m_*) to show the variation of theentire sed with these parameters. when binned simultaneously by irx, 4000abreak strength, and m_* these seds allow us to determine a low resolutionaverage attenuation curve for different ranges of m_*. the attenuation curvesthus derived are consistent with a lambda^{-0.7} attenuation law, and we findno significant variations with m_*. finally, we show the relationship betweenirx and the global stellar mass surface density and gas-phase-metallicity.among star forming galaxies we find a strong correlation between irx andstellar mass surface density, even at constant metallicity, a result that isclosely linked to the well-known correlation between irx and star-formationrate.

1303.6293	nonlinear color-metallicity relations of globular clusters. v. nonlinear  absorption-line index versus metallicity relations and bimodal index  distributions of m31 globular clusters	recent spectroscopy on the globular cluster (gc) system of m31 withunprecedented precision witnessed a clear bimodality in absorption-line indexdistributions of old gcs. such division of extragalactic gcs, so far assertedmainly by photometric color bimodality, has been viewed as the presence ofmerely two distinct metallicity subgroups within individual galaxies and formsa critical backbone of various galaxy formation theories. given thatspectroscopy is a more detailed probe into stellar population than photometry,the discovery of index bimodality may point to the very existence of dual gcpopulations. however, here we show that the observed spectroscopic dichotomy ofm31 gcs emerges due to the nonlinear nature of metallicity-to-index conversionand thus one does not necessarily have to invoke two separate gc subsystems. wetake this as a close analogy to the recent view that metallicity-colornonlinearity is primarily responsible for observed gc color bimodality. we alsodemonstrate that the metallicity-sensitive magnesium line displaysnon-negligible metallicity-index nonlinearity and balmer lines show ratherstrong nonlinearity. this gives rise to bimodal index distributions, which areroutinely interpreted as bimodal metallicity distributions, not consideringmetallicity-index nonlinearity. our findings give a new insight into theconstitution of m31's gc system, which could change much of the current thoughton the formation of gc systems and their host galaxies.

0712.4023	on the origin of bimodal horizontal-branches in massive globular  clusters: the case of ngc 6388 and ngc 6441	despite the efforts of the past decade, the origin of the bimodalhorizontal-branch (hb) found in some globular clusters (gcs) remains aconundrum. inspired by the discovery of multiple stellar populations in the{\it most massive} galactic gc, $\omega$ centauri, we investigate thepossibility that two distinct populations may coexist and are responsible forthe bimodal hbs in the {\it third} and {\it fifth} brightest gcs, ngc 6388 andngc 6441. using the population synthesis technique, we examine two differentchemical ``self-enrichment'' hypotheses in which a primordial gc wassufficiently massive to contain two or more distinct populations as suggestedby the populations found in $\omega$ cen: (1) the age-metallicity relationscenario in which two populations with different metallicity and age coexist,following an internal age-metallicity relation, and (2) the super-helium-richscenario in which gcs contain a certain fraction of helium-enhanced stars, forinstance, the second generation stars formed from the helium-enriched ejecta ofthe first. the comparative study indicates that the detailed color-magnitudediagram morphologies and the properties of the rr lyrae variables in ngc 6388and ngc 6441 support the latter scenario; i.e., the model which assumes a minorfraction ($\sim$ 15 %) of helium-excess (y $\simeq$ 0.3) stars. the resultssuggest that helium content is the main driver behind the hb bimodality foundmost often in massive gcs. if confirmed, the gc-to-gc variation of heliumabundance should be considered a {\it local} effect, further supporting theargument that age is the {\it global} second parameter of hb morphology.

1304.5791	the effect of second generation populations on the integrated colors of  metal-rich globular clusters in early-type galaxies	the mean color of globular clusters (gcs) in early-type galaxies is ingeneral bluer than the integrated color of halo field stars in host galaxies.metal-rich gcs often appear more associated with field stars than metal-poorgcs, yet show bluer colors than their host galaxy light. motivated by thediscovery of multiple stellar populations in milky way gcs, we present a newscenario in which the presence of second-generation (sg) stars in gcs isresponsible for the color discrepancy between metal-rich gcs and field stars.the model assumes that the sg populations have enhanced helium abundance asevidenced by observations, and it gives a good explanation of the bluer opticalcolors of metal-rich gcs than field stars as well as strong balmer lines andblue uv colors of metal-rich gcs. ours may be complementary to the recentscenario suggesting the difference in stellar mass functions (mfs) as an originfor the gc-to-star color offset. a quantitative comparison is given between thesg and mf models.

1310.4499	two distinct red giant branch populations in the globular cluster ngc  2419 as tracers of a merger event in the milky way	recent spectroscopic observations of the outer halo globular cluster (gc) ngc2419 show that it is unique among gcs, in terms of chemical abundance patterns,and some suggest that it was originated in the nucleus of a dwarf galaxy. herewe show, from the subaru narrow-band photometry employing a calcium filter,that the red giant-branch (rgb) of this gc is split into two distinctsubpopulations. comparison with spectroscopy has confirmed that the redder rgbstars in the $hk$[=(ca$-b)-(b-y)$] index are enhanced in [ca/h] by $\sim$0.2dex compared to the bluer rgb stars. our population model further indicatesthat the calcium-rich second generation stars are also enhanced in heliumabundance by a large amount ($\delta$y = 0.19). our photometry, together withthe results for other massive gcs (e.g., $\omega$ cen, m22, and ngc 1851),suggests that the discrete distribution of rgb stars in the $hk$ index might bea universal characteristic of this growing group of peculiar gcs. the plannednarrow-band calcium photometry for the local group dwarf galaxies would help toestablish an empirical connection between these gcs and the primordial buildingblocks in the hierarchical merging paradigm of galaxy formation.

1404.7508	multiple populations in globular clusters and the origin of the  oosterhoff period groups	the presence of multiple populations is now well-established in most globularclusters in the milky way. in light of this progress, here we suggest a newmodel explaining the origin of the sandage period-shift and the difference inmean period of type ab rr lyrae variables between the two oosterhoff groups. inour models, the instability strip in the metal-poor group ii clusters, such asm15, is populated by second generation stars (g2) with enhanced helium and cnoabundances, while the rr lyraes in the relatively metal rich group i clusterslike m3 are mostly produced by first generation stars (g1) without theseenhancements. this population shift within the instability strip withmetallicity can create the observed period-shift between the two groups, sinceboth helium and cno abundances play a role in increasing the period of rr lyraevariables. the presence of more metal-rich clusters havingoosterhoff-intermediate characteristics, such as ngc 1851, as well as of mostmetal-rich clusters having rr lyraes with longest periods (group iii) can alsobe reproduced, as more helium-rich third and later generations of stars (g3)penetrate into the instability strip with further increase in metallicity.therefore, for the most general cases, our models predict that the rr lyraesare produced mostly by g1, g2, and g3, respectively, for the oosterhoff groupsi, ii, and iii.

1406.5220	light element chemistry and the double red giant branch in the galactic  globular cluster ngc 288	the globular cluster ngc 288 was previously reported to exhibit two distinctred giant branches (rgbs) in the narrow-band calcium (hk) and str\"omgren b andy band passes. in order to investigate this phenomenon further, we obtainedmoderate resolution (r$\sim$18,000) spectra of 27 rgb stars in ngc 288 with thehydra multifiber spectrograph on the blanco 4m telescope at cerro tololointer-american observatory. from these data we derive iron($\langle$[fe/h]$\rangle$=-1.19; $\sigma$=0.12), oxygen($\langle$[o/fe]$\rangle$=$+$0.25; $\sigma$=0.13), and sodium($\langle$[na/fe]$\rangle$=$+$0.15; $\sigma$=0.26) abundances using standardequivalent width and spectrum synthesis techniques. combining these data withthose available in the literature indicates that the two giant branches havedistinctly different light element chemistry but do not exhibit a significantspread in [fe/h]. a new transmission tracing for the ctio ca filter, obtainedfor this project, shows that cn contamination is the primary spectral featuredriving the split rgb. interestingly, the cn leak in the current ctio ca filtermay be used as an efficient means to search for cn-weak and cn-strong stars insystems with otherwise small ca abundance variations.

1505.04791	star formation history of the milky way halo traced by the oosterhoff  dichotomy among globular clusters	in our recent investigation of the oosterhoff dichotomy in the multiplepopulation paradigm (jang et al. 2014), we have suggested that the rr lyraevariables in the oosterhoff groups i, ii, and iii globular clusters (gcs) areproduced mostly by the first, second, and third generation stars (g1, g2, andg3), respectively. here we show, for the first time, that the observeddichotomies in the inner and outer halo gcs can be naturally reproduced whenthese models are extended to all metallicity regimes, while maintainingreasonable agreements in the horizontal-branch type versus [fe/h] correlations.in order to achieve this, however, specific star formation histories arerequired for the inner and outer halos. in the inner halo gcs, the starformation commenced and ceased earlier with relatively short formationtimescale between the subpopulations (~0.5 gyr), while in the outer halo, theformation of g1 was delayed by ~0.8 gyr with more extended timescale between g1and g2 (~1.4 gyr). this is consistent with the dual origin of the milky wayhalo. despite the difference in detail, our models show that the oosterhoffperiod groups observed in both outer and inner halo gcs are all manifestationsof the "population-shift" effect within the instability strip, for which theorigin can be traced back to the two or three discrete episodes of starformation in gcs.

1508.05942	the milky way without x: an alternative interpretation of the double red  clump in the galactic bulge	the presence of two red clumps (rcs) in high latitude fields of the milky waybulge is interpreted as evidence for an x-shaped structure originated from thebar instability. here we show, however, that this double rc phenomenon is morelikely to be another manifestation of multiple populations observed in globularclusters (gcs) in the metal-rich regime. as in the bulge gc terzan 5, thehelium enhanced second generation stars (g2) in the classical bulge componentof the milky way are placed on the bright rc, which is about 0.5 mag brighterthan the normal rc originated from the first generation stars (g1), producingthe observed double rc. in a composite bulge, where a classical bulge cancoexist with a boxy pseudo bulge, our models can also reproduce keyobservations, such as the dependence of the double rc feature on metallicityand galactic latitude and longitude. if confirmed by gaia trigonometricparallax distances, this would indicate that the milky way bar is notsufficiently buckled to form the x-shaped structure in the bulge, and suggestthat the early-type galaxies would be similarly prevailed by super-helium-richsubpopulation.

1510.05668	on the use of the number count of blue horizontal--branch stars to infer  the dominant building blocks of the milky way halo	the formation of the milky way stellar halo is thought to be the result ofmerging and accretion of building blocks such as dwarf galaxies and massiveglobular clusters. recently, deason et al. (2015) suggested that the milky wayouter halo formed mostly from big building blocks, such as dwarf spheroidalgalaxies, based on the similar number ratio of blue straggler (bs) stars toblue horizontal-branch (bhb) stars. here we demonstrate, however, that thisresult is seriously biased by not taking into detailed consideration on theformation mechanism of bhb stars from helium enhanced second-generationpopulation. in particular, the high bs-to-bhb ratio observed in the outer halofields is most likely due to a small number of bhb stars provided by gcs ratherthan to a large number of bs stars. this is supported by our dynamicalevolution model of gcs which shows preferential removal of first generationstars in gcs. moreover, there are a sufficient number of outer halo gcs whichshow very high bs-to-bhb ratio. therefore, the bs-to-bhb number ratio is not agood indicator to use in arguing that more massive dwarf galaxies are the mainbuilding blocks of the milky way outer halo. several lines of evidence stillsuggest that gcs can contribute a significant fraction of the outer halo stars.

astro-ph;0004247	the h beta index as an age indicator of old stellar systems: the effects  of horizontal-branch stars	the strength of the h$\beta$ index has been computed for the integratedspectra of model globular clusters from the evolutionary population synthesis.these models take into account, for the first time, the detailed systematicvariation of horizontal-branch (hb) morphology with age and metallicity. ourmodels show that the h$\beta$ index is significantly affected by the presenceof blue hb stars. because of the contribution from blue hb stars, the h$\beta$does not monotonically decrease as metallicity increases at a given age.instead, it reaches a maximum strength when the distribution of hb stars iscentered around 9500 k, the temperature where the h$\beta$ index becomesstrongest. our models indicate that the strength of the h$\beta$ indexincreases as much as 0.75 {\aa} due to the presence of blue hb stars.  the comparison of the recent keck observations of the globular cluster systemin the milky way galaxy with those in giant elliptical galaxies, ngc 1399 andm87, shows a systematic shift in the h$\beta$ against metallicity plane. ourmodels suggest that this systematic difference is understood if the globularcluster systems in giant elliptical galaxies are several billion years older,in the mean, than the galactic counterpart. further observations of globularcluster systems in the external galaxies from the large ground-based telescopesand space uv facilities will enable to clarify whether this difference isindeed due to the age difference or other explanations are also possible.

astro-ph;0308469	deep wide field bvi ccd photometry of the sextans dwarf spheroidal  galaxy	we present deep wide field $vi$ ccd photometry of the sextans dwarfspheroidal galaxy (dsph) in the local group, covering a field of 42' x 28'located at the center of the galaxy. color-magnitude diagrams of the sextansdsph show well-defined red giant branch (rgb), blue horizontal branch (bhb),prominent red horizontal branch (rhb), asymptotic giant branch (agb), about 120variable star candidates including rr lyraes and anomalous cepheids, about 230blue stragglers (bss), and main sequence (ms) stars. the distance to the galaxyis derived using the $i$-band magnitude of the tip of the rgb ati(trgb)=15.95+/-0.04: (m-m)_0=19.90+/-0.06 for an adopted reddening ofe(b-v)=0.01. the mean metallicity of the rgb is estimated from the (v-i) color:[fe/h]=-2.1+/-0.1(statistical error) +/-0.2(standard calibration error) dex,with a dispersion of sigma[fe/h]=0.2 dex. the age of the msto of the main oldpopulation is estimated to be similar to that of m92, and there are seen somestellar populations with younger age. there is found to be one rgb bump atv=19.95+/-0.05 mag (m_v=0.03 mag), and a weak brighter bump at v=19.35+/-0.05mag(mv=-0.58 mag) which is probably an agb bump. the v-band luminosity functionof the rgb and ms stars is in general similar to that of m92, with a slightexcess of stars in the magnitude range brighter than the msto with respect tothat of m92. the bright bss are more centrally concentrated than the faint bss.significant radial gradients are seen for several kinds of populations: therhb, the red rgb, the red subgiant branch (sgb), and the bright bss are morecentrally concentrated toward the center of the galaxy, compared with the bhb,the blue rgb, the blue sgb, and the faint bss, respectively.

astro-ph;0411302	the galaxy evolution explorer: a space ultraviolet survey mission	we give an overview of the galaxy evolution explorer (galex), a nasa explorermission launched on april 28, 2003. galex is performing the first space uvsky-survey, including imaging and grism surveys in two bands (1350-1750angstroms and 1750-2750 angstroms). the surveys include an all-sky imagingsurvey (m[ab] ~ 20.5), a medium imaging survey of 1000 square degrees (m[ab] ~23), a deep imaging survey of 100 square degrees (m[ab] ~ 25), and a nearbygalaxy survey. spectroscopic grism surveys (r=100-200) are underway withvarious depths and sky coverage. many targets overlap existing or plannedsurveys. we will use the measured uv properties of local galaxies, along withcorollary observations, to calibrate the uv-global star formation raterelationship in local galaxies. we will apply this calibration to distantgalaxies discovered in the deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys to map thehistory of star formation in the universe over the redshift range 0 &lt; z &lt; 1.5,and probe the physical drivers of star formation in galaxies. the galex missionincludes a guest investigator program supporting the wide variety of programsmade possible by the first uv sky survey.

astro-ph;0411319	uv emission and star formation in stephan's quintet	we present the first galex uv images of the well known interacting group ofgalaxies, stephan's quintet (sq). we detect widespread uv emission throughoutthe group. however, there is no consistent coincidence between uv structure andemission in the optical, h\alpha, or hi. excluding the foreground galaxyngc7320 (sd), most of the uv emission is found in regions associated with thetwo spiral members of the group, ngc7319 and ngc7318b, and the intragroupmedium starburst sq-a. the extinction corrected uv data are analyzed toinvestigate the overall star formation activity in sq. it is found that thetotal star formation rate (sfr) of sq is 6.69+-0.65 m_\sun/yr. among this,1.34+-0.16 m_sun/yr is due to sq-a. this is in excellent agreement with thatderived from extinction corrected h\alpha luminosity of sq-a. the sfr inregions related to ngc 7319 is 1.98+-0.58 m_\sun/yr, most of which(68%) iscontributed by the disk. the contribution from the 'young tail' is only 15%. inthe uv, the 'young tail' is more extended (~100 kpc) and shows a loop-likestructure, including the optical tail, the extragalactic hii regions recentlydiscovered in h\alpha, and other uv emission regions discovered for the firsttime. the uv and optical colors of the 'old tail' are consistent with a singlestellar population of age t ~10^{8.5+-0.4} yrs. the uv emission associated withngc 7318b is found in a very large (~80 kpc) disk, with a net sfr of 3.37+-0.25m_sun/yr. several large uv emission regions are 30 -- 40 kpc away from thenucleus of ngc7318b. although both ngc7319 and ngc7318b show peculiar uvmorphology, their sfr is consistent with that of normal sbc galaxies,indicating that the strength of star formation activity is not enhenced byinteractions.

astro-ph;0412577	the properties of ultraviolet-luminous galaxies at the current epoch	we have used the first matched set of galex and sdss data to investigate theproperties of a sample of 74 nearby galaxies with far-ultraviolet luminositieschosen to overlap the luminosity range of typical high-z lyman break galaxies(lbgs). galex deep surveys have shown that ultraviolet-luminous galaxies(uvlgs) similar to these are the fastest evolving component of the uv galaxypopulation. model fits to the combined galex and sdss photometry yield typicalfuv extinctions similar to lbgs. the implied star formation rates are sfr ~ 3to 30 solar mass per year. this overlaps the range of sfrs for lbgs. we find astrong inverse correlation between galaxy mass and far-ultraviolet surfacebrightness, and on this basis divide the sample into ``large'' and ``compact''uvlgs. the compact uvlgs have half-light radii of a few kpc or less (similar tolbgs). they are relatively low mass galaxies (~10 billion solar masses) withtypical velocity dispersions of 60 to 150 km/s. they span a range inmetallicity from 0.3 to 1 times solar, have blue optical-uv colors, and areforming stars at a rate sufficient to build the present galaxy in ~a gigayear.in all these respects they appear similar to the lbg population. these ``livingfossils'' may therefore provide an opportunity for detailed investigation ofthe physical processes occurring in typical star forming galaxies in the earlyuniverse.

astro-ph;0501500	super helium-rich population and the origin of extreme horizontal-branch  stars in globular clusters	recent observations for the color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) of the massiveglobular cluster omega centauri have shown that it has a striking double mainsequence (ms), with a minority population of bluer and fainter ms wellseparated from a majority population of ms stars. here we confirm, with themost up-to-date y2 isochrones, that this special feature can only be reproducedby assuming a large variation (delta y = 0.15) of primordial helium abundanceamong several distinct populations in this cluster. we further show that thesame helium enhancement required for this special feature on the ms can byitself reproduce the extreme horizontal-branch (hb) stars observed in omegacen, which are hotter than normal hb stars. similarly, the complex features onthe hbs of other globular clusters, such as ngc 2808, are explained by largeinternal variations of helium abundance. supporting evidence for thehelium-rich population is also provided by the far-uv (fuv) observations ofextreme hb stars in these clusters, where the enhancement of helium cannaturally explain the observed fainter fuv luminosity for these stars. thepresence of super helium-rich populations in some globular clusters suggeststhat the third parameter, other than metallicity and age, also influences cmdmorphology of these clusters.

astro-ph;0504489	the galex ultraviolet variability (guvv) catalog	we present version 1.0 of the nasa galaxy evolution explorer (galex)ultraviolet variability catalog (guvv) that contains information on 84time-variable and transient sources gained with simultaneous near and farultraviolet photometric observations. these time-variable sources wereserendipitously revealed in the various 1.2 degree star fields currently beingsurveyed by the galex satellite in two ultraviolet bands (nuv 1750-2750a, fuv1350-1750a) with limiting ab magnitudes of 23-25. the largest-amplitudevariable objects presently detected by galex are m-dwarf flare stars, which canbrighten by 5-10 mag in both the nuv and fuv bands during short duration (&lt;500s) outbursts. other types of large-amplitude ultraviolet variable objectsinclude ab-type rr lyrae stars, which can vary periodically by 2-5mag in thegalex fuv band. this first guvv catalog lists galactic positions and possiblesource identifications in order to provide the astronomical community with alist of time-variable objects that can now be repeatedly observed at otherwavelengths. we expect the total number of time-variable source detections toincrease as the galex mission progresses, such that later version numbers ofthe guvv catalog will contain substantially more variable sources.

astro-ph;0507396	galex observations of an energetic ultraviolet flare on the dm4e star gj  3685a	the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) satellite has obtained high timeresolution ultraviolet photometry during a large flare on the m4 dwarf star gj3685a. simultaneous nuv (1750 - 2800a) and fuv (1350 - 1750a) time-taggedphotometry with time resolution better than 0.1 s shows that the overallbrightness in the fuv band increased by a factor of 1000 in 200 s. under theassumption that the nuv emission is mostly due to a stellar continuum, and thatthe fuv flux is shared equally between emission lines and continuum, then thereis evidence for two distinct flare components for this event. the first flaretype is characterized by an exponential increase in flux with little or noincrease in temperature. the other involves rapid increases in both temperatureand flux. while the decay time for the first flare component may be severalhours, the second flare event decayed over less than 1 minute, suggesting thatthere was little or no confinement of the heated plasma.

astro-ph;0604058	uv and fir selected star-forming galaxies at z=0: differences and  overlaps	we study two samples of local galaxies, one is uv (galex) selected and theother fir (iras) selected, to address the question whether uv and fir surveyssee the two sides ('bright' and 'dark') of the star formation of the samepopulation of galaxies or two different populations of star forming galaxies.no significant difference between the l$_{tot}$ ($=l_{60}+l_{fuv}$) luminosityfunctions of the uv and fir samples is found. also, after the correction forthe `malmquist bias' (bias for flux limited samples), the fir-to-uv ratio v.s.l$_{tot}$ relations of the two samples are consistent with each other. in therange of $9 \la \log(l_{tot}/l_\sun) \la 12$, both can be approximated by asimple linear relation of $\log (l_{60}/l_{fuv})=\log(l_{tot}/l_\sun)-9.66$.these are consistent with the hypothesis that the two samples represent thesame population of star forming galaxies, and their well documented differencesin l$_{tot}$ and in fir-to-uv ratio are due only to the selection effect. acomparison between the uv luminosity functions shows marginal evidence for apopulation of faint uv galaxies missing in the fir selected sample. thecontribution from these 'fir-quiet' galaxies to the overall uv population isinsignificant, given that the k-band luminosity functions (i.e. the stellarmass functions) of the two samples do not show any significant difference.

astro-ph;0608594	galex uv color relations for nearby early-type galaxies	we use galex/optical photometry to construct color-color relationships forearly-type galaxies sorted by morphological type. we have matched objects inthe galex gr1 public release and the first ir1.1 internal release, with the rc3early-type galaxies having a morphological type -5.5&lt;t&lt;-1.5 with mean error int&lt;1.5, and mean error on (b-v)t&lt;0.05. after visual inspection of each match, weare left with 130 galaxies with a reliable galex pipeline photometry in thefar-uv and near-uv bands. this sample is divided into ellipticals (-5.5&lt;t&lt;-3.5)and lenticulars (-3.5&lt;t&lt;-1.5). after correction for the galactic extinction,the color-color diagrams fuv-nuv vs. (b-v)_{tc} are plotted for the twosubsamples. we find a tight anti-correlation between the fuv-nuv and (b-v)_{tc}colors for ellipticals, the uv color getting bluer when the (b-v)_{tc} getredder. this relationship very likely is an extension of the color-metallicityrelationship into the galex nuv band. we suspect that the main source of thecorrelation is metal line blanketing in the nuv band. the fuv-nuv vs b-vcorrelation has larger scatter for lenticular galaxies; we speculate thisreflects the presence of low level star formation. if the latter objects (i.e.those that are blue both in fuv-nuv and b-v) are interpreted as harboringrecent star formation activity, this would be the case for a few percent (~4%)of ellipticals and ~15% of lenticulars; this would make about 10% of early-typegalaxies with residual star formation in our full sample of 130 early-typegalaxies. we also plot fuv-nuv vs. the mg_2 index and central velocitydispersion. we find a tight anti-correlation between fuv-nuv and the mg_2index(...).

astro-ph;0609071	radial variation of attenuation and star formation in the largest  late-type disks observed with galex	for a sample of 43 nearby, late-type galaxies, we have investigated theradial variation of both the current star formation rate and the dust-induceduv light attenuation. to do this we have cross-correlated iras images and galexobservations for each of these galaxies, and compiled observations of the gas(co and hi) and metal-abundance gradients found in the literature. we find thatattenuation correlates with metallicity. we then use the uv profiles, correctedfor attenuation, to study several variants of the schmidt law and conclude thatour results are compatible with a simple law similar to the one of kennicuttbut extending smoothly to lower surface densities, but with considerablescatter. we do not detect an abrupt break in the uv light at the thresholdradius derived from h-alpha data (at which the h-alpha profile shows a breakand beyond which only a few hii regions are usually found). we interpret theh-alpha sudden break not as a change in the star formation regime (as oftensuggested) but as the vanishingly small number of ionizing stars correspondingto low levels of star formation.

astro-ph;0609415	the diverse properties of the most ultraviolet luminous galaxies  discovered by the galaxy evolution explorer	we report on the properties of a sample of ultraviolet luminous galaxies(uvlgs) selected by matching the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) surveys withthe sloan digital sky survey third data release. out of 25362 galaxies between0.0&lt;z&lt;0.3 detected by galex, there are 215 galaxies with l&gt;2x10^10 l_solar at1530 angstroms (observed wavelength). the properties of this population arewell correlated with ultraviolet surface brightness. we find that the galaxieswith low uv surface brightness are primarily large spiral systems with amixture of old and young stellar populations, while the high surface brightnessgalaxies consist primarily of compact starburst systems. in terms of thebehavior of surface brightness with luminosity, size with luminosity, themass-metallicity relation, and other parameters, the compact uvlgs clearlydepart from the trends established by the full sample of galaxies. the subsetof compact uvlgs with the highest surface brightness (``supercompact uvlgs'')have characteristics that are remarkably similar to lyman break galaxies athigher redshift. they are much more luminous than typical localultraviolet-bright starburst galaxies and blue compact dwarf galaxies. theyhave metallicities that are systematically lower than normal galaxies of thesame stellar mass, indicating that they are less chemically evolved. in allthese respects, they are the best local analogs for lyman break galaxies.

astro-ph;0609436	ongoing formation of bulges and black holes in the local universe: new  insights from galex	we analyze a volume-limited sample of massive bulge-dominated galaxies withdata from both the sloan digital sky survey and the galaxy evolution explorer(galex) satellite. the galaxies have central velocity dispersions greater than100 km/s and stellar surface mass densities that lie above the value wheregalaxies transition from actively star forming to passive systems. the sampleis limited to redshifts 0.03&lt;z&lt;0.07. at these distances, the sdss spectrasample the light from the bulge-dominated central regions of the galaxies. thegalex nuv data provide high sensitivity to low rates of global star formationin these systems. our sample of bulge-dominated galaxies exhibits a much largerdispersion in nuv-r colour than in optical g-r colour. nearly all of thegalaxies with bluer nuv-r colours are agn. both galex images and sdss colourprofiles demonstrate that the excess uv light is associated with an extendeddisk. we find that galaxies with red outer regions almost never have a youngbulge or a strong agn. galaxies with blue outer regions have bulges and blackholes that span a wide range in age and accretion rate. galaxies with youngbulges and strongly accreting black holes almost always have blue outer disks.our suggested scenario is one in which the source of gas that builds the bulgeand black hole is a low mass reservoir of cold gas in the disk.the presence ofthis gas is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for bulge and black holegrowth. some mechanism must transport this gas inwards in a time variable way.as the gas in the disk is converted into stars, the galaxies will turn red, butfurther gas infall can bring them back into the blue nuv-r sequence.(abridged)

astro-ph;0611926	statistical properties of the galex/sdss matched source catalogs, and  classification of the uv sources	we use the galaxy evolution explorer (galex) medium and all-sky-imagingsurvey (mis &amp; ais) data from the first public data release (gr1), matched tothe sloan digital sky survey (sdss) dr3 catalog, to perform sourceclassification. the galex surveys provide photometry in far- and near-uv bandsand the sdss in five optical bands (u,g,r,i,z). the gr1/dr3 overlapping areasare 363[83]deg^2 for the galex ais[mis], for sources within the 0.5deg centralarea of the galex fields. our sample covers mostly |b|&gt;30deg galacticlatitudes. we present statistical properties of the galex/sdss matched sourcescatalog, containing &gt;2x10^6 objects detected in at least one uv band. weclassify the matched sources by comparing the seven-band photometry to modelcolors constructed for different classes of astrophysical objects. for sourceswith photometric errors &lt;0.3 mag, the corresponding typical ab-magnitude limitsare m_fuv~21.5, m_nuv~22.5 for ais, and m_fuv~24, m_nuv~24.5 for mis. at aisdepth, the number of galactic and extragalactic objects are comparable, but thelatter predominate in the mis. based on our stellar models, we estimate thegalex surveys detect hot white dwarfs throughout the milky way halo (down to aradius of 0.04 r_sun at mis depth), providing an unprecedented improvement inthe galactic wd census. their observed surface density is consistent with milkyway model predictions. we also select low-redshift qso candidates, extendingthe known qso samples to lower magnitudes, and providing candidates fordetailed z~1 follow-up investigations. sdss optical spectra available for alarge subsample confirm the classification for the photometrically selectedcandidates with 97% purity for single hot stars, ~45%(ais)/31%(mis) forbinaries containing a hot star and a cooler companion, and about 85% for qsos.

astro-ph;0612203	galex ultraviolet photometry of globular clusters in m31: three year  results and a catalog	we present ultraviolet (uv) photometry of m31 globular clusters (gcs) foundin 23 galaxy evolution explorer (galex) images covering the entirety of m31. wedetect 485 and 273 gcs (and gc candidates) in the near-ultraviolet (nuv; 2267a) and far-ultraviolet (fuv; 1516 a), respectively. comparing m31 data withthose of galactic gcs in the uv with the aid of population models, we find thatthe age ranges of old gcs in m31 and the galactic halo are similar. threemetal-rich ([fe/h]&gt;-1) gcs in m31 produce significant fuv flux making theirfuv-v colors unusually blue for their metallicities. these are thought to beanalogs of the two peculiar galactic gcs ngc 6388 and ngc 6441 with extendedblue hb stars. based on the models incorporating helium enriched subpopulationsin addition to the majority of the population that have a normal heliumabundance, we suggest that even small fraction of super-helium-richsubpopulations in gcs can reproduce the observed uv bright metal-rich gcs.young clusters in m31 show distinct uv and optical properties from gcs in milkyway. population models indicate that their typical age is less than ~ 2 gyrs. alarge fraction of young gcs have the kinematics of the thin, rapidly rotatingdisk component. however, a subset of the old gcs also shares the thin-diskkinematics of the younger clusters. the existence of young gcs on the outskirtsof m31 disk suggests the occurrence of a significant recent star formation inthe thin-disk of m31. old thin-disk gcs may set constraints on the epoch ofearly formation of the m31 thin-disk. we detect 12 (10) intermediate-age gccandidates in nuv (fuv). we suggest that some of spectroscopically identifiedintermediate-age gcs may not be truly intermediate in age, but rather older gcsthat possess developed hb.

astro-ph;0703281	the ultraviolet-optical color-magnitude diagram iii: constraints on  evolution from the blue to red sequence	we introduce a new quantity, the mass flux density of galaxies evolving fromthe blue sequence to the red sequence. we propose a simple technique forconstraining this mass flux using the volume corrected number density in theextinction-corrected uv-optical color magnitude distribution, the stellar ageindexes h-delta-a and d_n(4000), and a simple prescription for spectralevolution using a quenched star formation history. we exploit the excellentseparation of red and blue sequences in the nuv-r band color-magnitude diagram.the final value we measure, 0.033 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3, is strictly speaking anupper limit due to the possible contributions of bursting, composite, andextincted galaxies. however, it compares favorably with estimates of theaverage mass flux that we make based on the red luminosity function evolutionderived from the deepii and combo-17 surveys (bell et al 2004; faber et al.2005), 0.034 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3. we find that the blue sequence mass hasremained roughly constant since z=1 (mass flux 0.01 m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3) but theaverage on-going star formation of 0.037$ m_sun yr^-1 mpc^-3 over 0&lt;z&lt;1 isbalanced by mass flux off the blue sequence. we explore the nature of thegalaxies in the transition zone with particular attention to the frequency andimpact of agns. the agn fraction peaks in the transition zone. we findcircumstantial, albeit weak evidence that the quench rates are higher in higherluminosity agns.

astro-ph;0703503	the look-back time evolution of far-ultraviolet flux from the brightest  cluster elliptical galaxies at z &lt; 0.2	we present the galex uv photometry of the elliptical galaxies in abellclusters at moderate redshifts (z &lt; 0.2) for the study of the look-back timeevolution of the uv upturn phenomenon. the brightest elliptical galaxies (m_r &lt;-22) in 12 remote clusters are compared with the nearby giant ellipticalgalaxies of comparable optical luminosity in the fornax and virgo clusters. thesample galaxies presented here appear to be quiescent without signs of massivestar formation or strong nuclear activity, and show smooth, extended profilesin their uv images indicating that the far-uv (fuv) light is mostly produced byhot stars in the underlying old stellar population. compared to theircounterparts in nearby clusters, the fuv flux of cluster giant ellipticalgalaxies at moderate redshifts fades rapidly with ~ 2 gyrs of look-back time,and the observed pace in fuv - v color evolution agrees reasonably well withthe prediction from the population synthesis models where the dominant fuvsource is hot horizontal-branch stars and their progeny. a similar amount ofcolor spread (~ 1 mag) in fuv - v exists among the brightest cluster ellipticalgalaxies at z ~ 0.1, as observed among the nearby giant elliptical galaxies ofcomparable optical luminosity.

astro-ph;9911137	multiple stellar populations in the globular cluster omega centauri as  tracers of a merger event	the discovery of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy, which is being tidallydisrupted by and merging with the milky way, supports the view that the halo ofthe galaxy has been built up at least partially by the accretion of similardwarf systems. the sagittarius dwarf contains several distinct populations ofstars, and includes m54 as its nucleus, which is the second most massiveglobular cluster associated with the milky way. the most massive globularcluster is omega centauri, and here we report that omega centauri also hasseveral distinct stellar populations, as traced by red-giant-branch stars. themost metal-rich red-giant-branch stars are about 2 gyr younger than thedominant metal-poor component, indicating that omega centauri was enriched overthis timescale. the presence of more than one epoch of star formation in aglobular cluster is quite surprising, and suggests that omega centauri was oncepart of a more massive system that merged with the milky way, as thesagittarius dwarf galaxy is in the process of doing now. mergers probably weremuch more frequent in the early history of the galaxy and omega centauriappears to be a relict of this era.

astro-ph;9912226	the metallicity dependence of rr lyrae absolute magnitudes from  synthetic horizontal-branch models	a grid of synthetic horizontal-branch (shb) models based on hb evolutionarytracks with improved physics has been constructed to reconsider the theoreticalcalibration of the dependence of m_v(rr) on metallicity in globular clusters,and the slope of the mean &lt;m_v(rr)&gt;-[fe/h] relation. the shb models confirmlee's earlier finding (lee 1991) that the slope of the &lt;m_v(rr)&gt;-[fe/h]relation is itself a function of the metallicity range considered, and that inaddition, for a given [fe/h], rr lyrae luminosities depend on hb morphology.this is due to the fact that hb stars pass through the rr lyrae instabilitystrip at different evolutionary stages, depending on their original position onthe hb. at [fe/h]=-1.9, and for hb type 0, the models yield m_v(rr)=0.47 \pm0.10. the mean slope for the zero-age hb models is 0.204. since there is nosimple universal relation between m_v(rr) and metallicity that is applicable toall globular clusters, the hb morphology of each individual cluster must betaken into account, in addition to [fe/h], in deriving the appropriate m_v(rr).taking hb morphology into account, we find that the slope of the mean&lt;m_v(rr)&gt;-[fe/h] relation varies between 0.36 for the clusters withgalactocentric distances r_gc less than 6 kpc and 0.22 for clusters with6&lt;r_gc&lt;20 kpc. implications for interpreting observations of field rr lyraevariables and for absolute globular cluster ages and galactic chronology arebriefly discussed.

0706.0755	the calibration and data products of the galaxy evolution explorer	we describe the calibration status and data products pertaining to the gr2and gr3 data releases of the galaxy evolution explorer (galex). these releaseshave identical pipeline calibrations that are significantly improved over thegr1 data release. galex continues to survey the sky in the far ultraviolet(fuv, ~154 nm) and near ultraviolet (nuv, ~232 nm) bands, providingsimultaneous imaging with a pair of photon counting, microchannel plate, delayline readout detectors. these 1.25 degree field-of-view detectors arewell-suited to ultraviolet observations because of their excellent redrejection and negligible background. a dithered mode of observing and photonlist output pose complex requirements on the data processing pipeline,entangling detector calibrations and aspect reconstruction algorithms. recentimprovements have achieved photometric repeatability of 0.05 and 0.03 mab inthe fuv and nuv, respectively. we have detected a long term drift of order 1%fuv and 6% nuv over the mission. astrometric precision is of order 0.5" rms inboth bands. in this paper we provide the galex user with a broad overview ofthe calibration issues likely to be confronted in the current release.improvements are likely as the galex mission continues into an extended phasewith a healthy instrument, no consumables, and increased opportunities forguest investigations.

0706.1076	clustering properties of restframe uv selected galaxies ii: migration of  star formation sites with cosmic time from galex and cfhtls	we analyze the clustering properties of ultraviolet selected galaxies byusing galex-sdss data at z&lt;0.6 and cfhtls deep u' imaging at z=1. thesedatasets provide a unique basis at z&lt; 1 which can be directly compared withhigh redshift samples built with similar selection criteria. we discuss thedependence of the correlation function parameters (r0, delta) on theultraviolet luminosity as well as the linear bias evolution. we find that thebias parameter shows a gradual decline from high (b &gt; 2) to low redshift (b ~0.79^{+0.1}_{-0.08}). when accounting for the fraction of the star formationactivity enclosed in the different samples, our results suggest that the bulkof star formation migrated from high mass dark matter halos at z&gt;2 (10^12 &lt;m_min &lt; 10^13 m_sun, located in high density regions), to less massive halos atlow redshift (m_min &lt; 10^12 m_sun, located in low density regions). this resultextends the ``downsizing'' picture (shift of the star formation activity fromhigh stellar mass systems at high z to low stellar mass at low z) to the darkmatter distribution.
