0904.0460	ly alpha escape during cosmological hydrogen recombination: the 3d-1s  and 3s-1s two-photon processes	we give a formulation of the radiative transfer equation for lyman alphaphotons which allows us to include the two-photon corrections for the 3s-1s and3d-1s decay channels during cosmological hydrogen recombination. we use thisequation to compute the corrections to the sobolev escape probability for lymanalpha photons during hydrogen recombination, which then allow us to calculatethe changes in the free electron fraction and cmb temperature and polarizationpower spectra. we show that the effective escape probability changes by dp/p ~+11% at z~1400 in comparison with the one obtained using the sobolevapproximation. this speeds up of hydrogen recombination by dn_e/n_e ~- 1.6% atz~1190, implying |dc_l/c_l| ~1%-3% at l &gt;~ 1500 with shifts in the positions ofthe maxima and minima in the cmb power spectra. these corrections will beimportant for the analysis of future cmb data.  the total correction is the result of the superposition of three independentprocesses, related to (i) time-dependent aspects of the problem, (ii)corrections due to quantum mechanical deviations in the shape of the emissionand absorption profiles in the vicinity of the lyman alpha line from the normallorentzian, and (iii) a thermodynamic correction factor, which occurs to bevery important. all these corrections are neglected in thesobolev-approximation, but they are important in the context of future cmbobservations. all three can be naturally obtained in the two-photon formulationof the lyman alpha absorption process. however, the corrections (i) and (iii)can also be deduced in the normal '1+1' photon language, without necessarilygoing to the two-photon picture. therefore only (ii) is really related to thequantum mechanical aspects of the two-photon process (abridged)

0904.2220	cosmological hydrogen recombination: influence of resonance and electron  scattering	in this paper we consider the effects of resonance and electron scattering onthe escape of lyman alpha photons during cosmological hydrogen recombination.we pay particular attention to the influence of atomic recoil, doppler boostingand doppler broadening using a fokker-planck approximation of theredistribution function describing the scattering of photons on the lyman alpharesonance of moving hydrogen atoms. we extend the computations of our recentpaper on the influence of the 3d/3s-1s two-photon channels on the dynamics ofhydrogen recombination, simultaneously including the full time-dependence ofthe problem, the thermodynamic corrections factor, leading to afrequency-dependent asymmetry between the emission and absorption profile, andthe quantum-mechanical corrections related to the two-photon nature of the3d/3s-1s emission and absorption process on the exact shape of the lyman alphaemission profile. we show here that due to the redistribution of photons overfrequency hydrogen recombination is sped up by dn_e/n_e~-0.6% at z~900. for thecmb temperature and polarization power spectra this results in|dc_l/c_l|~0.5%-1% at l &gt;~ 1500, and therefore will be important for theanalysis of future cmb data in the context of the planck surveyor, spt and act.the main contribution to this correction is coming from the atomic recoileffect (dn_e/n_e~-1.2% at z~900), while doppler boosting and doppler broadeningpartially cancel this correction, again slowing hydrogen recombination down bydn_e/n_e~0.6% at z~900. the influence of electron scattering close to themaximum of the thomson visibility function at z~1100 can be neglected.(abridged)

0904.3419	analysis of hard x-ray eclipse in ss433 from integral observations	the analysis of hard x-ray integral observations (2003-2008) ofsuperaccreting galactic microquasar ss433 at precessional phases of the sourcewith the maximum disk opening angle is carried out. it is found that the shapeand width of the primary x-ray eclipse is strongly variable suggestingadditional absorption in dense stellar wind and gas outflows from the opticala7i-component and the wind-wind collision region. the independence of theobserved hard x-ray spectrum on the accretion disk precessional phase suggeststhat hard x-ray emission (20-100 kev) is formed in an extended, hot,quasi-isothermal corona, probably heated by interaction of relativistic jetwith inhomogeneous wind outflow from the precessing supercritical accretiondisk. a joint modeling of x-ray eclipsing and precessional hard x-rayvariability of ss433 revealed by integral by a geometrical model suggests thebinary mass ratio $q=m_x/m_v\simeq 0.25\div 0.5$. the absolute minimum of jointorbital and precessional $\chi^2$ residuals is reached at $q\simeq 0.3$. thefound binary mass ratio range allows us to explain the substantial precessionalvariability of the minimum brightness at the middle of the primary opticaleclipse. for the mass function of the optical star $f_v=0.268 m_\odot$ asderived from hillwig &amp; gies data, the obtained value of $q\simeq 0.3$ yieldsthe masses of the components $m_x\simeq 5.3 m_\odot$, $m_v\simeq 17.7 m_\odot$,confirming the black hole nature of the compact object in ss433.

0707.0188	is there a need and another way to measure the cosmic microwave  background temperature more accurately?	the recombination history of the universe depends exponentially on thetemperature, t_0, of the cosmic microwave background. therefore tiny changes oft_0 are expected to lead to significant changes in the free electron fraction.here we show that even the current 1sigma-uncertainty in the value of t_0results in more than half a percent ambiguity in the ionization history, andmore than 0.1% uncertainty in the tt and ee power spectra at small angularscales. we discuss how the value of t_0 affects the highly redshiftedcosmological hydrogen recombination spectrum and demonstrate that t_0 could, inprinciple, be measured by looking at the low frequency distortions of thecosmic microwave background spectrum. for this no absolute measurements arenecessary, but sensitivities on the level of ~30nk are required to extract thequasi-periodic frequency-dependent signal with typical delta nu/nu~0.1 comingfrom cosmological recombination. we also briefly mention the possibility ofobtaining additional information on the specific entropy of the universe, andother cosmological parameters.

0909.2378	cosmological recombination: feedback of helium photons and its effect on  the recombination spectrum	in this paper we consider the re-processing of high frequency photons emittedby heii and hei during the epoch of cosmological recombination by hei and hi.we demonstrate that, in comparison to computations which neglect all feedbackprocesses, the number of cosmological recombination photons that are related tothe presence of helium in the early universe could be increased by ~40%-70%.our computations imply that per helium nucleus ~3-6 additional photons could beproduced. therefore, a total of ~12-14 helium-related photons are emittedduring cosmological recombination. this is an important addition tocosmological recombination spectrum which in the future may render it slightlyeasier to determine the primordial abundance of helium using differentialmeasurements of the cmb energy spectrum. also, since these photons are the onlywitnesses of the feedback process at high redshift, observing them in principleoffers a way to check our understanding of the recombination physics. here mostinterestingly, the feedback of heii photons on hei leads to the appearance ofseveral additional, rather narrow spectral features in the hei recombinationspectrum at low frequencies. consequently, the signatures of helium-relatedfeatures in the cmb spectral distortion due to cosmological recombination atsome given frequency can exceed the average level of ~17% several times. wefind that in particular the bands around nu ~10ghz, ~35ghz, ~80ghz, and ~200ghzseem to be affected strongly. in addition, we computed the changes in thecosmological ionization history, finding that only the feedback of primary heiphotons on the dynamics of heii--&gt;hei recombination has an effect, producing achange of dn_e/n_e ~+ 0.17% at z~2300. this result seems to be ~2-3 timessmaller than the one obtained in earlier computations for this process(abridged).

0912.0016	polarization of x-ray lines from galaxy clusters and elliptical galaxies  - a way to measure tangential component of gas velocity	we study the impact of gas motions on the polarization of bright x-rayemission lines from the hot intercluster medium (icm). the polarizationnaturally arises from resonant scattering of emission lines owing to aquadrupole component in the radiation field produced by a centrally peaked gasdensity distribution. if differential gas motions are present then a photonemitted in one region of the cluster will be scattered in another region onlyif their relative velocities are small enough and the doppler shift of thephoton energy does not exceed the line width. this affects both the degree andthe direction of polarization. the changes in the polarization signal are inparticular sensitive to the gas motions perpendicular to the line of sight. wecalculate the expected degree of polarization for several patterns of gasmotions, including a slow inflow expected in a simple cooling flow model and afast outflow in an expanding spherical shock wave. in both cases, the effect ofnon-zero gas velocities is found to be minor. we also calculate thepolarization signal for a set of clusters, taken from large-scale structuresimulations and evaluate the impact of the gas bulk motions on the polarizationsignal. we argue that the expected degree of polarization is within reach ofthe next generation of space x-ray polarimeters.

1012.5036	the isw-tsz cross correlation: isw extraction out of pure cmb data	if dark energy introduces an acceleration in the universal expansion thenlarge scale gravitational potential wells should be shrinking, causing ablueshift in the cmb photons that cross such structures (integrated sachs-wolfeeffect, [isw]). galaxy clusters are known to probe those potential wells. inthese objects, cmb photons also experience inverse compton scattering off thehot electrons of the intra-cluster medium, and this results in a distortionwith a characteristic spectral signature of the cmb spectrum (the so-calledthermal sunyaev-zel'dovich effect, [tsz]). since both the isw and the tszeffects take place in the same potential wells, they must be spatiallycorrelated. we present how this cross isw-tsz signal can be detected in acmb-data contained way by using the frequency dependence of the tsz effect inmulti frequency cmb experiments like {\it planck}, {\em without} requiring theuse of external large scale structure tracers data. we find that by masking lowredshift clusters, the shot noise level decreases significantly, boosting thesignal to noise ratio of the isw--tsz cross correlation. we also find thatgalactic and extragalactic dust residuals must be kept at or below the level of~0.04 muk^2 at l=10, a limit that is a factor of a few below {\it planck}'sexpectations for foreground subtraction. if this is achieved, cmb observationsof the isw-tsz cross correlation should also provide an independent probe forthe existence of dark energy and the amplitude of density perturbations.

1101.2134	fast optical variability of ss 433	we study the optical variability of the peculiar galactic source ss 433 usingthe observations made with the russian turkish 1.5-m telescope (rtt150). asimple technique which allows to obtain high-quality photometric measurementswith 0.3-1 s time resolution using ordinary ccd is described in detail. usingthe test observations of nonvariable stars, we show that the atmosphericturbulence introduces no significant distortions into the measured lightcurves. therefore, the data obtained in this way are well suited for studyingthe aperiodic variability of various objects.  the large amount of ss 433 optical light curve measurements obtained in thisway allowed us to obtain the power spectra of its flux variability with arecord sensitivity up to frequencies of ~0.5 hz and to detect its break atfrequency =~2.4e-3 hz. we suggest that this break in the power spectrum resultsfrom the smoothing of the optical flux variability due to a finite size of theemitting region. based on our measurement of the break frequency in the powerspectrum, we estimated the size of the accretion-disk photosphere as 2e12 cm.we show that the amplitude of the variability in ss 433 decreases sharplyduring accretion-disk eclipses, but it does not disappear completely. thissuggests that the size of the variable optical emission source is comparable tothat of the normal star whose size is therefore r_o \approx 2e12 cm \approx 30r_sun. the decrease in flux variability amplitude during eclipses suggests thepresence of a nonvariable optical emission component with a magnitudem_r=~13.2.

1101.5550	supermassive black hole in an elliptical galaxy: accretion of a hot gas  with a low but finite angular momentum	the accretion of hot slowly rotating gas onto a supermassive black hole isconsidered. rotation velocities at the bondi radius r_b are small in comparisonwith speed of sound c_s. the centrifugal barrier at a depth r_c = l^2/g m_bh &lt;&lt;r_b hinders supersonic accretion. we take into account saturated electronthermal conductivity and bremsstrahlung energy losses of two temperature plasmafor density and temperature near the bondi radius similar to those observed inm87 galaxy. joint action of electron thermal conductivity and free-freeradiation leads to the effective cooling of accreting plasma and formation ofthe subsonic settling of accreting gas above the zone of a centrifugal barrier.a toroidal condensation and a hollow funnel that separates the torus from theblack hole emerge near the barrier. the barrier divides the flow into tworegions: (1) the settling zone with slow subkeplerian rotation and (2) the zonewith rapid supersonic nearly keplerian rotation. existence of the centrifugalbarrier leads to significant decrease of the accretion rate dm/dt in comparisonwith the critical bondi solution for gamma=5/3. shear instabilities in thetorus and related friction cause the gas to spread slowly in the equatorialplane in two directions. as a result, outer (r&gt;r_c) and inner (r&lt;r_c) disks areformed. the gas enters the zone of the internal adaf flow along the accretiondisk (r&lt;r_c). since the angular momentum is conserved, the outer disk removesoutward an excess of angular momentum along with part of the matter fallinginto the torus. such outer keplerian disk was observed by hubble spacetelescope around the nucleus of the m87 galaxy in the optical emission lines.turbulence causes rotation. we discuss the characteristic times during whichthe turbulence should lead to the changes in the orientation of the torus,accretion disk and, possibly, of the jet.

0802.3742	x-ray observations of the coma cluster in a broad energy band with  integral, rxte, and rosat observatories	we present results of x-ray observations of the coma cluster with multipleinstruments over a broad energy band. using the data from integral, rxte androsat observatories, we find that the coma spectrum in the 0.5-107 kev energyband can be well approximated by a thermal plasma emission model with atemperature of t=8.2 kev. integral was used to image the cluster emission inthe hard energy band. the cluster is only marginally detectable ~1.6sigma inthe 44-107 kev energy band; however, the raw flux in this band is consistentwith the previous results from beppo-sax and rxte observatories. we can excludewith high significance that the hard-band flux reported by beppo-sax and rxtecould be produced by a single point source. the 20-80 kev flux of a possiblenon-thermal component in the cluster spectrum is (6.0+-8.8)*10**-12ergs/cm^2/s. it is unlikely that the ic scattering of cmb photons is able toproduce hard x-ray flux at these levels, unless the magnetic field strength isas low as 0.2mug. the latter value can be considered as a lower limit on thefield strength in coma. we also present a temperature map of the central partof the cluster, which shows significant variations and in particular, a hot,~11.5 kev, region in the extension towards the subcluster infalling from thesouth-west.

0803.3584	pre-recombinational energy release and narrow features in the cmb  spectrum	energy release in the early universe (z&lt;~ 2x10^6) should lead to some broadspectral distortion of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) radiation field,which can be characterized as y-type distortion when the injection processstarted at redshifts z&lt;~ 5x10^4. here we demonstrate that if energy wasreleased before the beginning of cosmological hydrogen recombination (z~1400),closed loops of bound-bound and free-bound transitions in hi and heii lead tothe appearance of (i) characteristic multiple narrow spectral features at dmand cm wavelengths, and (ii) a prominent sub-millimeter feature consisting ofabsorption and emission parts in the far wien tail of cmb spectrum. theadditional spectral features are generated in the pre-recombinational epoch ofhi (z&gt;~1800) and heii (z&gt;~7000), and therefore differ from those arising due tonormal cosmological recombination in the undisturbed cmb blackbody radiationfield. we present the results of numerical computations including 25 atomicshells for both hi and heii, and discuss the contributions of severalindividual transitions in detail. as examples, we consider the case ofinstantaneous energy release (e.g. due to phase transitions) and exponentialenergy release because of long-lived decaying particles. our computations showthat due to possible pre-recombinational atomic transitions the variability ofthe cmb spectral distortion increases when comparing with the distortionsarising in the normal recombination epoch. the existence of these narrowspectral features would open an unique way to separate y-distortions due topre-recombinational ($1400&lt;~ z &lt;~5x10^4) energy release from those arising inthe post-recombinational era at redshifts z&lt;~800.

astro-ph;0204183	cosmic rays from microquasars: a narrow component to the cr spectrum?	we propose that relativistic galactic jets like those observed in grs1915+105 and gro j1655-40 may produce small but measurable contributions to thecosmic ray (cr) spectrum. if these jets contain cold protons and heavy ions (asin ss433), it is plausible that this component will consist of a narrowspectral feature, with a mean particle energy corresponding roughly to the bulkkinetic particle energy in the beam, gamma_jet m c^2, which, based on currentestimates of gamma_jet, falls into the range of 3-10 gev. the presence ofseveral sources with different gamma_jet will lead to superposition of severalsuch peaks. additionally, diffusive particle acceleration should produce apowerlaw whose low energy cutoff at or above gamma_jet^2 m c^2 would be visibleas another spectral feature. the large metallicities measured in severalmicroquasar companions suggest that this cr component could have an anomalouscomposition compared to the bulk galactic crs. we provide estimates of theeffects of adiabatic losses, which pose the greatest challenge to models ofnarrow band cr production in microquasar jets. while the total energy containedin the microquasar cr component is highly uncertain, the cr spectrum in thevicinity of microquasars would be severely affected. ams02 will be able toprobe the low energy cr spectrum for such components and composition anomalies.the spectrally peculiar gamma-ray emission produced by interaction of the ismwith crs surrounding microquasars might be detectable by glast. if the presenceof a microquasar cr proton component can be ruled out observationally, thisargument could be turned around in favor of electron-positron jets. we showthat existing osse/gro and future integral data on the galactic 511 kev lineflux put interesting constraints on the particle content of microquasar jets.

astro-ph;0404067	superposition of blackbodies and the dipole anisotropy: a possibility to  calibrate cmb experiments	the cmb angular temperature fluctuations observed by cobe and wmap enable usto place a lower limit on the spectral distortions of the cmb at any angularscale. these distortions are connected with the simple fact, that thesuperposition of blackbodies with different temperatures in general is not ablackbody. we show, that in the limit of small temperature fluctuations, thesuperposition of blackbodies leads to a y-type spectral distortion. it isknown, that the cmb dipole induces a y-type spectral distortion with quadrupoleand monopole angular distribution leading to a corresponding whole skyy-parameter of y~2.6\cdot 10^{-7}.we show here that taking the difference ofthe cmb signal in the direction of the maximum and minimum of the cmb dipoledue to the superposition of two blackbodies leads to a spectral distortion withy~3.1\cdot 10^{-6}. the amplitude of this distortion can be calculated to thesame precision as the cmb dipole, i.e. 0.3% today. therefore it may be used asa source with brightness of several or tens of \muk to cross calibrate andcalibrate different frequency channels of cmb surveys with precision of a fewtens or hundreds of nk. furthermore, we show in this work that primordialanisotropies for multipoles 2\leq l \leq 1000 also lead to spectral distortionsbut with much smaller y-parameter, i.e. y\sim 10^{-11}-10^{-9}.

astro-ph;0405487	cross terms and weak frequency dependent signals in the cmb sky	in this paper, we study the amplification of weak frequency dependent signalsin the cmb sky due to their cross correlation to intrinsic anisotropies. inparticular, we center our attention on mechanisms generating some weak signal,of peculiar spectral behaviour, such as resonant scattering in ionic, atomic ormolecular lines, thermal sz effect or extragalactic foreground emissions, whosetypical amplitude (denoted by $\epsilon$) is sufficiently smaller than theintrinsic cmb fluctuations. we find that all these effects involve either theautocorrelation of anisotropies generated during recombination ($z_{rec}$) orthe cross-correlation of those anisotropies with fluctuations arising at somelater redshift $z_i$. the degree of this correlation can be computed under theassumption that density fluctuations were generated as standard inflationarymodels dictate and that they evolved in time according to linear theory. incase that the weak signal is frequency dependent, we show that, by substractingpower spectra at different frequencies, it is possible to avoid the limitassociated to cosmic variance and unveil weaker terms linear in $\epsilon$. wefind that the correlation term shows a different spectral dependence than thesquared ($\propto \epsilon^2$) term considered usually, making its extractionparticularly straightforward for the thermal sz effect. furthermore, we findthat in most cases the correlation terms are particularly relevant at lowmultipoles and must be taken into account when characterising the powerspectrum associated to weak signals in the large angular scales.

astro-ph;0608242	cosmological hydrogen recombination: populations of the high level  sub-states	we present results for the spectral distortions of the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) arising due to bound-bound transitions during the epoch ofcosmological hydrogen recombination at frequencies down to nu~100mhz. we extendour previous treatment of the recombination problem now including the maincollisional processes and following the evolution of all the hydrogen angularmomentum sub-states for up to 100 shells. we show that, due to the low baryondensity of the universe, even within the highest considered shell fullstatistical equilibrium (se) is not reached and that at low frequencies therecombination spectrum is significantly different when assuming full se forn&gt;2. we also directly compare our results for the ionization history to theoutput of the recfast code, showing that especially at low redshifts rather bigdifferences arise. in the vicinity of the thomson visibility function theelectron fraction differs by roughly -0.6% which affects the temperature andpolarization power spectra by &lt;~1%. furthermore we shortly discuss theinfluence of free-free absorption and line broadening due to electronscattering on the bound-bound recombination spectrum and the generation of cmbangular fluctuations due to scattering of photons within the high shells.

astro-ph;0608256	hydrogen-like nitrogen radio line from hot interstellar and warm-hot  intergalactic gas	hyperfine structure lines of highly-charged ions may open a new window inobservations of hot rarefied astrophysical plasmas. in this paper we discussspectral lines of isotopes and ions abundant at temperatures 10^5-10^7 k,characteristic for warm-hot intergalactic medium, hot interstellar medium,starburst galaxies, their superwinds and young supernova remnants. observationsof these lines will allow to study bulk and turbulent motions of the observedtarget and will broaden the information about the gas ionization state,chemical and isotopic composition.  the most prospective is the line of the major nitrogen isotope havingwavelength 5.65 mm (sunyaev and churazov 1084). wavelength of this line iswell-suited for observation of objects at z=0.15-0.6 when it is redshifted to6.5-9 mm spectral band widely-used in ground-based radio observations, and, forexample, for z&gt;=1.3, when the line can be observed in 1.3 cm band and at lowerfrequencies. modern and future radio telescopes and interferometers are able toobserve the absorption by 14-n vii in the warm-hot intergalactic medium atredshifts above z=0.15 in spectra of brightest mm-band sources. sub-millimeteremission lines of several most abundant isotopes having hyperfine splittingmight also be detected in spectra of young supernova remnants.

astro-ph;0611172	the double compton emissivity in a mildly relativistic thermal plasma  within the soft photon limit	we provide simple and accurate analytic approximations for the low frequencydouble compton emission coefficient that are applicable in a broad range ofphysical situations up to mildly relativistic temperatures. theseapproximations may be useful for checking in which circumstances the doublecompton process is important. we perform series expansions of the doublecompton emission integral for low energies of the incident photon and electronand compare the derived analytic expressions with the results obtained bynumerical integrations of the full double compton cross section. we explicitlyderived analytic approximations to the low frequency double compton emissioncoefficient for initial monochromatic photons and wien spectra. we show thatcombining the analytic approximations given in this paper, an accuracy ofbetter than 5% over a very broad range of temperatures and under variousphysical conditions can be achieved. the double compton emissivity stronglydepends on the ratio of the incoming photon and electron energies: for hardphotons and cold electrons the emission is strongly suppressed compared to thecase of similar photon and electron energy, whereas in the opposite situation,i.e. hot electrons and soft initial photons, the emission is enhanced. forphotons and electrons close to thermodynamic equilibrium the double comptonemissivity increases less rapidly with temperature than in the lightman-thorneapproximation and the corrections exceed ~10% for temperatures above 4 kev.

astro-ph;0611497	on the influence of resonant scattering on cosmic microwave background  polarisation anisotropies	we implement the theory of resonant scattering in the context of cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) polarisation anisotropies. we compute the changes inthe e-mode polarisation (ee) and temperature e-mode (te) cmb power spectraintroduced by the scattering on a resonant transition with a given opticaldepth $\tau_x$ and polarisation coefficient $e_1$. the latter parameter,accounting for how anisotropic the scattering is, depends on the exchange ofangular momentum in the transition and enables, {\it a priori}, to distinguishamong different possible resonances. we use this formalism in two differentscenarios: cosmological recombination and cosmological reionisation. in thecontext of cosmological recombination, we compute predictions in frequency andmultipole space for the change in the te and ee power spectra introduced byscattering on the $h_{\alpha}$ and $p_{\alpha}$ lines of hydrogen. thisconstitutes a fundamental test for the standard model of recombination, and thesensitivity it requires is comparable to that needed in measuring theprimordial cmb b-mode polarisation component. in the context of reionisation,we study the scattering off metals and ions produced by the first stars, andfind that polarisation anisotropies, apart from providing a consistency testfor intensity measurements, give some insight on how reionisation evolved:since they keep memory of how anisotropic the line scattering is, they shouldbe able to discern the oi 63.2$\mu$m transition from other possible transitionsassociated to oiii, nii, niii, etc. the amplitude of these signals are,however, between 10 to 100 times below the (already challenging) level of cmbb-mode polarisation anisotropies.

astro-ph;9804181	hard x-ray observations of the x-ray pulsar a0535+26	we present the results of the observations of the giant bursts from the x-raypu lsar a0535+26 made by hexe onboard mir-kvant in april 1989, november 1993and february 1994. the pulse periods were measured, pulse profiles in differentenergy bands were produced, and their variability was investigated.  the power density spectra (pds) in 2x10^(-3)-1 hz range is presented, whichshape is typical for flicker-noise processes, usually observed in black holecandidates. the noise rms grows with energy from ~20% at 20 kev to ~30% at 80kev. the source photon spectrum in the 15-200 kev energy range and itsvariability over the pulse phase are reported. approximately the shape of thespectrum can be described by the "canonical" model for x-ray pulsars withpower-law index g~1.1, cut-off energy e_c~23 kev and folding energy e_f~19 kev.all these parameters are weakly dependent on the luminosity. the mostsignificant deviation from this continuum is observed at ~100 kev in thespectrum of the main pulse maximum. this feature is interpreted as a cyclotronline. comparison of the hexe data with the data from batse/cgro (bildsten etal., 1997) shows that in the high luminosity state (l~10^38 erg/s) the pulsar'spulse profile differs substantially from the pulse profile in thelow-luminosity (l~5x10^36 erg/s) state. this difference is explained by thequalitative change of the polar cap structure with formation of the accretioncolumns.

astro-ph;9811028	the disc accretion in gravitational field of a rapidly rotating neutron  star with a rotationally induced quadrupole mass distribution	we analyze the effect of the quadrupole component in the mass distribution ofa rapidly rotating neutron star on energy release in the boundary layer on thesurface of the accreting star and in the accretion disk in the cases where thestellar radius is smaller (or larger) than the radius of the marginally stablecircular orbit. we calculate the velocities and trajectories of the particlesthat fall on the stellar surface from the marginally stable orbit for a low-luminosity accreting source. the corresponding external gravitational field ofthe star is modeled by a new exact solution of the einstein equations invacuum. the parameters of this solution are adjusted by reconciling thenumerical data for the radius of the marginally stable orbit and thegravitational redshift of cook et al. (1994) with the corresponding data in theanalytical solution. for various equations of state, we consider 1.4 solar massnormal sequences and maximum mass normal sequences.

astro-ph;9903212	long-term variability of the hard x-ray source grs 1758-258:  granat/sigma observations	the results of granat/sigma hard x-ray observations of grs 1758-258 in1990-1998 are presented. the source lies at ~5\arcdeg from the galactic centerand was within the sigma field of view during the granat surveys of thisregion. the total exposure time of the galactic center was 11x10^6 s. theregular sigma observations revealed strong variability of the source: the40-150 kev flux varied at least by a factor of 8 on a time scale of a year,between less than 13 mcrab and ~100-110 mcrab. the average flux was ~60 mcrabin 1990-1998. the source's spectrum is well fitted by a power law with a photonindex \alpha ~1.86 in the energy range 40 to 150 kev and becomes steeper atenergies above ~100 kev. the radio and hard x-ray properties of grs 1758-258are similar to those of another galactic center source, 1e1740.7-2942. grs1758-258 and 1e1740.7-2942 are the two brightest hard x-ray sources in thegalactic center region. both sources have radio jets, similar x-rayluminosities (~10^37 erg/s), and spectra, and exhibit variations in the hardx-ray flux on long times scales by a factor of ~10 or more . in contrast tomost of the known black hole candidates, which are x-ray transients, grs1758-258 and 1e1740.7-2942 were detected by sigma during most of theobservations in 1990-1998. assuming that this behavior of the sources impliesthe suppression of accretion-disk instability in the region of partial hydrogenionization through x-ray heating, we impose constraints on the mass of theoptical companion and on the orbital period of the binary system.

astro-ph;9903287	microwave polarization in the direction of galaxy clusters induced by  the cmb quadrupole anisotropy	electron scattering induces a polarization in the cosmic microwave background(cmb) signal measured in the direction of a galaxy cluster due to the presenceof a quadrupole component in the cmb temperature distribution. measuring thepolarization towards distant clusters provides the unique opportunity toobserve the evolution of the cmb quadrupole at moderate redshifts, z~0.5-3. wedemonstrate that for the local cluster population the polarization degree willdepend on the cluster celestial position. there are two extended regions in thesky, which are opposite to each other, where the polarization is maximal,0.1(tau/0.02) microk in the rayleigh-jeans part of the cmb spectrum (tau beingthe thomson optical depth across the cluster) exceeding the contribution fromthe cluster transverse peculiar motion if v_t&lt;1300 km/s. one can hope to detectthis small signal by measuring a large number of clusters, thereby effectivelyremoving the systematic contribution from other polarization componentsproduced in clusters. these polarization effects, which are of the order of(v_t/c)^2 tau, (v_t/c) tau^2 and (kt_e/m_ec^2) tau^2, as well as thepolarization due to the cmb quadrupole, were previously calculated by sunyaevand zel'dovich for the rayleigh-jeans region. we fully confirm their earlierresults and present exact frequency dependencies for all these effects. thepolarization is considerably higher in the wien region of the cmb spectrum.

astro-ph;9904333	spread of matter over a neutron-star surface during disk accretion	disk accretion onto a slowly rotating neutron star with a weak magnetic field$h &lt; 3\times 10^8$ gauss is considered in a wide range of luminosities $1/100 &lt;l/l_{edd} &lt; 1,$ where $l_{edd}$ is the eddington luminosity. we construct atheory for the deceleration of rotation and the spread of matter over thestellar surface in the shallow-water approximation. the rotation slows down dueto friction against the dense underlying layers. the deceleration of keplerianrotation and the energy release take place on the stellar surface in alatitudinal belt whose meridional width rises with increasing $l.$ the combinedeffect of centrifugal force and radiation pressure gives rise to twolatitudinal rings of enhanced brightness which are symmetric around the equatorin the upper and lower hemispheres. they lie near the edges of differentiallyrotating and radiating upper and lower belts. the bright rings shift from theequatorial zone to higher latitudes when the luminosity $l$ rises. the ringzones are characterized by a minimum surface density and, accordingly, by amaximum meridional spread velocity. at a low accretion rate and luminosity, thereleased energy is removed through the comptonization of low-frequency photons.

astro-ph;9910280	the profile of a narrow line after single scattering by maxwellian  electrons: relativistic corrections to the kernel of the integral kinetic  equation	the frequency distribution of photons in frequency that results from singlecompton scattering of monochromatic radiation on thermal electrons is derivedin the mildly relativistic limit. algebraic expressions are given for (1) thephoton redistribution function, k(nu,omega -&gt; nu',omega'), and (2) the spectrumproduced in the case of isotropic incident radiation, p(nu -&gt; nu'). the formeris a good approximation for electron temperatures kt_e &lt; 25 kev and photonenergies hnu &lt; 50 kev, and the latter is applicable when hnu(hnu/m_ec^2) &lt; kt_e&lt; 25 kev, hnu &lt; 50 kev. both formulae can be used for describing the profilesof x-ray and low-frequency lines upon scattering in hot, optically thinplasmas, such as present in clusters of galaxies, in the coronae of accretiondisks in x-ray binaries and agns, during supernova explosions, etc. bothformulae can also be employed as the kernels of the corresponding integralkinetic equations (direction-dependent and isotropic) in the general problem ofcomptonization on thermal electrons. the k(nu,omega -&gt; nu',omega') kernel, inparticular, is applicable to the problem of induced compton interaction ofanisotropic low-frequency radiation of high brightness temperature with freeelectrons in the vicinity of powerful radiosources and masers.fokker-planck-type expansion (up to fourth order) of the integral kineticequation with the p(nu -&gt; nu') kernel derived here leads to a generalization ofthe kompaneets equation. we further present (1) a simpler kernel that isnecessary and sufficient to derive the kompaneets equation and (2) anexpression for the angular function for compton scattering in a hot plasma,which includes temperature and photon energy corrections to the rayleighangular function.

0810.1045	time-dependent corrections to the ly-alpha escape probability during  cosmological hydrogen recombination	we consider the effects connected with the detailed radiative transfer duringthe epoch of cosmological recombination on the ionization history of ouruniverse. we focus on the escape of photons from the hydrogen lyman-alpharesonance at redshifts 600&lt;~ z &lt;~ 2000, one of two key mechanisms defining therate of cosmological recombination. we approach this problem within thestandard formulation, and corrections due to two-photon interactions aredeferred to another paper. as a main result we show here that within anon-stationary approach to the escape problem, the resulting correction in thefree electron fraction, n_e, is about ~1.6-1.8% in the redshift range800&lt;~z&lt;~1200. therefore the discussed process results in one of the largestmodifications to the ionization history close to the maximum ofthomson-visibility function at z~1100 considered so far. we prove our resultsboth numerically and analytically, deriving the escape probability, andconsidering both lyman-alpha line emission and line absorption in a waydifferent from the sobolev approximation. in particular, we give a detailedderivation of the sobolev escape probability during hydrogen recombination, andexplain the underlying assumptions. we then discuss the escape of photons forthe case of coherent scattering in the lab frame, solving this problemanalytically in the quasi-stationary approximation and also in thetime-dependent case. we show here that during hydrogen recombination thesobolev approximation for the escape probability is not valid at the level ofdp/p~5-10%. this is because during recombination the ionization degree changessignificantly over a characteristic time dz/z~10%, so that at percent levelaccuracy the photon distribution is not evolving (abridged)
