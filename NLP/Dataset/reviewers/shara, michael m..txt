0905.1967	a near-infrared survey of the inner galactic plane for wolf-rayet stars  i. methods and first results: 41 new wr stars	the discovery of new wolf-rayet (wr) stars in our galaxy via large-scalenarrowband optical surveys has been severely limited by dust extinction. recentimprovements in infrared technology have made narrowband-broadband imagingsurveys viable again. we report a new j, k and narrow-band imaging survey of300 square degrees of the plane of the galaxy, spanning 150 degrees in galacticlongitude and reaching 1 degree above and below the galactic plane. the surveyhas a useful limiting magnitude of k = 15 over most of the observed galacticplane, and k = 14 within a few degrees of the galactic center. thousands ofemission line candidates have been detected. in spectrographic follow-ups of173 wr star candidates we have discovered 41 new wr stars, 15 of type wn and 26of type wc. star subtype assignments have been confirmed with k band spectra,and distances approximated using the method of spectroscopic parallax. a few ofthe new wr stars are amongst the most distant known in our galaxy. thedistribution of these new wr stars is seen to follow that of previously knownwr stars along the spiral arms of the galaxy. tentative radial velocities werealso measured for most of the new wr stars.

0906.0933	the nova shell and evolution of the recurrent nova t pyxidis	t pyxidis is the prototypical recurrent nova (rn) with a mysterious novashell. we report new observations of the shell with hst. the knots in the shellare expanding with velocities 500-715 km/s, for a distance of 3500 pc. thefractional expansion of the knots is constant, and this implies no significantdeceleration. hence, the knots were ejected by an eruption close to the year1866. knots have turned on after 1995, and this demonstrates that the knots arepowered by shocks from the collision of the 1866 ejecta with fast ejecta fromlater rn eruptions. the 1866 ejecta has a total mass of 10^-4.5 msun, whichwith the low ejection velocity shows that the 1866 event was an ordinary novaeruption, not a rn eruption. the accretion rate before the ordinary nova eventmust have been low (around the 4x10^-11 msun/yr expected for gravitationalradiation alone) and the matter accumulated on the surface of the white dwarffor ~750,000 years. the current accretion rate (&gt;10^-8 msun/yr) is 1000x higherthan expected for a system below the period gap, with the plausible reasonbeing that the 1866 event started a continuing supersoft source that drives theaccretion. a key fact about t pyx is that its accretion rate has been secularlydeclining since before the 1890 eruption, with the current rate being only 3%of its earlier rate. the decline in the observed accretion rate shows that thesupersoft source is not self-sustaining, and we calculate that the accretion int pyx will effectively stop in upcoming decades. with this, t pyx will enter astate of hibernation, lasting for an estimated 2,600,000 years, beforegravitational radiation brings the system into contact again. thus, t pyx hasan evolutionary cycle going from an ordinary cv state, to its current rn state,to a future hibernation state, and then repeating this cycle.

0911.1363	the brown dwarf kinematics project (bdkp). ii. details on nine wide  common proper motion very low-mass companions to nearby stars	we report on nine wide common proper motion systems containing late-type m,l, or t companions. we confirm six previously reported companions, and identifythree new systems. the ages of these systems are determined using diagnosticsfor both stellar primaries and low--mass secondaries and masses for thesecondaries are inferred using evolutionary models. of our three newdiscoveries, the m3+t6.5 pair g 204-39 and sdss j1758+4633 has an ageconstrained to 0.5-1.5 gyr making the secondary a potentially useful browndwarf benchmark. the g5+l4 pair g 200-28 and sdss j1416+5006 has a projectedseparation of ~25,000 au making it one of the widest and lowest binding energysystems known to date. the system containing nltt 2274 and sdss j0041+1341 isan older m4+l0 (&gt;4.5 gyr) pair which shows halpha activity in the secondary butnot the primary making it a useful tracer of age/mass/activity trends. we finda resolved binary frequency for widely-separated (&gt; 100 au) low--masscompanions (i.e. at least a triple system) which is at least twice thefrequency found for the field ultracool dwarf population. the ratio of triplesto binaries and quadruples to binaries is also high for this sample: 3:5 and1:4, respectively, compared to 8-parsec sample values of 1:4 and 1:26. theadditional components in these wide companion systems indicates a formationmechanism that requires a third or fourth component to maintain gravitationalstability or facilitate the exchange of angular momentum. the binding energiesfor the nine multiples discussed in this text are among the lowest known forwide low-mass systems, suggesting that weakly bound, low--to--intermediate mass(0.2m_sun &lt; m_tot &lt;1.0m_sun) multiples can form and survive to exist in thefield (1-8 gyr).

0707.2993	revised metallicity classes for low-mass stars: dwarfs (dm), subdwarfs  (sdm), extreme subdwarfs (esdm), and ultra subdwarfs (usdm)	the current classification system of m stars on the main sequencedistinguishes three metallicity classes (dwarfs - dm, subdwarfs - sdm, andextreme subdwarfs - esdm). the spectroscopic definition of these classes isbased on the relative strength of prominent cah and tio molecular absorptionbands near 7000a, as quantified by three spectroscopic indices (cah2, cah3, andtio5). we re-examine this classification system in light of our ongoingspectroscopic survey of stars with proper motion \mu &gt; 0.45 "/yr, which hasincreased the census of spectroscopically identified metal-poor m stars to over400 objects. kinematic separation of disk dwarfs and halo subdwarfs suggestdeficiencies in the current classification system. observations of commonproper motion doubles indicates that the current dm/sdm and sdm/esdm boundariesin the [tio5,cah2+cah3] index plane do not follow iso-metallicity contours,leaving some binaries inappropriately classified as dm+sdm or sdm+esdm. wepropose a revision of the classification system based on an empiricalcalibration of the tio/cah ratio for stars of near solar metallicity. weintroduce the parameter \zeta_{tio/cah} which quantifies the weakening of thetio bandstrength due to metallicity effect, with values ranging from\zeta_{tio/cah}=1 for stars of near-solar metallicity to \zeta_{tio/cah}~0 forthe most metal-poor (and tio depleted) subdwarfs. we redefine the metallicityclasses based on the value of the parameter \zeta_{tio/cah}; and refine thescheme by introducing an additional class of ultra subdwarfs (usdm). weintroduce sequences of sdm, esdm, and usdm stars to be used as formalclassification standards.

1002.2303	non-equipartition of energy, masses of nova ejecta, and type ia  supernovae	the total masses ejected during classical nova eruptions are needed to answertwo questions with broad astrophysical implications: can accreting white dwarfsbe pushed towards the chandrasekhar mass limit to yield type ia supernovae? areultra-luminous red variables a new kind of astrophysical phenomenon, or merelyextreme classical novae? we review the methods used to determine nova ejectamasses. except for the unique case of bt mon (nova 1939), all nova ejecta massdeterminations depend on untested assumptions and multi-parameter modeling. theremarkably simple assumption of equipartition between kinetic and radiatedenergy (e_kin and e_rad, respectively) in nova ejecta has been invoked as a wayaround this conundrum for the ultra-luminous red variable in m31. the deducedmass is far larger than that produced by any classical nova model. our novaeruption simulations show that radiation and kinetic energy in nova ejecta arevery far from being in energy equipartition, with variations of four orders ofmagnitude in the ratio e_kin/e_rad being commonplace. the assumption ofequipartition must not be used to deduce nova ejecta masses; any such"determinations" can be overestimates by a factor of up to 10,000. wedata-mined our extensive series of nova simulations to search for correlationsthat could yield nova ejecta masses. remarkably, the mass ejected during a novaeruption is dependent only on (and is directly proportional to) e_rad. if wemeasure the distance to an erupting nova and its bolometric light curve thene_rad and hence the mass ejected can be directly measured.

0704.0290	the core binary fractions of star clusters from realistic simulations	we investigate the evolution of binary fractions in star clusters usingn-body models of up to 100000 stars. primordial binary frequencies in thesemodels range from 5% to 50%. simulations are performed with the nbody4 code andinclude a full mass spectrum of stars, stellar evolution, binary evolution andthe tidal field of the galaxy. we find that the overall binary fraction of acluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at latetimes when a cluster is near dissolution. a critical exception occurs in thecentral regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time-- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a corebinary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase(occurring at 16 gyr with ~20000 stars remaining). binaries are destroyed inthe core by a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the combination ofmass-segregation and creation of new binaries in exchange interactions producesthe observed increase in relative number. we also find that binaries are cycledinto and out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to convection instars. for models of 100000 stars we show that the evolution of the core-radiusup to the end of the initial phase of core-collapse is not affected by theexact value of the primordial binary frequency (for frequencies of 10% orless). we discuss the ramifications of our results for the likely primordialbinary content of globular clusters.

1009.2961	the red nova-like variable in m31 - a blue candidate in quiescence	m31-rv was an extraordinarily luminous (~10^6 lsun) eruptive variable,displaying very cool temperatures (roughly 1000 kelvins) as it faded. thephotometric behavior of m31-rv (and several other very red novae, i.e. luminouseruptive red variables) has led to several models of this apparently new classof astrophysical object. one of the most detailed models is that of"mergebursts": hypothetical mergers of close binary stars. these are predictedto rival or exceed the brightest classical novae in luminosity, but to be muchcooler and redder than classical novae, and to become slowly hotter and blueras they age. this prediction suggests two stringent and definitive tests of themergeburst hypothesis. first, there should always be a cool red remnant, andnot a hot blue remnant at the site of such an outburst. second, the inflatedenvelope of a mergeburst event should be slowly contracting, hence it mustdisplay a slowly rising effective temperature. we have located a luminous,uv-bright object within 0.4 arcsec (1.5 sigma of the astrometric position) ofm31-rv in archival wfpc2 images taken 10 years after the outburst: it resemblesan old nova. twenty years after the outburst, the object remains much too hotto be a mergeburst. its behavior remains consistent with that of theoreticalnova models which erupt on a low mass white dwarf. future hubble uv and visibleimages could determine if the m31-rv analogs (in m85 and in m99) are alsobehaving like old novae.

1009.3864	an extended grid of nova models. iii. very luminous, red novae	extremely luminous, red eruptive variables like rv in m31 are being suggestedas exemplars of a new class of astrophysical object. our greatly extendedseries of nova simulations shows that classical nova models can produce veryred, luminous eruptions. in a poorly studied corner of 3-d nova parameter space(very cold, low-mass white dwarfs, accreting at very low rates) we find bonafide classical novae that are very luminous and red because they eject veryslowly moving, massive envelopes. a crucial prediction of these nova models -in contrast to the predictions of merging star ("mergeburst") models - is thata hot remnant, the underlying white dwarf, will emerge after the massiveejected envelope has expanded enough to become optically thin. this blueremnant must fade on a timescale of decades - much faster than a "mergeburst",which must fade on timescales of millennia or longer. furthermore, the coolingnova white dwarf and its expanding ejecta must become redder in the years aftereruption, while a contracting mergeburst must become hotter and bluer. wepredict that red novae will always brighten to l~1000 lsun for about 1 yearbefore rising to maximum luminosity at l~10^6 - 10^7 lsun. the maximumluminosity attainable by a nova is likely to be l~10^7 lsun, corresponding tom-12. in an accompanying paper we describe a fading, luminous blue candidatefor the remnant of m31-rv; it is observed with hst to be compatible only withthe nova model.

1109.1593	constraints on the progenitor system of the type ia supernova sn  2011fe/ptf11kly	type ia supernovae (sne) serve as a fundamental pillar of modern cosmology,owing to their large luminosity and a well-defined relationship betweenlight-curve shape and peak brightness. the precision distance measurementsenabled by sne ia first revealed the accelerating expansion of the universe,now widely believed (though hardly understood) to require the presence of amysterious "dark" energy. general consensus holds that type ia sne result fromthermonuclear explosions of a white dwarf (wd) in a binary system; however,little is known of the precise nature of the companion star and the physicalproperties of the progenitor system. here we make use of extensive historicalimaging obtained at the location of sn 2011fe/ptf11kly, the closest sn iadiscovered in the digital imaging era, to constrain the visible-lightluminosity of the progenitor to be 10-100 times fainter than previous limits onother sn ia progenitors. this directly rules out luminous red giants and thevast majority of helium stars as the mass-donating companion to the explodingwhite dwarf. any evolved red companion must have been born with mass less than3.5 times the mass of the sun. these observations favour a scenario where theexploding wd of sn 2011fe/ptf11kly, accreted matter either from another wd, orby roche-lobe overflow from a subgiant or main-sequence companion star.

1203.5543	the brown dwarf kinematics project (bdkp). iii. parallaxes for 70  ultracool dwarfs	we report parallax measurements for 70 ultracool dwarfs (ucds). using bothliterature values and our sample, we report new polynomial relations betweenspectral type and m$_{jhk}$. including resolved l/t transition binaries in therelations, we find no reason to differentiate between a "bright" (unresolvedbinary) and "faint" (single source) sample across the l/t boundary. isolatingearly t dwarfs, we find that the brightening of t0-t4 sources is prominent inm$_{j}$ where there is a [1.2 - 1.4] magnitude difference. a similar yetdampened brightening of [0.3 - 0.5] magnitude happens at m$_{h}$ and a plateauor dimming of [-0.2 - -0.3] magnitude is seen in m$_{k}$. comparing withevolutionary models that vary gravity, metallicity, and cloud thickness we findthat a near constant temperature of 1200 $\pm$100 k along a narrow spectralsubtype of t0-t4 is required to account for the brightening and color magnitudediagram of the l-dwarf/t-dwarf transition. furthermore, there is a significantpopulation of both l and t dwarfs which are red or potentially "ultra-cloudy"compared to the models, many of which are known to be young indicating acorrelation between enhanced photospheric dust and youth. for the lowsurface-gravity or young companion l dwarfs we find that 8 out of 10 are atleast [0.2-1.0] magnitude underluminous in m$_{jh}$ and/or m$_{k}$ compared toequivalent spectral type objects. we speculate that this is a consequence ofincreased dust opacity and conclude that low-surface gravity l dwarfs require acompletely new spectral-type/absolute magnitude polynomial for analysis.

1205.3531	the inter-eruption timescale of classical novae from expansion of the z  camelopardalis shell	the dwarf nova z camelopardalis is surrounded by the largest known classicalnova shell. this shell demonstrates that at least some dwarf novae must haveundergone classical nova eruptions in the past, and that at least someclassical novae become dwarf novae long after their nova thermonuclearoutbursts. the current size of the shell, its known distance, and the largestobserved nova ejection velocity set a lower limit to the time since z cam'slast outburst of 220 years. the brightest part of the z cam shell's radius iscurrently p ~ 1690 pixels. no expansion of the radius of the brightest part ofthe ejecta was detected, with an upper limit of pdot &lt; 1 pixel/3 years. thissuggests that the last z cam eruption occurred p/pdot &gt; 5,000 years ago.however, including the important effect of deceleration as the ejecta sweeps upinterstellar matter in its snowplow phase reduces the lower limit to 1300years. this is the first strong test of the prediction of nova thermonuclearrunaway theory that the inter-outburst times of classical novae are longer than1000 yr. the intriguing suggestion that z cam was a bright nova, recorded bychinese imperial astrologers in october - november 77 bce, is consistent withour measurements. if z cam was indeed the nova of 77 bce we predict that itsejecta are currently expanding at 85 km/s, or 0.11 arcsec/yr. detection andmeasurement of this rate of expansion are doable in just a few years.

1208.1280	at cnc: a second dwarf nova with a classical nova shell	we are systematically surveying all known and suspected z cam-type dwarfnovae for classical nova shells. this survey is motivated by the discovery ofthe largest known classical nova shell, which surrounds the archetypal dwarfnova z camelopardalis. the z cam shell demonstrates that at least some dwarfnovae must have undergone classical nova eruptions in the past, and that atleast some classical novae become dwarf novae long after their novathermonuclear outbursts, in accord with the hibernation scenario of cataclysmicbinaries. here we report the detection of a fragmented "shell", 3 arcmin indiameter, surrounding the dwarf nova at cancri. this second discoverydemonstrates that nova shells surrounding z cam-type dwarf novae cannot be veryrare. the shell geometry is suggestive of bipolar, conical ejection seen nearlypole-on. a spectrum of the brightest at cnc shell knot is similar to that ofthe ejecta of the classical nova gk per, and of z cam, dominated by [nii]emission. galex fuv imagery reveals a similar-sized, fuv-emitting shell. wedetermine a distance of 460 pc to at cnc, and an upper limit to its ejecta massof ~ 5 x 10^{-5} msun, typical of classical novae.

1212.1159	ultra-deep hubble space telescope imaging of the small magellanic cloud:  the initial mass function of stars with m &lt;~ 1 msun	we present a new measurement of the stellar initial mass function (imf) basedon ultra-deep, high-resolution photometry of &gt;5,000 stars in the outskirts ofthe small magellanic cloud (smc) galaxy. the hubble space telescope (hst)advanced camera for surveys (acs) observations reveal this rich, co-spatialpopulation behind the foreground globular cluster 47 tuc, which we targeted for121 hst orbits. the stellar main sequence of the smc is measured in the f606w,f814w color-magnitude diagram (cmd) down to ~30th magnitude, and is cleanlyseparated from the foreground star cluster population using proper motions. wesimulate the smc population by extracting stellar masses (single and unresolvedbinaries) from specific imfs, and converting those masses to luminosities inour bandpasses. the corresponding photometry for these simulated stars is drawndirectly from a rich cloud of 4 million artificial stars, thereby accountingfor the real photometric scatter and completeness of the data. over acontinuous and well populated mass range of m = 0.37 - 0.93 msun (i.e., down toa ~75% completeness limit at f606w = 28.7), we demonstrate that the imf is wellrepresented by a single power-law form with slope \alpha = -1.90(^{+0.15}_{-0.10}) (3 sigma error) (i.e., dn/dm \propto m^{\alpha}). this isshallower than the salpeter slope of \alpha = -2.35, which agrees with theobserved stellar luminosity function at higher masses. our results indicatethat the imf does {\it not} turn over to a more shallow power-law form withinthis mass range. we discuss implications of this result for the theory of starformation, the inferred masses of galaxies, and the (lack of a) variation ofthe imf with metallicity.

1302.6631	the vast population of wolf-rayet and red supergiant stars in m101: i.  motivation and first results	m101 is an ideal target in which to test predictions of massive star birthand evolution. the large abundance gradient across m101 (a factor of 20)suggests that many more wr stars must be found in the inner parts of thisgalaxy than in the outer regions. many hii regions and massive star-formingcomplexes have been identified in m101; they should be rich in wr stars, andsurrounded by rsg stars. finally, the wolf-rayet stars in m101 may be abundantenough for one to explode as a type ib or ic supernova and/or grb within ageneration. the clear identification of the progenitor of a type ib or icsupernova as a wr star would be a major confirmation of current stellarevolution theory.  motivated by these considerations, we have used the hubble space telescope tocarry out a deep, heii optical narrowband imaging survey of the massive starpopulations in the sci spiral galaxy m101. combined with archival broadbandimages, we were able to image almost the entire galaxy with the unprecedenteddepth and resolution that only hst affords.  we describe the extent of the survey and our images, as well as our datareduction procedures. a detailed study of a field east of the center of m101,containing the giant star-forming region ngc 5462, demonstrates how we findcandidates, their properties and spatial distribution, and how we rule out mostcontaminants. the spatial distributions of the wr and rsg stars near a giantstar-forming complex are strikingly different. wr stars dominate the complexcore, while rsg dominate the complex halo. future papers in this series willdescribe and catalog more than a thousand wr and rsg candidates that aredetectable in our images, as well as spectra of many of those candidates.

0802.4127	deep acs imaging in the globular cluster ngc6397: dynamical models	we present n-body models to complement deep imaging of the metal-poorcore-collapsed cluster ngc6397 obtained with the hubble space telescope. allsimulations include stellar and binary evolution in-step with the stellardynamics and account for the tidal field of the galaxy. we focus on the resultsof a simulation that began with 100000 objects (stars and binaries), 5%primordial binaries and population ii metallicity. after 16 gyr of evolutionthe model cluster has about 20% of the stars remaining and has reachedcore-collapse. we compare the color-magnitude diagrams of the model at this agefor the central region and an outer region corresponding to the observed fieldof ngc6397 (about 2-3 half-light radii from the cluster centre). thisdemonstrates that the white dwarf population in the outer region has sufferedlittle modification from dynamical processes - contamination of the luminosityfunction by binaries and white dwarfs with non-standard evolution histories isminimal and should not significantly affect measurement of the cluster age. wealso show that the binary fraction of main-sequence stars observed in thengc6397 field can be taken as representative of the primordial binary fractionof the cluster. for the mass function of the main-sequence stars we find thatalthough this has been altered significantly by dynamics over the clusterlifetime, especially in the central and outer regions, that the position of theobserved field is close to optimal for recovering the initial mass function ofthe cluster stars (below the current turn-off mass). more generally we look athow the mass function changes with radius in a dynamically evolved stellarcluster and suggest where the best radial position to observe the initial massfunction is for clusters of any age.

1406.3080	first detection and characterization of symbiotic stars in m31	symbiotic binaries are putative progenitors of type ia supernovae. the censusof galactic symbiotic binaries is so incomplete that we cannot reliablyestimate the total population of these stars, and use it to check whether thatnumber is consistent with the observed type ia supernova rate in spiralgalaxies. we have thus begun a survey of the nearest counterpart of our owngalaxy, namely m31, where a relatively complete census of symbiotic stars isachievable. we report the first detections and spectrographic characterizationsof 35 symbiotic binaries in m31, and compare these stars with the symbioticpopulation in the milky way. these newly detected m31 symbiotic binaries areremarkably similar to galactic symbiotics, though we are clearly only sampling(in this feasibility study) the most luminous symbiotics in m31. we have alsofound, in m31, the symbiotic star (m31sys j004233.17+412720.7) with the highestionization level known amongst all symbiotics. an optical outburst of the m31symbiotic star m31sys j004322.50+413940.9 was probably a nova-like outburst,the first symbiotic outburst detected outside the milky way and magellanicclouds.

1411.0382	observational signatures of snia progenitors, as predicted by models	a definitive determination of the progenitors of type ia supernovae (snia)has been a conundrum for decades. the single degenerate scenario $-$ a whitedwarf (wd) in a semi-detached binary system accreting mass from its secondary$-$ is a plausible path; however, no simulation to date has shown that such anoutcome is possible. in this study, we allowed a wd with a near chandrasekharmass of $1.4m_\odot$ to evolve over tens of thousands of nova cycles,accumulating mass secularly while undergoing periodic nova eruptions. wepresent the mass accretion limits within which a snia can possibly occur. theresults showed, for each parameter combination within the permitted limits,tens of thousands of virtually identical nova cycles where the accreted massexceeded the ejected mass, i.e. the wd grew slowly but steadily in mass.finally, the wd became unstable, the maximal temperature rose by nearly twoorders of magnitude, heavy element production was enhanced by orders ofmagnitude and the nuclear and neutrino luminosities became enormous. we alsofound that this mechanism leading to wd collapse is robust, with wds in therange $1.0 - 1.38m_\odot$, and an accretion rate of $5*10^{-7}m_\odot/yr$, allgrowing steadily in mass. these simulations of the onset of a snia event makeobservationally testable predictions about the light curves of pre-sn stars,and about the chemistry of snia ejecta.

1411.7061	dynamical interactions make hot jupiters in open star clusters	explaining the origin and evolution of exoplanetary "hot jupiters" remains asignificant challenge. one possible mechanism for their production isplanet-planet interactions, which produces hot jupiters from planets born farfrom their host stars but near their dynamical stability limits. in the muchmore likely case of planets born far from their dynamical stability limits, canhot jupiters can be formed in star clusters? our n-body simulations ofplanetary systems inside star clusters answer this question in the affirmative,and show that hot jupiter formation is not a rare event. we detail three casestudies of the dynamics-induced births of hot jupiters on highly eccentricorbits that can only occur inside star clusters. the hot jupiters' orbits bearremarkable similarities to those of some of the most extreme exoplanets known:hat-p-32 b, hat-p-2 b, hd 80606 b and gj 876 d. if stellar perturbations formedthese hot jupiters then our simulations predict that these very hot, innerplanets are often accompanied by much more distant gas giants in highlyeccentric orbits.

0805.0140	stellar exotica in 47 tucanae	we present far-uv spectroscopy obtained with hst for 48 blue objects in thecore of 47 tuc. based on their position in a fuv-optical colour-magnitudediagram, these were expected to include cataclysmic variables (cvs), bluestragglers (bss), white dwarfs (wds) and other exotic objects. for a subset ofthese sources, we also construct fuv-nir seds. based on our analysis of thisextensive data set, we report the following main results. (1) wespectroscopically confirm 3 previously known or suspected cvs via the detectionof emission lines and find new evidence for dwarf nova eruptions in two ofthese. (2) only one other source in our spectroscopic sample exhibits marginalevidence for line emission, but predicted and observed cv numbers still agreeto within a factor of about 2-3. (3) we have discovered a hot (t_eff = 8700 k),low-mass (m = 0.05 m_sun) secondary star in a previously known 0.8 day binarysystem. this exotic object is probably the remnant of a subgiant that has beenstripped of its envelope and may represent the ``smoking gun'' of a recentdynamical encounter. (4) we have found a helium wd, the second to be opticallydetected in 47 tuc, and the first outside a millisecond-pulsar system. (5) wehave discovered a bs-wd binary system, the first known in any globular cluster.(6) we have found two additional candidate wd binary systems with putative mainsequence and subgiant companions. (7) we estimate the wd binary fraction in thecore of 47 tuc to be 15 +17/-9 (stat) +8/-7 (sys). (8) one bs in our sample mayexceed twice the cluster turn-off mass, but the uncertainties are large. takenas a whole, our study illustrates the wide range of stellar exotica that arelurking in the cores of gcs, most of which are likely to have undergonesignificant dynamical encounters.

1508.03141	growing white dwarfs to the chandrasekhar limit: the parameter space of  the single degenerate snia channel	can a white dwarf, accreting hydrogen-rich matter from a non-degeneratecompanion star, ever exceed the chandrasekhar mass and explode as a type iasupernova? we explore the range of accretion rates that allow a white dwarf(wd) to secularly grow in mass, and derive limits on the accretion rate and onthe initial mass that will allow it to reach $1.4m_\odot$ --- the chandrasekharmass. we follow the evolution through a long series of hydrogen flashes, duringwhich a thick helium shell accumulates. this determines the effective heliummass accretion rate for long-term, self-consistent evolutionary runs withhelium flashes. we find that net mass accumulation always occurs despite heliumflashes. although the amount of mass lost during the first few helium shellflashes is a significant fraction of that accumulated prior to the flash, thatfraction decreases with repeated helium shell flashes. eventually no mass isejected at all during subsequent flashes. this unexpected result occurs becauseof continual heating of the wd interior by the helium shell flashes near itssurface. the effect of heating is to lower the electron degeneracy throughoutthe wd, and especially in the outer layers. this key result yields heliumburning that is quasi-steady state, instead of explosive. we thus find aremarkably large parameter space within which long-term, self-consistentsimulations show that a wd can grow in mass and reach the chandrasekhar limit,despite its helium flashes.

astro-ph;0108350	free-floating planets: not so surprising	we find that free-floating planets can remain bound to a star cluster formuch longer than was previously assumed: of the order of the cluster half-massrelaxation timescale as opposed to the crossing-time. this result is based onn-body simulations performed with the new grape-6 special purpose hardware andis important in the context of the preliminary detection of a population offree-floating sub-stellar objects in the globular cluster m22. the planets inour n-body study are of jupiter mass and are initially placed in circularorbits of between 0.05 and 50 au about a parent star whose mass is chosen froma realistic initial mass function. the presence of the free-floating planets isthe result of dynamical encounters between planetary systems and the clusterstars. most planets are liberated from their parent star in, or near, thecluster core, and then drift outwards on a timescale of ~ 10^{8-9} year. thisstill implies the existence of many (~100) planets per star if the m22 resultis confirmed.

astro-ph;0111496	spatially resolved stis spectra of wr+ob binaries with colliding winds	we present spatially resolved spectra of the visual wr+ob massive binarieswr86, wr146, and wr147, obtained with the space telescope imaging spectrographon board the hubble space telescope. the systems are classified as follows:wr86 = wc7 + b0 iii, wr146 = wc6 + o8 i-iif, wr147 = wn8 + o5-7 i-ii(f). bothwr146 and wr147 are known to have strong non-thermal radio emission arising ina wind-wind collision shock zone between the wr and ob components. we find thatthe spectra of their o companions show halpha profiles in emission, indicativeof large mass-loss rates, and consistent with the colliding-wind model. ourspectra indicate that the b component in wr86 has a low mass-loss rate, whichpossibly explains the fact that wr86, despite being a long period wr+ob binary,was not found to be a strong non-thermal radio emitter. because of the smallmass-loss rate of the b star component in wr86, the wind collision region mustbe closer to the b star and smaller in effective area, hence generating smalleramounts of non-thermal radio emission. absolute magnitudes for all the starsare estimated based on the spectral types of the components (based on thetables by schmidt-kaler for ob stars, and van der hucht for wr stars), andcompared with actual, observed magnitude differences. while the derivedluminosities for the wc7 and b0 iii stars in wr86 are consistent with theobserved magnitude difference, we find a discrepancy of at least 1.5 magnitudesbetween the observed luminosities of the components in each of wr146 and wr147and the absolute magnitudes expected from their spectral types. in both cases,it looks as though either the wr components are about 2 magnitudes too brightfor their spectral types, or that the o components are about 2 magnitudes toofaint. we discuss possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy.

astro-ph;0202179	star clusters as type ia supernova factories	we find a remarkably enhanced production rate in star clusters (relative tothe field) of very short period, massive double-white-dwarf stars and ofgiant-white dwarf binaries. these results are based on n-body simulationsperformed with the new grape-6 special purpose hardware and are important inidentifying and characterizing the progenitors of type ia supernovae. the highincidence of very close double-white-dwarf systems is the result of dynamicalencounters between (mostly) primordial binaries and other cluster stars.orbital hardening rapidly drives these degenerate binaries to periods under ~10hours. gravitational radiation emission and mergers producingsupra-chandrasekhar objects follow in less than a hubble time. if most starsare born in clusters then estimates of the double white dwarf merger rates ingalaxies (due to cluster dynamical interaction) must be increased more thantenfold. a majority of the roche lobe overflow giant-white dwarf binaries arenot primordial; they are produced in exchange reactions. most cases resulted ina common-envelope and formation of a double-white-dwarf binary rather thansupersoft x-ray sources leading possibly to a type ia supernova.

(2001). v36 has an orbital period of 0.4 or 0.8 days, blue optical colorsand is located within 1 arcsec of a chandra x-ray source. a few of theremaining cv candidates may represent chance superpositions or smc interlopers,but at least half are expected to be real cluster members with peculiar colors.however, only a few of these cv candidates are possible counterparts to chandrax-ray sources. thus it is not yet clear which, if any, of them are true cvs,rather than non-interacting ms/wd binaries or helium wds.

astro-ph;0302119	white dwarf sequences in dense star clusters	we use the results of realistic n-body simulations to investigate theappearance of the white dwarf population in dense star clusters. we show thatthe presence of a substantial binary population in a star cluster, and theinteraction of this population with the cluster environment, has seriousconsequences for the morphology of the observed white dwarf sequence and thederived white dwarf cooling age of the cluster. we find that over time thedynamical evolution of the cluster -- mass-segregation, stellar interactionsand tidal stripping -- hampers the use of white dwarfs as tracers of theinitial mass function, and also leads to a significant enhancement of the whitedwarf mass fraction. future observations of star clusters should be conductedslightly interior to the half-mass radius of the cluster in order to bestobtain information about the cluster age and initial mass function from thewhite dwarf luminosity function. the evolution of binary stars and the clusterenvironment must necessarily be accounted for when studying the white dwarfpopulations of dynamically evolved star clusters.

astro-ph;0309168	a far-ultraviolet survey of 47 tucanae.ii the long-period cataclysmic  variable ako 9	we present time-resolved, far-ultraviolet (fuv) spectroscopy and photometryof the 1.1 day eclipsing binary system ako 9 in the globular cluster 47tucanae. the fuv spectrum of ako 9 is blue and exhibits prominent c iv and heii emission lines. the spectrum broadly resembles that of long-period,cataclysmic variables in the galactic field.  combining our time-resolved fuv data with archival optical photometry of 47tuc, we refine the orbital period of ako 9 and define an accurate ephemeris forthe system. we also place constraints on several other system parameters, usinga variety of observational constraints. we find that all of the empiricalevidence is consistent with ako 9 being a long-period dwarf nova in which masstransfer is driven by the nuclear expansion of a sub-giant donor star. wetherefore conclude that ako 9 is the first spectroscopically confirmedcataclysmic variable in 47 tuc.  we also briefly consider ako 9's likely formation and ultimate evolution.regarding the former, we find that the system was almost certainly formeddynamically, either via tidal capture or in a 3-body encounter. regarding thelatter, we show that ako 9 will probably end its cv phase by becoming adetached, double wd system or by exploding in a type ia supernova.

astro-ph;0310845	microlensing candidates in m87 and the virgo cluster with the hubble  space telescope	the position of the giant elliptical galaxy m87 at the center of the virgocluster means that the inferred column density of dark matter associated withboth the cluster halo and the galaxy halo is quite large. this system is thusan important laboratory for studying massive dark objects in ellipticalgalaxies and galaxy clusters by gravitational microlensing, stronglycomplementing the studies of spiral galaxy halos performed in the local group.we have performed a microlensing survey of m87 with the wfpc2 instrument on thehubble space telescope. over a period of thirty days, with images taken oncedaily, we discover seven variable sources. four are variable stars of somesort, two are consistent with classical novae, and one exhibits an excellentmicrolensing lightcurve, though with a very blue color implying the somewhatdisfavored possibility of a horizontal branch source being lensed. based onsensitivity calculations from artificial stars and from artificial lightcurves,we estimate the expected microlensing rate. we find that the detection of oneevent is consistent with a dark halo with a 20% contribution of microlensingobjects for both m87 and the virgo cluster, similar to the value found fromobservations in the local group. further work is required to test thehypothesized microlensing component to the cluster.

astro-ph;0311327	the h-alpha light curves and spatial distribution of novae in m81	we present the results of a preliminary h-alpha survey of m81 for novaeconducted over a 5 month interval using the 5' field of view camera (wfcam) onthe calypso telescope at kitt peak, az. we observed m81 nearly every clearnight during this interval, covering the entire galaxy, and discovered 12novae. our comprehensive time coverage allowed us to produce the most completeset of h-alpha light curves for novae in m81 to date. a raw nova rate for m81gives 23 yr^-1 which, because of the nature of our survey, is a hard lowerlimit. an analysis of the completeness in our survey gives a corrected novarate of 30 yr^-1. this agrees well with the rate of 33 (+13,-8) yr^-1, derivedfrom monte carlo simulations using nova light curves and survey frame limits.the spatial distribution of the novae we discovered follows the bulge lightmuch better than the disk or total light according to kolmogorov - smirnovtests of their radial distributions. the asymmetry in the distribution of novaeacross the major axis line of m81 implies a bulge-to-disk nova ratio of &gt; 9 andsupports the idea that novae originate primarily in older stellar populations.

astro-ph;0404065	first evidence of circumstellar disks around blue straggler stars	we present an analysis of optical hst/stis and hst/fos spectroscopy of 6 bluestragglers found in the globular clusters m3, ngc6752 and ngc6397. these starsare a subsample of a set of ~50 blue stragglers and stars above the mainsequence turn-off in four globular clusters which will be presented in anforthcoming paper. all but the 6 stars presented here can be well fitted withnon-lte model atmospheres. the 6 misfits, on the other hand, possess balmerjumps which are too large for the effective temperatures implied by theirpaschen continua. we find that our data for these stars are consistent withmodels only if we account for extra absorption of stellar balmer photons by anionized circumstellar disk. column densities of hi and caii are derived as arethe the disks' thicknesses. this is the first time that a circumstellar disk isdetected around blue stragglers. the presence of magnetically-locked disksattached to the stars has been suggested as a mechanism to lose the largeangular momentum imparted by the collision event at the birth of these stars.the disks implied by our study might not be massive enough to constitute suchan angular momentum sink, but they could be the leftovers of once larger disks.

astro-ph;0404197	hubble space telescope imaging of the wr 38/wr38a cluster	we are conducting a high angular resolution imaging survey of galacticwolf-rayet stars using the wide field and planetary camera 2 aboard the hubblespace telescope. we have found a small stellar cluster associated with thefaint, close pair wr 38 and wr 38a. we present astrometric measurements andphotometry in the wide-band f336w (u), f439w (b), and f555w (v) filter systemfor these cluster and nearby stars. we compare their colors and magnitudes withcalibrated model results for reddened stars to identify seven probable mainsequence members of the cluster. a least-squares fit of the colors andmagnitudes of this set yields a cluster reddening of e(b-v) = 1.45 +/- 0.14 magand a distance of 3.7^{+3.8}_{-1.2} kpc. we discuss the relationship of thiscluster to other objects along the line of sight, and we argue that thedistance probably lies in the range 5 - 8 kpc (but is not as great as 14.5 kpcdistance recently advocated by shorlin, turner, &amp; pedreros). at a distance of 8kpc, the cluster would reside in a dense region of the carina spiral arm, closeto a giant molecular cloud and the starburst cluster ngc 3603.

astro-ph;0412070	a catalog of northern stars with annual proper motions larger than 0.15  seconds of arc (lspm catalog - north)	the lspm-north catalog is a comprehensive list of 61,977 stars north of thej2000 celestial equator that have proper motions larger than 0.15 seconds ofarc per year (local-background-stars frame). the catalog has been generatedprimarily as a result of our systematic search for high proper motion stars inthe digitized sky surveys using our superblink software. at brightermagnitudes, the catalog incorporates stars and data from the tycho-2 catalogueand also, to a lesser extent, from the all-sky compiled catalogue of 2.5million stars. the lspm catalog expands considerably over the old luyten (lhs,nltt) catalogs, superseding them for northern declinations. corrections to thelocal-background-stars proper motions have been calculated, and absolute propermotions in the extragalactic frame are given. the catalog is estimated to beover 99% complete at high galactic latitudes (|b&gt;15|), and over 90% complete atlow galactic latitudes (|b&lt;15|), down to a magnitude v=19.0, and has a limitingmagnitude v=21.0. all the northern stars listed in the lhs and nltt catalogshave been re-identified, and their positions, proper motions and magnitudesre-evaluated. the catalog also lists a large number of completely new objects,which promise to expand very significantly the census of red dwarfs, subdwarfs,and white dwarfs in the vicinity of the sun.

astro-ph;0501030	a possible high nova rate for two local group dwarf galaxies: m32 and  ngc 205	we report the results of a preliminary nova survey of local group dwarfellipticals. we used the tenagra observatory to observe m32, ngc 205, ngc 147,and ngc 185 in their entirety every clear night over a 4.5 month interval anddiscovered one nova in m32 and a candidate nova in ngc 205. the nova in m32 wasverified spectroscopically. the nova candidate in ngc 205 had an unusually lowpeak luminosity (m_v = -5.1), and we were unable to obtain spectroscopicverification. we report a high bulk nova rate for m32 of 2(+2.4,-1.0) yr^-1and, assuming the candidate nova is correctly identified, for ngc 205 of2(+2.2,-1.0) yr^-1. if the ngc 205 variable is not a nova, we calculate anupper limit on the bulk nova rate for ngc 205 of 1.5 yr^-1. we report upperlimits on the bulk nova rates in ngc 147 of 2 yr^-1 and ngc 185 of 1.8 yr^-1and a combined bulk nova rate for the four galaxies of 4(+4.2,-1.4) yr^-1(2{+3.9,-1.4} yr^-1 without the ngc 205 nova candidate). from the bulk rates,integrated and extinction corrected v-band photometry, and (v-k)_0 colors wederive a luminosity specific nova rate for m32 of 12.0(+14.4,-6.0) yr^-1 [10^10l_sun,k]^-1 and for ngc 205 of 29.3(+32.3,-14.7) yr^-1 [10^10 l_sun,k]^-1 andfor the combined 4 galaxies of 14.1(+14.8,-4.9) yr^-1 [10^10 l_sun,k]^-1(7.0{+13.7,-4.9} yr^-1[10^10 l_sun,k]^-1 without the ngc 205 nova candidate).if the higher rate is confirmed by surveys in subsequent seasons, it wouldimply that either dwarf ellipticals have a higher interacting binary fractionthan their higher mass counter parts, or that the completeness is higher forthese less complex systems and the nova rates for larger, more distant systemsare systematically underestimated.

astro-ph;0506709	erupting cataclysmic variable stars in the nearest globular cluster, ngc  6397: intermediate polars?	ngc 6397 is the closest globular cluster, and hence the ideal place to searchfor faint stellar populations such as cataclysmic variables (cvs). hst andchandra observers have identified nine certain and likely cvs in this nearbycluster, including several magnetic cv candidates. we have combined our recentuv imagery with archival hst images of ngc 6397 to search for new cv candidatesand especially to look for dwarf nova-like eruptive events. we find remarkableand somewhat unexpected dwarf nova-like eruptions of the two well-knowncataclysmic systems cv2 and cv3. these two objects have been claimed to be {\itmagnetic} cvs, as indicated by their helium emission-line spectra. magneticfields in cvs are usually expected to prevent the disk instability that leadsto dwarf nova eruptions. in fact, most field magnetic cvs are observed to notundergo eruptions. our observations of the dwarf nova eruptions of cv2 and cv3can be reconciled with these objects' heii emission lines if both objects areinfrequently-erupting intermediate polars, similar to ex hya. if this is thecase for most globular cluster cvs then we can reconcile the many x-ray and uvbright cv candidates seen by chandra and hst with the very small numbers oferupting dwarf novae observed in cluster cores.

astro-ph;0508406	cataclysmic and close binaries in star clusters. v. erupting dwarf  novae, faint blue stars, x-ray sources, and the classical nova in the core of  m80	large populations of cataclysmic variables (cvs) in globular clusters havelong been predicted, but the number of absolutely certain cluster cvs known inglobulars is still less than 10. hst and chandra observers have recently founddozens of cataclysmic variable candidates in several populous globularclusters. confirmation and characterization of these candidates are extremelydifficult, thus identification of unambiguous cvs remains important. we havesearched all archival hst images of the dense globular cluster m80 for eruptingdwarf novae (dn), and to check the outburst behaviors of two very blue objectsfirst identified a decade ago. two new erupting dwarf novae were found in 8searched epochs, making m80 a record holder for erupting dn. the quiescentclassical nova in m80 varies by no more than a few tenths of a magnitude ontimescales of minutes to years, and a similar faint, blue object varies by asimilar amount. simulations and completeness tests indicate that there are atmost 3 erupting dn like ss cyg and at most 9 u gem-like dn in m80. either thisvery dense cluster contains about an order of magnitude fewer cvs than theorypredicts, or most m80 cvs are extremely faint and/or erupt very infrequentlylike wz sge. we have detected a sequence of 54 objects running parallel to themain sequence and several tenths of a magnitude bluewards of it. these blueobjects are significantly more centrally concentrated than the main sequencestars, but not as centrally concentrated as the blue stragglers. we suggestthat these objects are white dwarf--red dwarf binaries, and that some are thefaint cv population of m80.

astro-ph;0510101	discovery of a nearby halo white dwarf with proper motion mu=2.55  arcsec/yr	we report the discovery of pm j13420-3415, a faint (v=17) white dwarf with avery high proper motion mu = 2.55 arcsec/yr. the star was found in the southernsky extension of the superblink proper motion survey. a red spectrum shows theclassical signature of a da white dwarf, with a weak h-alpha line in absorptionas the only prominent feature. the star is also found to have a large radialvelocity v_rad = +212+/-15 km/s. at the adopted distance of 18 pc, the star hasa very large space motion of 313 km/s relative to the sun. an integration ofthe space motion shows that the star is on a nearly polar galactic orbit, andis thus an unambiguous member of the galactic halo. however, with an estimatedeffective temperature 5,000k &lt; t_eff &lt; 5,500k, the white dwarf appears to bemuch younger than expected for a denizen of the halo. the apparent paradox canbe explained if the white dwarf is the relatively young (~2 gyr) remnant of alonger-lived (10-14 gyr) main sequence star, in which case the object ispredicted to be a low-mass white dwarf with m ~ 0.45 m_sun.

astro-ph;0701738	the white dwarf cooling sequence of ngc6397	we present the results of a deep hubble space telescope (hst) exposure of thenearby globular cluster ngc6397, focussing attention on the cluster's whitedwarf cooling sequence. this sequence is shown to extend over 5 magnitudes indepth, with an apparent cutoff at magnitude f814w=27.6. we demonstrate, usingboth artificial star tests and the detectability of background galaxies atfainter magnitudes, that the cutoff is real and represents the truncation ofthe white dwarf luminosity function in this cluster. we perform a detailedcomparison between cooling models and the observed distribution of white dwarfsin colour and magnitude, taking into account uncertainties in distance,extinction, white dwarf mass, progenitor lifetimes, binarity and cooling modeluncertainties. after marginalising over these variables, we obtain values forthe cluster distance modulus and age of \mu_0 = 12.02 \pm 0.06 and t_c = 11.47\pm 0.47gyr (95% confidence limits). our inferred distance and white dwarfinitial-final mass relations are in good agreement with other independentdeterminations, and the cluster age is consistent with, but more precise than,prior determinations made using the main sequence turnoff method. inparticular, within the context of the currently accepted \lambda cdmcosmological model, this age places the formation of ngc6397 at a redshift z=3,at a time when the cosmological star formation rate was approaching its peak.

astro-ph;0703424	an astrometric companion to the nearby metal-poor, low-mass star lhs  1589	we report the discovery of a companion to the high proper motion star lhs1589, a nearby high-velocity, low-mass subdwarf. the companion (lhs 1589b) islocated 0.224+/-0.004" to the southwest of the primary (lhs 1589a), and is 0.5magnitude fainter than the primary in the k_s band. the pair was resolved withthe ircal infrared camera at lick observatory, operating with the laser guidestar adaptive optics system. a low-resolution spectrum of the unresolved pairobtained at the mdm observatory shows the source to be consistent with a coolsubdwarf of spectral subtype sdk7.5. a photometric distance estimate places themetal-poor system at a distance d=81+/-18 parsecs from the sun. we also measurea radial velocity v_rad=67+/-8 km/s which, together with the proper motion andestimated distance, suggests that the pair is roaming the inner galactic haloon a highly eccentric orbit. with a projected orbital separation s=18.1+/-4.8au, and a crude estimate of the system's total mass, we estimate the orbitalperiod of the system to be in the range 75 yr &lt; p &lt; 500 yr. this suggests thatthe dynamical mass of the system could be derived astrometrically, aftermonitoring the orbital motion over a decade or so. the lhs 1589ab system couldthus provide a much needed constraint to the mass-luminosity relationship ofmetal-poor, low-mass stars.

0809.3008	the brown dwarf kinematics project (bdkp) i. proper motions and  tangential velocities for a large sample of late-type m, l and t dwarfs	we report proper motion measurements for 427 late-type m, l and t dwarfs, 332of which have been measured for the first time. combining these new propermotions with previously published measurements yields a sample of 841 m7-t8dwarfs. we combined parallax measurements or calculated spectrophotometricdistances and computed tangential velocities for the entire sample. we findthat kinematics for the full and volume-limited 20 pc samples are consistentwith those expected for the galactic thin disk, with no significant differencesbetween late-type m, l, and t dwarfs. applying an age-velocity relation weconclude that the average kinematic age of the 20 pc sample of ultracool dwarfsis older than recent kinematic estimates and more consistent with age resultscalculated with population synthesis models. there is a statistically distinctpopulation of high tangential velocity sources whose kinematics suggest an evenolder population of ultracool dwarfs belonging to either the galactic thickdisk or halo. we isolate subsets of the entire sample, including lowsurface-gravity dwarfs, unusually blue l dwarfs, and photometric outliers inj-ks color and investigate their kinematics. we find that the spectroscopicallydistinct class of unusually blue l dwarfs has kinematics clearly consistentwith old age, implying that high surface-gravity and/or low metallicity may berelevant to their spectral properties. the low surface-gravity dwarfs arekinematically younger than the overall population, and the kinematics of thered and blue ultracool dwarfs suggest ages that are younger and older than thefull sample, respectively. we also present a reduced proper motion diagram at2mass ks for the entire population and find that a limit of h_ks &gt; 18 excludesm dwarfs from the l and t dwarf population regardless of near-infrared color.

astro-ph;9907400	the early palomar program (1950-1955) for the discovery of classical  novae in m81: analysis of the spatial distribution, magnitude distribution,  and distance suggestion	data obtained in the 1950-1955 palomar campaign for the discovery ofclassical novae in m81 are set out in detail. positions and apparent bmagnitudes are listed for the 23 novae that were found. there is modestevidence that the spatial distribution of the novae does not track the bbrightness distribution of either the total light or the light beyond anisophotal radius that is $70\arcsec$ from the center of m81. the novadistribution is more extended than the aforementioned light, with a significantfraction of the sample appearing in the outer disk/spiral arm region. wesuggest that many (perhaps a majority) of the m81 novae that are observed atany given epoch (compared with say $10^{10}$ years ago) are daughters ofpopulation i interacting binaries. the conclusion that the present day novaeare drawn from two population groups, one from low mass white dwarf secondariesof close binaries identified with the bulge/thick disk population, and theother from massive white dwarf secondaries identified with the outer thindisk/spiral arm population, is discussed. we conclude that the m81 data areconsistent with the two population division as argued previously from (1) theobservational studies on other grounds by della valle et al. (1992, 1994),della valle &amp; livio (1998), and shafter et al. (1996) of nearby galaxies, (2)the hatano et al. (1997a,b) monte carlo simulations of novae in m31 and in thegalaxy, and (3) the yungelson et al. (1997) population synthesis modeling ofnova binaries. two different methods of using m81 novae as distance indicatorsgive a nova distance modulus for m81 as $(m-m)_0 = 27.75$, consistent with thecepheid modulus that is the same value.
