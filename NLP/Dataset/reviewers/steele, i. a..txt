0903.1414	evidence for energy injection and a fine-tuned central engine at optical  wavelengths in grb 070419a	we present a comprehensive multiwavelength temporal and spectral analysis ofthe fred grb 070419a. the early-time emission in the $\gamma$-ray and x-raybands can be explained by a central engine active for at least 250 s, while atlate times the x-ray light curve displays a simple power-law decay. incontrast, the observed behaviour in the optical band is complex (from 10$^2$ upto 10$^6$ s). we investigate the light curve behaviour in the context of thestandard forward/reverse shock model; associating the peak in the optical lightcurve at $\sim$450 s with the fireball deceleration time results in a lorenzfactor $\gamma \approx 350$ at this time. in contrast, the shallow opticaldecay between 450 and 1500 s remains problematic, requiring a reverse shockcomponent whose typical frequency is above the optical band at the optical peaktime for it to be explained within the standard model. this predicts anincreasing flux density for the forward shock component until t $\sim$ 4$\times$ 10$^6$ s, inconsistent with the observed decay of the optical emissionfrom t $\sim$ 10$^4$ s. a highly magnetized fireball is also ruled out due tounrealistic microphysic parameters and predicted light curve behaviour that isnot observed. we conclude that a long-lived central engine with a finely tunedenergy injection rate and a sudden cessation of the injection is required tocreate the observed light curves - consistent with the same conditions that areinvoked to explain the plateau phase of canonical x-ray light curves of grbs.

0903.2958	rise and fall of the x-ray flash 080330: an off-axis jet?	x-ray flashes (xrfs) are a class of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) with the peakenergy of the time-integrated spectrum, ep, below 30 kev, whereas classicalgrbs have ep of a few hundreds kev. apart from ep and the lower luminosity, theproperties of xrfs are typical of the classical grbs. yet, the nature of xrfsand the differences from that of grbs are not understood. in addition, there isno consensus on the interpretation of the shallow decay phase observed in mostx-ray afterglows of both xrfs and grbs. we examine in detail the case of xrf080330 discovered by swift at the redshift of 1.51. this burst isrepresentative of the xrf class and exhibits an x-ray shallow decay. the richand broadband (from nir to uv) photometric data set we collected across thisphase makes it an ideal candidate to test the off-axis jet interpretationproposed to explain both the softness of xrfs and the shallow decay phase. wepresent prompt gamma-ray, early and late ir/visible/uv and x-ray observationsof the xrf 080330. we derive a sed from nir to x-ray bands across the plateauphase with a power-law index of 0.79 +- 0.01 and negligible rest-frame dustextinction. the multi-wavelength evolution of the afterglow is achromatic from~10^2 s out to ~8x10^4 s. we describe the temporal evolution of themulti-wavelength afterglow within the context of the standard afterglow modeland show that a single-component jet viewed off-axis explains the observations(abriged).

0905.4680	a transit timing analysis of nine rise light curves of the exoplanet  system tres-3	we present nine newly observed transits of tres-3, taken as part of a transittiming program using the rise instrument on the liverpool telescope. amarkov-chain monte-carlo analysis was used to determine the planet-star radiusratio and inclination of the system, which were found to berp/rstar=0.1664^{+0.0011}_{-0.0018} and i = 81.73^{+0.13}_{-0.04} respectively,consistent with previous results. the central transit times and uncertaintieswere also calculated, using a residual-permutation algorithm as an independentcheck on the errors. a re-analysis of eight previously published tres-3 lightcurves was conducted to determine the transit times and uncertainties usingconsistent techniques. whilst the transit times were not found to be inagreement with a linear ephemeris, giving chi^2 = 35.07 for 15 degrees offreedom, we interpret this to be the result of systematics in the light curvesrather than a real transit timing variation. this is because the light curvesthat show the largest deviation from a constant period either have relativelylittle out-of-transit coverage, or have clear systematics. a new ephemeris wascalculated using the transit times, and was found to be t_c(0) = 2454632.62610+- 0.00006 hjd and p = 1.3061864 +- 0.0000005 days. the transit times were thenused to place upper mass limits as a function of the period ratio of apotential perturbing planet, showing that our data are sufficiently sensitiveto have probed for sub-earth mass planets in both interior and exterior 2:1resonances, assuming the additional planet is in an initially circular orbit.

0909.4160	bolometric luminosity variations in the luminous blue variable afgl2298	we characterise the variability in the physical properties of the luminousblue variable afgl2298 between 1989-2008. in conjunction with published datafrom 1989-2001, we have undertaken a long term (2001-2008) near-irspectroscopic and photometric observational campaign for this star and utilisea non-lte model atmosphere code to interpret these data. we find afgl2298 tohave been highly variable during the two decades covered by the observationaldatasets. photometric variations of &gt;1.6 mag have been observed in the jhkwavebands; however, these are not accompanied by correlated changes in near-ircolour. non-lte model atmosphere analysis of 4 epochs of k band spectroscopyobtained between 2001-7 suggests that the photometric changes were driven byexpansion and contraction of the stellar photosphere accompanied bycomparatively small changes in the stellar temperature. unclumped mass lossrates throughout this period were modest and directly comparable to those ofother highly luminous lbvs. however, the bolometric luminosity of afgl2298appears to have varied by at least a factor of ~2 between 1989-2008, with itbeing one of the most luminous stars in the galaxy during maximum. comparisonto other lbvs that have undergone non bolometric luminosity conserving`eruptions' shows such events to be heterogeneous, with afgl2298 the leastextreme example. these results - and the diverse nature of both the quiescentlbvs and associated ejecta - may offer support to the suggestion that more thanone physical mechanism is responsible for such behaviour.

1003.4250	grb 090902b: afterglow observations and implications	the optical-infrared afterglow of the lat-detected long duration burst, grb090902b, has been observed by several instruments. the earliest detection byrotse-iiia occurred 80 minutes after detection by the gbm instrument onboardthe fermi gamma-ray space telescope, revealing a bright afterglow and a decayslope suggestive of a reverse shock origin. subsequent optical-ir observationsfollowed the light curve for 6.5 days. the temporal and spectral behavior atoptical-infrared frequencies is consistent with synchrotron fireball modelpredictions; the cooling break lies between optical and xrt frequencies ~ 1.9days after the burst. the inferred electron energy index is $p = 1.8 \pm 0.2$,which would however imply an x-ray decay slope flatter than observed. the xrtand lat data have similar spectral indices and the observed steeper value ofthe lat temporal index is marginally consistent with the predicted temporaldecay in the radiative regime of the forward shock model. absence of a jetbreak during the first 6 days implies a collimation-corrected $\gamma$-rayenergy $e_{\gamma} &gt; 2.2\times10^{52}\rm$ ergs, one of the highest ever seen ina long-duration grbs. more events combining gev photon emission withmulti-wavelength observations will be required to constrain the nature of thecentral engine powering these energetic explosions and to explore thecorrelations between energetic quanta and afterglow emission.

1005.0966	ogle 2008--blg--290: an accurate measurement of the limb darkening of a  galactic bulge k giant spatially resolved by microlensing	gravitational microlensing is not only a successful tool for discoveringdistant exoplanets, but it also enables characterization of the lens and sourcestars involved in the lensing event. in high magnification events, the lenscaustic may cross over the source disk, which allows a determination of theangular size of the source and additionally a measurement of its limbdarkening. when such extended-source effects appear close to maximummagnification, the resulting light curve differs from the characteristicpaczynski point-source curve. the exact shape of the light curve close to thepeak depends on the limb darkening of the source. dense photometric coveragepermits measurement of the respective limb-darkening coefficients. in the caseof microlensing event ogle 2008-blg-290, the k giant source star reached a peakmagnification of about 100. thirteen different telescopes have covered thisevent in eight different photometric bands. subsequent light-curve analysisyielded measurements of linear limb-darkening coefficients of the source in sixphotometric bands. the best-measured coefficients lead to an estimate of thesource effective temperature of about 4700 +100-200 k. however, the photometricestimate from colour-magnitude diagrams favours a cooler temperature of 4200+-100 k. as the limb-darkening measurements, at least in the ctio/smarts2 v andi bands, are among the most accurate obtained, the above disagreement needs tobe understood. a solution is proposed, which may apply to previous events wheresuch a discrepancy also appeared.

1009.1737	exquisite nova light curves from the solar mass ejection imager (smei)	we present light curves of three classical novae (kt eridani, v598 puppis,v1280 scorpii) and one recurrent nova (rs ophiuchi) derived from data obtainedby the solar mass ejection imager (smei) on board the coriolis satellite. smeiprovides near complete sky-map coverage with precision visible-light photometryat 102-minute cadence. the light curves derived from these sky maps offerunprecedented temporal resolution around, and especially before, maximum light,a phase of the nova eruption normally not covered by ground-based observations.they allow us to explore fundamental parameters of individual objects includingthe epoch of the initial explosion, the reality and duration of any pre-maximumhalt (found in all three fast novae in our sample), the presence of secondarymaxima, speed of decline of the initial light curve, plus precise timing of theonset of dust formation (in v1280 sco) leading to estimation of the bolometricluminosity, white dwarf mass and object distance. for kt eri, liverpooltelescope skycamt data confirm important features of the smei light curve andoverall our results add weight to the proposed similarities of this object torecurrent rather than to classical novae. in rs oph, comparison with hard x-raydata from the 2006 outburst implies that the onset of the outburst coincideswith extensive high velocity mass-loss. it is also noted that two of the fournovae we have detected (v598 pup and kt eri) were only discovered byground-based observers weeks or months after maximum light, yet these novaereached peak magnitudes of 3.46 and 5.42 respectively. this emphasizes the factthat many bright novae per year are still overlooked, particularly those of thevery fast speed class. coupled with its ability to observe novae in detail evenwhen relatively close to the sun in the sky, we estimate that as many as 5novae per year may be detectable by smei.

1009.4361	grb 090313 and the origin of optical peaks in grb light curves:  implications for lorentz factors and radio flares	we use a sample of 19 gamma ray bursts (grbs) that exhibit single-peakedoptical light curves to test the standard fireball model by investigating therelationship between the time of the onset of the afterglow and the temporalrising index. our sample includes grbs and x-ray flashes for which we derive awide range of initial lorentz factors ($40 &lt; \gamma &lt; 450$). using plausiblemodel parameters the typical frequency of the forward shock is expected to lieclose to the optical band; within this low typical frequency framework, we usethe optical data to constrain $\epsilon_e$ and show that values derived fromthe early time light curve properties are consistent with published typicalvalues derived from other afterglow studies. we produce expected radio lightcurves by predicting the temporal evolution of the expected radio emission fromforward and reverse shock components, including synchrotron self-absorptioneffects at early time. although a number of the grbs in this sample do not havepublished radio measurements, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodin the case of {\it swift} grb 090313, for which millimetric and centrimetricobservations were available, and conclude that future detections ofreverse-shock radio flares with new radio facilities such as the evla and almawill test the low frequency model and provide constraints on magnetic models.

1105.1591	a faint optical flash in dust-obscured grb 080603a - implications for  grb prompt emission mechanisms	we report the detection of a faint optical flash by the 2-m faulkes telescopenorth simultaneously with the second of two prompt gamma-ray pulses in integralgamma-ray burst (grb) 080603a, beginning at t_rest = 37 s after the onset ofthe grb. this optical flash appears to be distinct from the subsequent emergingafterglow emission, for which we present comprehensive broadband radio to x-raylight curves to 13 days post-burst and rigorously test the standard fireballmodel. the intrinsic extinction toward grb 080603a is high (a_v,z = 0.8 mag),and the well-sampled x-ray-to-near-infrared spectral energy distribution isinteresting in requiring an lmc2 extinction profile, in contrast to themajority of grbs. comparison of the gamma-ray and extinction-corrected opticalflux densities of the flash rules out an inverse-compton origin for the promptgamma-rays; instead, we suggest that the optical flash could originate from theinhomogeneity of the relativistic flow. in this scenario, a large velocityirregularity in the flow produces the prompt gamma-rays, followed by a milderinternal shock at a larger radius that would cause the optical flash. flatgamma-ray spectra, roughly f propto nu^-0.1, are observed in many grbs. if theflat spectrum extends down to the optical band in grb 080603a, the opticalflare could be explained as the low-energy tail of the gamma-ray emission. ifthis is indeed the case, it provides an important clue to understanding thenature of the emission process in the prompt phase of grbs and highlights theimportance of deep (r&gt; 20 mag), rapid follow-up observations capable ofdetecting faint, prompt optical emission.

1107.3352	constraining grb emission physics with extensive early-time, multiband  follow-up	understanding the origin and diversity of emission processes responsible forgamma-ray bursts (grbs) remains a pressing challenge. while prompt andcontemporaneous panchromatic observations have the potential to testpredictions of the internal-external shock model, extensive multiband imaginghas been conducted for only a few grbs. we present rich, early-time, multibanddatasets for two \swift\ events, grb 110205a and grb 110213a. the former showsoptical emission since the early stages of the prompt phase, followed by thesteep rising in flux up to ~1000s after the burst ($t^{-\alpha}$ with$\alpha=-6.13 \pm 0.75$). we discuss this feature in the context of thereverse-shock scenario and interpret the following single power-law decay asbeing forward-shock dominated. polarization measurements, obtained with theringo2 instrument mounted on the liverpool telescope, also provide hints on thenature of the emitting ejecta. the latter event, instead, displays a verypeculiar optical to near-infrared lightcurve, with two achromatic peaks. inthis case, while the first peak is probably due to the onset of the afterglow,we interpret the second peak to be produced by newly injected material,signifying a late-time activity of the central engine.

1204.2869	characterizing low-mass binaries from observation of long time-scale  caustic-crossing gravitational microlensing events	despite astrophysical importance of binary star systems, detections arelimited to those located in small ranges of separations, distances, and massesand thus it is necessary to use a variety of observational techniques for acomplete view of stellar multiplicity across a broad range of physicalparameters. in this paper, we report the detections and measurements of 2binaries discovered from observations of microlensing events moa-2011-blg-090and ogle-2011-blg-0417. determinations of the binary masses are possible bysimultaneously measuring the einstein radius and the lens parallax. themeasured masses of the binary components are 0.43 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.39$m_{\odot}$ for moa-2011-blg-090 and 0.57 $m_{\odot}$ and 0.17 $m_{\odot}$ forogle-2011-blg-0417 and thus both lens components of moa-2011-blg-090 and onecomponent of ogle-2011-blg-0417 are m dwarfs, demonstrating the usefulness ofmicrolensing in detecting binaries composed of low-mass components. frommodeling of the light curves considering full keplerian motion of the lens, wealso measure the orbital parameters of the binaries. the blended light ofogle-2011-blg-0417 comes very likely from the lens itself, making it possibleto check the microlensing orbital solution by follow-up radial-velocityobservation. for both events, the caustic-crossing parts of the light curves,which are critical for determining the physical lens parameters, were resolvedby high-cadence survey observations and thus it is expected that the number ofmicrolensing binaries with measured physical parameters will increase in thefuture.

1204.4789	a new type of ambiguity in the planet and binary interpretations of  central perturbations of high-magnification gravitational microlensing events	high-magnification microlensing events provide an important channel to detectplanets. perturbations near the peak of a high-magnification event can beproduced either by a planet or a binary companion. it is known that centralperturbations induced by both types of companions can be generallydistinguished due to the basically different magnification pattern aroundcaustics. in this paper, we present a case of central perturbations for whichit is difficult to distinguish the planetary and binary interpretations. thepeak of a lensing light curve affected by this perturbation appears to be bluntand flat. for a planetary case, this perturbation occurs when the sourcetrajectory passes the negative perturbation region behind the back end of anarrowhead-shaped central caustic. for a binary case, a similar perturbationoccurs for a source trajectory passing through the negative perturbation regionbetween two cusps of an astroid-shaped caustic. we demonstrate the degeneracyfor 2 high-magnification events of ogle-2011-blg-0526 andogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336. for ogle-2011-blg-0526, the $\chi^2$difference between the planetary and binary model is $\sim$ 3, implying thatthe degeneracy is very severe. for ogle-2011-blg-0950/moa-2011-blg-336, thestellar binary model is formally excluded with $\delta \chi^2 \sim$ 105 and theplanetary model is preferred. however, it is difficult to claim a planetdiscovery because systematic residuals of data from the planetary model arelarger than the difference between the planetary and binary models. consideringthat 2 events observed during a single season suffer from such a degeneracy, itis expected that central perturbations experiencing this type of degeneracy iscommon.

1205.6323	moa-2010-blg-477lb: constraining the mass of a microlensing planet from  microlensing parallax, orbital motion and detection of blended light	microlensing detections of cool planets are important for the construction ofan unbiased sample to estimate the frequency of planets beyond the snow line,which is where giant planets are thought to form according to the coreaccretion theory of planet formation. in this paper, we report the discovery ofa giant planet detected from the analysis of the light curve of ahigh-magnification microlensing event moa-2010-blg-477. the measuredplanet-star mass ratio is $q=(2.181\pm0.004)\times 10^{-3}$ and the projectedseparation is $s=1.1228\pm0.0006$ in units of the einstein radius. the angulareinstein radius is unusually large $\theta_{\rm e}=1.38\pm 0.11$ mas. combiningthis measurement with constraints on the "microlens parallax" and the lensflux, we can only limit the host mass to the range $0.13&lt;m/m_\odot&lt;1.0$. inthis particular case, the strong degeneracy between microlensing parallax andplanet orbital motion prevents us from measuring more accurate host and planetmasses. however, we find that adding bayesian priors from two effects (galacticmodel and keplerian orbit) each independently favors the upper end of this massrange, yielding star and planet masses of $m_*=0.67^{+0.33}_{-0.13}\ m_\odot$and $m_p=1.5^{+0.8}_{-0.3}\ m_{\rm jup}$ at a distance of $d=2.3\pm0.6$ kpc,and with a semi-major axis of $a=2^{+3}_{-1}$ au. finally, we show that thelens mass can be determined from future high-resolution near-ir adaptive opticsobservations independently from two effects, photometric and astrometric.

1211.3782	moa-2010-blg-073l: an m-dwarf with a substellar companion at the  planet/brown dwarf boundary	we present an analysis of the anomalous microlensing event, moa-2010-blg-073,announced by the microlensing observations in astrophysics survey on2010-03-18.  this event was remarkable because the source was previously known to bephotometrically variable. analyzing the pre-event source lightcurve, wedemonstrate that it is an irregular variable over time scales &gt;200d. itsdereddened color, $(v-i)_{s,0}$, is 1.221$\pm$0.051mag and from our lens modelwe derive a source radius of 14.7$\pm$1.3 $r_{\odot}$, suggesting that it is ared giant star.  we initially explored a number of purely microlensing models for the eventbut found a residual gradient in the data taken prior to and after the event.this is likely to be due to the variability of the source rather than part ofthe lensing event, so we incorporated a slope parameter in our model in orderto derive the true parameters of the lensing system.  we find that the lensing system has a mass ratio of q=0.0654$\pm$0.0006. theeinstein crossing time of the event, $t_{\rm{e}}=44.3$\pm$0.1d, wassufficiently long that the lightcurve exhibited parallax effects. in addition,the source trajectory relative to the large caustic structure allowed theorbital motion of the lens system to be detected. combining the parallax withthe einstein radius, we were able to derive the distance to the lens,$d_l$=2.8$\pm$0.4kpc, and the masses of the lensing objects. the primary of thelens is an m-dwarf with $m_{l,p}$=0.16$\pm0.03m_{\odot}$ while the companionhas $m_{l,s}$=11.0$\pm2.0m_{\rm{j}}$ putting it in the boundary zone betweenplanets and brown dwarfs.

1303.1184	a giant planet beyond the snow line in microlensing event  ogle-2011-blg-0251	we present the analysis of the gravitational microlensing eventogle-2011-blg-0251. this anomalous event was observed by several survey andfollow-up collaborations conducting microlensing observations towards thegalactic bulge. based on detailed modelling of the observed light curve, wefind that the lens is composed of two masses with a mass ratio q=1.9 x 10^-3.thanks to our detection of higher-order effects on the light curve due to theearth's orbital motion and the finite size of source, we are able to measurethe mass and distance to the lens unambiguously. we find that the lens is madeup of a planet of mass 0.53 +- 0.21,m_jup orbiting an m dwarf host star with amass of 0.26 +- 0.11 m_sun. the planetary system is located at a distance of2.57 +- 0.61 kpc towards the galactic centre. the projected separation of theplanet from its host star is d=1.408 +- 0.019, in units of the einstein radius,which corresponds to 2.72 +- 0.75 au in physical units. we also identified acompetitive model with similar planet and host star masses, but with a smallerorbital radius of 1.50 +- 0.50 au. the planet is therefore located beyond thesnow line of its host star, which we estimate to be around 1-1.5 au.

1305.6897	grb 090727 and gamma-ray bursts with early time optical emission	we present a multi-wavelength analysis of gamma-ray burst grb 090727, forwhich optical emission was detected during the prompt gamma-ray emission by the2-m autonomous robotic liverpool telescope and subsequently monitored for afurther two days with the liverpool and faulkes telescopes. within the contextof the standard fireball model, we rule out a reverse shock origin for theearly time optical emission in grb 090727 and instead conclude that the earlytime optical flash likely corresponds to emission from an internal dissipationprocesses. putting grb 090727 into a broader observational and theoreticalcontext, we build a sample of 36 gamma-ray bursts (grbs) with contemporaneousearly time optical and gamma-ray detections. from these grbs, we extract asub-sample of 18 grbs, which show optical peaks during prompt gamma-rayemission, and perform detailed temporal and spectral analysis in gamma-ray,x-ray, and optical bands. we find that in most cases early time opticalemission shows sharp and steep behaviour, and notice a rich diversity ofspectral properties. using a simple internal shock dissipation model, we showthat the emission during prompt grb phase can occur at very differentfrequencies via synchrotron radiation. based on the results obtained fromobservations and simulation, we conclude that the standard external shockinterpretation for early time optical emission is disfavoured in most cases dueto sharp peaks ($\delta t/t &lt; 1$) and steep rise/decay indices, and thatinternal dissipation can explain the properties of grbs with optical peaksduring gamma-ray emission.

(2012) to test the standard synchrotron shock model. theevolution of the radio and optical afterglow, with its prominent opticalrebrightening at t_rest 260-2600 s, is remarkably well modelled by adecelerating jet viewed close to the jet edge, combined with some earlyre-energization of the shock. we thus constrain the geometry of the jet withhalf-opening and viewing angles of 23 and 21 deg respectively and suggest thatwide jets viewed off-axis are more common in grbs than previously thought. wealso derive the fireball microphysics parameters epsilon_b=2.4e-4 andepsilon_e=9.3e-2 and a circumburst density of n=240 cm^-3. the ability toself-consistently model the microphysics parameters and jet geometry in thisway offers an alternative to trying to identify elusive canonical jet breaks atlate times. the mismatch between the observed and model-predicted x-ray fluxesis explained by the local rather than the global cooling approximation in thesynchrotron radiation model, constraining the microphysics of particleacceleration taking place in a relativistic shock and, in turn, emphasising theneed for a more realistic treatment of cooling in future developments oftheoretical models. finally, our interpretation of the optical peak as due tothe passage of the forward shock synchrotron frequency highlights theimportance of high quality multi-band data to prevent some optical peaks frombeing erroneously attributed to the onset of fireball deceleration.

1403.3092	candidate gravitational microlensing events for future direct lens  imaging	the mass of the lenses giving rise to galactic microlensing events can beconstrained by measuring the relative lens-source proper motion and lens flux.the flux of the lens can be separated from that of the source, companions tothe source, and unrelated nearby stars with high-resolution images taken whenthe lens and source are spatially resolved. for typical ground-based adaptiveoptics (ao) or space-based observations, this requires either inordinately longtime baselines or high relative proper motions. we provide a list ofmicrolensing events toward the galactic bulge with high relative lens-sourceproper motion that are therefore good candidates for constraining the lens masswith future high-resolution imaging. we investigate all events from 2004 --2013 that display detectable finite-source effects, a feature that allows us tomeasure the proper motion. in total, we present 20 events with mu &gt;~ 8 mas/yr.of these, 14 were culled from previous analyses while 6 are new, includingogle-2004-blg-368, moa-2005-blg-36, ogle-2012-blg-0211, ogle-2012-blg-0456,moa-2012-blg-532, and moa-2013-blg-029. in &lt;~12 years the lens and source ofeach event will be sufficiently separated for ground-based telescopes with aosystems or space telescopes to resolve each component and further characterizethe lens system. furthermore, for the most recent events, comparison of thelens flux estimates from images taken immediately to those estimated fromimages taken when the lens and source are resolved can be used to empiricallycheck the robustness of the single-epoch method currently being used toestimate lens masses for many events.

0808.0004	inferring statistics of planet populations by means of automated  microlensing searches	(abridged) the study of other worlds is key to understanding our own, and notonly provides clues to the origin of our civilization, but also looks into itsfuture. rather than in identifying nearby systems and learning about theirindividual properties, the main value of the technique of gravitationalmicrolensing is in obtaining the statistics of planetary populations within themilky way and beyond. only the complementarity of different techniquescurrently employed promises to yield a complete picture of planet formationthat has sufficient predictive power to let us understand how habitable worldslike ours evolve, and how abundant such systems are in the universe. acooperative three-step strategy of survey, follow-up, and anomaly monitoring ofmicrolensing targets, realized by means of an automated expert system and anetwork of ground-based telescopes is ready right now to be used to obtain afirst census of cool planets with masses reaching even below that of earthorbiting k and m dwarfs in two distinct stellar populations, namely thegalactic bulge and disk. the hunt for extra-solar planets acts as a principalscience driver for time-domain astronomy with robotic-telescope networksadopting fully-automated strategies. several initiatives, both into facilitiesas well as into advanced software and strategies, are supposed to see thecapabilities of gravitational microlensing programmes step-wise increasing overthe next 10 years. new opportunities will show up with high-precisionastrometry becoming available and studying the abundance of planets aroundstars in neighbouring galaxies becoming possible. finally, we should not missout on sharing the vision with the general public, and make its realization toprofit not only the scientists but all the wider society.

astro-ph;0412165	the prospects for finding brown dwarfs in eclipsing binary systems and  measuring brown dwarf properties	we present the results of a simulation to investigate the prospects ofmeasuring mass, age, radius, metallicity and luminosity data for brown dwarfsin fully eclipsing binary systems around late k and early m dwarfs identifiedby ultra-wide-field transit surveys. these surveys will monitor approximately amillion k and m dwarfs at a level sufficient to detect transits of lowluminosity companions. we look at the current observational evidence for suchsystems, and suggest that about 1% of late k and early-mid m dwarfs could havea very close bd companion. with this assumption, and using the superwasptransit survey as an example, our simulation predicts that 400 brown dwarfs infully eclipsing binary systems could be discovered. all of these eclipsingbinaries could yield accurate brown dwarf mass and radius measurements. byinferring the brown dwarf effective temperature distribution, assuming auniform age spread and an alpha=0.5 companion brown dwarf mass function, thesimulation estimates that brown dwarf brightness could also be measurable (atthe 10% level) for about 60 of these binary systems from the secondary eclipse.irradiation of the brown dwarfs will be below the 10% level for about 70% ofthese systems, meaning that the measured brown dwarf brightnesses shouldgenerally be the same as those of free-floating counterparts. the predicted agedistribution of the primaries is dominated by young systems, and about 20binaries could be younger than 1gyr. we suggest that many of these young binarysystems will be members of ``kinematic moving groups'', allowing their ages tobe accurately constrained.

astro-ph;0412412	rapid grb follow-up with the 2-m robotic liverpool telescope	we present the capabilities of the 2-m robotic liverpool telescope (lt),owned and operated by liverpool john moores university and situated at orm, lapalma. robotic control and scheduling of the lt make it especially powerful forobservations in time domain astrophysics including: (i) rapid response totargets of opportunity: gamma ray bursts, novae, supernovae, comets; (ii)monitoring of variable objects on timescales from seconds to years, and (iii)observations simultaneous or coordinated with other facilities, bothground-based and from space. following a grb alert from the gamma rayobservatories hete-2, integral and swift we implement a special over-ride modewhich enables observations to commence in about a minute after the alert,including optical and near infrared imaging and spectroscopy. in particular,the combination of aperture, site, instrumentation and rapid response (aided byits rapid slew and fully-opening enclosure) makes the lt excellently suited tohelp solving the mystery of the origin of optically dark grbs, for theinvestigation of short bursts (which currently do not have any confirmedoptical counterparts) and for early optical spectroscopy of the grb phenomenonin general. we briefly describe the lt's key position in the robonet-1.0network of robotic telescopes.

astro-ph;0506493	crossing into the substellar regime in praesepe	we present the results of a deep optical 2.6 square degree survey with nearinfrared follow-up measurements of the intermediate-aged praesepe open cluster.the survey is complete to i=21.3, z=20.5, corresponding to ~0.06 solar massesassuming a cluster age of 0.5 gyrs. using 3-5 pass-bands to constrain clustermembership, we identify 32 new low mass cluster members, at least 4 of whichare likely to be substellar. we use the low mass census to trace the regionwhere the sequence moves away from the nextgen towards the dusty regime at teff= 2200k. in doing so, we identify four unresolved binaries, yielding asubstellar binary fraction of ~30 percent. the binary fractions appear todecrease below 0.1 solar masses, in contrast to the rising fractions found inthe pleiades. we also identify a paucity of late m dwarfs, thought to be due toa steepening in the mass-luminosity relation at these spectral types, andcompare the properties of this gap in the sequence to those observed in youngerclusters. we note an overdensity of faint sources in the region of theso-called subcluster (possibly an older smaller cluster within praesepe), andsubsequently derive the luminosity and mass functions for the main praesepecluster, revealing a turn-over near the substellar boundary. we conclude bypresenting astrometric measurements for low mass praesepe candidates from theliterature, and rule out as a likely foreground dwarf rpr1, hitherto thought tobe a substellar member.

astro-ph;0511032	the automatic real-time grb pipeline of the 2-m liverpool telescope	the 2-m liverpool telescope (lt), owned by liverpool john moores university,is located in la palma (canary islands) and operates in fully robotic mode. in2005, the lt began conducting an automatic grb follow-up program. on receivingan automatic grb alert from a gamma-ray observatory (swift, integral, hete-ii,ipn) the lt initiates a special override mode that conducts follow-upobservations within 2-3 min of the grb onset. this follow-up procedure beginswith an initial sequence of short (10-s) exposures acquired through an r' bandfilter. these images are reduced, analyzed and interpreted automatically usingpipeline software developed by our team called "lt-trap" (liverpool telescopetransient rapid analysis pipeline); the automatic detection and successfulidentification of an unknown and potentially fading optical transient triggersa subsequent multi-color imaging sequence. in the case of a candidate brighterthan r'=15, either a polarimetric (from 2006) or a spectroscopic observation(from 2007) will be triggered on the lt. if no candidate is identified, thetelescope continues to obtain z', r' and i' band imaging with increasinglylonger exposure times. here we present a detailed description of the lt-trapand briefly discuss the illustrative case of the afterglow of grb 050502a,whose automatic identification by the lt just 3 min after the grb, led to theacquisition of the first early-time (&lt; 1 hr) multi-color light curve of a grbafterglow.

astro-ph;0603181	high quality early time light curves of grb 060206: implications for  gamma ray burst environments and energetics	the 2-m robotic liverpool telescope (lt) reacted promptly to thehigh-redshift (z=4.048) gamma-ray burst grb 060206. the afterglow wasidentified automatically and multicolor r'i'z' imaging was triggered withouthuman intervention. combining our data with those obtained from laterfollow-ups provides a well-sampled optical light-curve from 5 minutes to &gt;2dafter the gamma event. the light-curve is highly structured with at least threebumps evident in the first 75 minutes, including a major rebrightening(delta_r'=-1.6 at t=3000s), interpreted as late energy injection. at early time(t=440s), we find evidence for fast (delta t_(rest)&lt;4s&lt;&lt;t) variability,indicating on-going internal-engine activity. we emphasise that a low redshiftgrb (z&lt;1) with similar intrinsic properties would have been interpretedcompletely differently due to undersampling of the light curve in the restframe at early times; the light-curve behaviour of grb 060206 should thereforenot be considered peculiar. finally, although the observed late-time steepeningof the optical light curve resembles a jet break if taken in isolation, thelack of a corresponding change in the x-ray slope rules out a jet-breakinterpretation. traditionally, grb jet breaks have been inferred from opticaldata in the absence of simultaneous x-ray data. we suggest therefore thatcurrent estimates of the jet opening angle distribution might be biased byevents like grb060206. consequently, the grb explosion energy distribution andevent rates may have to be revised.

astro-ph;0603320	finding benchmark brown dwarfs to probe the imf as a function of time	using a simulated disk brown dwarf (bd) population, we find that new largearea infrared surveys are expected to identify enough bds covering wide enoughmass--age ranges to potentially measure the mass function down to ~0.03mo, andthe bd formation history out to 10 gyr, at a level capable of establishing ifbd formation follows star formation. we suggest these capabilities are bestrealised by spectroscopic calibration of bd properties (teff, g and [m/h])which, when combined with a measured luminosity and an evolutionary model cangive bd mass and age relatively independent of bd atmosphere models. suchcalibration requires an empirical understanding of how bd spectra are affectedby variations in these properties, and thus the identification and study of"benchmark bds" whose age and composition can be established independently. weidentify the best sources of benchmark bds as young open cluster members,moving group members, and wide (&gt;1000au) bd companions to both subgiant starsand high mass white dwarfs (wds). we have used 2mass to measure a wide l dwarfcompanion fraction of 2.7(+0.7/-0.5)%, which equates to a bd companion fractionof 34(+9/-6)% for an alpha~1 companion mass function. using this value wesimulate populations of wide bd binaries, and estimate that 80(+21/-14)subgiant--bd binaries, and 50(+13/-10) benchmark wd--bd binaries could beidentified using current and new facilities. the wd--bd binaries should all beidentifiable using the large area survey component of ukidss combined withsloan. discovery of the subgiant--bd binaries will require a nir imagingcampaign around a large (~900) sample of hipparcos subgiants. if identified,spectral studies of these benchmark brown dwarfs could reveal the spectralsensitivities across the teff, g and [m/h] space probed by new surveys.

astro-ph;0607601	anatomy of a dark burst - the afterglow of grb 060108	we report the first detection of an optical afterglow of a grb (060108) thatwould have been classified as 'dark' in the absence of deep, rapid ground-basedoptical imaging with the 2-m robotic faulkes telesscope (ftn). ourmultiwavelength analysis reveals an x-ray light curve typical of many swiftlong grbs (3-segments plus flare). its optical afterglow, however, was alreadyfainter than the detection limit of the uvot within 100s of the burst. opticalimaging in bvri' filters with the ftn began 2.75 minutes after the burst andresulted in the detection of the optical afterglow at 5.3 minutes, with a ukirtk-band identification at ~45 mins. r and i'-band light curves are consistentwith a single power law decay in flux, f(t) prop t^-a where a=0.43+/-0.08, or a2-segment light curve with a steep decay a_1 &lt;0.88, flattening to a_2 ~ 0.31,with evidence for rebrightening at i' band. deep vlt r-band imaging at ~12 daysreveals a faint, extended object (r ~23.5 mag) at the location of theafterglow. although the brightness is compatible with the extrapolation of thea_2 slow decay, significant flux is likely due to a host galaxy. this impliesthat the optical light curve had a break before 12 days, akin to what observedin the x-rays. we derive a maximum photometric redshift z&lt;3.2 for grb 060108and a best-fitting optical-to-x-ray sed at 1000 s after the burst consistentwith a power law with index beta_ox = 0.54 and a small amount of extinction.the unambiguous detection at b-band and the derived photometric redshift ruleout a high redshift as the reason for the optical faintness of grb 060108.instead, the hard opt/x-ray spectral index confirms it as one of theoptically-darkest bursts detected and with modest host extinction explains theuvot non-detection (abridged).

astro-ph;0610660	the remarkable afterglow of grb 061007: implications for optical flashes  and grb fireballs	we present a multiwavelength analysis of swift grb 061007. the 2-m roboticfaulkes telescope south (fts) began observing 137 s after the onset of thegamma-ray emission, when the optical counterpart was already decaying from r10.3 mag, and continued observing for the next 5.5 hours. these observationsbegin during the final gamma-ray flare and continue through and beyond a long,soft tail of gamma-ray emission whose flux shows an underlying simple power-lawdecay identical to that seen at optical and x-ray wavelengths, with temporalslope alpha 1.7 this remarkably simple decay in all of these bands is rare forswift bursts, which often show much more complex light curves. we suggest theafterglow emission begins as early as 30-100 s and is contemporaneous with theon-going variable prompt emission from the central engine, but originates froma physically distinct region dominated by the forward shock. the afterglowcontinues unabated until at least 10^5 s showing no evidence of a break. theobserved multiwavelength evolution of grb 061007 is explained by an expandingfireball whose optical, x-ray and late-time gamma-ray emission is dominated byemission from a forward shock with typical synchrotron frequency, nu_m, that isalready below the optical band as early as t=137 s and a cooling frequency,nu_c, above the x-ray band to at least t=10^5 s. in contrast, the typicalfrequency of the reverse shock lies in the radio band at early time. we suggestthat the unexpected lack of bright optical flashes from the majority of swiftgrbs may be explained with a low nu_m originating from small microphysicsparameters, epsilon_e and epsilon_b.
