0902.3142	type ii supernovae as probes of cosmology	- constraining the cosmological parameters and understanding dark energy havetremendous implications for the nature of the universe and its physical laws.  - the pervasive limit of systematic uncertainties reached by cosmographybased on cepheids and type ia supernovae (sne ia) warrants a search forcomplementary approaches.  - type ii sne have been shown to offer such a path. their distances can bewell constrained by luminosity-based or geometric methods. competing,complementary, and concerted efforts are underway, to explore and exploit thoseobjects that are extremely well matched to next generation facilities.spectroscopic follow-up will be enabled by space- based and 20-40 meter classtelescopes.  - some systematic uncertainties of type ii sne, such as reddening by dust andmetallicity effects, are bound to be different from those of sne ia. theirstellar progenitors are known, promising better leverage on cosmic evolution.in addition, their rate - which closely tracks the ongoing star formation rate- is expected to rise significantly with look- back time, ensuring an adequatesupply of distant examples.  - these data will competitively constrain the dark energy equation of state,allow the determination of the hubble constant to 5%, and promote ourunderstanding of the processes involved in the last dramatic phases of massivestellar evolution.

1003.4207	on the orbital period change in the recurrent nova u scorpii	the orbital period of the recurrent nova u sco has been observed to decreaseduring the 1999 outburst. in an outburst mass is ejected from the surface ofthe white dwarf. the separation of the binary system widens and the orbitalperiod increases. we find that magnetic braking between outbursts, masstransfer to the companion, and frictional angular momentum losses duringoutbursts are all too small to account for this unexpected change. we find,however, that if the secondary has a sufficiently strong magnetic field,b=8x10^3 g, then the ejected material can couple to it and corrotate with thesystem. the ejected material gains angular momentum while the binary systemloses it and the period decreases. if such a strong magnetic field is indeedpresent, then we predict that a period decrease should be observed also duringthe current 2010 outburst. if, however, the presence of such a field can beruled out observationally, then the cause for the period decrease (ifconfirmed) remains unknown.

1011.0457	the wfc3 galactic bulge treasury program: metallicity estimates for the  stellar population and exoplanet hosts	we present new uv-to-ir stellar photometry of four low-extinction windows inthe galactic bulge, obtained with the wide field camera 3 on the hubble spacetelescope (hst). using our five bandpasses, we have defined reddening-freephotometric indices sensitive to stellar effective temperature and metallicity.we find that the bulge populations resemble those formed via classicaldissipative collapse: each field is dominated by an old (~10 gyr) populationexhibiting a wide metallicity range (-1.5 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; 0.5). we detect ametallicity gradient in the bulge population, with the fraction of stars atsuper-solar metallicities dropping from 41% to 35% over distances from thegalactic center ranging from 0.3 to 1.2 kpc. one field includes candidateexoplanet hosts discovered in the sweeps hst transit survey. our measurementsfor 11 of these hosts demonstrate that exoplanets in the distinct bulgeenvironment are preferentially found around high-metallicity stars, as in thesolar neighborhood, supporting the view that planets form more readily inmetal-rich environments.

1105.4176	the first detection of blue straggler stars in the milky way bulge	we report the first detections of blue straggler stars (bss) in the bulge ofthe milky way galaxy. proper motions from extensive space-based observationsalong a single sight-line allow us to separate a sufficiently clean andwell-characterized bulge sample that we are able to detect a small populationof bulge objects in the region of the color-magnitude diagram commonly occupiedyoung objects and blue strgglers. however, variability measurements of theseobjects clearly establish that a fraction of them are blue stragglers. out ofthe 42 objects found in this region of the color-magnitude diagram, we estimatethat at least 18 are genuine bss. we normalize the bss population by ourestimate of the number of horizontal branch stars in the bulge in order tocompare the bulge to other stellar systems. the bss fraction is clearlydiscrepant from that found in stellar clusters. the blue straggler populationof dwarf spheroidals remains a subject of debate; some authors claim ananticorrelation between the normalised blue straggler fraction and integratedlight. if this trend is real, then the bulge may extend it by three orders ofmagnitude in mass. conversely, we find that the genuinely young (~5gy oryounger) population in the bulge, must be at most 3.4% under the mostconservative scenario for the bss population.

1110.5809	evidence for type ia supernova diversity from ultraviolet observations  with the hubble space telescope	we present ultraviolet (uv) spectroscopy and photometry of four type iasupernovae (sne 2004dt, 2004ef, 2005m, and 2005cf) obtained with the uv prismof the advanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope. this datasetprovides unique spectral time series down to 2000 angstrom. significantdiversity is seen in the near maximum-light spectra (~ 2000--3500 angstrom) forthis small sample. the corresponding photometric data, together with archivaldata from swift ultraviolet/optical telescope observations, provide furtherevidence of increased dispersion in the uv emission with respect to theoptical. the peak luminosities measured in uvw1/f250w are found to correlatewith the b-band light-curve shape parameter dm15(b), but with much largerscatter relative to the correlation in the broad-band b band (e.g., ~0.4 magversus ~0.2 mag for those with 0.8 &lt; dm15 &lt; 1.7 mag). sn 2004dt is found as anoutlier of this correlation (at &gt; 3 sigma), being brighter than normal sne iasuch as sn 2005cf by ~0.9 mag and ~2.0 mag in the uvw1/f250w and uvm2/f220wfilters, respectively. we show that different progenitor metallicity orline-expansion velocities alone cannot explain such a large discrepancy.viewing-angle effects, such as due to an asymmetric explosion, may have asignificant influence on the flux emitted in the uv region. detailed modelingis needed to disentangle and quantify the above effects.

1112.3364	dead zones around young stellar objects: dependence on physical  parameters	angular momentum is transported outwards through an accretion disc bymagnetohydrodynamical (mhd) turbulence thus allowing material to accrete on tothe central object. the magneto-rotational instability (mri) requires a minimumionisation fraction to drive turbulence in a disc. the inner parts of the discaround a young stellar object are sufficiently hot to be thermally ionised.further out, cosmic rays ionise the surface layers and a dead zone forms at themid-plane where the disc is too cool for the mri to operate. the surfacedensity in the turbulent active layer is often assumed to be constant withradius because the cosmic rays penetrate a constant layer. however, if acritical magnetic reynolds number, re_{m,crit}, is used to determine the extentof the dead zone, the surface density in the layer generally increases withradius. for small critical magnetic reynolds number of order 1, the constantlayer approximation may be a reasonable fit. however, mhd simulations suggestthe critical magnetic reynolds number may be much larger, of order 10^4.analytical fits for the surface density in the magnetic active layer show that\sigma_m \propto re_{m,crit}^{-2} r^{9/2} t^{\,2}$, at temperature t and radiusr, are a good fit for higher critical magnetic reynolds number. for themetallicity variation between our galaxy, the lmc and the smc, there should beno significant difference in the extent of the dead zone. observations suggestan increase in the lifetime of the disc with decreasing metallicity that cannotbe explained by the dead zone structure (ignoring possible differences in dustabundances).

1204.2959	dead zones around young stellar objects: fu orionis outbursts and  transition discs	we perform global time-dependent simulations of an accretion disc around ayoung stellar object with a dead zone (a region where the magneto-rotationalinstability cannot drive turbulence because the material is not sufficientlyionised). for infall accretion rates on to the disc of around 10^-7 msun/yr,dead zones occur if the critical magnetic reynolds number is larger than about10^4. we model the collapse of a molecular gas cloud. at early times when theinfall accretion rate is high, the disc is thermally ionised and fullyturbulent. however, as the infall accretion rate drops, a dead zone may form ifthe critical magnetic reynolds number is sufficiently large, otherwise the discremains fully turbulent. with a dead zone the disc can become unstable to thegravo-magneto instability. the mass of the star grows in large accretionoutbursts that may explain fu orionis events. at late times there is notsufficient mass in the disc for outbursts to occur but the dead zone becomeseven more prominent as the disc cools. large inner dead zones in the laterstages of disc evolution may help to explain observations of transition discswith an inner hole.

1207.4284	on the evolution of the snow line in protoplanetary discs	we model the evolution of the snow line in a protoplanetary disc. if themagneto-rotational instability (mri) drives turbulence throughout the disc,there is a unique snow line outside of which the disc is icy. the snow linemoves closer to the star as the infall accretion rate drops. because the snowline moves inside the radius of the earth's orbit, the formation of ourwater-devoid planet is difficult with this model. however, protoplanetary discsare not likely to be sufficiently ionised to be fully turbulent. a dead zone atthe mid-plane slows the flow of material through the disc and a steady statecannot be achieved. we therefore model the evolution of the snow line also in atime-dependent disc with a dead zone. as the mass is accumulating, the outerparts of the dead zone become self gravitating, heat the massive disc and thusthe outer snow line does not come inside the radius of the earth's orbit,contrary to the fully turbulent disc model. there is a second, inner icyregion, within the dead zone, that moves inwards of the earth's orbit after atime of about 10^6 yr. with this model there is sufficient time and mass in thedisc for the earth to form from water-devoid planetesimals at a radius of 1 au.furthermore, the additional inner icy region predicted by this model may allowfor the formation of giant planets close to their host star without the needfor much migration.

0711.4059	planets in the galactic bulge: results from the sweeps project	the exoplanets discovered so far have been mostly around relatively nearbyand bright stars. as a result, the host stars are mostly (i) in the galacticdisk, (ii) relatively massive, and (iii) relatively metal rich. the aim of thesweeps project is to extend our knowledge to stars which (i) are in a differentpart of the galaxy, (ii) have lower masses, and (iii) have a large range ofmetallicities. to achieve this goal, we used the hubble space telescope tosearch for transiting planets around f, g, k, and m dwarfs in the galacticbulge. we photometrically monitored 180,000 stars in a dense bulge fieldcontinuously for 7 days. we discovered 16 candidate transiting extrasolarplanets with periods of 0.6 to 4.2 days, including a new class of ultra-shortperiod planets (uspps) with p &lt; 1.2 days. radial-velocity observations of thetwo brightest candidates support their planetary nature. these results suggestthat planets are as abundant in the galactic bulge as they are in the solarneighborhood, and they are equally abundant around low-mass stars (within afactor 2). the planet frequency increases with metallicity even for the starsin the galactic bulge. all the uspp hosts are low-mass stars, suggesting eitherthat close-in planets around higher-mass stars are irradiatively evaporated, orthat the planets can migrate to close-in orbits only around such old andlow-mass stars.

1211.0023	on the formation and evolution of asteroid belts and their potential  significance for life	suggestions have been made that asteroid belts may be important both for theexistence of life and perhaps even for the evolution of complex life on aplanet. using numerical models for protoplanetary discs we calculate thelocation of the snow line, and we propose that asteroid belts are most likelyto form in its vicinity. we then show that observations of warm dust inexo-solar systems, thought to be produced by collisions between asteroids in abelt, indicate that asteroid belts (when they exist), indeed coincide with theradial location and the temperature of the snow line. giant planets formoutside the snow line and prevent planet formation just inside of their orbitcreating an asteroid belt there. however, the migration of giant planetsthrough the asteroid belt likely disperses the compact formation. we examineexisting observations of giant exo-planets and find that less than 4% are atradial locations outside of the snow line. this definitely may be theconsequence of observational selection effects. however, with this caveat inmind, we point out that the dearth of giant planets outside the snow line mayalso suggest that compact asteroid belts are not common, and more speculativelythat complex life may not expected in most of the currently observed systems.

1306.5243	on the evolution of the snow line in protoplanetary discs ii: analytic  approximations	we examine the evolution of the snow line in a protoplanetary disc thatcontains a dead zone (a region of zero or low turbulence). the snow line iswithin a self-gravitating part of the dead zone, and we obtain a fully analyticsolution for its radius. our formula could prove useful for futureobservational attempts to characterise the demographics of planets outside thesnow line. external sources such as comic rays or x-rays from the central starcan ionise the disc surface layers and allow the magneto-rotational instabilityto drive turbulence there. we show that provided that the surface density inthis layer is less than about 50 g/cm^2, the dead zone solution exists, afteran initial outbursting phase, until the disc is dispersed by photoevaporation.we demonstrate that the snow line radius is significantly larger than thatpredicted by a fully turbulent disc model, and that in our own solar system itremains outside of the orbital radius of the earth. thus, the inclusion of adead zone into a protoplanetary disc model explains how our earth formed withvery little water.

1407.7879	hot jupiters and cool stars	close-in planets are in jeopardy as their host stars evolve off the mainsequence to the subgiant and red giant phases. in this paper, we explore theinfluences of the stellar mass (in the range 1.5--2\mso ), mass-lossprescription, planet mass (from neptune up to 10 jupiter masses), andeccentricity, on the orbital evolution of planets as their parent stars evolveto become subgiants and red giants. we find that planet engulfment during thered giant branch is not very sensitive to the stellar mass or mass-loss ratesadopted in the calculations, but quite sensitive to the planetary mass. therange of initial separations for planet engulfment increases with decreasingmass-loss rates or stellar mass and increasing planetary masses. regarding theplanet's orbital eccentricity, we find that as the star evolves into the redgiant phase, stellar tides start to dominate over planetary tides. as aconsequence, a transient population of moderately eccentric close-in jovianplanets is created, that otherwise would have been expected to be absent frommain sequence stars. we find that very eccentric and distant planets do notexperience much eccentricity decay, and that planet engulfment is primarilydetermined by the pericenter distance and the maximum stellar radius.

1507.00873	hydrodynamic properties of gamma-ray bursts outflows deduced from  thermal component	we study the properties of a significant thermal emission component that wasidentified in 47 grbs observed by different instruments. within the frameworkof the "fireball" model, we deduce the values of the lorentz factor gamma, andthe acceleration radius, r_0, for these bursts. we find that all the values ofgamma in our sample are in the range 10^2 &lt;= gamma &lt;= 10^3, with &lt;gamma&gt; = 370.we find a very weak dependence of gamma on the acceleration radius r_0, gamma ~r_0^alpha with alpha = -0.10 +- 0.09 at sigma = 2.1 confidence level. thevalues of r_0 span a wide range, 10^6.5 &lt;= r_0 &lt;= 10^{9.5} cm, with mean value&lt;r_0&gt;~10^{8} cm. this is higher than the gravitational radius of a 10 m_sunblack hole by a factor ~30. we argue that this result provides indirectevidence for jet propagation inside a massive star, and suggests the existenceof recollimation shocks that take place close to this radius.

1508.00931	the solar system as an exoplanetary system	with the availability of considerably more data, we revisit the question ofhow special our solar system is, compared to observed exoplanetary systems. tothis goal, we employ a mathematical transformation that allows for ameaningful, statistical comparison. we find that the masses and densities ofthe giant planets in our solar system are very typical, as is the age of thesolar system. while the orbital location of jupiter is somewhat of an outlier,this is most likely due to strong selection effects towards short-periodplanets. the eccentricities of the planets in our solar system are relativelysmall compared to those in observed exosolar systems, but still consistent withthe expectations for an 8-planet system (and could, in addition, reflect aselection bias towards high-eccentricity planets). the two characteristics ofthe solar system that we find to be most special are the lack of super-earthswith orbital periods of days to months and the general lack of planets insideof the orbital radius of mercury. overall, we conclude that in terms of itsbroad characteristics our solar system is not expected to be extremely rare,allowing for a level of optimism in the search for extrasolar life.

astro-ph;0007190	hubble space telescope observations of the planetary nebula k648 in the  globular cluster m15	we have obtained observations of the planetary nebula k648 in the galacticglobular cluster m15 with the hubble space telescope's wfpc2 camera, coveringan interval of 7 days. the frames provide both time-sampled broad-bandphotometry of the central star and high-resolution images of the nebula in thelight of h-alpha, [oiii], and [nii]. in the deep narrow-band images, k648 is afairly typical double-shelled elliptical, but with a bright arc at one end ofthe major axis that is especially prominent in [nii]; this feature is probablya collection of fliers. the nebula is surrounded by a faint, smooth ellipticalhalo, which appears undisturbed by any interaction with the interstellarmedium. adopting teff = 40,000 +- 3,000 k based upon published spectral-lineanalyses, and employing our new broad-band optical flux data along with theknown cluster distance, we find log l/l_sun = 3.78 +- 0.08 for the k648 centralstar. theoretical post-asymptotic-giant-branch evolutionary tracks imply a massof 0.60 +- 0.02 m_sun for this luminosity, which is significantly higher thanthe mean mass of white dwarfs in globular clusters and the halo field (0.50 +-0.02). the k648 central star exhibits no significant photometric variability inour data; thus we find no direct evidence of a close binary companion. wesuggest that the progenitor of k648 experienced mass augmentation in aclose-binary merger, allowing it to evolve to a remnant of higher mass thanthose of the single stars in the cluster.

astro-ph;0007474	launching of jets and the vertical structure of accretion disks	the launching of magnetohydrodynamic outflows from accretion disks isconsidered. we formulate a model for the local vertical structure of a thindisk threaded by a poloidal magnetic field of dipolar symmetry. the modelconsists of an optically thick disk matched to an isothermal atmosphere. thedisk is supposed to be turbulent and possesses an effective viscosity and aneffective magnetic diffusivity. in the atmosphere, if the magnetic field linesare inclined sufficiently to the vertical, a magnetocentrifugal outflow isdriven and passes through a slow magnetosonic point close to the surface. wedetermine how the rate of mass loss varies with the strength and inclination ofthe magnetic field. in particular, we find that for disks in which the meanpoloidal field is sufficiently strong to stabilize the disk against themagnetorotational instability, the mass loss rate decreases extremely rapidlywith increasing field strength, and is maximal at an inclination angle of 40-50degrees. for turbulent disks with weaker mean fields, the mass loss rateincreases monotonically with increasing strength and inclination of the field,but the solution branch terminates before achieving excessive mass loss rates.our results suggest that efficient jet launching occurs for a limited range offield strengths, and a limited range of inclination angles in excess of 30degrees. in addition, we determine the direction and rate of radial migrationof the poloidal magnetic flux, and discuss whether configurations suitable forjet launching can be maintained against dissipation.

astro-ph;0101253	episodic accretion in magnetically layered protoplanetary discs	we study protoplanetary disc evolution assuming that angular momentumtransport is driven by gravitational instability at large radii, andmagnetohydrodynamic (mhd) turbulence in the hot inner regions. at radii of theorder of 1 au such discs develop a magnetically layered structure, withaccretion occurring in an ionized surface layer overlying quiescent gas that istoo cool to sustain mhd turbulence. we show that layered discs are subject to alimit cycle instability, in which accretion onto the protostar occurs in burstswith an accretion rate of 10^{-5} solar masses / yr, separated by quiescentintervals where the accretion rate is 10^{-8} solar masses / yr. such burstscould lead to repeated episodes of strong mass outflow in young stellarobjects. the transition to this episodic mode of accretion occurs at an earlyepoch (t &lt; 1 myr), and the model therefore predicts that many youngpre-main-sequence stars should have low rates of accretion through the innerdisc. at ages of a few myr, the discs are up to an order of magnitude moremassive than the minimum mass solar nebula, with most of the mass locked up inthe quiescent layer of the disc at around 1 au. the predicted rate of low massplanetary migration is reduced at the outer edge of the layered disc, whichcould lead to an enhanced probability of giant planet formation at radii of 1-3au.

astro-ph;0104455	the farthest known supernova: support for an accelerating universe and a  glimpse of the epoch of deceleration	we present photometric observations of an apparent type ia supernova (sn ia)at a redshift of ~1.7, the farthest sn observed to date. sn 1997ff, wasdiscovered in a repeat observation by the hst of the hdf-), and serendipitouslymonitored with nicmos on hst throughout the gto campaign. the sn type can bedetermined from the host galaxy type:an evolved, red elliptical lacking enoughrecent star formation to provide a significant population of core-collapse sne.the class- ification is further supported by diagnostics available from theobserved colors and temporal behavior of the sn, both of which match a typicalsn ia. the photo- metric record of the sn includes a dozen flux measurements inthe i, j, and h bands spanning 35 days in the observed frame. the redshiftderived from the sn photometry, z=1.7+/-0.1, is in excellent agreement with theredshift estimate of z=1.65+/-0.15 derived from theu_300,b_450,v_606,i_814,j_110,j_125,h_160, h_165,k_s photometry of the galaxy.optical and near-infrared spectra of the host provide a very tentativespectroscopic redshift of 1.755. fits to observations of the sn provideconstraints for the redshift-distance relation of sne~ia and a powerful test ofthe current accelerating universe hypothesis. the apparent sn brightness isconsistent with that expected in the decelerating phase of the preferredcosmological model, omega_m~1/3, omega_lambda~2/3. it is inconsistent with greydust or simple luminosity evolution, candidate astro- physical effects whichcould mimic past evidence for an accelerating universe from sne ia at z~0.5.weconsider several sources of possible systematic error including lensing, snmisclassification, selection bias, and calibration errors. currently, none ofthese effects appears likely to challenge our conclusions.

astro-ph;0109046	the large-scale ionised outflow of ch cygni	hst and ground-based [oii} and [nii] images obtained from 1996 to 1999 revealthe existence of a ionised optical nebula around the symbiotic binary ch cygextending out to 5000 a.u. from the central stars. the observed velocity rangeof the nebula, derived from long-slit echelle spectra, is of 130 km/s. in spiteof its complex appearence, the velocity data show that the basic morphology ofthe inner regions of the optical nebula is that of a bipolar (or conical)outflow extending nearly along the plane of the sky out to some 2000 a.u. fromthe centre. even if the extension of this bipolar outflow and its positionangle are consistent with those of the radio jet produced in 1984 (extrapolatedto the time of our optical imagery), no obvious counterpart is visible of theoriginal, dense radio bullets ejected by the system. we speculate that theoptical bipolar outflow might be the remannt of the interaction of the bulletswith a relatively dense circumstellar medium.

astro-ph;0201284	structure, evolution and nucleosynthesis of primordial stars	(abridge version) the evolution of population iii stars (z=0) is followedfrom the pre-main sequence phase up to the agb phase for intermediate-massstars and up to c ignition in more massive stars...we find that, thanks to thedevelopment of mixing episodes (carbon injections) at the beginning of the agbphase, the carbon abundance of the 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4 and 5mo models issignificantly increased in the envelope. this process then allows low- andintermediate-mass stars to achieve a ``standard'' thermally pulsing agbphase... in the 7mo model, the cno envelope abundance following the seconddredge-up is so large that the star does not experience the carbon injectionepisode and follows a more standard thermally pulsing agb evolution. ourcomputations also indicate that, thanks to a small overshooting at the base ofthe convective envelope, the third dredge-up is already operating in stars withm &gt;~1.5 mo after a few pulses, and that by the end of our modeling, hot bottomburning is activated in stars more massive than ~ 2mo. this evolutionarybehavior suggests that primordial low- and intermediate stars could have beensignificant contributors to the production of primary 12c, 14n, and may havecontributed to some extent to the production of mg and al and possiblys-elements (despite the lack of iron seeds) in the early universe.

astro-ph;0204001	predictions for the frequency and orbital radii of massive extrasolar  planets	we investigate the migration of massive extrasolar planets due togravitational interaction with a viscous protoplanetary disc. we show that amodel in which planets form at 5 au at a constant rate, before migrating, leadsto a predicted distribution of planets that is a steeply rising function of log(a), where a is the orbital radius. between 1 au and 3 au, the expected numberof planets per logarithmic interval in orbital radius roughly doubles. wedemonstrate that, once selection effects are accounted for, this is consistentwith current data, and then extrapolate the observed planet fraction to massesand radii that are inaccessible to current observations. in total, about 15percent of stars targeted by existing radial velocity searches are predicted topossess planets with masses 0.3 m_jupiter &lt; m_p sin (i) &lt; 10 m_jupiter, andradii 0.1 au &lt; a &lt; 5 au. a third of these planets (around 5 percent of thetarget stars) lie at the radii most amenable to detection via microlensing. afurther 5-10 percent of stars could have planets at radii of 5 au &lt; a &lt; 8 authat have migrated outwards. we discuss the probability of forming a system(akin to the solar system) in which significant radial migration of the mostmassive planet does not occur. about 10-15 percent of systems with a survivingmassive planet are estimated to fall into this class. finally, we note that asmaller fraction of low mass planets than high mass planets is expected tosurvive without being consumed by the star. the initial mass function forplanets is thus predicted to rise more steeply towards small masses than theobserved mass function.

astro-ph;0303017	star formation at the twilight of the dark ages: which stars reionized  the universe?	we calculate the global star formation rate density (sfrd) from z ~ 30-3using a semi-analytic model incorporating the hierarchical assembly of darkmatter halos, gas cooling via atomic hydrogen, star formation, supernovafeedback, and suppression of gas collapse in small halos due to the presence ofa photoionizing background. we compare the results with the predictions ofsimpler models based on the rate of dark matter halo growth and a fixed ratioof stellar-to-dark mass, and with observational constraints on the sfrd at 3 &lt;z &lt; 6. we also estimate the star formation rate due to very massive, metal-freepop iii stars using a simple model based on the halo formation rate, calibratedagainst detailed hydrodynamic simulations of pop iii star formation. we findthat the total production rate of hydrogen-ionizing photons during the probableepoch of reionization (15 &lt; z &lt; 20) is approximately equally divided betweenpop ii and pop iii stars, and that if reionization is late (less than about 15,close to the lower limit of the range allowed by the wmap results), then pop iistars alone may be able to reionize the universe.

astro-ph;0402512	type ia supernova discoveries at z&gt;1 from the hubble space telescope:  evidence for past deceleration and constraints on dark energy evolution	we have discovered 16 type ia supernovae (sne ia) with the hubble spacetelescope (hst) and have used them to provide the first conclusive evidence forcosmic deceleration that preceded the current epoch of cosmic acceleration.these objects, discovered during the course of the goods acs treasury program,include 6 of the 7 highest-redshift sne ia known, all at z&gt;1.25, and populatethe hubble diagram in unexplored territory. the luminosity distances to theseand 170 previous sne ia are provided. a purely kinematic interpretation of thesn ia sample provides evidence at the &gt; 99% confidence level for a transitionfrom deceleration to acceleration or similarly, strong evidence for a cosmicjerk. using a simple model of the expansion history, the transition between thetwo epochs is constrained to be at z=0.46 +/- 0.13. the data are consistentwith the cosmic concordance model of omega_m ~ 0.3, omega_lambda~0.7(chi^2_dof=1.06), and are inconsistent with a simple model of evolution or dustas an alternative to dark energy. for a flat universe with a cosmologicalconstant. when combined with external flat-universe constraints we find w=-1.02+ 0.13 - 0.19 (and $&lt;-0.76 at the 95% confidence level) for an assumed staticequation of state of dark energy, p = w\rho c^2. joint constraints on both therecent equation of state of dark energy, $w_0$, and its time evolution, dw/dz,are a factor of ~8 more precise than its first estimate and twice as precise asthose without the sne ia discovered with hst. our constraints are consistentwith the static nature of and value of w expected for a cosmological constant(i.e., w_0 = -1.0, dw/dz = 0), and are inconsistent with very rapid evolutionof dark energy. we address consequences of evolving dark energy for the fate ofthe universe.

astro-ph;0403425	orbital capture of stars by a massive black hole via exchanges with  compact remnants	we propose a dynamical mechanism for capturing stars around a massive blackhole (mbh), which is based on the accumulation there of a very dense cluster ofcompact stellar remnants. this study is motivated by the presence of ~10 youngmassive stars (m*~3-15 mo, ~b9v--o8v) less than 0.04 pc from the mbh in thegalactic center (gc). their existence in the extreme environment so close to ambh is a challenge for theories of star formation and stellar dynamics. we showthat young stars, which formed far from the mbh and were then scattered intoeccentric orbits, repeatedly cross a cluster of stellar black holes (sbhs),where they may undergo rare direct 3-body exchanges with a mbh-sbh "binary".the interaction between two objects of similar mass ejects the sbh and capturesthe star on a tight orbit around the mbh. such captures can naturally explaintrends observed in the orbits of the young stars. we derive the capturecross-section, validate it by monte-carlo simulations, and calculate the numberof captured stars in the gc using the currently uncertain estimates of thenumbers of sbhs inside 0.04 pc and of young stars in the inner few pc of thegc. we find that under favorable conditions 3-body exchange can account for\~25% of the observed stars, mostly at the fainter end of the observed range.we discuss additional effects that possibly increase the capture efficiency.future observations will establish whether there are enough sbhs and youngstars for exchange captures to singly account for the central young stars. weestimate that there are also ~35 lower mass stars (m*~1-3 mo, ~g2v--a0v) inside0.04 pc similarly captured by exchanges with neutron stars. ongoing replacementof compact remnants by main sequence stars may regulate the accumulation ofcompact remnants near the mbh.

0705.4035	is the bardeen-petterson effect responsible for the warping and  precession in ngc 4258?	strong evidence for the presence of a warped keplerian accretion disc inngc4258 (m 106) has been inferred from the kinematics of water masers detectedat sub-parsec scales. assuming a power-law accretion disc and using constraintson the disc parameters derived from observational data, we have analyzed therelativistic bardeen-petterson effect driven by a kerr black hole as thepotential physical mechanism responsible for the disc warping. we found thatthe bardeen-petterson radius is comparable to or smaller than the inner radiusof the maser disc (independent of the allowed value for the black hole spinparameter). numerical simulations for a wide range of physical conditions haveshown that the evolution of a misaligned disc due to the bardeen-pettersontorques usually produces an inner flat disc and a warped transition region witha smooth gradient in the tilt and twist angles. since this structure is similarto that seen in ngc 4258, we propose that the bardeen-petterson effect may beresponsible for the disc warping in this galaxy. we estimated the time-scalenecessary for the disc inside of the bardeen-petterson radius to align with theblack hole's equator, as a function of the black hole spin. our results showthat the bardeen-petterson effect can align the disc within a few billion yearsin the case of ngc 4258. finally, we show that if the observed curvature of theouter anomalous arms in the galactic disc of ngc 4258 is associated with theprecession of its radio jet/counterjet, then the bardeen-petterson effect canprovide the required precession period.

astro-ph;0608398	warping and precession in galactic and extragalactic accretion disks	the bardeen-petterson general relativistic effect has been suggested as themechanism responsible for precession in some accretion disk systems. here weexamine separately four mechanisms (tidally-induced, irradiation-induced,magnetically-induced and bardeen-petterson-induced) that can lead to warpingand precession. we use a sample of eight x-ray binaries and four activegalactic nuclei (agns) that present signatures of warping and/or precession intheir accretion disks to explore the viability of the different mechanisms. forthe x-ray binaries smc x-1 and 4u 1907+09 all four mechanisms provideprecession periods compatible with those observed, while for cyg x-1 and theactive galaxies arp 102b and ngc 1068, only two mechanisms are in agreementwith the observations. the irradiation-driven instability seems incapable ofproducing the inferred precession of the active galaxies in our sample, and thetidally-induced precession can probably be ruled out in the case of arp 102b.perhaps the best case for a bardeen-petterson precession can be achieved forngc 1068. our results show that given the many observational uncertainties thatstill exist, it is extremely difficult to confirm unambiguously that thebardeen-petterson effect has been observed in any of the other sources of oursample.

astro-ph;0610098	transiting extrasolar planetary candidates in the galactic bulge	more than 200 extrasolar planets have been discovered around relativelynearby stars, primarily through the doppler line shifts owing to the reflexmotions of their host stars, and more recently through transits of some planetsacross the face of the host stars. the detection of planets with the shortestknown periods, 1.2 to 2.5 days, has mainly resulted from transit surveys whichhave generally targeted stars more massive than 0.75 m_sun. here we report theresults from a planetary transit search performed in a rich stellar fieldtowards the galactic bulge. we discovered 16 candidates with orbital periodsbetween 0.4 and 4.2 days, five of which orbit stars of 0.44 to 0.75 m_sun. intwo cases, radial-velocity measurements support the planetary nature of thecompanions. five candidates have orbital periods below 1.0 day, constituting anew class of ultra-short-period planets (uspps), which occur only around starsof less than 0.88 m_sun. this indicates that those orbiting very close to moreluminous stars might be evaporatively destroyed, or that jovian planets aroundlower-mass stars might migrate to smaller radii.

astro-ph;9511054	on the formation and evolution of common envelope systems	we discuss the formation of a common envelope system following dynamicallyunstable mass transfer in a close binary, and the subsequent dynamicalevolution and final fate of the envelope. we base our discussion on newthree-dimensional sph calculations that we have performed for a close binarysystem containing a $4\,m_\odot$ red giant with a $0.7\,m_\odot$ main-sequencestar companion. the initial parameters are chosen to model the formation of asystem resembling v~471~tau, a typical progenitor of a cataclysmic variablebinary. in our highest-resolution calculation, we find evidence for acorotating region of gas around the central binary. this is in agreement withthe theoretical model proposed by meyer \&amp; meyer-hofmeister (1979) for theevolution of common envelope systems, in which this central corotating regionis coupled to the envelope through viscous angular momentum transport only. wealso find evidence that the envelope is convectively unstable, in which casethe viscous dissipation time could be as short as $\sim100$ dynamical times,leading to rapid ejection of the envelope. for v~471~tau, our results, and theobserved parameters of the system, are entirely consistent with rapid envelopeejection on a timescale $\sim1\,$yr and an efficiency parameter$\alpha_{ce}\simeq1$.

astro-ph;9707138	the properties of x-ray and optical light curves of x-ray novae	we have collected the available data from the literature and from public dataarchives covering the past two decades for the long-term x-ray and opticallight curves of x-ray nova (xn) outbursts, and carry out for the first time asystematic, statistical study of xn light curves which are classified into 5morphological types. basic light curve parameters, e.g., the outburst peakflux, amplitude, luminosity, rise and decay timescales, the observed andexpected outburst durations, and total energy radiated, are tabulated anddiscussed. the rise timescales are found to have a flat distribution while thedecay timescales have a much narrower and near-gaussian distribution, centeredaround 30 days and dominated by the strongest outbursts. the peak luminosity isalso distributed like a gaussian, centered around 0.2 in eddington units, whilethe total energy released has a much broader distribution around 10e44 ergs.  we identify and discuss additional light curve features, such as precursors,plateaus, and secondary maxima. the plateaus exhibited in the light curves ofblack hole sources are found to have, on average, longer durations and they arefollowed by longer decays. the identified secondary maxima seem to occur mostlyin black hole systems. for the frequency of outbursts, we find that the averagexn outburst rate is about 2.6 per year for events &gt;0.3 crab, and that the meanrecurrence time between outbursts from a single source is 6 years. the spatialand logn-logs distribution of the xn sources, with limited statistics, agreeswith a source population in the galactic disk, as observed from a point at adistance of 8.5 kpc from the galactic center. finally, we point out that theobserved xn light curve properties can in general be explained by a diskthermal instability model, although some important problems still remain.

astro-ph;9712150	on the difficulty of launching an outflow from an accretion disk	we solve for the local vertical structure of a thin accretion disk threadedby a poloidal magnetic field. the angular velocity deviates from the keplerianvalue as a result of the radial lorentz force, but is constant on magneticsurfaces. angular momentum transport and energy dissipation in the disk areparametrized by an alpha-prescription, and a kramers opacity law is assumed tohold. we also determine the stability of the equilibria with respect to themagnetorotational (or balbus-hawley) instability. if the magnetic field issufficiently strong, stable equilibria can be found in which the angle ofinclination, i, of the magnetic field to the vertical at the surface of thedisk has any value in the range [0,90 degrees). by analyzing the dynamics of atransonic outflow in the corona of the disk, we show that a certain potentialdifference must be overcome even when i &gt; 30 degrees. we determine thispotential difference as a function of i for increasing values of the verticalmagnetic field strength. for magnetorotationally stable equilibria, thepotential difference increases faster than the fourth power of the magneticfield strength, quickly exceeding a value corresponding to the centraltemperature of the disk, and is minimized with respect to i at i approximatelyequal to 38 degrees. we show that this property is relatively insensitive tothe form of the opacity law. our results suggest that an additional source ofenergy, such as coronal heating, may be required for the launching of anoutflow from a magnetized disk.

astro-ph;9809154	supernova 1987a: rotation and a binary companion	in this paper we provide a possible link between the structure of the bipolarnebula surrounding sn1987a and the properties of its progenitor star. a windblwon bubble (wbb) scenario is emplyed, in which a fast, tenuous wind from ablue supergiant expands into a slow, dense wind, expelled during an earlier redsupergiant phase. the bipolar shapre develops due to a pole-to-equator densitycontrast in the slow wind (ie, the slow wind forms a slow torus). we use thewind compressed disk (wcd) model of bjorkman &amp; cassinelli (1992) to determinethe shape of the slow torus. in the wcd scenario, the shape of the torus isdetermined by the rotation of the progenitor star. we then use a self-similarsemi-analytical method for wind blown bubble evolution to determine the shapeof the resulting bipolar nebula.  we find that the union of the wind-compressed-disk and bipolar-wind-blown-bubble models allows us to recover the salient properties of sn1987a'scircumstellar nebula. in particular, the size, speed and density of sn1987a'sinner ring are easily reproduced in our calculations. an exploration ofparameter space shows the the red supergiant progenitor must be been rotatingat &gt; 0.3 of its breakup speed. we conclude that the progenitor was most likelyspun up by a merger with a binary companion. using a simple model for thebinary merger we find that the companion is likely to have had a mass &gt; 0.5m_sun.

astro-ph;9812220	the accretion of brown dwarfs and planets by giant stars -- i. agb stars	we study the response of the structure of an asymptotic giant branch (agb)star to the accretion of a brown dwarf or planet in its interior. inparticular, we examine the case in which the brown dwarf spirals-in, and theaccreted matter is deposited at the base of the convective envelope and in thethin radiative shell surrounding the hydrogen burning shell. in our sphericallysymmetric simulations, we explore the effects of different accretion rates andwe follow two scenarios in which the amounts of injected mass are equal to$\sim 0.01$ and $\sim 0.1 m_\odot$. the calculations show that for highaccretion rates ($\dot m_{acc} = 10^{-4} m_\odot yr^{-1}$), the considerablerelease of accretion energy produces a substantial expansion of the star andgives rise to hot bottom burning at the base of the convective envelope. forsomewhat lower accretion rates ($\dot m_{acc} = 10^{-5} m_\odot yr^{-1}$), theaccretion luminosity represents only a small fraction of the stellarluminosity, and as a result of the increase in mass (and concomitantly of thegravitational force), the star contracts. our simulations also indicate thatthe triggering of thermal pulses is delayed (accelerated) if mass is injectedat a slower (faster) rate. we analyze the effects of this accretion process onthe surface chemical abundances and show that chemical modifications are mainlythe result of deposition of fresh material rather than of activenucleosynthesis. finally, we suggest that the accretion of brown dwarfs andplanets can induce the ejection of shells around giant stars, increase theirsurface lithium abundance and lead to significant spin-up. the combination ofthese features is frequently observed among g and k giant stars.

astro-ph;9905235	the accretion of planets and brown dwarfs by giant stars -- ii. solar  mass stars on the red giant branch	this paper extends our previous study of planet/brown dwarf accretion bygiant stars to solar mass stars located on the red giant branch. the modelassumes that the planet is dissipated at the bottom of the convective envelopeof the giant star. the giant's evolution is then followed in detail. we analyzethe effects of different accretion rates and different initial conditions. thecomputations indicate that the accretion process is accompanied by asubstantial expansion of the star, and in the case of high accretion rates, hotbottom burning can be activated. the possible observational signatures thataccompany the engulfing of a planet are also extensively investigated. theyinclude : the ejection of a shell and a subsequent phase of ir emission, anincrease in the 7li surface abundance and a potential stellar metallicityenrichment, spin-up of the star due to the deposition of orbital angularmomentum, the possible generation of magnetic fields and a related x-rayactivity due to the development of shear at the base of the convectiveenvelope, and the effects on the morphology of the horizontal branch inglobular clusters. we propose that the ir excess and high li abundance observedin 4-8% of the g and k giants originate from the accretion of a giant planet, abrown dwarf or a very low-mass star.

astro-ph;9906028	black hole formation via hypercritical accretion during common envelope  evolution	neutron stars inspiralling into a stellar envelope can accrete at ratesvastly exceeding the eddington limit if the flow develops pressures high enoughto allow neutrinos to radiate the released gravitational energy. it has beensuggested that this hypercritical mode of accretion leads inevitably to theformation of stellar mass black holes during common envelope evolution. westudy the hydrodynamics of this flow at large radii (r &gt;&gt; r_ns), and show thatfor low mach number flows, in two dimensions, modest density gradients in thestellar envelope suffice to produce a hot, advection dominated accretion diskaround the accreting object. the formation of outflows from such a disk ishighly probable, and we discuss the impact of the resultant mass loss andfeedback of energy into the envelope for the survival of the neutron star.unless outflows are weaker than those inferred for well observed accretingsystems, we argue that in most cases insufficient accretion occurs to forcecollapse to a black hole before the envelope has been ejected. this conclusionsis of interest for black hole formation in general, for some models of gammaray bursts, and for predictions of the event rate in future ligo observations.

astro-ph;9907439	the ages of pre-main-sequence stars	the position of pre-main-sequence or protostars in the hertzsprung--russelldiagram is often used to determine their mass and age by comparison withpre-main-sequence evolution tracks. on the assumption that the stellar modelsare accurate, we demonstrate that, if the metallicity is known, the massobtained is a good estimate. however, the age determination can be verymisleading because it is significantly (generally different by a factor of twoto five) dependent on the accretion rate and, for ages less than about onemillion years, the initial state of the star. we present a number of accretingprotostellar tracks that can be used to determine age if the initial conditionscan be determined and the underlying accretion rate has been constant in thepast. because of the balance established between the kelvin-helmholtz,contraction timescale and the accretion timescale a pre-main-sequence starremembers its accretion history. knowledge of the current accretion rate,together with an h--r-diagram position gives information about the rate ofaccretion in the past but does not necessarily improve any age estimate. we donot claim that ages obtained by comparison with these particular accretingtracks are likely to be any more reliable than those from comparisons withnon-accreting tracks. instead we stress the unreliability of any suchcomparisons and use the disparities between various tracks to estimate thelikely errors in age and mass estimates. we also show how a set of coevalaccreting objects do not appear coeval when compared with non-accreting tracks.instead accreting pre-main-sequence stars of around a solar mass are likely toappear older than those of either smaller or larger mass.

astro-ph;9910418	the formation and role of vortices in protoplanetary disks	we carry out a two-dimensional, compressible, simulation of a disk, includingdust particles, to study the formation and role of vortices in protoplanetarydisks. we find that anticyclonic vortices can form out of an initial randomperturbation of the vorticity field. vortices have a typical decay time of theorder of 50 orbital periods (for a viscosity parameter alpha=0.0001 and a diskaspect ratio of h/r = 0.15). if vorticity is continuously generated at aconstant rate in the flow (e.g. by convection), then a large vortex can formand be sustained (due to the merger of vortices).  we find that dust concentrates in the cores of vortices within a few orbitalperiods, when the drag parameter is of the order of the orbital frequency.also, the radial drift of the dust induces a significant increase in thesurface density of dust particles in the inner region of the disk. thus,vortices may represent the preferred location for planetesimal formation inprotoplanetary disks.  we show that it is very difficult for vortex mergers to sustain a relativelycoherent outward flux of angular momentum.

0812.0023	the wfc3 galactic bulge treasury program: a first look at resolved  stellar population tools	[abridged] when wfc3 is installed on hst, the community will have powerfulnew tools for investigating resolved stellar populations. the wfc3 galacticbulge treasury program will obtain deep imaging on 4 low-extinction fields.these non-proprietary data will enable a variety of science investigations notpossible with previous data sets. to aid in planning for the use of these dataand for future proposals, we provide an introduction to the program, itsphotometric system, and the associated calibration effort.  the observing strategy is based upon a new 5-band photometric system spanningthe uv, optical, and near-infrared. with these broad bands, one can constructreddening-free indices of teff and [fe/h]. besides the 4 bulge fields, theprogram will target 6 fields in well-studied star clusters, spanning a widerange of [fe/h]. the cluster data serve to calibrate the indices, providepopulation templates, and correct the transformation of isochrones into thewfc3 photometric system. the bulge data will shed light on the bulge formationhistory, and will also serve as population templates for other studies. one ofthe fields includes 12 candidate hosts of extrasolar planets.  cmds are the most popular tool for analyzing resolved stellar populations.however, due to degeneracies among teff, [fe/h], and reddening in traditionalcmds, it can be difficult to draw robust conclusions from the data. the 5-bandsystem used for the bulge treasury observations will provide indices that areroughly orthogonal in teff and [fe/h], and we argue that model fitting in anindex-index diagram will make better use of the information than fittingseparate cmds. we provide simulations to show the expected data quality and thepotential for differentiating between different star-formation histories.
