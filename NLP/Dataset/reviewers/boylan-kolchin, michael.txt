0903.3041	resolving cosmic structure formation with the millennium-ii simulation	we present the millennium-ii simulation (ms-ii), a very large n-bodysimulation of dark matter evolution in the concordance lcdm cosmology. thems-ii assumes the same cosmological parameters and uses the same particlenumber and output data structure as the original millennium simulation (ms),but was carried out in a periodic cube one-fifth the size (100 mpc/h) with 5times better spatial resolution (a plummer equivalent softening of 1.0 kpc/h)and with 125 times better mass resolution (a particle mass of 6.9 \times 10^6msun/h). by comparing results at ms and ms-ii resolution, we demonstrateexcellent convergence in dark matter statistics such as the halo mass function,the subhalo abundance distribution, the mass dependence of halo formationtimes, the linear and nonlinear autocorrelations and power spectra, and haloassembly bias. together, the two simulations provide precise results for suchstatistics over an unprecedented range of scales, from halos similar to thosehosting local group dwarf spheroidal galaxies to halos corresponding to therichest galaxy clusters. the "milky way" halos of the aquarius project wereselected from a lower resolution version of the ms-ii and were then resimulatedat much higher resolution. as a result, they are present in the ms-ii alongwith thousands of other similar mass halos. a comparison of their assemblyhistories in the ms-ii and in resimulations of 1000 times better resolutionshows detailed agreement over a factor of 100 in mass growth. we publiclyrelease halo catalogs and assembly trees for the ms-ii in the same formatwithin the same archive as those already released for the ms.

0908.2428	extragalactic gamma-ray background radiation from dark matter  annihilation	if dark matter is composed of neutralinos, one of the most exciting prospectsfor its detection lies in observations of the gamma-ray radiation created inpair annihilations between neutralinos, a process that may contributesignificantly to the extragalactic gamma-ray background (egb) radiation. wehere use the high-resolution millennium-ii simulation of cosmic structureformation to produce the first full-sky maps of the expected radiation comingfrom extragalactic dark matter structures. our map making procedure takes intoaccount the total gamma-ray luminosity from all haloes and their subhaloes, andincludes corrections for unresolved components of the emission as well as anextrapolation to the damping scale limit of neutralinos. our analysis alsoincludes a proper normalization of the signal according to a specificsupersymmetric model based on minimal supergravity. the new simulated mapsallow a study of the angular power spectrum of the gamma-ray background fromdark matter annihilation, which has distinctive features associated with thenature of the annihilation process and may be detectable in forthcomingobservations by the recently launched fermi satellite. our results are in broadagreement with analytic models for the gamma-ray background, but they alsoinclude higher-order correlations not readily accessible in analyticcalculations and, in addition, provide detailed spectral information for eachpixel. in particular, we find that difference maps at different energies canreveal cosmic large-scale structure at low and intermediate redshifts. if theintrinsic emission spectrum is characterized by an emission peak, cosmologicaltomography with gamma ray annihilation radiation is in principle possible.

0909.4305	how do galaxies populate dark matter halos?	for any assumed stellar initial mass function, the sloan digital sky survey(sdss) gives a precise determination of the stellar mass function of galaxiesfor 10^8 m_sun &lt; m_* &lt; 10^12 m_sun. within the concordance lcdm cosmology, themillennium simulations give a precise halo mass function for all halos withinwhich galaxies can form. under the plausible hypothesis that the stellar massof a galaxy is an increasing function of the maximum mass ever attained by itshalo, these combine to give halo mass as a function of stellar mass. the resultagrees quite well with observational estimates of mean halo mass as a functionof stellar mass from stacking analyses of the gravitational lensing signal andthe satellite dynamics of sdss galaxies. for m_* ~ 5.5 x 10^10 m_sun, thestellar mass usually assumed for the milky way, the implied halo mass is ~ 2 x10^12 m_sun, consistent with most recent direct estimates and inferences fromthe mw/m31 timing argument. the fraction of the baryons associated with eachhalo which are present as stars in its central galaxy reaches a maximum of 20%at masses somewhat below that of the milky way, and falls rapidly at bothhigher and lower masses. these conversion efficiencies are lower than in almostall recent high-resolution simulations of galaxy formation, showing that theseare not yet viable models for the formation of typical members of the galaxypopulation. when inserted in the millennium-ii simulation, our derived relationbetween stellar mass and halo mass predicts a stellar mass autocorrelationfunction in excellent agreement with that measured directly in the sdss. theimplied tully-fisher relation also appears consistent with observation,suggesting that galaxy luminosity functions and tully-fisher relations can bereproduced simultaneously in a lcdm cosmology.

0911.4484	there's no place like home? statistics of milky way-mass dark matter  halos	we present an analysis of the distribution of structural properties for milkyway-mass halos in the millennium-ii simulation (ms-ii). this simulation ofstructure formation within the standard lcdm cosmology contains thousands ofmilky way-mass halos and has sufficient resolution to properly resolve manysubhalos per host. it thus provides a major improvement in the statisticalpower available to explore the distribution of internal structure for halos ofthis mass. in addition, the ms-ii contains lower resolution versions of theaquarius project halos, allowing us to compare our results to simulations ofsix halos at a much higher resolution. we study the distributions of massassembly histories, of subhalo mass functions and accretion times, and ofmerger and stripping histories for subhalos capable of impacting disks at thecenters of halos. we show that subhalo abundances are not well-described bypoisson statistics at low mass, but rather are dominated by intrinsic scatter.using the masses of subhalos at infall and the abundance-matching assumption,there is less than a 10% chance that a milky way halo with m_vir =10^12 m_sunwill host two galaxies as bright as the magellanic clouds. this probabilityrises to ~25% for a halo with m_vir=2.5 x 10^12 m_sun. the statistics relevantfor disk heating are very sensitive to the mass range that is consideredrelevant. mergers with infall mass : redshift zero virial mass greater than1:30 could well impact a central galactic disk and are a near inevitabilitysince z=2, whereas only half of all halos have had a merger with infall mass :redshift zero virial mass greater than 1:10 over this same period.

0707.2960	dynamical friction and galaxy merging timescales	the timescale for galaxies within merging dark matter halos to merge witheach other is an important ingredient in galaxy formation models. accurateestimates of merging timescales are required for predictions of astrophysicalquantities such as black hole binary merger rates, the build-up of stellar massin central galaxies, and the statistical properties of satellite galaxieswithin dark matter halos. in this paper, we study the merging timescales ofextended dark matter halos using n-body simulations. we compare these resultsto standard estimates based on the chandrasekhar theory of dynamical friction.we find that these standard predictions for merging timescales, which are oftenused in semi-analytic galaxy formation models, are systematically shorter thanthose found in simulations. the discrepancy is approximately a factor of 1.7for $m_sat/m_host \approx 0.1$ and becomes larger for more disparatesatellite-to-host mass ratios, reaching a factor of $\sim 3.3$ for$m_sat/m_host\approx 0.01$. based on our simulations, we propose a new, easilyimplementable fitting formula that accurately predicts the timescale for anextended satellite to sink from the virial radius of a host halo down to thehalo's center for a wide range of $m_sat/m_host$ and orbits. including acentral bulge in each galaxy changes the merging timescale by $\la 10%$. tohighlight one concrete application of our results, we show that mergingtimescales often used in the literature overestimate the growth of stellar massby satellite accretion by $\approx 40 %$, with the extra mass gained in lowmass ratio mergers.

1001.2304	the merger rates and mass assembly histories of dark matter haloes in  the two millennium simulations	we construct merger trees of dark matter haloes and quantify their mergerrates and mass growth rates using the joint dataset from the millennium andmillennium-ii simulations. the finer resolution of the millennium-ii simulationhas allowed us to extend our earlier analysis of halo merger statistics to anunprecedentedly wide range of descendant halo mass (10^10 &lt; m0 &lt; 10^15 msun),progenitor mass ratio (10^-5 &lt; xi &lt; 1), and redshift (0 &lt; z &lt; 15). we updateour earlier fitting form for the mean merger rate per halo as a function ofm_0, xi, and z. the overall behavior of this quantity is unchanged: the rateper unit redshift is nearly independent of z out to z~15; the dependence onhalo mass is weak (m0^0.13); and it is nearly a power law in the progenitormass ratio (xi^-2). we also present a simple and accurate fitting formula forthe mean mass growth rate of haloes as a function of mass and redshift. thismean rate is 46 msun/yr for 10^12 msun haloes at z=0, and it increases withmass as m^{1.1} and with redshift as (1+z)^2.5 (for z &gt; 1). when the fit forthe mean mass growth rate is integrated over a halo's history, we findexcellent match to the mean mass assembly histories of the simulated haloes. bycombining merger rates and mass assembly histories, we present results for thenumber of mergers over a halo's history and the statistics of the redshift ofthe last major merger.

1001.3307	mapping extragalactic dark matter structures through gamma-rays	if dark matter is composed of neutralinos, the gamma-ray radiation producedin their annihilation offers an attractive possibility for dark matterdetection. this process may contribute significantly to the extragalacticgamma-ray background (egb) radiation, which is being measured by the fermisatellite with unprecedented sensitivity. using the high-resolutionmillennium-ii simulation of cosmic structure formation we have produced thefirst full-sky maps of the expected contribution of dark matter annihilation tothe egb radiation. our maps include a proper normalization of the signalaccording to a specific supersymmetric model based on minimal supergravity. thenew simulated maps allow a study of the angular power spectrum of the gamma-raybackground from dark matter annihilation, which has distinctive featuresassociated with the nature of the annihilation process. our results are inbroad agreement with analytic models for the gamma-ray background, but theyalso include higher-order correlations not readily accessible in analyticcalculations and, in addition, provide detailed spectral information for eachpixel. in particular, we find that color maps combining different energies canreveal the cosmic large-scale structure at low and intermediate redshifts.

1002.3394	further constraining galaxy evolution models through the size function  of sdss early-type galaxies	we discuss how the effective radius phi(re) function (erf) recently workedout by bernardi et al. (2009) represents a new testbed to improve the currentunderstanding of semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. in particular, wehere show that a detailed hierarchical model of structure formation can broadlyreproduce the correct peak in the size distribution of local early-typegalaxies, although it significantly overpredicts the number of very compact andvery large galaxies. this in turn is reflected in the predicted size-massrelation, much flatter than the observed one, due to too large (~3 kpc)low-mass galaxies (&lt;10^11 \msun), and to a non-negligible fraction of compact(&lt; 0.5-1 kpc) and massive galaxies (&gt; 10^11 \msun). we also find that thelatter discrepancy is smaller than previously claimed, and limited to onlyultracompact (re &lt; 0.5 kpc) galaxies when considering elliptical-dominatedsamples. we explore several causes behind these effects. we conclude that theformer problem might be linked to the initial conditions, given that large andlow-mass galaxies are present at all epochs in the model. the survival ofcompact and massive galaxies might instead be linked to their very old ages andpeculiar merger histories. overall, knowledge of the galactic stellar mass {\emand} size distributions allows a better understanding of where and how toimprove models.

1003.3021	a semi-analytic model comparison - gas cooling and galaxy mergers	we use stripped-down versions of three semi-analytic galaxy formation modelsto study the influence of different assumptions about gas cooling and galaxymergers. by running the three models on identical sets of merger treesextracted from high-resolution cosmological n-body simulations, we are able toperform both statistical analyses and halo-by-halo comparisons. our studydemonstrates that there is a good statistical agreement between the threemodels used here, when operating on the same merger trees, reflecting a generalagreement in the underlying framework for semi-analytic models. we also show,however, that various assumptions that are commonly adopted to treat gascooling and galaxy mergers can lead to significantly different results, atleast in some regimes. in particular, we find that the different models adoptedfor gas cooling lead to similar results for mass scales comparable to that ofour own galaxy. significant differences, however, arise at larger mass scales.these are largely (but not entirely) due to different treatments of the `rapidcooling' regime, and different assumptions about the hot gas distribution. atthis mass regime, the predicted cooling rates can differ up to about one orderof magnitude, with important implications on the relative weight that thesemodels give to agn feedback in order to counter-act excessive gas condensationin relatively massive haloes at low redshift. different assumptions in themodelling of galaxy mergers can also result in significant differences in thetimings of mergers, with important consequences for the formation and evolutionof massive galaxies.

1006.0106	from dwarf spheroidals to cds: simulating the galaxy population in a  lcdm cosmology	we apply updated semi-analytic galaxy formation models simultaneously to thestored halo/subhalo merger trees of the millennium and millennium-iisimulations. these differ by a factor of 125 in mass resolution, allowingexplicit testing of resolution effects on predicted galaxy properties. we haverevised the treatments of the transition between the rapid infall and coolingflow regimes of gas accretion, of the sizes of bulges and of gaseous andstellar disks, of supernova feedback, of the transition between central andsatellite status as galaxies fall into larger systems, and of gas and starstripping once they become satellites. plausible values of efficiency andscaling parameters yield an excellent fit not only to the observed abundance oflow-redshift galaxies over 5 orders of magnitude in stellar mass and 9magnitudes in luminosity, but also to the observed abundance of milky waysatellites. this suggests that reionisation effects may not be needed to solvethe "missing satellite" problem except, perhaps, for the faintest objects. thesame model matches the observed large-scale clustering of galaxies as afunction of stellar mass and colour. the fit remains excellent down to ~30kpcfor massive galaxies. for m* &lt; 6 x 10^10msun, however, the model overpredictsclustering at scales below 1 mpc, suggesting that the sigma_8 adopted in thesimulations (0.9) is too high. galaxy distributions within rich clusters agreebetween the simulations and match those observed, but only if galaxies withoutdark matter subhalos (so-called orphans) are included. our model predicts alarger passive fraction among low-mass galaxies than is observed, as well as anoverabundance of ~10^10msun galaxies beyond z~0.6, reflecting deficiencies inthe way star-formation rates are modelled.

1010.4797	dynamics of the magellanic clouds in a lcdm universe	we examine milky way-magellanic cloud systems selected from the millennium-iisimulation in order to place the orbits of the magellanic clouds in acosmological context. our analysis shows that satellites massive enough to belmc analogs are typically accreted at late times. moreover, those that areaccreted at early times and survive to the present have orbital properties thatare discrepant with those observed for the lmc. the high velocity of the lmc,coupled with the dearth of unbound orbits seen in the simulation, argues thatthe mass of the mw's halo is unlikely to be less than 2 x 10^12 msun. thisconclusion is further supported by statistics of halos hosting satellites withmasses, velocities, and separations comparable to those of the lmc. we furthershow that: (1) lmc and smc-mass objects are not particularly uncommon inmw-mass halos; (2) the apparently high angular momentum of the lmc is notcosmologically unusual; and (3) it is rare for a mw halo to host a lmc-smcbinary system at z=0, but high speed binary pairs accreted at late times arepossible. based on these results, we conclude that the lmc was accreted withinthe past four gyr and is currently making its first pericentric passage aboutthe mw.

1011.2492	linking haloes to galaxies: how many halo properties are needed?	recent studies emphasize that an empirical relation between the stellar massof galaxies and the mass of their host dark matter subhaloes can predict theclustering of galaxies and its evolution with cosmic time. in this paper westudy the assumptions made by this methodology using a semi-analytical model(sam). to this end, we randomly swap between the locations of model galaxieswithin a narrow range of subhalo mass (m_infall). we find that shuffled samplesof galaxies have different auto-correlation functions in comparison with theoriginal model galaxies. this difference is significant even if central andsatellite galaxies are allowed to follow a different relation between m_infalland stellar mass, and can reach a factor of 2 for massive galaxies at redshiftzero. we analyze three features within sams that contribute to this effect: a)the relation between stellar mass and subhalo mass evolves with redshift forcentral galaxies, affecting satellite galaxies at the time of infall. b) thestellar mass of galaxies falling into groups and clusters at high redshift isdifferent from the mass of central galaxies at the same time. c) the stellarmass growth for satellite galaxies after infall can be significant and dependson the infall redshift and the group mass. we show that the above is true fordiffering sams, and that the effect is sensitive to the treatment of dynamicalfriction and stripping of gas in satellite galaxies. we find that by using thefof group mass at redshift zero in addition to m_infall, an empirical model isable to accurately reproduce the clustering properties of galaxies. on theother hand, using the infall redshift as a second parameter does not yield asgood results because it is less correlated with stellar mass. our analysisindicates that environmental processes are important for modeling theclustering and abundance of galaxies.

1102.0002	the density and pseudo-phase-space density profiles of cdm halos	cosmological n-body simulations indicate that the spherically-averageddensity profiles of cold dark matter halos are accurately described by einastoprofiles, where the logarithmic slope is a power-law of adjustable exponent,\gamma =dln\rho /dlnr ~ r^\alpha $. the pseudo-phase-space density (ppsd)profiles of cdm halos also show remarkable regularity, and are wellapproximated by simple power laws, q(r)=\rho /\sigma ^3 ~ r^-\chi . we showthat this is expected from dynamical equilibrium considerations, since jeans'equations predict that the pseudo-phase-space density profiles of einasto halosshould resemble power laws over a wide range of radii. for the values of \alphatypical of cdm halos, the inner q profiles of equilibrium halos deviatesignificantly from a power law only very close to the center, and simulationsof extremely high-resolution would be needed to detect such deviationsunambiguously. we use an ensemble of halos drawn from the millennium-iisimulation to study which of these two alternatives describe best the massprofile of cdm halos. our analysis indicates that at the resolution of the bestavailable simulations, both einasto and power-law ppsd profiles (withadjustable exponents \alpha and \chi, respectively) provide equally acceptablefits to the simulations. a full account of the structure of cdm halos requiresunderstanding how the shape parameters that characterize departures fromself-similarity, like \alpha or \chi, are determined by evolutionary history,environment or initial conditions.

1103.1875	small-scale structure in the sdss and lcdm: isolated l* galaxies with  bright satellites	we use a volume-limited spectroscopic sample of isolated galaxies in thesloan digital sky survey (sdss) to investigate the frequency and radialdistribution of luminous (m_r &lt;~ -18.3) satellites like the large magellaniccloud (lmc) around ~l* milky way analogs and compare our resultsobject-by-object to lcdm predictions based on abundance matching insimulations. we show that 12% of milky way-like galaxies host an lmc-likesatellite within 75 kpc (projected), and 42 % within 250 kpc (projected). thisimplies ~10% have a satellite within the distance of the lmc, and ~40% of l*galaxies host a bright satellite within the virialized extent of their darkmatter halos. remarkably, the simulation reproduces the observed frequency,radial dependence, velocity distribution, and luminosity function of observedsecondaries exceptionally well, suggesting that lcdm provides an accuratereproduction of the observed universe to galaxies as faint as l~10^9 lsun on~50 kpc scales. when stacked, the observed projected pairwise velocitydispersion of these satellites is sigma~160 km/s, in agreement withabundance-matching expectations for their host halo masses. finally, brightsatellites around l* primaries are significantly redder than typical galaxiesin their luminosity range, indicating that environmental quenching is operatingwithin galaxy-size dark matter halos that typically contain only a singlebright satellite. this redness trend is in stark contrast to the milky way'slmc, which is unusually blue even for a field galaxy. we suggest that the lmc'sdiscrepant color might be further evidence that it is undergoing a triggeredstar-formation event upon first infall.

1103.3272	a tale of two populations: the stellar mass of central and satellite  galaxies	we develop a new empirical methodology to study the relation between thestellar mass of galaxies and the mass of their host subhaloes. our approach issimilar to abundance matching, and is based on assigning a stellar mass to eachsubhalo within a large cosmological n-body simulation. however, wesignificantly extend the method to include a different treatment for centraland satellite galaxies, allowing the stellar mass of satellite galaxies todepend on both the host subhalo mass, and on the halo mass. unlike in previousstudies, our models are constrained by two observations: the stellar massfunction of galaxies, and their auto-correlation functions (cfs). we presentresults for ~10^6 different successful models, showing that the uncertainty inthe host subhalo mass reaches a factor of ~10 for a given stellar mass. ourresults thus indicate that the host subhalo mass of central and satellitegalaxies is poorly constrained by using information coming solely from theabundance and cfs of galaxies. in addition, we demonstrate that the fraction ofstellar mass relative to the universal baryon fraction can vary betweendifferent models, and can reach ~0.6 for a specific population of low massgalaxies. we conclude that additional observational constraints are needed, inorder to better constrain the mass relation between haloes and galaxies. thesemight include weak lensing, satellite kinematics, or measures of clusteringother than the cfs. moreover, cfs based on larger surveys with a betterestimate of the systematic uncertainties are needed.

1105.2293	the effects of patchy reionization on satellite galaxies of the milky  way	we combine the high-resolution aquarius simulations with three-dimensionalmodels of reionization based on the initial density field of the aquariusparent simulation, millennium-ii, to study the impact of patchy reionization onthe faint satellite population of milky way halos. because the aquarius suiteconsists of zoom-in simulations of halos in the millennium-ii volume, we followthe formation of substructure and the growth of reionization bubbles due to thelarger environment simultaneously, and thereby determine the reionizationredshifts of satellite candidates. we do this for four different reionizationmodels, and also compare results to instantaneous reionization. using a simpleprocedure for selecting satellites and assigning luminosities in thesimulations, we compare the resulting satellite populations. we find that theoverall number of satellites depends sensitively on the reionization model,with a factor of 3-4 variation between the four models for a given host halo,although the difference is entirely in the population of faint satellites (m_v&gt; -10). in addition, we find that for a given reionization model the totalnumber of satellites differs by 10%-20% between the patchy and homogeneousscenarios, provided that the redshift is chosen appropriately for theinstantaneous case. however, the halo-halo scatter from the six aquarius halosis large, up to a factor of 2-3, and so is comparable to the difference betweenreionization scenarios. in order to use the population of faint dwarf galaxiesaround the milky way as a probe of the local reionization history, then, it isnecessary to first better understand the general distribution of substructurearound milky way-mass halos.

1107.4098	convergence of galaxy properties with merger tree temporal resolution	dark matter halo merger trees are now routinely extracted from cosmologicalsimulations of structure formation. these trees are frequently used as inputsto semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to provide the backbone withinwhich galaxy formation takes place. by necessity, these merger trees areconstructed from a finite set of discrete "snapshots" of the n-body simulationand so have a limited temporal resolution. to date, there has been littleconsideration of how this temporal resolution affects the properties ofgalaxies formed within these trees. in particular, the question of how manysnapshots are needed to achieve convergence in galaxy properties has not beanswered. therefore, we study the convergence in the stellar and total baryonicmasses of galaxies, distribution of merger times, stellar mass functions andstar formation rates in the galacticus model of galaxy formation as a functionof the number of "snapshot" times used to represent dark matter halo mergertrees. when utilizing snapshots between z=20 and z=0, we find that at least 128snapshots are required to achieve convergence to within 5% for galaxy masses.this convergence is obtained for mean quantities averaged over large samples ofgalaxies - significant variance for individual galaxies remains even when usingvery large numbers of snapshots. we find only weak dependence of the rate ofconvergence on the distribution of snapshots in time - snapshots spaceduniformly in the expansion factor, uniformly in the logarithm of expansionfactor or uniformly in the logarithm of critical overdensity for collapse workequally well in almost all cases. we provide input parameters to galacticuswhich allow this type of convergence study to be tuned to other simulations andto be carried out for other galaxy properties.

1111.2048	the milky way's bright satellites as an apparent failure of lcdm	we use the aquarius simulations to show that the most massive subhalos ingalaxy-mass dark matter halos in lcdm are grossly inconsistent with thedynamics of the brightest milky way dwarf spheroidal galaxies. while thebest-fitting hosts of the dwarf spheroidals all have 12 &lt; vmax &lt; 25 km/s, lcdmsimulations predict at least ten subhalos with vmax &gt; 25 km/s. these subhalosare also among the most massive at earlier times, and significantly exceed theuv suppression mass back to z ~ 10. no lcdm-based model of the satellitepopulation of the milky way explains this result. the problem lies in thesatellites' densities: it is straightforward to match the observed milky wayluminosity function, but doing so requires the dwarf spheroidals to have darkmatter halos that are a factor of ~5 more massive than is observed. independentof the difficulty in explaining the absence of these dense, massive subhalos,there is a basic tension between the derived properties of the bright milky waydwarf spheroidals and lcdm expectations. the inferred infall masses of thesegalaxies are all approximately equal and are much lower than standard lcdmpredictions for systems with their luminosities. consequently, their impliedstar formation efficiencies span over two orders of magnitude, from 0.2% to 20%of baryons converted into stars, in stark contrast with expectations gleanedfrom more massive galaxies. we explore possible solutions to these problemswithin the context of lcdm and find them to be unconvincing. in particular, weuse controlled simulations to demonstrate that the small stellar masses of thebright dwarf spheroidals make supernova feedback an unlikely explanation fortheir low inferred densities.

1204.0516	the growth of galactic bulges through mergers in lcdm haloes revisited.  i. present-day properties	we use the millennium i and ii cosmological simulations to revisit the impactof mergers in the growth of bulges in central galaxies in the lcdm scenario. weseed galaxies within the growing cdm haloes using semi-empirical relations toassign stellar and gaseous masses, and an analytic treatment to estimate thetransfer of stellar mass to the bulge of the remnant after a galaxy merger. wefind that this model roughly reproduces the observed correlation between thebulge-to-total (b/t) mass ratio and stellar mass in present-day centralgalaxies as well as their observed demographics, although low-mass b/t&lt;0.1(bulgeless) galaxies might be scarce relative to the observed abundance. in ourmerger-driven scenario, bulges have a composite population made of (i) starsacquired from infalling satellites, (ii) stars transferred from the primarydisc due to merger-induced perturbations, and (iii) newly formed stars instarbursts triggered by mergers. we find that (i) and (ii) are the mainchannels of mass assembly, with the first being dominant for massive galaxies,creating large bulges with different stellar populations than those of theinner discs, while the second is dominant for intermediate/low-mass galaxiescreating small bulges with similar stellar populations to the inner discs. weassociate the dominion of the first (second) channel to classical (pseudo)bulges, and compare the predicted fractions to observations. we remark that ourtreatment does not include other mechanisms of bulge growth such as intrinsicsecular disc instabilities or misaligned gas accretion. we find that theevolution of the stellar and gaseous contents of the satellite as it movestowards the central galaxy is a key ingredient in setting the morphology of theremnant, and that a good match to the observed bulge demographics occurs whenthis evolution proceeds closely to that of the central galaxy.

1206.1049	the dynamical state and mass-concentration relation of galaxy clusters	we use the millennium simulation series to study how the dynamical state ofdark matter halos affects the relation between mass and concentration. we findthat a large fraction of massive systems are identified when they aresubstantially out of equilibrium and in a particular phase of their dynamicalevolution: the more massive the halo, the more likely it is found at atransient stage of high concentration. this state reflects the recent assemblyof massive halos and corresponds to the first pericentric passage ofrecently-accreted material when, before virialization, the kinetic andpotential energies reach maximum and minimum values, respectively. this resultexplains the puzzling upturn in the mass-concentration relation reported inrecent work for massive halos; indeed, the upturn disappears when onlydynamically-relaxed systems are considered in the analysis. our results warnagainst applying simple equilibrium models to describe the structure of rare,massive galaxy clusters and urges caution when extrapolating scaling lawscalibrated on lower-mass systems, where such deviations from equilibrium areless common. the evolving dynamical state of galaxy clusters ought to becarefully taken into account if cluster studies are to provide precisecosmological constraints.

1211.0758	on the hot gas content of the milky way halo	the milky way appears to be missing baryons, as the observed mass in starsand gas is well below the cosmic mean. one possibility is that a substantialfraction of the galaxy's baryons are embedded within an extended,million-degree hot halo, an idea supported indirectly by observations of warmgas clouds in the halo and gas-free dwarf spheroidal satellites. x-rayobservations have established that hot gas does exist in our galaxy beyond thelocal hot bubble; however, it may be distributed in a hot disk configuration.moreover, recent investigations into the x-ray constraints have suggested thatany galactic corona must be insignificant. here we re-examine the observationaldata, particularly in the x-ray and radio bands, in order to determine whetherit is possible for a substantial fraction of the galaxy's baryons to exist in ~10^6 k gas. in agreement with past studies, we find that a baryonically closedhalo is clearly ruled out if one assumes that the hot corona is distributedwith a cuspy nfw profile. however, if the hot corona of the galaxy is in anextended, low-density distribution with a large central core, as expected foran adiabatic gas in hydrostatic equilibrium, then it may contain up to 10^11m_sun of material, possibly accounting for all of the missing galactic baryons.we briefly discuss some potential avenues for discriminating between a massive,extended hot halo and a local hot disk.

1301.3137	can feedback solve the too big to fail problem?	the observed central densities of milky way dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dsphs)are significantly lower than the densities of the largest (vmax about 35 km/s)subhalos found in dissipationless simulations of galaxy-size dark matter hosts.one possible explanation is that gas removal from feedback can lower coredensities enough to match observations. we model the dynamical effects ofsupernova feedback through the use of a time-varying central potential in highresolution, idealized numerical simulations and explore the resulting impact onthe mass distributions of dwarf dark matter halos. we find that in order tomatch the observed central masses of m_star about 10^6 m_sun dsphs, the energyequivalent of more than 40,000 supernovae must be delivered with 100%efficiency directly to the dark matter. this energy requirement exceeds thenumber of supernovae that have ever exploded in most dsphs for typical initialmass functions. we also find that, per unit energy delivered and per cumulativemass removed from the galaxy, single blow-out events are more effective thanrepeated small bursts in reducing central dark matter densities. we concludethat it is unlikely that supernova feedback alone can solve the "too big tofail" problem for milky way subhalos.

1301.4220	a research note on the implementation of star formation and stellar  feedback in semi-analytic models	we study the impact of star formation and stellar feedback prescriptions ongalaxy properties predicted by means of "stripped-down" versions ofindependently developed semi-analytic models (sams). these include cooling,star formation, feedback from supernovae (sne) and simplified prescriptions forgalaxy merging, but no chemical evolution, disc instabilities or agn feedback.we run these versions on identical samples of dark matter (dm) haloes extractedfrom high-resolution n-body simulations in order to perform both statisticalanalysis and object-by-object comparisons. we compare our results with previouswork based on stripped-down versions of the same sams including only gascooling, and show that all feedback models provide coherent modifications inthe distribution of baryons between the various gas phases. in particular, wefind that the predicted hot gas fractions are considerably increased by up to afactor of three, while the corresponding cold gas fractions are correspondinglydecreased, and a significant amount of mass is ejected from the dm halo.nonetheless, we also find relevant differences in the predicted properties ofmodel galaxies among the three sams: these deviations are more relevant at massscales comparable to that of our own galaxy, and are reduced at larger masses,confirming the varying impact of stellar feedback at different mass scales. wealso check the effect of enhanced star formation events (i.e. starburstsmodes), defined in connection with galaxy mergers. we find that, in general,these episodes have a limited impact in the overall star formation histories ofmodel galaxies, even in massive dm halos where merger-driven star formation hasoften been considered very important.

1302.0288	the mass profile and accretion history of cold dark matter halos	we use the millennium simulation series to study the relation between theaccretion history (mah) and mass profile of cold dark matter halos. we findthat the mean density within the scale radius, r_{-2} (where the halo densityprofile has isothermal slope), is directly proportional to the critical densityof the universe at the time when the main progenitor's virial mass equals themass enclosed within r_{-2}. scaled to these characteristic values of mass anddensity, the mean mah, expressed in terms of the critical density of theuniverse, m(\rho_{crit}(z)), resembles that of the enclosed density profile,m(&lt;\rho &gt;), at z=0. both follow closely the nfw profile, suggesting that thesimilarity of halo mass profiles originates from the mass-independence of halomahs. support for this interpretation is provided by outlier halos whoseaccretion histories deviate from the nfw shape; their mass profiles showcorrelated deviations from nfw and are better approximated by einasto profiles.fitting both m(&lt;\rho &gt;) and m(\rho_{crit}) with either nfw or einasto profilesyield concentration and shape parameters that are correlated, confirming andextending earlier work linking the concentration of a halo with its accretionhistory. these correlations also confirm that halo structure is insensitive toinitial conditions: only halos whose accretion histories differ greatly fromthe nfw shape show noticeable deviations from nfw in their mass profiles. as aresult, the nfw profile provides acceptable fits to hot dark matter halos,which do not form hierarchically, and for fluctuation power spectra other thancdm. our findings, however, predict a subtle but systematic dependence of massprofile shape on accretion history which, if confirmed, would provide strongsupport for the link between accretion history and halo structure we proposehere.

1303.6283	galactic accretion and the outer structure of galaxies in the cdm model	we have combined the semi-analytic galaxy formation model of guo et al.(2011) with the particle-tagging technique of cooper et al. (2010) to predictgalaxy surface brightness profiles in a representative sample of ~1900 massivedark matter haloes (10^12--10^14 m_sol) from the millennium ii lambda-cdmn-body simulation. here we present our method and basic results focusing on theouter regions of galaxies, consisting of stars accreted in mergers. thesesimulations cover scales from the stellar haloes of milky way-like galaxies tothe 'cd envelopes' of groups and clusters, and resolve low surface brightnesssubstructure such as tidal streams. we find that the surface density ofaccreted stellar mass around the central galaxies of dark matter haloes is welldescribed by a sersic profile, the radial scale and amplitude of which varysystematically with halo mass (m_200). the total stellar mass surface densityprofile breaks at the radius where accreted stars start to dominate over starsformed in the galaxy itself. this break disappears with increasing m_200because accreted stars contribute more of the total mass of galaxies, and isless distinct when the same galaxies are averaged in bins of stellar mass,because of scatter in the relation between m_star and m_200. to test our modelwe have derived average stellar mass surface density profiles for massivegalaxies at z~0.08 by stacking sdss images. our model agrees well with thesestacked profiles and with other data from the literature, and makes predictionsthat can be more rigorously tested by future surveys that extend the analysisof the outer structure of galaxies to fainter isophotes. we conclude that it islikely that the outer structure of the spheroidal components of galaxies islargely determined by collisionless merging during their hierarchical assembly

1305.0560	on the stark difference in satellite distributions around the milky way  and andromeda	we compare spherically-averaged radial number counts of bright (&gt; 10^5 lsun)dwarf satellite galaxies within 400 kpc of the milky way (mw) and m31 and findthat the mw satellites are much more centrally concentrated. remarkably, thetwo satellite systems are almost identical within the central 100 kpc, whilem31 satellites outnumber mw satellites by about a factor of four at deprojecteddistances spanning 100 - 400 kpc. we compare the observed distributions tothose predicted for lcdm suhbalos using a suite of 44 high-resolution ~10^12halo zoom simulations, 22 of which are in pairs like the mw and m31. we findthat the radial distribution of satellites around m31 is fairly typical ofthose predicted for subhalos, while the milky way's distribution is morecentrally concentrated that any of our simulated lcdm halos. one possibleexplanation is that our census is bright (&gt; 10^5 lsun) mw dwarf galaxies issignificantly incomplete beyond ~ 100 kpc of the sun. if there were ~8 - 20more bright dwarfs orbiting undetected at 100 - 400 kpc, then the milky way'sradial distribution would fall within the range expected from subhalodistributions and alos look very much like the known m31 system. we use oursimulations to demonstrate that there is enough area left unexplored by thesloan digital sky survey and its extensions that the discovery of ~10 newbright dwarfs is not implausible given the expected range of angular anisotropyof subhalos in the sky.

1307.3552	a dichotomy in satellite quenching around l* galaxies	we examine the star formation properties of bright (~0.1 l*) satellitesaround isolated ~l* hosts in the local universe using spectroscopicallyconfirmed systems in the sloan digital sky survey dr7. our selection method iscarefully designed with the aid of n-body simulations to avoid groups andclusters. we find that satellites are significantly more likely to be quenchedthan a stellar mass-matched sample of isolated galaxies. remarkably, thisquenching occurs only for satellites of hosts that are themselves quenched:while star formation is unaffected in the satellites of star-forming hosts,satellites around quiescent hosts are more than twice as likely to be quenchedthan stellar-mass matched field samples. one implication of this is thatwhatever shuts down star formation in isolated, passive l* galaxies also playsat least an indirect role in quenching star formation in their brightsatellites. the previously-reported tendency for "galactic conformity" incolor/morphology may be a by-product of this host-specific quenching dichotomy.the s\'ersic indices of quenched satellites are statistically identical tothose of field galaxies with the same specific star formation rates, suggestingthat environmental and secular quenching give rise to the same morphologicalstructure. by studying the distribution of pairwise velocities between thehosts and satellites, we find dynamical evidence that passive host galaxiesreside in dark matter halos that are ~45% more massive than those ofstar-forming host galaxies of the same stellar mass. we emphasize that evenaround passive hosts, the mere fact that galaxies become satellites does nottypically result in star formation quenching: we find that only ~30% of ~0.1 l*galaxies that fall in from the field are quenched around passive hosts,compared with ~0% around star forming hosts.

1310.6746	elvis: exploring the local volume in simulations	we introduce a set of high-resolution dissipationless simulations that modelthe local group (lg) in a cosmological context: exploring the local volume insimulations (elvis). the suite contains 48 galaxy-size halos, each withinhigh-resolution volumes that span 2-5 mpc in size, and each resolving thousandsof systems with masses below the atomic cooling limit. half of the elvis galaxyhalos are in paired configurations similar to the milky way (mw) and m31; theother half are isolated, mass-matched analogs. we find no difference in theabundance or kinematics of substructure within the virial radii of isolatedversus paired hosts. on mpc scales, however, lg-like pairs average almost twiceas many companions and the velocity field is kinematically hotter and morecomplex. we present a refined abundance matching relation between stellar massand halo mass that reproduces the observed satellite stellar mass functions ofthe mw and m31 down to the regime where incompleteness is an issue, $m_\star\sim 5\times 10^5 \, m_\odot$. within a larger region spanning approximately 3mpc, the same relation predicts that there should be $\sim$ 1000 galaxies with$m_\star &gt; 10^{3}\,m_\odot$ awaiting discovery. we show that up to 50% of haloswithin 1 mpc of the mw or m31 could be systems that have previously been withinthe virial radius of either giant. by associating never-accreted halos withgas-rich dwarfs, we show that there are plausibly 50 undiscovered dwarfgalaxies with hi masses $&gt; 10^5\,m_\odot$ within the local volume. the radialvelocity distribution of these predicted gas-rich dwarfs can be used to informfollow-up searches based on ultra-compact high-velocity clouds found in thealfalfa survey.

1312.0945	the mass-concentration-redshift relation of cold dark matter halos	we use the millennium simulation series to investigate the mass and redshiftdependence of the concentration of equilibrium cold dark matter (cdm) halos. weextend earlier work on the relation between halo mass profiles and assemblyhistories to show how the latter may be used to predict concentrations forhalos of all masses and at any redshift. our results clarify the link betweenconcentration and the ``collapse redshift'' of a halo as well as whyconcentration depends on mass and redshift solely through the dimensionless``peak height'' mass parameter, $\nu(m,z)=\delta_{\rm crit}(z)/\sigma(m,z)$. wecombine these results with analytic mass accretion histories to extrapolate the$c(m,z)$ relations to mass regimes difficult to reach through directsimulation. our model predicts that, at given $z$, $c(m)$ should deviatesystematically from a simple power law at high masses, where concentrationsapproach a constant value, and at low masses, where concentrations aresubstantially lower than expected from extrapolating published empirical fits.this correction may reduce the expected self-annihilation boost factor fromsubstructure by about one order of magnitude. the model also reproduces the$c(m,z)$ dependence on cosmological parameters reported in earlier work, andthus provides a simple and robust account of the relation between cosmology andthe mass-concentration-redshift relation of cdm halos.

1402.1498	the surprising inefficiency of dwarf satellite quenching	we study dwarf satellite galaxy quenching using observations from the geha etal. (2012) nsa/sdss catalog together with lcdm cosmological simulations tofacilitate selection and interpretation. we show that fewer than 30% of dwarfs(m* ~ 10^8.5-10^9.5 msun) identified as satellites within massive host halos(mhost ~ 10^12.5-10^14 msun) are quenched, in spite of the expectation fromsimulations that half of them should have been accreted more than 6 gyr ago. weconclude that whatever the action triggering environmental quenching of dwarfsatellites, the process must be highly inefficient. we investigate a series ofsimple, one-parameter quenching models in order to understand what is requiredto explain the low quenched fraction and conclude that either the quenchingtimescale is very long (&gt; 9.5 gyr, a "slow starvation" scenario) or that theenvironmental trigger is not well matched to accretion within the virialvolume. we discuss these results in light of the fact that most of the low massdwarf satellites in the local group are quenched, a seeming contradiction thatcould point to a characteristic mass scale for satellite quenching.

1403.6469	m31 satellite masses compared to lcdm subhaloes	we compare the kinematics of m31's satellite galaxies to the mass profiles ofthe subhaloes they are expected to inhabit in lcdm. we consider the mostmassive subhaloes of an approximately m31-sized halo, following the assumptionof a monotonic galaxy luminosity-to-subhalo mass mapping. while this abundancematching relation is consistent with the kinematic data for galaxies down tothe luminosity of the bright satellites of the milky way and m31, it is notconsistent with kinematic data for fainter dwarf galaxies (those with l &lt;~ 10^8lsun). comparing the kinematics of m31's dwarf spheroidal (dsph) satellites tothe subhaloes reveals that m31's dsph satellites are too low density to beconsistent with the subhaloes' mass profiles. a similar discrepancy has beenreported between milky way dsphs and their predicted subhaloes, the "too big tofail" problem. by contrast, total mass profiles of the dwarf elliptical (andsimilarly bright) satellites are consistent with the subhaloes. however, theysuffer from large systematic uncertainties in their dark matter content becauseof substantial (and potentially dominant) contributions from baryons withintheir half-light radii.

(i) when the contribution from poorly resolved halosis subtracted out, sams tend to under-predict by ~30 per cent the mass thatcools in the infall-dominated regime. (ii) at large halo masses sams tend toover-predict cooling rates, though the numerical result may be affected by theuse of sph. (iii) as found in our previous work, cooling rates are found to besignificantly affected by model details: simulations disfavour models withlarge cores and with quenching of cooling at major mergers. (iv) when coolingis switched on at z~2, cold gas accumulates very quickly in the simulatedhalos. this accumulation is reproduced by sams with varying degrees ofaccuracy.

1404.5313	too big to fail in the local group	we compare the dynamical masses of dwarf galaxies in the local group (lg) tothe predicted masses of halos in the elvis suite of $\lambda$cdm simulations, asample of 48 galaxy-size hosts, 24 of which are in paired configuration similarto the lg. we enumerate unaccounted-for dense halos ($v_\mathrm{max} \gtrsim25$ km s$^{-1}$) in these volumes that at some point in their histories weremassive enough to have formed stars in the presence of an ionizing background($v_\mathrm{peak} &gt; 30$ km s$^{-1}$). within 300 kpc of the milky way, thenumber of unaccounted-for massive halos ranges from 2 - 25 over our fullsample. moreover, this "too big to fail" count grows as we extend ourcomparison to the outer regions of the local group: within 1.2 mpc of eithergiant we find that there are 12-40 unaccounted-for massive halos. this countexcludes volumes within 300 kpc of both the mw and m31, and thus should belargely unaffected by any baryonically-induced environmental processes.according to abundance matching -- specifically abundance matching thatreproduces the local group stellar mass function -- all of these missingmassive systems should have been quite bright, with $m_\star &gt; 10^6m_\odot$.finally, we use the predicted density structure of outer lg dark matter halostogether with observed dwarf galaxy masses to derive an$m_\star-v_\mathrm{max}$ relation for lg galaxies that are outside the virialregions of either giant. we find that there is no obvious trend in the relationover three orders of magnitude in stellar mass (a "common mass" relation), from$m_\star \sim 10^8 - 10^5 m_\odot$, in drastic conflict with the tight relationexpected for halos that are unaffected by reionization. solutions to the toobig to fail problem that rely on ram pressure stripping, tidal effects, orstatistical flukes appear less likely in the face of these results.

1405.1040	near-field limits on the role of faint galaxies in cosmic reionization	reionizing the universe with galaxies appears to require significant starformation in low-mass halos at early times, while local dwarf galaxy countstell us that star formation has been minimal in small halos around us today.using simple models and the elvis simulation suite, we show that reionizationscenarios requiring appreciable star formation in halos with $m_{\rm vir}\approx 10^{8}\,m_{\odot}$ at $z=8$ are in serious tension with galaxy countsin the local group. this tension originates from the seemingly inescapableconclusion that 30 - 60 halos with $m_{\rm vir} &gt; 10^{8}\,m_{\odot}$ at $z=8$will survive to be distinct bound satellites of the milky way at $z = 0$.reionization models requiring star formation in such halos will produce dozensof bound galaxies in the milky way's virial volume today (and 100 - 200throughout the local group), each with $\gtrsim 10^{5}\,m_{\odot}$ of old stars($\gtrsim 13$ gyr). this exceeds the stellar mass function of classical milkyway satellites today, even without allowing for the (significant)post-reionization star formation observed in these galaxies. one possibleimplication of these findings is that star formation became sharply inefficientin halos smaller than $\sim 10^9 \,m_{\odot}$ at early times, implying that thehigh-$z$ luminosity function must break at magnitudes brighter than is oftenassumed (at ${\rm m_{uv}} \approx -14$). our results suggest that jwst (andpossibly even hst with the frontier fields) may realistically detect thefaintest galaxies that drive reionization. it remains to be seen how theseresults can be reconciled with the most sophisticated simulations of earlygalaxy formation at present, which predict substantial star formation in$m_{\rm vir} \sim 10^8 \, m_{\odot}$ halos during the epoch of reionization.

1407.3276	the mass dependance of satellite quenching in milky way-like halos	using the sloan digital sky survey, we examine the quenching of satellitegalaxies around isolated milky way-like hosts in the local universe. we findthat the efficiency of satellite quenching around isolated galaxies is low androughly constant over two orders of magnitude in satellite stellar mass($m_{*}$ = $10^{8.5}-10^{10.5} \, m_{\odot}$), with only $\sim~20\%$ of systemsquenched as a result of environmental processes. while largely independent ofsatellite stellar mass, satellite quenching does exhibit clear dependence onthe properties of the host. we show that satellites of passive hosts aresubstantially more likely to be quenched than those of star-forming hosts, andwe present evidence that more massive halos quench their satellites moreefficiently. these results extend trends seen previously in more massive hosthalos and for higher satellite masses. taken together, it appears that galaxieswith stellar masses larger than about $10^{8}~m_{\odot}$ are uniformlyresistant to environmental quenching, with the relative harshness of the hostenvironment likely serving as the primary driver of satellite quenching. atlower stellar masses ($&lt; 10^{8}~m_{\odot}$), however, observations of the localgroup suggest that the vast majority of satellite galaxies are quenched,potentially pointing towards a characteristic satellite mass scale below whichquenching efficiency increases dramatically.

1503.06803	taking care of business in a flash: constraining the timescale for  low-mass satellite quenching with elvis	the vast majority of dwarf satellites orbiting the milky way and m31 arequenched, while comparable galaxies in the field are gas-rich and star-forming.assuming that this dichotomy is driven by environmental quenching, we use theelvis suite of n-body simulations to constrain the characteristic timescaleupon which satellites must quench following infall into the virial volumes oftheir hosts. the high satellite quenched fraction observed in the local groupdemands an extremely short quenching timescale (~ 2 gyr) for dwarf satellitesin the mass range mstar ~ 10^6-10^8 msun. this quenching timescale issignificantly shorter than that required to explain the quenched fraction ofmore massive satellites (~ 8 gyr), both in the local group and in more massivehost halos, suggesting a dramatic change in the dominant satellite quenchingmechanism at mstar &lt; 10^8 msun. combining our work with the results ofcomplementary analyses in the literature, we conclude that the suppression ofstar formation in massive satellites (mstar ~ 10^8 - 10^11 msun) is broadlyconsistent with being driven by starvation, such that the satellite quenchingtimescale corresponds to the cold gas depletion time. below a critical stellarmass scale of ~ 10^8 msun, however, the required quenching times are muchshorter than the expected cold gas depletion times. instead, quenching must acton a timescale comparable to the dynamical time of the host halo. we posit thatram-pressure stripping can naturally explain this behavior, with the criticalmass (of mstar ~ 10^8 msun) corresponding to halos with gravitational restoringforces that are too weak to overcome the drag force encountered when movingthrough an extended, hot circumgalactic medium.

1504.02466	sweating the small stuff: simulating dwarf galaxies, ultra-faint dwarf  galaxies, and their own tiny satellites	we present fire/gizmo hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of isolated darkmatter halos, two each at the mass of classical dwarf galaxies ($m_{\rm vir}\simeq 10^{10} m_{\odot}$) and ultra-faint galaxies ($m_{\rm vir} \simeq 10^9m_{\odot}$), and with two feedback implementations. the resultant centralgalaxies lie on an extrapolated abundance matching relation from $m_{\star}\simeq 10^6$ to $10^4 m_{\odot}$ without a break. every host is filled withsubhalos, many of which form stars. our dwarfs with $m_{\star} \simeq 10^6m_{\odot}$ each have 1-2 well-resolved satellites with $m_{\star} = 3-200\times 10^3 m_{\odot}$. even our isolated ultra-faint galaxies havestar-forming subhalos. if this is representative, dwarf galaxies throughout theuniverse should commonly host tiny satellite galaxies of their own. we combineour results with the elvis simulations to show that targeting $\sim 50~ \rmkpc$ regions around nearby isolated dwarfs could increase the chances ofdiscovering ultra-faint galaxies by $\sim 35\%$ compared to random halopointings, and specifically identify the region around the phoenix dwarf galaxyas a good potential target.  the well-resolved ultra-faint galaxies in our simulations ($m_{\star} \simeq3 - 30 \times 10^3 m_{\odot}$) form within $m_{\rm peak} \simeq 0.5 - 3 \times10^9 m_{\odot}$ halos. each has a uniformly ancient stellar population ($ &gt; 10~\rm gyr$) owing to reionization-related quenching. more massive systems, incontrast, all have late-time star formation. our results suggest that $m_{\rmhalo} \simeq 5 \times 10^9 m_{\odot}$ is a probable dividing line between haloshosting reionization "fossils" and those hosting dwarfs that can continue toform stars in isolation after reionization.

1504.06621	the local group as a time machine: studying the high-redshift universe  with nearby galaxies	we infer the uv luminosities of local group galaxies at early cosmic times($z \sim 2$ and $z \sim 7$) by combining stellar population synthesis modelingwith star formation histories derived from deep color-magnitude diagramsconstructed from hubble space telescope (hst) observations. our analysisprovides a basis for understanding high-$z$ galaxies - including those that maybe unobservable even with the james webb space telescope (jwst) - in thecontext of familiar, well-studied objects in the very low-$z$ universe. we findthat, at the epoch of reionization, all local group dwarfs were less luminousthan the faintest galaxies detectable in deep hst observations of blank fields.we predict that jwst will observe $z \sim 7$ progenitors of galaxies similar tothe large magellanic cloud today; however, the hst frontier fields initiativemay already be observing such galaxies, highlighting the power of gravitationallensing. consensus reionization models require an extrapolation of the observedblank-field luminosity function at $z \approx 7$ by at least two orders ofmagnitude in order to maintain reionization. this scenario requires theprogenitors of the fornax and sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxies to becontributors to the ionizing background at $z \sim 7$. combined with numericalsimulations, our results argue for a break in the uv luminosity function from afaint-end slope of $\alpha \sim -2$ at $m_{\rm uv} &lt; -13$ to $\alpha \sim -1.2$at lower luminosities. applied to photometric samples at lower redshifts, ouranalysis suggests that hst observations in lensing fields at $z \sim 2$ arecapable of probing galaxies with luminosities comparable to the expectedprogenitor of fornax.

1509.01250	push it to the limit: local group constraints on high-redshift stellar  mass functions for mstar &gt; 10^5 msun	we constrain the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function from 2 &lt; z &lt; 5for galaxies with stellar masses as low as 10^5 msun by combining starformation histories of milky way satellite galaxies derived from deep hubblespace telescope observations with merger trees from the elvis suite of n-bodysimulations. this approach extends our understanding more than two orders ofmagnitude lower in stellar mass than is currently possible by direct imaging.we find the faint end slopes of the mass functions to be alpha=-1.42(+0.07/-0.05) at z = 2 and alpha = -1.57^(+0.06/-0.06) at z = 5, and showthe slope only weakly evolves from z = 5 to z = 0. our findings are in starkcontrast to a number of direct detection studies that suggest slopes as steepas alpha = -1.9 at these epochs. such a steep slope would result in an order ofmagnitude too many luminous milky way satellites in a mass regime that isobservationally complete (mstar &gt; 2*10^5 msun at z = 0). the most recentstudies from zfourge and candels also suggest flatter faint end slopes that areconsistent with our results, but with a lower degree of precision. this workillustrates the strong connections between low and high-z observations whenviewed through the lens of lcdm numerical simulations.

1511.01095	the no-spin zone: rotation vs dispersion support in observed and  simulated dwarf galaxies	we perform a systematic bayesian analysis of rotation vs. dispersion support($v_{\rm rot} / \sigma$) in $40$ dwarf galaxies throughout the local volume(lv) over a stellar mass range $10^{3.5} m_{\rm \odot} &lt; m_{\star} &lt; 10^8m_{\rm \odot}$. we find that the stars in $\sim 90\%$ of the lv dwarf galaxiesstudied -- both satellites and isolated systems -- are dispersion-supported. inparticular, we show that $7/10$ *isolated* dwarfs in our sample have stellarpopulations with $v_{\rm rot} / \sigma &lt; 0.6$. all have $v_{\rm rot} / \sigma\lesssim 2$. these results challenge the traditional view that the stars ingas-rich dwarf irregulars (dirrs) are distributed in cold,rotationally-supported stellar disks, while gas-poor dwarf spheroidals (dsphs)are kinematically distinct in having dispersion-supported stars. we see noclear trend between $v_{\rm rot} / \sigma$ and distance to the closest $\rml_{\star}$ galaxy, nor between $v_{\rm rot} / \sigma$ and $m_{\star}$ withinour mass range. we apply the same bayesian analysis to four fire hydrodynamiczoom-in simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies ($10^9 m_{\odot} &lt; m_{\rm vir} &lt;10^{10} m_{\rm \odot}$) and show that the simulated *isolated* dirr galaxieshave stellar ellipticities and stellar $v_{\rm rot} / \sigma$ ratios that areconsistent with the observed population of dirrs *and* dsphs without the needto subject these dwarfs to any external perturbations or tidal forces. we positthat most dwarf galaxies form as puffy, dispersion-supported systems, ratherthan cold, angular momentum-supported disks. if this is the case, thentransforming a dirr into a dsph may require little more than removing its gas.

1512.04544	resonant sterile neutrino dark matter in the local and high-z universe	sterile neutrinos comprise an entire class of dark matter models that,depending on their production mechanism, can be hot, warm, or cold dark matter.we simulate the local group and representative volumes of the universe in avariety of sterile neutrino models, all of which are consistent with thepossible existence of a radiative decay line at ~3.5 kev. we compare models ofproduction via resonances in the presence of a lepton asymmetry (suggested byshi &amp; fuller 1999) to "thermal" models. we find that properties in the highlynonlinear regime - e.g., counts of satellites and internal properties of halosand subhalos - are insensitive to the precise fall-off in power withwavenumber, indicating that nonlinear evolution essentially washes awaydifferences in the initial (linear) matter power spectrum. in the quasi-linearregime at higher redshifts, however, quantitative differences in the 3d matterpower spectra remain, raising the possibility that such models can be testedwith future observations of the lyman-alpha forest. while many of the sterileneutrino models largely eliminate multiple small-scale issues within the colddark matter (cdm) paradigm, we show that these models may be ruled out in thenear future via discoveries of additional dwarf satellites in the local group.

1512.04548	properties of resonantly produced sterile neutrino dark matter subhalos	the anomalous 3.55 kev x-ray line recently detected towards a number ofmassive dark matter objects may be interpreted as the radiative decays of 7.1kev mass sterile neutrino dark matter. depending on its parameters, the sterileneutrino can range from cold to warm dark matter with small-scale suppressionthat differs in form from commonly-adopted thermal warm dark matter. here, wenumerically investigate the subhalo properties for 7.1 kev sterile neutrinodark matter produced via the resonant shi-fuller mechanism. using accuratematter power spectra, we run cosmological zoom-in simulations of a milkyway-sized halo and explore the abundance of massive subhalos, their radialdistributions, and their internal structure. we also simulate the halo withthermal 2.0 kev warm dark matter for comparison and discuss quantitativedifferences. we find that the resonantly produced sterile neutrino model forthe 3.55 kev line provides a good description of structures in the local group,including the number of satellite dwarf galaxies and their radial distribution,and largely mitigates the too-big-to-fail problem. future searches forsatellite galaxies by deep surveys, such as the dark energy survey, largesynoptic survey telescope, and wide field infrared survey telescope, will be astrong direct test of warm dark matter scenarios.

astro-ph;0309243	major mergers of galaxy haloes: cuspy or cored inner density profile?	we present the results from a series of collisionless n-body simulations ofmajor mergers of galaxy dark matter haloes with density profiles having eitherinner cusps or cores. our simulations range from 2x10^5 to 10^7 particles,allowing us to probe the phase-space distribution of dark matter particles inthe innermost regions (less than 0.005 virial radii) of cold dark matterhaloes, a subject of much recent debate. we find that a major merger of twocored haloes yields a cored halo and does not result in a cuspy profile seen inmany cosmological simulations. this result is unchanged if we consider mergerswith parent mass ratios of 3:1 instead of 1:1. mergers of a cuspy halo witheither a cored halo or a second cuspy halo of equal mass, on the other hand,produce cuspy haloes with a slightly reduced inner logarithmic slope. cuspyhaloes, once formed, therefore appear resilient to major mergers. we find thevelocity structure of the remnants to be mildly anisotropic, with a maxwellianvelocity distribution near the centre but not in the outer portions of thefinal haloes. violent relaxation is effective only during the early phase ofmergers, with phase mixing likely to be the dominant relaxation process at latetimes.

astro-ph;0407488	core formation in galactic nuclei due to recoiling black holes	anisotropic gravitational radiation from a coalescing black hole binary canimpart a recoil velocity of up to several hundred km/s to the remnant blackhole. we examine the effects of recoiling massive black holes on their hoststellar bulges, both for holes that escape their host and those that return tothe galactic center via dynamical friction. we show that removal of a blackhole via radiation recoil generally results in a rapidly-formed central core inthe stellar system, with the effect being largest when the hole stays bound tothe bulge and the recoil velocity is comparable to the bulge velocitydispersion. black hole recoil therefore provides a mechanism for producingcores in some early type galaxies, but it is expected to be most efficient infaint ellipticals that are known to have steep density profiles. we argue thatthese results may hint at a significant role for gas in facilitating thecoalescence of binary black holes in faint (power-law) early-type galaxies.

astro-ph;0502495	dissipationless mergers of elliptical galaxies and the evolution of the  fundamental plane	we carry out numerical simulations of dissipationless major mergers ofelliptical galaxies using initial galaxy models that consist of a dark matterhalo and a stellar bulge with properties consistent with the observedfundamental plane. by varying the density profile of the dark matter halo(standard nfw versus adiabatically contracted nfw), the global stellar to darkmatter mass ratio, and the orbit of the merging galaxies, we are able to assessthe impact of each of these factors on the structure of the merger remnant. ourresults indicate that the properties of the remnant bulge depend primarily onthe angular momentum and energy of the orbit; for a cosmologically motivatedorbit, the effective radius and velocity dispersion of the remnant bulge remainapproximately on the fundamental plane. this indicates that the observedproperties of elliptical galaxies are consistent with significant growth vialate dissipationless mergers. we also find that the dark matter fraction withinthe effective radius of our remnants increases after the merger, consistentwith the hypothesis that the tilt of the fundamental plane from the virialtheorem is due to a varying dark matter fraction as a function of galaxy mass.

astro-ph;0601400	red mergers and the assembly of massive elliptical galaxies: the  fundamental plane and its projections	several recent observations suggest that gas-poor (dissipationless) mergersof elliptical galaxies contribute significantly to the build-up of the massiveend of the red sequence. we perform a series of major merger simulations toinvestigate the spatial and velocity structure of the remnants of such mergers.regardless of orbital energy or angular momentum, we find that the stellarremnants lie on the fundamental plane defined by their progenitors, a result ofvirial equilibrium with a small tilt due to an increasing central dark matterfraction. however, the locations of merger remnants in the projections of thefundamental plane -- the faber-jackson and r_e-m_* relations -- depend stronglyon the merger orbit, and the relations steepen significantly from the canonicalscalings (l sigma^4 and r_e m_*^0.6) for mergers on radial orbits. our resultsimply that the projections of the fundamental plane -- but not necessarily theplane itself -- provide a powerful way of investigating the assembly history ofmassive elliptical galaxies, including the brightest cluster galaxies at ornear the centers of galaxy clusters. we argue that most massive ellipticals areformed by anisotropic merging and that their fundamental plane projectionsshould thus differ noticeably from those of lower mass ellipticals even thoughthey should lie on the same fundamental plane. current observations areconsistent with this conclusion. the steepening in the l-sigma relation forluminous ellipticals may also be reflected in a corresponding steepening in them_bh-sigma relation for massive black holes.

astro-ph;0608122	satellite accretion onto massive galaxies with central black holes	minor mergers of galaxies are expected to be common in a hierarchicalcosmology such as $\lambda$cdm and have the potential to significantly affectgalactic structure. in this paper we dissect the case-by-case outcome from aset of numerical simulations of a single satellite elliptical galaxy accretingonto a massive elliptical galaxy. we take care to explore cosmologicallyrelevant orbital parameters and to set up realistic initial galaxy models thatinclude all three relevant dynamical components: dark matter halos, stellarbulges, and central massive black holes. the effects of several differentparameters are considered, including orbital energy and angular momentum,satellite density and inner density profile, satellite-to-host mass ratio, andpresence of a black hole at the center of the host. black holes play a crucialrole in protecting the shallow stellar cores of the hosts, as satellitesmerging onto a host with a central black hole are more strongly disrupted thanthose merging onto hosts without black holes. orbital parameters play animportant role in determining the degree of disruption: satellites on lessbound or more eccentric orbits are more easily destroyed than those on morebound or more circular orbits as a result of an increased number of pericentricpassages and greater cumulative effects of gravitational shocking and tidalstripping. in addition, satellites with densities typical of faint ellipticalgalaxies are disrupted relatively easily, while denser satellites can survivemuch better in the tidal field of the host. over the range of parametersexplored, we find that the accretion of a single satellite elliptical galaxycan result in a broad variety of changes, in both signs, in the surfacebrightness profile and color of the central part of an elliptical galaxy.
