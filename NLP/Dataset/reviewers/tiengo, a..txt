0901.2241	from outburst to quiescence: the decay of the transient anomalous x-ray  pulsar xte j1810-197	xte j1810-197 is the first transient anomalous x-ray pulsar ever discovered.its highly variable x-ray flux allowed us to study the timing and spectralemission properties of a magnetar candidate over a flux range of about twoorders of magnitude. we analyzed nine xmm-newton observations of xte j1810-197collected over a four years baseline (september 2003 - september 2007). epic pnand mos data were reduced and used for detailed timing and spectral analysis.pulse phase spectroscopic studies were also carried out for observations withsufficiently high signal to noise. we find that: (i) a three blackbodies modelreproduces the spectral properties of the source over the entire outburststatistically better than the two blackbodies model previously used in theliterature, (ii) the coldest blackbody is consistent with the thermal emissionfrom the whole surface, and has temperature and radius similar to thoseinferred from rosat observations before the outburst onset, (iii) there is aspectral feature around 1.1 kev during six consecutive observations (sincemarch 2005); if due to proton resonant cyclotron scattering, it would imply amagnetic field of around 2e14 g. this is in a very good agreement with thevalue from the spin period measurements.

0901.3453	suzaku observation of the new soft gamma repeater sgr 0501+4516 in  outburst	we present the first suzaku observation of the new soft gamma repeater sgr0501+4516, performed on 2008 august 26, four days after the onset of burstingactivity of this new member of the magnetar family. the soft x-ray persistentemission was detected with the x-ray imaging spectrometer (xis) at a 0.5-10 kevflux of 3.8e-11 erg/s/cm2, with a spectrum well fitted by an absorbed blackbodyplus power-law model. the source pulsation was confirmed at a period of5.762072+/-0.000002 s, and 32 x-ray bursts were detected by the xis, four ofwhich were also detected at higher energies by the hard x-ray detector (hxd).the strongest burst, which occurred at 03:16:16.9 (utc), was so bright that itcaused instrumental saturation, but its precursor phase, lasting for about 200ms, was detected successfully over the 0.5-200 kev range, with a fluence of~2.1e-7 erg/cm2 and a peak intensity of about 89 crab. the entire burst fluenceis estimated to be ~50 times higher. the precursor spectrum was very hard, andwell modeled by a combination of two blackbodies. we discuss the burstingactivity and x/gamma-ray properties of this newly discovered soft gammarepeater in comparison with other members of the class.

0907.2873	spin-down rate and inferred dipole magnetic field of the soft gamma-ray  repeater sgr 1627-41	using chandra data taken on 2008 june, we detected pulsations at 2.59439(4) sin the soft gamma-ray repeater sgr 1627-41. this is the second measurement ofthe source spin period and allows us to derive for the first time a long-termspin-down rate of (1.9 +/- 0.4)e-11 s/s. from this value we infer for sgr1627-41 a characteristic age of 2.2 kyr, a spin-down luminosity of 4e+34 erg/s(one of the highest among sources of the same class), and a surface dipolemagnetic field strength of 2e+14 g. these properties confirm the magnetarnature of sgr 1627-41; however, they should be considered with caution sincethey were derived on the basis of a period derivative measurement made usingtwo epochs only and magnetar spin-down rates are generally highly variable. thepulse profile, double-peaked and with a pulsed fraction of (13 +/- 2)% in the2-10 kev range, closely resembles that observed by xmm-newton in 2008september. having for the first time a timing model for this sgr, we alsosearched for a pulsed signal in archival radio data collected with the parkesradio telescope nine months after the previous x-ray outburst. no evidence forradio pulsations was found, down to a luminosity level 10-20 times fainter (fora 10% duty cycle and a distance of 11 kpc) than the peak luminosity shown bythe known radio magnetars.

0907.4239	xmm-newton observation of the persistent be/ns x-ray binary pulsar rx  j1037.5-5647 in a low luminosity state	the spectra of several x-ray binary pulsars display a clear soft excess,which in most cases can be described with a blackbody model, above the mainpower-law component. while in the high-luminosity sources it is usuallycharacterized by low temperature (kt &lt; 0.5 kev) and large emission radius (r &gt;100 km), in the two persistent and low-luminosity pulsars 4u 0352+309 and rxj0146.9+6121 this component has a high temperature (kt &gt; 1 kev) and a smallerradius (r &lt; 0.5 km), consistent with the estimated size of the neutron-starpolar cap. here we report on the timing and spectral analysis of rxj1037.5-5647, another low-luminosity persistent be binary pulsar, based on thefirst xmm-newton observation of this source. we have found a best-fit period p= 853.4(+/-0.2) s, that implies an average pulsar spin-up dp/dt ~ -2e-8 s/s inthe latest decade. the estimated source luminosity is lx ~ 10^34 erg/s, a valuecomparable to that of the other persistent be binary pulsars and about oneorder of magnitude lower than in most of the previous measurements. the sourcespectrum can be described with a power law plus blackbody model, with ktbb =1.26(+0.16/-0.09) kev and rbb = 128(+13/-21) m, suggesting a polar-cap originof this component. these results strengthen the hypothesis that, in addition tolow luminosities and long periods, this class of sources is characterized alsoby common spectral properties

0907.4616	quiet but still bright: xmm-newton observations of the soft gamma-ray  repeater sgr 0526-66	sgr 0526-66 was the first soft gamma-ray repeater (sgr) from which a giantflare was detected in march 1979, suggesting the existence of magnetars, i.e.neutron stars powered by the decay of their extremely strong magnetic field.since then, very little information has been obtained on this object, mainlybecause it has been burst-inactive since 1983 and the study of its persistentx-ray emission has been hampered by its large distance and its location in ax-ray bright supernova remnant in the large magellanic cloud. here we report ona comprehensive analysis of all the available xmm-newton observations of sgr0526-66. in particular, thanks to a deep observation taken in 2007, we measuredits pulsation period (p = 8.0544 +/- 0.0002 s) 6 years after its latestdetection by chandra. this allowed us to detect for the first time asignificant reduction of its spin-down rate. from a comparison with two shorterxmm-newton observations performed in 2000 and 2001, we found no significantchanges in the spectrum, which is well modelled by an absorbed power-law withnh = 4.6e+21 cm^-2 and photon index = 3.27. the high luminosity (about 4e+35erg/s, in the 1-10 kev energy band) still observed about 25 years after thelatest detection of bursting activity places sgr 0526-66 in the group of brightand persistent magnetar candidates.

0911.1659	xmm-newton and swift observations prove grb 090709a to be a distant,  standard, long grb	grb 090709a is a long gamma-ray burst (grb) discovered by swift, featuring abright x-ray afterglow as well as a faint infrared transient with very red andpeculiar colors. the burst attracted a large interest because of a possiblequasi-periodicity at p=8.1 s in the prompt emission, suggesting that it couldhave a different origin with respect to standard, long grbs. in order tounderstand the nature of this burst, we obtained a target of opportunityobservation with xmm-newton. x-ray spectroscopy, based on xmm-newton and swiftdata, allowed us to model the significant excess in photoelectric absorptionwith respect to the galactic value as due to a large column density (about6.5e+22 cm^-2) in the grb host, located at z=4.2. such a picture is alsoconsistent with the infrared transient's properties. re-analysis of the promptemission, based on integral and on swift data, excludes any significantmodulation at p=8.1 s. thus, we conclude that grb 090709a is a distant,standard, long grb.

0911.3064	the dust-scattering x-ray rings of the anomalous x-ray pulsar 1e  1547.0-5408	on 2009 january 22 numerous strong bursts were detected from the anomalousx-ray pulsar 1e 1547.0-5408. swift/xrt and xmm-newton/epic observations carriedout in the following two weeks led to the discovery of three x-ray ringscentered on this source. the ring radii increased with time following theexpansion law expected for a short impulse of x-rays scattered by three dustclouds. assuming different models for the dust composition and grain sizedistribution, we fit the intensity decay of each ring as a function of time atdifferent energies, obtaining tight constrains on the distance of the x-raysource. although the distance strongly depends on the adopted dust model, wefind that some models are incompatible with our x-ray data, restricting to 4-8kpc the range of possible distances for 1e 1547.0-5408. the best-fitting dustmodel provides a source distance of 3.91 +/- 0.07 kpc, which is compatible withthe proposed association with the supernova remnant g 327.24-0.13, and impliesdistances of 2.2 kpc, 2.6 kpc and 3.4 kpc for the dust clouds, in goodagreement with the dust distribution inferred by co line observations towards1e 1547.0-5408. however, dust distances in agreement with co data are alsoobtained for a set of similarly well-fitting models that imply a sourcedistance of about 5 kpc. a distance of about 4-5 kpc is also favored by thefact that these dust models are already known to provide good fits to thedust-scattering halos of bright x-ray binaries.

1112.4602	a time-variable, phase-dependent emission line in the x-ray spectrum of  the isolated neutron star rx j0822-4300	rx j0822-4300 is the central compact object associated with the puppis asupernova remnant. previous x-ray observations suggested rx j0822-4300 to be ayoung neutron star with a weak dipole field and a peculiar surface temperaturedistribution dominated by two antipodal spots with different temperatures andsizes. an emission line at 0.8 kev was also detected. we performed a very deep(130 ks) observation with xmm-newton, which allowed us to study in detail thephase-resolved properties of rx j0822-4300. our new data confirm the existenceof a narrow spectral feature, best modelled as an emission line, only seen inthe `soft' phase interval - when the cooler region is best aligned to the lineof sight. surprisingly, comparison of our recent observations to the older onesyields evidence for a variation in the emission line component, which can bemodelled as a decrease in the central energy from ~0.80 kev in 2001 to ~0.73kev in 2009--2010. the line could be generated via cyclotron scattering ofthermal photons in an optically thin layer of gas, or - alternatively - itcould originate in low-rate accretion by a debris disk. in any case, avariation in energy, pointing to a variation of the magnetic field in the lineemitting region, cannot be easily accounted for.

1112.5341	xmm-newton observation of the persistent be/ns x-ray binary pulsar rx  j0440.9+4431	many x-ray accreting pulsars have a soft excess below 10 kev. this featurehas been detected also in faint sources and at low luminosity levels,suggesting that it is an ubiquitous phenomenon. in the case of the highluminosity pulsars (lx &gt; 10^36 erg/s), the fit of this component with thermalemission models usually provides low temperatures (kt &lt; 0.5 kev) and largeemission regions (r &gt; a few hundred km); for this reason, it is referred to asa `soft' excess. on the other hand, we recently found that in persistent,low-luminosity (lx ~ 10^34 erg/s) and long-period (p &gt; 100 s) be accretingpulsars the observed excess can be modeled with a rather hot (kt &gt; 1 kev)blackbody component of small area (r &lt; 0.5 km), which can be interpreted asemission from the ns polar caps. in this paper we present the results of arecent xmm-newton observation of the galactic be pulsar rx j0440.9+4431, whichis a poorly studied member of this class of sources. we have found a best-fitperiod p = 204.96(+/-0.02) s, which implies an average pulsar spin-down duringthe last 13 years, with dp/dt ~ 6x10^(-9) s/s. the estimated source luminosityis lx ~ 8x10^(34) erg/s: this value is higher by a factor &lt; 10 compared tothose obtained in the first source observations, but almost two orders ofmagnitude lower than those measured during a few outbursts detected in thelatest years. the source spectrum can be described with a power law plusblackbody model, with ktbb = 1.34(+/-0.04) kev and rbb = 273(+/-16) m,suggesting a polar-cap origin of this component. our results support theclassification of rx j0440.9+4431 as a persistent be/ns pulsar, and confirmthat the hot blackbody spectral component is a common property of this class ofsources.

1203.6449	a new low magnetic field magnetar: the 2011 outburst of swift  j1822.3-1606	we report on the long term x-ray monitoring with swift, rxte, suzaku, chandraand xmm-newton of the outburst of the newly discovered magnetar swiftj1822.3-1606 (sgr 1822-1606), from the first observations soon after thedetection of the short x-ray bursts which led to its discovery, through thefirst stages of its outburst decay (covering the time-span from july 2011,until end of april 2012). we also report on archival rosat observations whichwitnessed the source during its likely quiescent state, and on upper limits onswift j1822.3-1606's radio-pulsed and optical emission during outburst, withthe green bank telescope (gbt) and the gran telescopio canarias (gtc),respectively. our x-ray timing analysis finds the source rotating with a periodof p=8.43772016(2) s and a period derivative \dot{p}=8.3(2)x10^{-14} s s^{-1} ,which entails an inferred dipolar surface magnetic field of b~2.7x10^{13} g atthe equator. this measurement makes swift j1822.3-1606 the second lowestmagnetic field magnetar (after sgr 0418+5729; rea et al. 2010). following theflux and spectral evolution from the beginning of the outburst, we find thatthe flux decreased by about an order of magnitude, with a subtle softening ofthe spectrum, both typical of the outburst decay of magnetars. by modeling thesecular thermal evolution of swift j1822.3-1606, we find that the observedtiming properties of the source, as well as its quiescent x-ray luminosity, canbe reproduced if it was born with a poloidal and crustal toroidal fields ofb_{p}~1.5x10^{14} g and b_{tor}~7x10^{14} g, respectively, and if its currentage is ~550 kyr.

1206.6614	optical and x-ray observations of candidate isolated neutron stars in  the g315.4-2.3 snr	g315.4-2.3 is a young galactic supernova remnant (snr), whose identificationas the remains of a type-ii supernova (sn) explosion has been debated for along time. in particular, recent multi-wavelength observations suggest that itis the result of a type ia sn, based on spectroscopy of the snr shell and thelack of a compact stellar remnant.however, two x-ray sources, one detected byeinstein and rosat (source v) and the other by chandra (source n) have beenproposed as possible isolated neutron star candidates. in both cases, no clearoptical identification was available and, therefore, we performed an opticaland x-ray study to determine the nature of these two sources. based on chandraastrometry, source v is associated with a bright v~14 star, which had beensuggested based on the less accurate rosat position. similarly, from vltarchival observations, we found that source n is associated with a relativelybright star ($v=20.14 $). these likely identifications suggest that both x-raysources cannot be isolated neutron stars.

1208.0231	the xmm-newton survey of the small magellanic cloud	although numerous archival xmm-newton observations existed towards the smallmagellanic cloud (smc) before 2009, only a fraction of the whole galaxy wascovered. between may 2009 and march 2010 we carried out an xmm-newton survey ofthe smc, in order to obtain a complete overage of both its bar and wing.thirty-three observations of 30 different fields with a total exposure of aboutne ms filled the missing parts. we systematically processed all available smcdata from the european photon imaging camera. after rejecting observations withvery high background we included 53 archival and the 33 survey observations. weproduced images in five different energy bands. we applied astrometricboresight corrections using secure identifications of x-ray sources and combineall the images to produce a mosaic, which covers the main body of the smc. wepresent an overview of the xmm-newton observations, describe their analysis andsummarise first results which will be presented in follow-up papers in detail.here, we mainly focus on extended x-ray sources like supernova remnants (snrs)and clusters of galaxies which are seen in our x-ray images. the xmm-newtonsurvey represents the deepest complete survey of the smc in the 0.15-12.0 kevx-ray band. we propose three new snrs with low surface brightness of a few10^-14 erg s^-1 cm^-2 arcmin^-2 and large extent. also several known remnantsappear larger than previously measured from x-rays or other wavelengthsextending the size distribution of smc snrs to larger values.

1303.5579	the outburst decay of the low magnetic field magnetar sgr 0418+5729	we report on the long term x-ray monitoring of the outburst decay of the lowmagnetic field magnetar sgr 0418+5729, using all the available x-ray dataobtained with rxte, swift, chandra, and xmm-newton observations, from thediscovery of the source in june 2009, up to august 2012. the timing analysisallowed us to obtain the first measurement of the period derivative of sgr0418+5729: \dot{p}=4(1)x10^{-15} s/s, significant at ~3.5 sigma confidencelevel. this leads to a surface dipolar magnetic field of b_dip ~6x 10^{12} g.this measurement confirms sgr 0418+5729 as the lowest magnetic field magnetar.following the flux and spectral evolution from the beginning of the outburst upto ~1200 days, we observe a gradual cooling of the tiny hot spot responsiblefor the x-ray emission, from a temperature of ~0.9 to 0.3 kev. simultaneously,the x-ray flux decreased by about 3 orders of magnitude: from about1.4x10^{-11} to 1.2x10^{-14} erg/s/cm^2 . deep radio, millimeter, optical andgamma-ray observations did not detect the source counterpart, implyingstringent limits on its multi-band emission, as well as constraints on thepresence of a fossil disk. by modeling the magneto-thermal secular evolution ofsgr 0418+5729, we infer a realistic age of ~550 kyr, and a dipolar magneticfield at birth of ~10^{14} g. the outburst characteristics suggest the presenceof a thin twisted bundle with a small heated spot at its base. the bundleuntwisted in the first few months following the outburst, while the hot spotdecreases in temperature and size. we estimate the outburst rate of lowmagnetic field magnetars to be about one per year per galaxy, and we brieflydiscuss the consequences of such result in several other astrophysicalcontexts.

1304.1653	x-ray emission from the luminous o-type subdwarf hd 49798 and its  compact companion	the x-ray source rx j0648.0-4418 is the only confirmed binary system in whicha compact object, most likely a massive white dwarf, accretes from a hotsubdwarf companion, the bright sdo star hd 49798. the x-ray emission from thissystem is characterized by two periodic modulations caused by an eclipse, atthe orbital period of 1.55 d, and by the rotation of the compact object with aspin period of 13.2 s. in 2011 we obtained six short xmm-newton observationscentered at orbital phase 0.75, in order to study the system during theeclipse, and spaced at increasingly long time intervals in order to obtain anaccurate measure of the spin-period evolution through phase-connected timing.the duration of the eclipse ingress and egress, 500 s, indicates the presenceof an x-ray emitting region with dimensions of the order of a few 10^4 km,surrounding the pulsar and probably due to scattering in the companion's wind.we derived an upper limit on the spin-period derivative |pdot|&lt;6x10^-15 s/s,more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the previously available value.significant x-ray emission is detected also during the 1.2 hours-long eclipse,with a luminosity of about 3x10^30 erg/s. the eclipse spectrum shows prominentemission lines of h- and he-like nitrogen, an overabundant element in hd 49798.these findings support the suggestion that the x-ray emission observed duringthe eclipse originates in hd 49798 and that the processes responsible for x-rayemission in the stellar winds of massive o stars are also at work in the muchweaker winds of hot subdwarfs.

1404.4446	constraints on the winds of hot subdwarf stars from x-ray observations  of two sdb binaries with compact companions: cd -30 11223 and pg 1232-136	little observational data are available on the weak stellar winds of hotsubdwarf stars of b spectral type (sdb). close binary systems composed of ansdb star and a compact object (white dwarf, neutron star or black hole) couldbe detected as accretion-powered x-ray sources. the study of their x-rayemission can probe the properties of line-driven winds of sdb stars that cannot be derived directly from spectroscopy because of the low luminosity ofthese stars. here we report on the first sensitive x-ray observations of twosdb binaries with compact companions. cd -30 11223 is the sdb binary with theshortest known orbital period (1.2 h) and its companion is certainly a whitedwarf. pg 1232-136 is an sdb binary considered the best candidate to host ablack hole companion. we observed these stars with xmm-newton in august 2013for 50 ks and in july 2009 for 36 ks, respectively. none of them was detectedand we derived luminosity upper limits of about 1.5x10^29 erg/s for cd -3011223 5x10^29 erg/s for pg 1232-136. the corresponding mass loss rate for pg1232-136 is poorly constrained, owing to the unknown efficiency for black holeaccretion. on the other hand, in the case of cd -30 11223 we could derive,under reasonable assumptions, an upper limit of about 3x10^-13 solar masses/yron the wind mass loss rate from the sdb star. this is one of the fewobservational constraints on the weak winds expected in this class of low masshot stars. we also report the results on the x-ray emission from a cluster ofgalaxies serendipitously discovered in the field of cd -30 11223.

1502.04717	giant outburst from the supergiant fast x-ray transient igr j17544-2619:  accretion from a transient disc?	supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxts) are high mass x-ray binariesassociated with ob supergiant companions and characterised by an x-ray flaringbehaviour whose dynamical range reaches 5 orders of magnitude on timescales ofa few hundred to thousands of seconds. current investigations concentrate onfinding possible mechanisms to inhibit accretion in sfxts and explain theirunusually low average x-ray luminosity. we present the swift observations of anexceptionally bright outburst displayed by the sfxt igr j17544-2619 on 2014october 10 when the source achieved a peak luminosity of $3\times10^{38}$ ergs$^{-1}$. this extends the total source dynamic range to $\gtrsim$10$^6$, thelargest (by a factor of 10) recorded so far from an sfxt. tentative evidencefor pulsations at a period of 11.6 s is also reported. we show that theseobservations challenge, for the first time, the maximum theoretical luminosityachievable by an sfxt and propose that this giant outburst was due to theformation of a transient accretion disc around the compact object.

1509.02385	a magnetic diverter for charged particle background rejection in the  simbol-x telescope	minimization of charged particle background in x-ray telescopes is a wellknown issue. charged particles (chiefly protons and electrons) naturallypresent in the cosmic environment constitute an important background sourcewhen they collide with the x-ray detector. even worse, a serious degradation ofspectroscopic performances of the x-ray detector was observed in chandra andnewton-xmm, caused by soft protons with kinetic energies ranging between 100kev and some mev being collected by the grazing-incidence mirrors and funneledto the detector. for a focusing telescope like simbol-x, the exposure of thesoft x-ray detector to the proton flux can increase significantly theinstrumental background, with a consequent loss of sensitivity. in the worstcase, it can also seriously compromise the detector duration. a well-knowncountermeasure that can be adopted is the implementation of a properly-designedmagnetic diverter, that should prevent high-energy particles from reaching thefocal plane instruments of simbol-x. although newton-xmm and swift-xrt areequipped with magnetic diverters for electrons, the magnetic fields used areinsufficient to effectively act on protons. in this paper, we simulate thebehavior of a magnetic diverter for simbol-x, consisting ofcommercially-available permanent magnets. the effects of simbol-x optics issimulated through geant4 libraries, whereas the effect of the intense requiredmagnetic fields is simulated along with specifically-written numerical codes inidl.

1512.00467	extras discovery of an 1.2-s x-ray pulsar in m 31	during a search for coherent signals in the x-ray archival data ofxmm-newton, we discovered a modulation at 1.2 s in 3xmm j004301.4+413017 (3xj0043), a source lying in the direction of an external arm of m 31. this shortperiod indicates a neutron star (ns). between 2000 and 2013, the position of 3xj0043 was imaged by public xmm-newton observations 35 times. the analysis ofthese data allowed us to detect an orbital modulation at 1.27 d and study thelong-term properties of the source. the emission of the pulsar was rather hard(most spectra are described by a power law with $\gamma &lt; 1$) and, assuming thedistance to m 31, the 0.3-10 kev luminosity was variable, from$\sim$$3\times10^{37}$ to $2\times10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. the analysis ofoptical data shows that, while 3x j0043 is likely associated to a globularcluster in m 31, a counterpart with $v\gtrsim22$ outside the cluster cannot beexcluded. considering our findings, there are two main viable scenarios for 3xj0043: a peculiar low-mass x-ray binary, similar to 4u 1822-37 or 4u 1626-67,or an intermediate-mass x-ray binary resembling her x-1. regardless of theexact nature of the system, 3x j0043 is the first accreting ns in m 31 in whichthe spin period has been detected.

1512.03241	long term study of the double pulsar j0737-3039 with xmm-newton: pulsar  timing	the relativistic double neutron star binary psr j0737-3039 shows clearevidence of orbital phase-dependent wind-companion interaction, both in radioand x-rays. in this paper we present the results of timing analysis of psrj0737-3039 performed during 2006 and 2011 xmm-newton large programs thatcollected ~20,000 x-ray counts from the system. we detected pulsations from psrj0737-3039a (psr a) through the most accurate timing measurement obtained byxmm-newton so far, the spin period error being of 2x10^-13 s. psr a's pulseprofile in x-rays is very stable despite significant relativistic spinprecession that occurred within the time span of observations. this yields aconstraint on the misalignment between the spin axis and the orbital momentumaxis delta_a ~6.6^{+1.3}_{-5.4} deg, consistent with estimates based on radiodata. we confirmed pulsed emission from psr j0737-3039b (psr b) in x-rays evenafter its disappearance in radio. the unusual phenomenology of psr b's x-rayemission includes orbital pulsed flux and profile variations as well as a lossof pulsar phase coherence on time scales of years. we hypothesize that this isdue to the interaction of psr a's wind with psr b's magnetosphere andorbital-dependent penetration of the wind plasma onto psr b closed field lines.finally, the analysis of the full xmm-newton dataset provided evidences oforbital flux variability (~7%) for the first time, involving a bow-shockscenario between psr a's wind and psr b's magnetosphere.

astro-ph;0010367	the first xmm-newton spectrum of a high redshift quasar - pks 0537-286	we present xmm-newton observations of the high redshift z=3.104, radio-loudquasar pks 0537-286. the epic ccd cameras provide the highest signal-to-noisespectrum of a high-z quasar to date. the epic observations show that pks0537-286 is extremely x-ray luminous (lx=2x10^47 erg/s), with an unusually hardx-ray spectrum (gamma=1.27+/-0.02). the flat power-law emission extends overthe whole observed energy range; there is no evidence of intrinsic absorption,which has been claimed in pks 0537-286 and other high z quasars.  however, there is evidence for weak compton reflection. a redshifted iron kline, observed at 1.5 kev - corresponding to 6.15 kev in the quasar rest frame- is detected at 95% confidence. if confirmed, this is the most distant iron kline known. the line equivalent width is small (33ev), consistent with the`x-ray baldwin effect' observed in other luminous quasars. the reflectedcontinuum is also weak (r=0.25). we find the overall spectral energydistribution of pks 0537-286 is dominated by the x-ray emission, which,together with the flat power-law and weak reflection features, suggests thatthe x-radiation from pks 0537-286 is dominated by inverse compton emissionassociated with a face-on relativistic jet.

astro-ph;0304477	integral and xmm-newton observations of the weak grb 030227	we present integral and xmm-newton observations of the prompt gamma-rayemission and the x-ray afterglow of grb030227, the first grb for which thequick localization obtained with the integral burst alert system (ibas) has ledto the discovery of x-ray and optical afterglows. grb030227 had a duration ofabout 20 s and a peak flux of 1.1 photons cm^-2 s^-1 in the 20-200 kev energyrange. the time averaged spectrum can be fit by a single power law with photonindex about 2 and we find some evidence for a hard to soft spectral evolution.the x-ray afterglow has been detected starting only 8 hours after the promptemission, with a 0.2-10 kev flux decreasing as t^-1 from 1.3x10e-12 to 5x10e-13erg cm^-2 s^-1. the afterglow spectrum is well described by a power law withphoton index 1.94+/-0.05 modified by a redshifted neutral absorber with columndensity of several 10e22 cm^-2. a possible emission line at 1.67 kev could bedue to fe for a redshift z=3, consistent with the value inferred from theabsorption.

astro-ph;0502417	a xmm-newton view of the soft gamma-ray repeater sgr 1806--20: long term  variability in the pre-super giant flare epoch	the low energy (&lt;10 kev) x-ray emission of the soft gamma-ray repeatersgr1806-20 has been studied by means of four xmm-newton observations carriedout in the last two years, the latter performed in response to a strongsequence of hard x-ray bursts observed on 2004 october 5. the source was caughtin different states of activity: over the 2003-2004 period the 2-10 kev fluxdoubled with respect to the historical level observed previously. the long termraise in luminosity was accompanied by a gradual hardening of the spectrum,with the power law photon index decreasing from 2.2 to 1.5, and by a growth ofthe bursting activity. the pulse period measurements obtained in the fourobservations are consistent with an average spin-down rate of 5.5x10e-10 s/s,higher than the values observed in the previous years. the long-term behaviorof sgr1806-20 exhibits the correlation between spectral hardness and spin-downrate previously found only by comparing the properties of different sources(both sgrs and anomalous x-ray pulsars). the best quality spectrum (obtained on6 september 2004) cannot be fitted by a single power law, but it requires anadditional blackbody component (kt=0.79 kev, r_bb = 1.9 (d/15 kpc)^2 km),similar to the spectra observed in other sgrs and in anomalous x-ray pulsars.no spectral lines were found in the persistent emission, with equivalent widthupper limits in the range 30-110 ev. marginal evidence for an absorptionfeature at 4.2 kev is present in the cumulative spectrum of 69 bursts detectedin september-october 2004.

astro-ph;0503390	three xmm-newton observations of the anomalous x-ray pulsar 1e  1048.1-5937: long term variations in spectrum and pulsed fraction	we report the results of a recent (july 2004) xmm-newton target ofopportunity observation of the anomalous x-ray pulsar 1e 1048.1-5937, togetherwith a detailed re-analysis of previous observations carried out in 2000 and2003. in july 2004 the source had a 2-10 kev flux of 6.2$\times10^{-12}$ ergcm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and a pulsed fraction p$_f$=0.68. the comparison of thethree data sets shows the presence of an anti-correlation between flux andpulsed fraction, implying that previous estimates of the source energeticsbased on the assumption of a large and constant pulsed fraction might besignificantly underestimated. the source spectrum is well described by a powerlaw plus blackbody model (kt~0.63 kev, photon index $\gamma$~2.7-3.5) or,alternatively, by the sum of two blackbodies of which the hotter is comptonizedby relativistic electrons. in this case the temperatures are kt${_1}$~0.2-0.3kev and kt${_2}$~0.4-0.5 kev and the emitting area of the cooler component isconsistent with the whole neutron star surface. the long term luminosityvariation of a factor &gt;~2 is accompanied by relatively small variations in thespectral shape. phase resolved spectroscopy indicates a harder spectrum incorrespondence of the pulse maximum. no spectral features have been detectedwith 4$\sigma$ limits on the equivalent width in the range ~10-220 ev,depending on line energy and width.
