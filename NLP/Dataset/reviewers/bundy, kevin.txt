0902.1188	the greater impact of mergers on the growth of massive galaxies:  implications for mass assembly and evolution since z~1	using deep infrared observations conducted with the moircs on the subarutelescope in goods-n combined with public surveys in goods-s, we investigatethe dependence on stellar mass, m_*, and galaxy type of the close pair fraction(5 kpc &lt; r &lt; 20 kpc) and implied merger rate. in common with some recentstudies we find that the fraction of paired systems that could result in majormergers is low (~4%) and does not increase significantly with redshift toz~1.2, with (1+z)^{1.6 \pm 1.6}. our key finding is that massive galaxies withm_* &gt; 1e11 msun are more likely to host merging companions than less massivesystems (m_* ~ 1e10 msun). we find evidence for a higher pair fraction for red,spheroidal hosts compared to blue, late-type systems, in line with expectationsbased on clustering at small scales. so-called "dry" mergers between early-typegalaxies represent nearly 50% of close pairs with m_* &gt; 3e10 msun at z~0.5, butless than 30% at z~1. this result can be explained by the increasing abundanceof red, early-type galaxies at these masses. we compare the volumetric mergerrate of galaxies with different masses to mass-dependent trends in galaxyevolution, finding that major mergers cannot fully account for the formation ofspheroidal galaxies since z~1. in terms of mass assembly, major mergerscontribute little to galaxy growth below m_* ~ 3e10 msun but are moresignificant among galaxies with m_* &gt; 1e11 msun, 30% of which have undergonemostly dry mergers over the observed redshift range. overall, the relativelymore rapid coalescence of high mass galaxies mirrors the expected hierarchicalgrowth of halos and is consistent with recent model predictions, even if thedownsizing of star formation and morphological evolution involves additionalphysical processes.

0902.2907	the evolutionary history of lyman break galaxies between redshift 4 and  6: observing successive generations of massive galaxies in formation	we present new measurements of the evolution in the lyman break galaxy (lbg)population between z~4 and z~6. by utilizing the extensive multiwavelengthdatasets available in the goods fields, we identify 2443 b, 506 v, and 137i'-band dropout galaxies likely to be at z~4, 5, and 6. with the goal ofunderstanding the duration of typical star formation episodes in galaxies atz&gt;4, we examine the distribution of stellar masses and ages as a function ofcosmic time. we find that at a fixed rest-uv luminosity, the average stellarmasses and ages of galaxies do not increase significantly between z~6 and 4. inorder to maintain this near equilibrium in the average properties of highredshift lbgs, we argue that there must be a steady flux of young,newly-luminous objects at each successive redshift. when considered along withthe short duty cycles inferred from clustering measurements, these results maysuggest that galaxies are undergoing star formation episodes lasting onlyseveral hundred million years. in contrast to the unchanging relationshipbetween the average stellar mass and rest-uv luminosity, we find that thenumber density of massive galaxies increases considerably with time over 4&lt;z&lt;6.given this rapid increase of uv luminous massive galaxies, we explore thepossibility that a significant fraction of massive (m*&gt;1e11 msun) z~2-3 distantred galaxies (drgs) were in part assembled in an lbg phase at earlier times.integrating the growth in the stellar mass function of actively forming lbgsover 4&lt;z&lt;6 down to z~2, we find that z&gt;3 lbgs could have contributedsignificantly to the quiescent drg population, indicating that the intensestar-forming systems probed by current sub-millimeter observations are not theonly route toward the assembly of drgs at z~2.

0903.2479	compact high-redshift galaxies are the cores of the most massive  present-day spheroids	observations suggest that effective radii of high-z massive spheroids are asmuch as a factor ~6 smaller than low-z galaxies of comparable mass. given theapparent absence of low-z counterparts, this has often been interpreted asindicating that the high density, compact red galaxies must be 'puffed up' bysome mechanism. we compare the ensemble of high-z observations with largesamples of well-observed low-z ellipticals. at the same physical radii, thestellar surface mass densities of low and high-z systems are comparable.moreover, the abundance of high surface density material at low redshift iscomparable to or larger than that observed at z&gt;1-2, consistent with thecontinuous buildup of spheroids over this time. the entire population ofcompact, high-z red galaxies may be the progenitors of the high-density coresof present-day ellipticals, with no need for a decrease in stellar density fromz=2 to z=0. the primary difference between low and high-z systems is thus theobserved low-density material at large radii in low-z spheroids (rather thanthe high-density material in high-z spheroids). such low-density material mayeither (1) assemble at z&lt;2 or (2) be present, but not yet detected, at z&gt;2.mock observations of low-z massive systems show that the high-z observations donot yet probe sufficiently low surface brightness material to detect the lowsurface density 'wings' (if present). thus, if the high-z galaxies resemble themost massive systems today, their inferred effective radii could beunder-estimated by factors ~2-4. this difference arises because massive systemsat low redshift are not well-fit by single sersic profiles. we discussimplications of our results for physical models of galaxy evolution.

0905.0162	mid-ir luminosities and uv/optical star formation rates at z&lt;1.4	uv continuum and mid-ir emission constitute two widely used star formationindicators at intermediate and high redshifts. we study 2430 galaxies withz&lt;1.4 in the extended groth strip with mips 24 mic observations from fidel,spectroscopy from deep2, and uv, optical, and near-ir photometry from aegis.the data are coupled with stellar population models and bayesian sed fitting toestimate dust-corrected sfrs. in order to probe the dust heating from stellarpopulations of various ages, the derived sfrs were averaged over varioustimescales--from 100 myr for "current" sfr to 1--3 gyr for long-timescale sfrs.these sed-based uv/optical sfrs are compared to total infrared luminositiesextrapolated from 24 mic observations. we find that for the blue, actively starforming galaxies the correlation between the ir luminosity and the uv/opticalsfr shows a decrease in scatter when going from shorter to longer sfr-averagingtimescales. we interpret this as the greater role of intermediate age stellarpopulations in heating the dust than what is typically assumed. this holds overthe entire redshift range. many so-called green valley galaxies are simplydust-obscured actively star-forming galaxies. however, there exist 24mic-detected galaxies, some with l&gt;10^11 l_sun, yet with little current starformation. for them a reasonable amount of dust absorption of stellar light issufficient to produce the observed levels of ir. in our sample optical andx-ray agns do not contribute on average more than ~50% to the mid-irluminosity, and we see no evidence for a large population of "ir excess"galaxies (abridged).

0706.4089	the deep2 galaxy redshift survey: the role of galaxy environment in the  cosmic star-formation history	using galaxy samples drawn from the sloan digital sky survey and the deep2galaxy redshift survey, we study the relationship between star formation andenvironment at z ~ 0.1 and z ~ 1. we estimate the total star-formation rate(sfr) and specific star-formation rate (ssfr) for each galaxy according to themeasured [o ii] nebular line luminosity, corrected using empirical calibrationsto match more robust sfr indicators. echoing previous results, we find that inthe local universe star formation depends on environment such that galaxies inregions of higher overdensity, on average, have lower star-formation rates andlonger star-formation timescales than their counterparts in lower-densityregions. at z ~ 1, we show that the relationship between specific sfr andenvironment mirrors that found locally. however, we discover that therelationship between total sfr and overdensity at z ~ 1 is inverted relative tothe local relation. this observed evolution in the sfr-density relation isdriven, in part, by a population of bright, blue galaxies in dense environmentsat z ~ 1. this population, which lacks a counterpart at z ~ 0, is thought toevolve into members of the red sequence from z ~ 1 to z ~ 0. finally, weconclude that environment does not play a dominant role in the cosmicstar-formation history at z &lt; 1: the dependence of the mean galaxy sfr on localgalaxy density at constant redshift is small compared to the decline in theglobal sfr space density over the last 7 gyr.

0906.5357	mergers and bulge formation in lambda-cdm: which mergers matter?	we use a suite of semi-empirical models to predict galaxy merger rates andcontributions to bulge growth as functions of merger mass, redshift, and massratio. the models use empirical halo occupation constraints to identifymergers, together with high-resolution simulations to quantify how mergers withdifferent properties contribute to the bulge population. we find good agreementwith a variety of observational constraints, and provide fitting functions formerger rates and contributions to bulge growth. we identify several robustconclusions. (1) major mergers dominate formation and assembly of l* bulges andthe spheroid mass density, minor mergers contribute ~30%. (2) this ismass-dependent: bulge formation is dominated by more minor mergers inlower-mass systems. at higher masses, bulges form in major mergers near l*, butsubsequently assemble in minor mergers. (3) the minor/major contribution isalso morphology-dependent: higher b/t systems form in more major mergers, lowerb/t systems form in situ from minor mergers. (4) low-mass galaxies, beinggas-rich, require more major mergers to reach the same b/t as high-masssystems. (5) absolute merger rates increase with galaxy mass. (6) predictedrates agree well with observations, but suggest that some morphology-selectedsamples include contamination from minor mergers. (7) predicted rates agreewith integrated growth in bulge mass with cosmic time, but with factor ~2uncertainty - half the bulge mass density could come from non-mergers. weconsider ~1000 model variations and quantify resulting uncertainties.conclusions regarding the major/minor contribution to bulge growth are veryrobust, absolute merger rates have systematic factor ~2 uncertainties.

0909.2039	discriminating between the physical processes that drive spheroid size  evolution	massive galaxies at high-z have smaller effective radii than those today, butsimilar central densities. their size growth therefore relates primarily to theevolving abundance of low-density material. various models have been proposedto explain this evolution, which have different implications for galaxy, star,and bh formation. we compile observations of spheroid properties as a functionof redshift and use them to test proposed models. evolution in progenitorgas-richness with redshift gives rise to initial formation of smaller spheroidsat high-z. these systems can then evolve in apparent or physical size viaseveral channels: (1) equal-density 'dry' mergers, (2) later major or minor'dry' mergers with less-dense galaxies, (3) adiabatic expansion, (4) evolutionin stellar populations &amp; mass-to-light-ratio gradients, (5) age-dependent biasin stellar mass estimators, (6) observational fitting/selection effects. if anyone of these is tuned to explain observed size evolution, they make distinctpredictions for evolution in other galaxy properties. only model (2) isconsistent with observations as a dominant effect. it is the only model whichallows for an increase in m_bh/m_bulge with redshift. still, the amount ofmerging needed is larger than that observed or predicted. we therefore comparecosmologically motivated simulations, in which all these effects occur, &amp; showthey are consistent with all the observational constraints. effect (2), whichbuilds up an extended low-density envelope, does dominate the evolution, buteffects 1,3,4, &amp; 6 each contribute ~20% to the size evolution (a net factor~2). this naturally also predicts evolution in m_bh-sigma similar to thatobserved.

1004.1331	keck spectroscopy of z&gt;1 field spheroidals: dynamical constraints on the  growth rate of red "nuggets"	we present deep keck spectroscopy for 17 morphologically-selected fieldspheroidals in the redshift range 1.05&lt;z&lt;1.60 in order to investigate thecontinuity in physical properties between the claimed massive compact redgalaxies ("nuggets") at z~2 and well-established data for massive spheroidalgalaxies below z~1. by combining keck-based stellar velocity dispersions withhst-based sizes, we find that the most massive systems (mdyn &gt; 10^11 msol) grewin size over 0&lt;z&lt;1.6 as (1+z)^(-0.75 +- 0.10) (i.e., x2 since z=1.5) whereasintermediate mass systems (10^11 msol &gt; mdyn &gt; 10^10 msol) did not growsignificantly. these trends are consistent with a picture in which more massivespheroidals formed at higher redshift via "wetter" mergers involving greaterdissipation. to examine growth under the favored "dry" merger hypothesis, wealso examine size growth at a fixed velocity dispersion. this test, uniquelypossible with our dynamical data, allows us to consider the effects of"progenitor bias." above our completeness limit (sigma &gt; 200 km/s), we findsize growth consistent with that inferred for the mass-selected sample, thusruling out strong progenitor bias. to maintain continuity in the growth ofmassive galaxies over the past 10 gyr, our new results imply that sizeevolution over 1.3&lt;z&lt;2.3, a period of 1.9 gyr, must have been even moredramatic than hitherto claimed if the red sources at z&gt;2 are truly massive andcompact.

1004.2708	mergers in lambda-cdm: uncertainties in theoretical predictions and  interpretations of the merger rate	different methodologies lead to order-of-magnitude variations in predictedgalaxy merger rates. we examine and quantify the dominant uncertainties.different halo merger rates and subhalo 'destruction' rates agree to within afactor ~2 given proper care in definitions. if however (sub)halo masses are notappropriately defined or are under-resolved, the major merger rate can bedramatically suppressed. the dominant differences in galaxy merger rates owe tobaryonic physics. hydrodynamic simulations without feedback and older modelsthat do not agree with the observed galaxy mass function propagate factor ~5bias in the resulting merger rates. however, if the model matches the galaxymass function, properties of central galaxies are sufficiently converged togive small differences in merger rates. but variations in baryonic physics ofsatellites also have dramatic effects. the known problem of satellite'over-quenching' in most semi-analytic models (sams), whereby sam satellitesare too efficiently stripped of gas, could lead to order-of-magnitudeunder-estimates of merger rates for low-mass, gas-rich galaxies. fixing thesatellite properties to observations tends to predict higher merger rates, butwith factor ~2 empirical uncertainties. choice of mass ratio definitionmatters: at low masses, most true major mergers (in baryonic/dynamical galaxymass) will appear to be minor mergers in their stellar or luminosity massratio. observations and models using these criteria may underestimate majormerger rates by factors ~5. orbital parameters and gas fractions also introducefactor ~3 differences in amount of bulge formed by mergers, even for fixed massratio encounters.

1006.3558	on the evolution of the velocity-mass-size relations of disk-dominated  galaxies over the past 10 billion years	we study the evolution of the scaling relations between maximum circularvelocity, stellar mass and optical half-light radius of star-formingdisk-dominated galaxies in the context of lcdm-based galaxy formation models.using data from the literature combined with new data from the deep2 and aegissurveys we show that there is a consistent observational and theoreticalpicture for the evolution of these scaling relations from z\sim 2 to z=0. theevolution of the observed stellar scaling relations is weaker than that of thevirial scaling relations of dark matter haloes, which can be reproduced, bothqualitatively and quantitatively, with a simple, cosmologically-motivated modelfor disk evolution inside growing nfw dark matter haloes. in this model opticalhalf-light radii are smaller, both at fixed stellar mass and maximum circularvelocity, at higher redshifts. this model also predicts that the scalingrelations between baryonic quantities evolve even more weakly than thecorresponding stellar relations. we emphasize, though, that this weak evolutiondoes not imply that individual galaxies evolve weakly. on the contrary,individual galaxies grow strongly in mass, size and velocity, but in such a waythat they move largely along the scaling relations. finally, recentobservations have claimed surprisingly large sizes for a number of star-formingdisk galaxies at z \sim 2, which has caused some authors to suggest that highredshift disk galaxies have abnormally high spin parameters. however, we arguethat the disk scale lengths in question have been systematically overestimatedby a factor \sim 2, and that there is an offset of a factor \sim 1.4 betweenh\alpha sizes and optical sizes. taking these effects into account, there is noindication that star forming galaxies at high redshifts (z\sim 2) haveabnormally high spin parameters.

1007.1967	absence of evidence is not evidence of absence: the color-density  relation at fixed stellar mass persists to z ~ 1	we use data drawn from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey to investigate therelationship between local galaxy density, stellar mass, and rest-frame galaxycolor. at z ~ 0.9, we find that the shape of the stellar mass function at thehigh-mass (log (m*/msun) &gt; 10.1) end depends on the local environment, withhigh-density regions favoring more massive systems. accounting for this stellarmass-environment relation (i.e., working at fixed stellar mass), we find asignificant color-density relation for galaxies with 10.6 &lt; log(m*/msun) &lt; 11.1and 0.75 &lt; z &lt; 0.95. this result is shown to be robust to variations in thesample selection and to extend to even lower masses (down to log(m*/msun) ~10.4). we conclude by discussing our results in comparison to recent works inthe literature, which report no significant correlation between galaxyproperties and environment at fixed stellar mass for the same redshift andstellar mass domain. the non-detection of environmental dependence found inother data sets is largely attributable to their smaller samples size and lowersampling density, as well as systematic effects such as inaccurate redshiftsand biased analysis techniques. ultimately, our results based on deep2 dataillustrate that the evolutionary state of a galaxy at z ~ 1 is not exclusivelydetermined by the stellar mass of the galaxy. instead, we show that localenvironment appears to play a distinct role in the transformation of galaxyproperties at z &gt; 1.

1007.3494	aegis: demographics of x-ray and optically selected agns	we develop a new diagnostic method to classify galaxies into agn hosts,star-forming galaxies, and absorption-dominated galaxies by combining the [oiii]/hbeta ratio with rest-frame u-b color. this can be used to robustly selectagns in galaxy samples at intermediate redshifts (z&lt;1). we compare the resultof this optical agn selection with x-ray selection using a sample of 3150galaxies with 0.3&lt;z&lt;0.8 and i_ab&lt;22, selected from the deep2 galaxy redshiftsurvey and the all-wavelength extended groth strip international survey(aegis). among the 146 x-ray sources in this sample, 58% are classifiedoptically as emission-line agns, the rest as star-forming galaxies orabsorption-dominated galaxies. the latter are also known as "x-ray bright,optically normal galaxies" (xbongs). analysis of the relationship betweenoptical emission lines and x-ray properties shows that the completeness ofoptical agn selection suffers from dependence on the star formation rate andthe quality of observed spectra. it also shows that xbongs do not appear to bea physically distinct population from other x-ray detected, emission-line agns.on the other hand, x-ray agn selection also has strong bias. about 2/3 of allemission-line agns at l_bol&gt;10^44 erg/s in our sample are not detected in our200 ks chandra images, most likely due to moderate or heavy absorption by gasnear the agn. the 2--7 kev detection rate of seyfert 2s at z~0.6 suggests thattheir column density distribution and compton-thick fraction are similar tothat of local seyferts. multiple sample selection techniques are needed toobtain as complete a sample as possible.

1102.3911	the assembly history of disk galaxies: i - the tully-fisher relation to  z~1.3 from deep exposures with deimos	we present new measures of the evolving scaling relations between stellarmass, luminosity and rotational velocity for a morphologically-inclusive sampleof 129 disk-like galaxies with z_ab&lt;22.5 in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.3, basedon spectra from deimos on the keck ii telescope, multi-color hst acsphotometry, and ground-based ks-band imaging. a unique feature of our survey isthe extended spectroscopic integration times, leading to significantimprovements in determining characteristic rotational velocities for eachgalaxy. rotation curves are reliably traced to the radius where they begin toflatten for ~90% of our sample, and we model the hst-resolved bulge and diskcomponents in order to accurately de-project our measured velocities,accounting for seeing and dispersion. we demonstrate the merit of theseadvances by recovering an intrinsic scatter on the stellar mass tully-fisherrelation a factor of 2-3 less than in previous studies at intermediate redshiftand comparable to that of locally-determined relations. with our increasedprecision, we find the relation is well-established by &lt;z&gt;~1, with nosignificant evolution to &lt;z&gt;~0.3, \deltam_stellar ~ 0.04+/-0.07 dex. a clearertrend of evolution is seen in the b-band tully-fisher relation corresponding toa decline in luminosity of \deltam_b ~ 0.85+/-0.28 magnitudes at fixed velocityover the same redshift range, reflecting the changes in star formation overthis period. as an illustration of the opportunities possible when gas massesare available for a sample such as ours, we show how our dynamical and stellarmass data can be used to evaluate the likely contributions of baryons and darkmatter to the assembly history of spiral galaxies.

1104.0928	new constraints on the evolution of the stellar-to-dark matter  connection: a combined analysis of galaxy-galaxy lensing, clustering, and  stellar mass functions from z=0.2 to z=1	using data from the cosmos survey, we perform the first joint analysis ofgalaxy-galaxy weak lensing, galaxy spatial clustering, and galaxy numberdensities. carefully accounting for sample variance and for scatter betweenstellar and halo mass, we model all three observables simultaneously using anovel and self-consistent theoretical framework. our results provide strongconstraints on the shape and redshift evolution of the stellar-to-halo massrelation (shmr) from z=0.2 to z=1. at low stellar mass, we find that halo massscales as mh m*^0.46 and that this scaling does not evolve significantly withredshift to z=1. we show that the dark-to-stellar ratio, mh/m*, varies from lowto high masses, reaching a minimum of mh/m*~27 at m*=4.5x10^10 msun andmh=1.2x10^12 msun. this minimum is important for models of galaxy formationbecause it marks the mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of thecentral galaxy has been the most efficient. we describe the shmr at thisminimum in terms of the "pivot stellar mass", m*piv, the "pivot halo mass",mhpiv, and the "pivot ratio", (mh/m*)piv. thanks to a homogeneous analysis of asingle data set, we report the first detection of mass downsizing trends forboth mhpiv and m*piv. the pivot stellar mass decreases fromm*piv=5.75+-0.13x10^10 msun at z=0.88 to m*piv=3.55+-0.17x10^10 msun at z=0.37.intriguingly, however, the corresponding evolution of mhpiv leaves the pivotratio constant with redshift at (mh/m*)piv~27. we use simple arguments to showhow this result raises the possibility that star formation quenching mayultimately depend on mh/m* and not simply mh, as is commonly assumed. we showthat simple models with such a dependence naturally lead to downsizing in thesites of star formation. finally, we discuss the implications of our results inthe context of popular quenching models, including disk instabilities and agnfeedback.

1108.4719	evolution of the most massive galaxies to z=0.6: i. a new method for  physical parameter estimation	we use principal component analysis (pca) to estimate stellar masses, meanstellar ages, star formation histories (sfhs), dust extinctions and stellarvelocity dispersions for ~290,000 galaxies with stellar masses greater than$10^{11}msun and redshifts in the range 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.7 from the baryon oscillationspectroscopic survey (boss). we find the fraction of galaxies with active starformation first declines with increasing stellar mass, but then flattens abovea stellar mass of 10^{11.5}msun at z~0.6. this is in striking contrast toz~0.1, where the fraction of galaxies with active star formation declinesmonotonically with stellar mass. at stellar masses of 10^{12}msun, therefore,the evolution in the fraction of star-forming galaxies from z~0.6 to thepresent-day reaches a factor of ~10. when we stack the spectra of the mostmassive, star-forming galaxies at z~0.6, we find that half of their [oiii]emission is produced by agns. the black holes in these galaxies are accretingon average at ~0.01 the eddington rate. to obtain these results, we use thestellar population synthesis models of bruzual &amp; charlot (2003) to generate alibrary of model spectra with a broad range of sfhs, metallicities, dustextinctions and stellar velocity dispersions. the pca is run on this library toidentify its principal components over the rest-frame wavelength range3700-5500a. we demonstrate that linear combinations of these components canrecover information equivalent to traditional spectral indices such as the4000a break strength and hda, with greatly improved s/n. this method is able torecover physical parameters such as stellar mass-to-light ratio, mean stellarage, velocity dispersion and dust extinction from the relatively low s/n bossspectra. we examine the sensitivity of our stellar mass estimates to the inputparameters in our model library and the different stellar population synthesismodels.

1109.0010	the integrated stellar content of dark matter halos	measurements of the total amount of stars locked up in galaxies as a functionof host halo mass contain key clues about the efficiency of processes thatregulate star formation. we derive the total stellar mass fraction f_star as afunction of halo mass m500c from z=0.2 to z=1 using two complementary methods.first, we derive f_star using a statistical halo occupation distribution modeljointly constrained by data from lensing, clustering, and the stellar massfunction. this method enables us to probe f_star over a much wider halo massrange than with group or cluster catalogs. second, we derive f_star at groupscales using a cosmos x-ray group catalog and we show that the two methodsagree to within 30%. we quantify the systematic uncertainty on f_star usingabundance matching methods and we show that the statistical uncertainty onf_star (~10%) is dwarfed by systematic uncertainties associated with stellarmass measurements (~45% excluding imf uncertainties). assuming a chabrier imf,we find 0.012&lt;f_star&lt;0.025 at m500c=10^13 msun and 0.0057&lt;f_star&lt;0.015 atm500c=10^14 msun. these values are significantly lower than previouslypublished estimates. we investigate the cause of this difference and find thatprevious work has overestimated f_star due to a combination of inaccuratestellar mass estimators and/or because they have assumed that all galaxies ingroups are early type galaxies with a constant mass-to-light ratio. contrary toprevious claims, our results suggest that the mean value of f_star is alwayssignificantly lower than f_gas for halos above 10^13 msun. combining ourresults with recently published gas mas fractions, we find a shortfall inf_star+f_gas at r500c compared to the cosmic mean. this shortfall varies withhalo mass and becomes larger towards lower halos masses.

0710.2105	aegis: new evidence linking active galactic nuclei to the quenching of  star formation	utilizing chandra x-ray observations in the all-wavelength extended grothstrip international survey (aegis) we identify 241 x-ray selected activegalactic nuclei (agns, l &gt; 10^{42} ergs/s) and study the properties of theirhost galaxies in the range 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.4. by making use of infrared photometryfrom palomar observatory and bri imaging from the canada-france-hawaiitelescope, we estimate agn host galaxy stellar masses and show that bothstellar mass and photometric redshift estimates (where necessary) are robust tothe possible contamination from agns in our x-ray selected sample. accountingfor the photometric and x-ray sensitivity limits of the survey, we constructthe stellar mass function of x-ray selected agn host galaxies and find thattheir abundance decreases by a factor of ~2 since z~1, but remains roughly flatas a function of stellar mass. we compare the abundance of agn hosts to therate of star formation quenching observed in the total galaxy population. ifthe timescale for x-ray detectable agn activity is roughly 0.5-1 gyr--assuggested by black hole demographics and recent simulations--then we deducethat the inferred agn "trigger" rate matches the star formation quenching rate,suggesting a link between these phenomena. however, given the large range ofnuclear accretion rates we infer for the most massive and red hosts, x-rayselected agns may not be directly responsible for quenching star formation.

1109.6040	galaxies in x-ray groups i: robust membership assignment and the impact  of group environments on quenching	understanding the mechanisms that lead dense environments to host galaxieswith redder colors, more spheroidal morphologies, and lower star formationrates than field populations remains an important problem. as most candidateprocesses ultimately depend on host halo mass, accurate characterizations ofthe local environment, ideally tied to halo mass estimates and spanning a rangein halo mass and redshift are needed. in this work, we present and test arigorous, probabalistic method for assigning galaxies to groups based onprecise photometric redshifts and x-ray selected groups drawn from the cosmosfield. the groups have masses in the range 10^13 &lt; m_200c/m_sun &lt; 10^14 andspan redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;1. we characterize our selection algorithm via tests onspectroscopic subsamples, including new data obtained at the vlt, and byapplying our method to detailed mock catalogs. we find that our group membergalaxy sample has a purity of 84% and completeness of 92% within 0.5 r200c. wemeasure the impact of uncertainties in redshifts and group centering on thequality of the member selection with simulations based on current data as wellas future imaging and spectroscopic surveys. as a first application of our newgroup member catalog which will be made publicly available, we show that membergalaxies exhibit a higher quenched fraction compared to the field at fixedstellar mass out to z~1, indicating a significant relationship between starformation and environment at group scales. we also address the suggestion thatdusty star forming galaxies in such groups may impact the high-l power spectrumof the cosmic microwave background and find that such a population cannotexplain the low power seen in recent sz measurements.

1110.1637	can minor merging account for the size growth of quiescent galaxies? new  results from the candels survey	the presence of extremely compact galaxies at z~2 and their subsequent growthin physical size has been the cause of much puzzlement. we revisit the questionusing deep infrared wide field camera 3 data to probe the rest-frame opticalstructure of 935 host galaxies selected with 0.4&lt;z&lt;2.5 and stellar masses m* &gt;10^10.7 msol using optical and near-infrared photometry in the ukirt ultra deepsurvey and goods-south fields of the candels survey. at each redshift, the mostcompact sources are those with little or no star formation, and we find thatthe mean size of these systems grows by a factor of 3.5 +- 0.3 over thisredshift interval. the new data are sufficiently deep to enable us to identifycompanions to these hosts whose stellar masses are ten times smaller, whilestill yielding suitably accurate photometric redshifts to define a likelyphysical association. by searching for faint companions around 404 quiescenthosts within a projected physical annulus 10 &lt; r &lt; 30 kpc/h, we estimate theminor merger rate over the redshift range 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 2. after correcting forcontamination from projected pairs, we find that 13-18% of quiescent hosts havelikely physical companions with stellar mass ratios of 0.1 or greater. mergersof these companions will typically increase the host mass by 6+-2% per mergertimescale. we estimate the minimum growth rate necessary to explain thedeclining abundance of compact galaxies. using a simple model of mergingmotivated by recent numerical simulations, we then assess whether mergers ofthe faint companions with their hosts are sufficient to explain this minimalrate. we find that mergers with mass ratios &gt; 0.1 may explain most of the sizeevolution observed at z &gt;~ 1 if a relatively short merger timescale is assumed,but the rapid growth seen at higher redshift likely requires additionalphysical processes.

1203.1625	dependence of galaxy quenching on halo mass and distance from its centre	we study the dependence of star-formation quenching on galaxy mass andenvironment, in the sdss (z~0.1) and the aegis (z~1). it is crucial that wedefine quenching by low star-formation rate rather than by red colour, giventhat one third of the red galaxies are star forming. we address stellar massm*, halo mass mh, density over the nearest n neighbours deltan, and distance tothe halo centre d. the fraction of quenched galaxies appears more stronglycorrelated with mh at fixed m* than with m* at fixed mh, while for satellitesquenching also depends on d. we present the m*-mh relation for centrals at z~1.at z~1, the dependence of quenching on m* at fixed mh is somewhat morepronounced than at z~0, but the quenched fraction is low (10%) and the haloesare less massive. for satellites, m*-dependent quenching is noticeable at highd, suggesting a quenching dependence on sub-halo mass for recently capturedsatellites. at small d, where satellites likely fell in more than a few gyrago, quenching strongly depends on mh, and not on m*. the mh-dependence ofquenching is consistent with theoretical wisdom where virial shock heating inmassive haloes shuts down accretion and triggers ram-pressure stripping,causing quenching. the interpretation of deltan is complicated by the fact thatit depends on the number of observed group members compared to n, motivatingthe use of d as a better measure of local environment.

0711.0238	the evolutionary history of galactic bulges: photometric and  spectroscopic studies of distant spheroids in the goods fields	we report on the first results of a new study aimed at understanding thediversity and evolutionary history of distant galactic bulges in the context ofnow well-established trends for pure spheroidal galaxies. to this end, bulgeshave been isolated for a sample of 137 spiral galaxies within the redshiftrange 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.2 in the goods fields. using proven photometric techniques wedetermine the characteristic parameters (size, surface brightness, profileshape) of both the disk and bulge components in our sample. in agreement withearlier work which utilized aperture colors, distant bulges show a broaderrange of optical colors than would be the case for passively-evolvingpopulations. to quantify the amount of recent star formation necessary toexplain this result, we used the deimos spectrograph to secure stellar velocitydispersions for a sizeable fraction of our sample. this has enabled us tocompare the fundamental plane of our distant bulges with that for spheroidalgalaxies in a similar redshift range. bulges of spiral galaxies with abulge-to-total luminosity ratio (b/t)&gt;0.2 show very similar patterns ofevolution to those seen for pure spheroidals such that the stellar populationsof all spheroids with m&gt;10^{11}msun are homogeneously old, consistent with asingle major burst of star formation at high redshift (z_f&lt;~2), while bulgeswith m&lt;10^{11}msun must have had more recent stellar mass growth (~10% in masssince z~1). although further data spanning a wider range of redshift and massis desirable, the striking similarity between the assembly histories of bulgesand low mass spheroidals is difficult to reconcile with the picture whereby themajority of large bulges form primarily via secular processes within spiralgalaxies.

1205.4245	the correlated formation histories of massive galaxies and their dark  matter halos	using observations in the cosmos field, we report an intriguing correlationbetween the star formation activity of massive (~10^{11.4}\msol) centralgalaxies, their stellar masses, and the large-scale (~10 mpc) environments oftheir group-mass (~10^{13.6}\msol) dark matter halos. probing the redshiftrange z=[0.2,1.0], our measurements come from two independent sources: an x-raydetected group catalog and constraints on the stellar-to-halo mass relationderived from a combination of clustering and weak lensing statistics. at z=1,we find that the stellar mass in star-forming centrals is a factor of two lessthan in passive centrals at the same halo mass. this implies that the presenceor lack of star formation in group-scale centrals cannot be a stochasticprocess. by z=0, the offset reverses, probably as a result of the differentgrowth rates of these objects. a similar but weaker trend is observed whendividing the sample by morphology rather than star formation. remarkably, wefind that star-forming centrals at z~1 live in groups that are significantlymore clustered on 10 mpc scales than similar mass groups hosting passivecentrals. we discuss this signal in the context of halo assembly and recentsimulations, suggesting that star-forming centrals prefer halos with higherangular momentum and/or formation histories with more recent growth; such halosare known to evolve in denser large-scale environments. if confirmed, thiswould be evidence of an early established link between the assembly history ofhalos on large scales and the future properties of the galaxies that forminside them.

1205.4262	galaxies in x-ray groups. ii. a weak lensing study of halo centering	locating the centers of dark matter halos is critical for understanding themass profiles of halos as well as the formation and evolution of the massivegalaxies that they host. the task is observationally challenging because wecannot observe halos directly, and tracers such as bright galaxies or x-rayemission from hot plasma are imperfect. in this paper we quantify theconsequences of miscentering on the weak lensing signal from a sample of 129x-ray selected galaxy groups in the cosmos field with redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;1 and halomasses in the range 10^13 - 10^14 m_sun. by measuring the stacked lensingsignal around eight different candidate centers (such as the brightest membergalaxy, the mean position of all member galaxies, or the x-ray centroid), wedetermine which candidates best trace the center of mass in halos. in thissample of groups, we find that massive galaxies near the x-ray centroids tracethe center of mass to &lt;~75 kpc, while the x-ray position and centroids based onthe mean position of member galaxies have larger offsets primarily due to thestatistical uncertainties in their positions (typically ~50-150 kpc).approximately 30% of groups in our sample have ambiguous centers with multiplebright or massive galaxies, and these groups show disturbed mass profiles thatare not well fit by standard models, suggesting that they are merging systems.we find that halo mass estimates from stacked weak lensing can be biased low by5-30% if inaccurate centers are used and the issue of miscentering is notaddressed.

1207.6114	stellar masses of sdss-iii boss galaxies at z~0.5 and constraints to  galaxy formation models	we calculate stellar masses for massive luminous galaxies at redshift 0.2-0.7using the first two years of data from the baryon oscillation spectroscopicsurvey (boss). stellar masses are obtained by fitting model spectral energydistributions to u,g,r,i,z magnitudes, and simulations with mock galaxies areused to understand how well the templates recover the stellar mass. accurateboss spectroscopic redshifts are used to constrain the fits. we find that thedistribution of stellar masses in boss is narrow (delta log m~0.5 dex) andpeaks at about logm ~ 11.3 (for a kroupa initial stellar mass function), andthat the mass sampling is uniform over the redshift range 0.2 to 0.6, inagreement with the intended boss target selection. the galaxy masses probed byboss extend over ~10^{12} m, providing unprecedented measurements of thehigh-mass end of the galaxy mass function. we find that the galaxy numberdensity above ~ 2.5 10^{11} m agrees with previous determinations. we perform acomparison with semi-analytic galaxy formation models tailored to the bosstarget selection and volume, in order to contain incompleteness. the abundanceof massive galaxies in the models compare fairly well with the boss data, butthe models lack galaxies at the massive end. moreover, no evolution withredshift is detected from ~0.6 to 0.4 in the data, whereas the abundance ofmassive galaxies in the models increases to redshift zero. additionally, bossdata display colour-magnitude (mass) relations similar to those found in thelocal universe, where the most massive galaxies are the reddest. on the otherhand, the model colours do not display a dependence on stellar mass, span anarrower range and are typically bluer than the observations. we argue that thelack of a colour-mass relation for massive galaxies in the models is mostly dueto metallicity, which is too low in the models.

1302.6620	galaxies in x-ray groups. iii. satellite color and morphology  transformations	while the star formation rates and morphologies of galaxies have long beenknown to correlate with their local environment, the process by which thesecorrelations are generated is not well understood. galaxy groups are thought toplay an important role in shaping the physical properties of galaxies beforeentering massive clusters at low redshift, and transformations of satellitegalaxies likely dominate the buildup of local environmental correlations. toilluminate the physical processes that shape galaxy evolution in denseenvironments, we study a sample of 116 x-ray selected galaxy groups at z=0.2-1with halo masses of 10^13-10^14 m_sun and centroids determined with weaklensing. we analyze morphologies based on hst imaging and colors determinedfrom 31 photometric bands for a stellar mass-limited population of 923satellite galaxies and a comparison sample of 16644 field galaxies. controllingfor variations in stellar mass across environments, we find significant trendsin the colors and morphologies of satellite galaxies with group-centricdistance and across cosmic time. specifically at low stellar mass(log(m_stellar/m_sun) = 9.8-10.3), the fraction of disk-dominated star-forminggalaxies declines from &gt;50% among field galaxies to &lt;20% among satellites nearthe centers of groups. this decline is accompanied by a rise in quenchedgalaxies with intermediate bulge+disk morphologies, and only a weak increase inred bulge-dominated systems. these results show that both color and morphologyare influenced by a galaxy's location within a group halo. we suggest thatstrangulation and disk fading alone are insufficient to explain the observedmorphological dependence on environment, and that galaxy mergers or close tidalencounters must play a role in building up the population of quenched galaxieswith bulges seen in dense environments at low redshift.

1308.2974	evolution of the stellar-to-dark matter relation: separating  star-forming and passive galaxies from z=1 to 0	we use measurements of the stellar mass function, galaxy clustering, andgalaxy-galaxy lensing within the cosmos survey to constrain the stellar-to-halomass relation (shmr) of star forming and quiescent galaxies over the redshiftrange z=[0.2,1.0]. for massive galaxies, m*&gt;~10^10.6 msol, our results indicatethat star-forming galaxies grow proportionately as fast as their dark matterhalos while quiescent galaxies are outpaced by dark matter growth. at lowermasses, there is minimal difference in the shmrs, implying that the majoritylow-mass quiescent galaxies have only recently been quenched of their starformation. our analysis also affords a breakdown of all cosmos galaxies intothe relative numbers of central and satellite galaxies for both populations. atz=1, satellite galaxies dominate the red sequence below the knee in the stellarmass function. but the number of quiescent satellites exhibits minimal redshiftevolution; all evolution in the red sequence is due to low-mass centralgalaxies being quenched of their star formation. at m*~10^10 msol, the fractionof central galaxies on the red sequence increases by a factor of ten over ourredshift baseline, while the fraction of quenched satellite galaxies at thatmass is constant with redshift. we define a "migration rate" to the redsequence as the time derivative of the passive galaxy abundances. we find thatthe migration rate of central galaxies to the red sequence increases by nearlyan order of magnitude from z=1 to z=0. these results imply that the efficiencyof quenching star formation for centrals is increasing with cosmic time, whilethe mechanisms that quench the star formation of satellite galaxies in groupsand clusters is losing efficiency.

1309.6321	do we expect most agn to live in disks?	recent observations have indicated that a large fraction of the low tointermediate luminosity agn population lives in disk-dominated hosts, while themore luminous quasars live in bulge-dominated hosts, in conflict with someprevious model predictions. we therefore build and compare a semi-empiricalmodel for agn fueling which accounts for both merger and non-merger'triggering.' in particular, we show that the 'stochastic accretion' model - inwhich fueling in disk galaxies is essentially a random process arising wheneverdense gas clouds reach the nucleus - provides a good match to the presentobservations at low/intermediate luminosities. however it falls short of thehigh-luminosity population. we combine this with models for majormerger-induced agn fueling, which lead to rarer but more luminous events, andpredict the resulting abundance of disk-dominated and bulge-dominated agn hostgalaxies as a function of luminosity and redshift. we compile and compareobservational constraints from z~0-2. the models and observations genericallyshow a transition from disk to bulge dominance in hosts near the seyfert-quasartransition, at all redshifts. 'stochastic' fueling dominates agn by number(dominant at low luminosity), and dominates bh growth below the knee in thepresent-day bh mass function (&lt;10^7 m_sun). however it accounts for just ~10%of bh mass growth at masses &gt;10^8 m_sun. in total, fueling in disky hostsaccounts for ~30% of the total agn luminosity density/bh mass density. thecombined model also accurately predicts the agn luminosity function andclustering/bias as a function of luminosity and redshift; however, we arguethat these are not sensitive probes of bh fueling mechanisms.

1410.7402	understanding the unique assembly history of central group galaxies	central galaxies (cgs) in massive halos live in unique environments withformation histories closely linked to that of the host halo. in local clustersthey have larger sizes ($r_e$) and lower velocity dispersions (sigma) at fixedstellar mass m_star, and much larger r_e at a fixed $\sigma$ than field andsatellite galaxies (non-cgs). using spectroscopic observations of groupgalaxies selected from the cosmos survey, we compare the dynamical scalingrelations of early-type cgs and non-cgs at z~0.6, to distinguish possiblemechanisms that produce the required evolution. cgs are systematically offsettowards larger r_e at fixed $\sigma$ compared to non-cgs with similar m_star.the cg r_e-m_star relation also shows differences, primarily driven by asub-population (~15%) of galaxies with large $r_e$, while the m_star-sigmarelations are indistinguishable. these results are accentuated when doublesersic profiles, which better fit light in the outer regions of galaxies, areadopted. they suggest that even group-scale cgs can develop extended componentsby these redshifts that can increase total $r_e$ and m_star estimates byfactors of ~2. to probe the evolutionary link between our sample and clustercgs, we also analyze two cluster samples at z~0.6 and z~0. we find similarresults for the more massive halos at comparable z, but much more distinct cgscaling relations at low-z. thus, the rapid, late-time accretion of outercomponents, perhaps via the stripping and accretion of satellites, would appearto be a key feature that distinguishes the evolutionary history of cgs.

1412.1482	overview of the sdss-iv manga survey: mapping nearby galaxies at apache  point observatory	we present an overview of a new integral field spectroscopic survey calledmanga (mapping nearby galaxies at apache point observatory), one of three coreprograms in the fourth-generation sloan digital sky survey (sdss-iv) that beganon 2014 july 1. manga will investigate the internal kinematic structure andcomposition of gas and stars in an unprecedented sample of 10,000 nearbygalaxies. we summarize essential characteristics of the instrument and surveydesign in the context of manga's key science goals and present prototypeobservations to demonstrate manga's scientific potential. manga employsdithered observations with 17 fiber-bundle integral field units that vary indiameter from 12" (19 fibers) to 32" (127 fibers). two dual-channelspectrographs provide simultaneous wavelength coverage over 3600-10300 a atr~2000. with a typical integration time of 3 hr, manga reaches a target r-bandsignal-to-noise ratio of 4-8 (per a, per 2" fiber) at 23 ab mag per sq. arcsec,which is typical for the outskirts of manga galaxies. targets are selected withstellar mass greater than 1e9 msun using sdss-i redshifts and i-band luminosityto achieve uniform radial coverage in terms of the effective radius, anapproximately flat distribution in stellar mass, and a sample spanning a widerange of environments. analysis of our prototype observations demonstratesmanga's ability to probe gas ionization, shed light on recent star formationand quenching, enable dynamical modeling, decompose constituent components, andmap the composition of stellar populations. manga's spatially resolved spectrawill enable an unprecedented study of the astrophysics of nearby galaxies inthe coming 6 yr.

1502.07040	p-manga: gradients in recent star formation histories as diagnostics for  galaxy growth and death	we present an analysis of the data produced by the manga prototype run(p-manga), aiming to test how the radial gradients in recent star formationhistories, as indicated by the 4000aa-break (d4000), hdelta absorption(ew(hd_a)) and halpha emission (ew(ha)) indices, can be useful forunderstanding disk growth and star formation cessation in local galaxies. weclassify 12 galaxies observed on two p-manga plates as either centrallyquiescent (cq) or centrally star-forming (csf), according to whether d4000measured in the central spaxel of each datacube exceeds 1.6. for each galaxy wegenerate both 2d maps and radial profiles of d4000, ew(hd_a) and ew(ha). wefind that csf galaxies generally show very weak or no radial variation in thesediagnostics. in contrast, cq galaxies present significant radial gradients, inthe sense that d4000 decreases, while both ew(hd_a) and ew(ha) increase fromthe galactic center outward. the outer regions of the galaxies show greaterscatter on diagrams relating the three parameters than their central parts. inparticular, the clear separation between centrally-measured quiescent andstar-forming galaxies in these diagnostic planes is largely filled in by theouter parts of galaxies whose global colors place them in the green valley,supporting the idea that the green valley represents a transition betweenblue-cloud and red-sequence phases, at least in our small sample. these resultsare consistent with a picture in which the cessation of star formationpropagates from the center of a galaxy outwards as it moves to the redsequence.

1503.01124	p-manga: full spectral fitting and stellar population maps from  prototype observations	manga (mapping nearby galaxies at apache point observatory) is a 6-yearsdss-iv survey that will obtain resolved spectroscopy from 3600 $\aa$ to 10300$\aa$ for a representative sample of over 10,000 nearby galaxies. in thispaper, we derive spatially resolved stellar population properties and radialgradients by performing full spectral fitting of observed galaxy spectra fromp-manga, a prototype of the manga instrument. these data include spectra foreighteen galaxies, covering a large range of morphological type. we derive age,metallicity, dust and stellar mass maps, and their radial gradients, using highspectral-resolution stellar population models, and assess the impact of varyingthe stellar library input to the models. we introduce a method to determinedust extinction which is able to give smooth stellar mass maps even in cases ofhigh and spatially non-uniform dust attenuation.  with the spectral fitting we produce detailed maps of stellar populationproperties which allow us to identify galactic features among this diversesample such as spiral structure, smooth radial profiles with little azimuthalstructure in spheroidal galaxies, and spatially distinct galaxy sub-components.in agreement with the literature, we find the gradients for galaxies identifiedas early-type to be on average flat in age, and negative (- 0.15 dex / r$_e$ )in metallicity, whereas the gradients for late-type galaxies are on averagenegative in age (- 0.39 dex / r$_e$ ) and flat in metallicity. we demonstratehow different levels of data quality change the precision with which radialgradients can be measured. we show how this analysis, extended to the largenumbers of manga galaxies, will have the potential to shed light on galaxystructure and evolution.

0804.4686	ubiquitous outflows in deep2 spectra of star-forming galaxies at z=1.4	galactic winds are a prime suspect for the metal enrichment of theintergalactic medium and may have a strong influence on the chemical evolutionof galaxies and the nature of qso absorption line systems. we use a sample of1406 galaxy spectra at z~1.4 from the deep2 redshift survey to show thatblueshifted mg ii 2796, 2803 a absorption is ubiquitous in starforming galaxiesat this epoch. this is the first detection of frequent outflowing galacticwinds at z~1. the presence and depth of absorption are independent of agnspectral signatures or galaxy morphology; major mergers are not a prerequisitefor driving a galactic wind from massive galaxies. outflows are found incoadded spectra of galaxies spanning a range of 30x in stellar mass and 10x instar formation rate (sfr), calibrated from k-band and from mips ir fluxes. theoutflows have column densities of order n_h ~ 10^20 cm^-2 and characteristicvelocities of ~ 300-500 km/sec, with absorption seen out to 1000 km/sec in themost massive, highest sfr galaxies. the velocities suggest that the outflowinggas can escape into the igm and that massive galaxies can producecosmologically and chemically significant outflows. both the mg ii equivalentwidth and the outflow velocity are larger for galaxies of higher stellar massand sfr, with v_wind ~ sfr^0.3, similar to the scaling in low redshiftir-luminous galaxies. the high frequency of outflows in the star-forming galaxypopulation at z~1 indicates that galactic winds occur in the progenitors ofmassive spirals as well as those of ellipticals. the increase of outflowvelocity with mass and sfr constrains theoretical models of galaxy evolutionthat include feedback from galactic winds, and may favor momentum-driven modelsfor the wind physics.

1507.04752	the stripe 82 massive galaxy project ii: stellar mass completeness of  spectroscopic galaxy samples from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey	the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey (boss) has collected spectra forover one million galaxies at $0.15&lt;z&lt;0.7$ over a volume of 15.3 gpc$^3$ (9,376deg$^2$) -- providing us an opportunity to study the most massive galaxypopulations with vanishing sample variance. however, boss samples are selectedvia complex color cuts that are optimized for cosmology studies, not galaxyscience. in this paper, we supplement boss samples with photometric redshiftsfrom the stripe 82 massive galaxy catalog and measure the total galaxy stellarmass function (smf) at $z\sim0.3$ and $z\sim0.55$. with the total smf in hand,we characterize the stellar mass completeness of boss samples. thehigh-redshift cmass ("constant mass") sample is significantly impacted by massincompleteness and is 80% complete at $\log_{10}(m_*/m_{\odot}) &gt;11.6$ only inthe narrow redshift range $z=[0.51,0.61]$. the low redshift lowz sample is 80%complete at $\log_{10}(m_*/m_{\odot}) &gt;11.6$ for $z=[0.15,0.43]$. to constructmass complete samples at lower masses, spectroscopic samples need to besignificantly supplemented by photometric redshifts. this work will enablefuture studies to better utilize the boss samples for galaxy-formation science.

1511.01496	sdss-iv/manga: spectrophotometric calibration technique	mapping nearby galaxies at apache point observatory (manga), one of threecore programs in the sloan digital sky survey-iv (sdss-iv), is anintegral-field spectroscopic (ifs) survey of roughly 10,000 nearby galaxies. itemploys dithered observations using 17 hexagonal bundles of 2 arcsec fibers toobtain resolved spectroscopy over a wide wavelength range of 3,600-10,300a. tomap the internal variations within each galaxy, we need to perform accurate{\it spectral surface photometry}, which is to calibrate the specific intensityat every spatial location sampled by each individual aperture element of theintegral field unit. the calibration must correct only for the flux loss due toatmospheric throughput and the instrument response, but not for losses due tothe finite geometry of the fiber aperture. this requires the use of standardstar measurements to strictly separate these two flux loss factors (throughputversus geometry), a difficult challenge with standard single-fiber spectroscopytechniques due to various practical limitations. therefore, we developed atechnique for spectral surface photometry using multiple small fiber-bundlestargeting standard stars simultaneously with galaxy observations. we discussthe principles of our approach and how they compare to previous efforts, and wedemonstrate the precision and accuracy achieved. manga's relative calibrationbetween the wavelengths of h$\alpha$ and h$\beta$ has a root-mean-square (rms)of 1.7%, while that between [nii] $\lambda$6583a and [oii] $\lambda$3727a hasan rms of 4.7%. using extinction-corrected star formation rates and gas-phasemetallicities as an illustration, this level of precision guarantees that fluxcalibration errors will be sub-dominant when estimating these quantities. theabsolute calibration is better than 5% for more than 89% of manga's wavelengthrange.

astro-ph;0312222	a slow merger history of field galaxies since z~1	using deep infrared observations conducted with the cisco imager on thesubaru telescope, we investigate the field-corrected pair fraction and theimplied merger rate of galaxies in redshift survey fields with hubble spacetelescope imaging. in the redshift interval, 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.5, the fraction ofinfrared-selected pairs increases only modestly with redshift to 7% +- 6% atz~1. this is nearly a factor of three less than the fraction, 22% +- 8%,determined using the same technique on hst optical images and as measured in aprevious similar study. tests support the hypothesis that optical pairfractions at z~1 are inflated by bright star-forming regions that are unlikelyto be representative of the underlying mass distribution. by determiningstellar masses for the companions, we estimate the mass accretion rateassociated with merging galaxies. at z~1, we estimate this to be 2x10^{9 +-0.2} solar masses per galaxy per gyr. although uncertainties remain, ourresults suggest that the growth of galaxies via the accretion of pre-existingfragments remains as significant a phenomenon in the redshift range studied asthat estimated from ongoing star formation in independent surveys.

astro-ph;0601621	observational evidence for the co-evolution of galaxy mergers, quasars,  and the blue/red galaxy transition	we compile a number of observations to estimate the time-averaged rate offormation or buildup of red sequence galaxies, as a function of mass andredshift. comparing this with the mass functions of mergers and quasar hosts,and independently comparing their clustering properties as a function ofredshift, we find that these populations trace the same mass distribution, withsimilar evolution, at redshifts 0&lt;z&lt;~1.5. knowing one of the quasar, merger, orelliptical mass/luminosity functions, it is possible to predict the others.allowing for greater model dependence, we compare the rate of early-typebuildup with the implied merger and quasar triggering rates as a function ofmass and redshift and find agreement. over this redshift range, observed mergerfractions can account for the entire bright quasar luminosity function andbuildup of the red sequence at all but the highest masses at low redshift(&gt;~10^11 m_solar at z&lt;~0.3) where 'dry' mergers appear to dominate. thissupports a necessary prediction of theories where mergers between gas-richgalaxies produce ellipticals with an associated phase of quasar activity, afterwhich the remnant becomes red. these populations trace a similar characteristictransition mass, possibly reflecting the mass above which the ellipticalpopulation is mostly (&gt;~50%) assembled at a given redshift, which increaseswith redshift over the observed range in a manner consistent with suggestionsthat cosmic downsizing may apply to red galaxy assembly as well as starformation. these mass distributions as a function of redshift do not uniformlytrace the all/red/blue galaxy population, ruling out models in which quasaractivity is generically associated with star formation or is long lived in'old' systems.
