0902.4383	on the origin of the scatter around the fundamental plane: correlations  with stellar population parameters	we present a fundamental plane (fp) analysis of 141 early-type galaxies inthe shapley supercluster at z=0.049 based on spectroscopy from the aaomegaspectrograph at the aat and photometry from the wfi on the eso/mpi 2.2mtelescope. the key feature of the survey is its coverage of low-mass galaxiesdown to sigma_0~50km/s. we obtain a best-fitting fp relation log r_e=1.06 logsigma_0 - 0.82 log &lt; i &gt;_e + cst in the r band. the shallow exponent of sigma_0is a result of the extension of our sample to low velocity dispersions. weinvestigate the origin of the intrinsic fp scatter, using estimates of age,metallicity and alpha/fe. we find that the fp residuals anti-correlate(&gt;3sigma) with the mean stellar age in agreement with previous work. however, astronger (&gt;4sigma) correlation with alpha/fe is also found. these correlationsindicate that galaxies with effective radii smaller than those predicted by thefp have stellar populations systematically older and with alpha over-abundanceslarger than average, for their sigma_0. including alpha/fe as a fourthparameter in the fp, the total scatter decreases from 0.088 dex to 0.075 dexand the estimated intrinsic scatter decreases from 0.068 dex to 0.049 dex.thus, variations in alpha/fe account for &gt;&gt; 30% of the total variance aroundthe fp, and &gt;&gt; 50% of the estimated intrinsic variance. this result indicatesthat the distribution of galaxies around the fp are tightly related to theenrichment, and hence to the timescale of star-formation. our results appear tobe consistent with the merger hypothesis for the formation of ellipticals whichpredicts that a significant fraction of the scatter is due to variations in theimportance of dissipation in forming merger remnants of a given mass.

0903.1414	evidence for energy injection and a fine-tuned central engine at optical  wavelengths in grb 070419a	we present a comprehensive multiwavelength temporal and spectral analysis ofthe fred grb 070419a. the early-time emission in the $\gamma$-ray and x-raybands can be explained by a central engine active for at least 250 s, while atlate times the x-ray light curve displays a simple power-law decay. incontrast, the observed behaviour in the optical band is complex (from 10$^2$ upto 10$^6$ s). we investigate the light curve behaviour in the context of thestandard forward/reverse shock model; associating the peak in the optical lightcurve at $\sim$450 s with the fireball deceleration time results in a lorenzfactor $\gamma \approx 350$ at this time. in contrast, the shallow opticaldecay between 450 and 1500 s remains problematic, requiring a reverse shockcomponent whose typical frequency is above the optical band at the optical peaktime for it to be explained within the standard model. this predicts anincreasing flux density for the forward shock component until t $\sim$ 4$\times$ 10$^6$ s, inconsistent with the observed decay of the optical emissionfrom t $\sim$ 10$^4$ s. a highly magnetized fireball is also ruled out due tounrealistic microphysic parameters and predicted light curve behaviour that isnot observed. we conclude that a long-lived central engine with a finely tunedenergy injection rate and a sudden cessation of the injection is required tocreate the observed light curves - consistent with the same conditions that areinvoked to explain the plateau phase of canonical x-ray light curves of grbs.

0903.2958	rise and fall of the x-ray flash 080330: an off-axis jet?	x-ray flashes (xrfs) are a class of gamma-ray bursts (grbs) with the peakenergy of the time-integrated spectrum, ep, below 30 kev, whereas classicalgrbs have ep of a few hundreds kev. apart from ep and the lower luminosity, theproperties of xrfs are typical of the classical grbs. yet, the nature of xrfsand the differences from that of grbs are not understood. in addition, there isno consensus on the interpretation of the shallow decay phase observed in mostx-ray afterglows of both xrfs and grbs. we examine in detail the case of xrf080330 discovered by swift at the redshift of 1.51. this burst isrepresentative of the xrf class and exhibits an x-ray shallow decay. the richand broadband (from nir to uv) photometric data set we collected across thisphase makes it an ideal candidate to test the off-axis jet interpretationproposed to explain both the softness of xrfs and the shallow decay phase. wepresent prompt gamma-ray, early and late ir/visible/uv and x-ray observationsof the xrf 080330. we derive a sed from nir to x-ray bands across the plateauphase with a power-law index of 0.79 +- 0.01 and negligible rest-frame dustextinction. the multi-wavelength evolution of the afterglow is achromatic from~10^2 s out to ~8x10^4 s. we describe the temporal evolution of themulti-wavelength afterglow within the context of the standard afterglow modeland show that a single-component jet viewed off-axis explains the observations(abriged).

0906.1123	the hst/acs coma cluster survey: v - compact stellar systems in the coma  cluster	the hst acs coma cluster treasury survey is a deep two passband imagingsurvey of the nearest very rich cluster of galaxies, covering a range of galaxydensity environments. the imaging is complemented by a recent wide fieldredshift survey of the cluster conducted with hectospec on the 6.5m mmt. amongthe many scientific applications for this data are the search for compactgalaxies. in this paper, we present the discovery of seven compact (but quiteluminous) stellar systems, ranging from m32-like galaxies down to ultra-compactdwarfs (ucds)/dwarf to globular transition objects (dgtos). we find that allseven compact galaxies require a two-component fit to their light profile andhave measured velocity dispersions that exceed those expected for typicalearly-type galaxies at their luminosity. from our structural parameter analysiswe conclude that three of the sample should be classified as compactellipticals or m32-like galaxies, the remaining four being less extremesystems. the three compact ellipticals are all found to have old luminosityweighted ages (&gt; 12 gyr), intermediate metallicities (-0.6 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; -0.1) andhigh [mg/fe] (&gt; 0.25). our findings support a tidal stripping scenario as theformation mode of compact galaxies covering the luminosity range studied here.we speculate that at least two early-type morphologies may serve as theprogenitor of compact galaxies in clusters.

0910.3877	access: nir luminosity function and stellar mass function of galaxies in  the shapley supercluster environment	we present the nir luminosity (lf) and stellar mass functions (smf) ofgalaxies in the core of the shapley supercluster at z=0.048, based on newk-band observations in conjunction with b- and r-band photometry and asubsample of ~650 galaxies spectroscopically confirmed supercluster members,allowing to investigate the galaxies down to m_k^*+6 and m=10^8.75 m_sun. forthe 3 deg^2 field the k-band lf is described by a schechter function withm_k^*=-24.96+-0.10 and \alpha=-1.42+-0.03. we investigate the effect ofenvironment by deriving the lf in three regions selected according to the localgalaxy density, and observe a significant increase in the faint-end slope goingfrom the high- (\alpha=-1.33) to the low-density (\alpha=-1.49) environments.the smf is fitted well by a schechter function with log_10(m^*)=11.16+-0.04 and\alpha=-1.20+-0.02. the smf of supercluster galaxies is also characterised byan excess of massive galaxies that are associated to the cluster bcgs. whilethe value of m* depends on environment the slope of the galaxy smf does notvary with the environment. by comparing our findings with cosmologicalsimulations, we conclude that the environmental dependences of the lf are notprimary due to variations in the merging histories, but to processes which arenot treated in the semi-analytical models, such as tidal stripping orharassment. in field regions the smf shows a sharp upturn below m=10^9 m_sun,close to our mass limit, suggesting that the upturns seen in our k-band lfs,but not in the smf, are due to this dwarf population. the environmentalvariations seen in the faint-end of the k-band lf suggests that dwarf galaxies,which are easier to strip than their more massive counterparts, are affected bytidal/gas stripping upon entering the supercluster.

1003.4250	grb 090902b: afterglow observations and implications	the optical-infrared afterglow of the lat-detected long duration burst, grb090902b, has been observed by several instruments. the earliest detection byrotse-iiia occurred 80 minutes after detection by the gbm instrument onboardthe fermi gamma-ray space telescope, revealing a bright afterglow and a decayslope suggestive of a reverse shock origin. subsequent optical-ir observationsfollowed the light curve for 6.5 days. the temporal and spectral behavior atoptical-infrared frequencies is consistent with synchrotron fireball modelpredictions; the cooling break lies between optical and xrt frequencies ~ 1.9days after the burst. the inferred electron energy index is $p = 1.8 \pm 0.2$,which would however imply an x-ray decay slope flatter than observed. the xrtand lat data have similar spectral indices and the observed steeper value ofthe lat temporal index is marginally consistent with the predicted temporaldecay in the radiative regime of the forward shock model. absence of a jetbreak during the first 6 days implies a collimation-corrected $\gamma$-rayenergy $e_{\gamma} &gt; 2.2\times10^{52}\rm$ ergs, one of the highest ever seen ina long-duration grbs. more events combining gev photon emission withmulti-wavelength observations will be required to constrain the nature of thecentral engine powering these energetic explosions and to explore thecorrelations between energetic quanta and afterglow emission.

1009.4361	grb 090313 and the origin of optical peaks in grb light curves:  implications for lorentz factors and radio flares	we use a sample of 19 gamma ray bursts (grbs) that exhibit single-peakedoptical light curves to test the standard fireball model by investigating therelationship between the time of the onset of the afterglow and the temporalrising index. our sample includes grbs and x-ray flashes for which we derive awide range of initial lorentz factors ($40 &lt; \gamma &lt; 450$). using plausiblemodel parameters the typical frequency of the forward shock is expected to lieclose to the optical band; within this low typical frequency framework, we usethe optical data to constrain $\epsilon_e$ and show that values derived fromthe early time light curve properties are consistent with published typicalvalues derived from other afterglow studies. we produce expected radio lightcurves by predicting the temporal evolution of the expected radio emission fromforward and reverse shock components, including synchrotron self-absorptioneffects at early time. although a number of the grbs in this sample do not havepublished radio measurements, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodin the case of {\it swift} grb 090313, for which millimetric and centrimetricobservations were available, and conclude that future detections ofreverse-shock radio flares with new radio facilities such as the evla and almawill test the low frequency model and provide constraints on magnetic models.

1012.0449	uv-ir luminosity functions and stellar mass functions of galaxies in the  shapley supercluster core	we present a panchromatic study of luminosity functions (lfs) and stellarmass functions (smfs) of galaxies in the core of the shapley supercluster atz=0.048, in order to investigate how the dense environment affects the galaxyproperties, such as star formation (sf) or stellar masses. we find that whilefaint-end slopes of optical and nir lfs steepen with decreasing density, noenvironment effect is found in the slope of the smfs. this suggests thatmechanisms transforming galaxies in different environments are mainly relatedto the quench of sf rather than to mass-loss. the near-uv (nuv) and far-uv(fuv) lfs obtained have steeper faint-end slopes than the local fieldpopulation, while the 24$\mu$m and 70$\mu$m galaxy lfs for the shapleysupercluster have shapes fully consistent with those obtained for the localfield galaxy population. this apparent lack of environmental dependence for theinfrared (ir) lfs suggests that the bulk of the star-forming galaxies that makeup the observed cluster ir lf have been recently accreted from the field andhave yet to have their sf activity significantly affected by the clusterenvironment.

1012.1466	a tale of two grb-sne at a common redshift of z = 0.54	we present ground-based and hst optical observations of the opticaltransients (ots) of long-duration gamma ray bursts (grbs) 060729 and 090618,both at a redshift of z = 0.54. for grb 060729, bumps are seen in the opticallight curves (lcs), and the late-time broadband spectral energy distributions(seds) of the ot resemble those of local type ic supernovae (sne). for grb090618, the dense sampling of our optical observations has allowed us to detectwell-defined bumps in the optical lcs, as well as a change in colour, that areindicative of light coming from a core-collapse sn. the accompanying sne forboth events are individually compared with sn1998bw, a known grb-supernova, andsn1994i, a typical type ic supernova without a known grb counterpart, and inboth cases the brightness and temporal evolution more closely resemblesn1998bw. we also exploit our extensive optical and radio data for grb 090618,as well as the publicly-available swift -xrt data, and discuss the propertiesof the afterglow at early times. in the context of a simple jet-like model, theafterglow of grb 090618 is best explained by the presence of a jet-break att-to &gt; 0.5 days. we then compare the rest-frame, peak v -band absolutemagnitudes of all of the grb and x-ray flash (xrf)-associated sne with a largesample of local type ibc sne, concluding that, when host extinction isconsidered, the peak magnitudes of the grb/xrf-sne cannot be distinguished fromthe peak magnitudes of non-grb/xrf sne.

1105.1591	a faint optical flash in dust-obscured grb 080603a - implications for  grb prompt emission mechanisms	we report the detection of a faint optical flash by the 2-m faulkes telescopenorth simultaneously with the second of two prompt gamma-ray pulses in integralgamma-ray burst (grb) 080603a, beginning at t_rest = 37 s after the onset ofthe grb. this optical flash appears to be distinct from the subsequent emergingafterglow emission, for which we present comprehensive broadband radio to x-raylight curves to 13 days post-burst and rigorously test the standard fireballmodel. the intrinsic extinction toward grb 080603a is high (a_v,z = 0.8 mag),and the well-sampled x-ray-to-near-infrared spectral energy distribution isinteresting in requiring an lmc2 extinction profile, in contrast to themajority of grbs. comparison of the gamma-ray and extinction-corrected opticalflux densities of the flash rules out an inverse-compton origin for the promptgamma-rays; instead, we suggest that the optical flash could originate from theinhomogeneity of the relativistic flow. in this scenario, a large velocityirregularity in the flow produces the prompt gamma-rays, followed by a milderinternal shock at a larger radius that would cause the optical flash. flatgamma-ray spectra, roughly f propto nu^-0.1, are observed in many grbs. if theflat spectrum extends down to the optical band in grb 080603a, the opticalflare could be explained as the low-energy tail of the gamma-ray emission. ifthis is indeed the case, it provides an important clue to understanding thenature of the emission process in the prompt phase of grbs and highlights theimportance of deep (r&gt; 20 mag), rapid follow-up observations capable ofdetecting faint, prompt optical emission.

1107.3352	constraining grb emission physics with extensive early-time, multiband  follow-up	understanding the origin and diversity of emission processes responsible forgamma-ray bursts (grbs) remains a pressing challenge. while prompt andcontemporaneous panchromatic observations have the potential to testpredictions of the internal-external shock model, extensive multiband imaginghas been conducted for only a few grbs. we present rich, early-time, multibanddatasets for two \swift\ events, grb 110205a and grb 110213a. the former showsoptical emission since the early stages of the prompt phase, followed by thesteep rising in flux up to ~1000s after the burst ($t^{-\alpha}$ with$\alpha=-6.13 \pm 0.75$). we discuss this feature in the context of thereverse-shock scenario and interpret the following single power-law decay asbeing forward-shock dominated. polarization measurements, obtained with theringo2 instrument mounted on the liverpool telescope, also provide hints on thenature of the emitting ejecta. the latter event, instead, displays a verypeculiar optical to near-infrared lightcurve, with two achromatic peaks. inthis case, while the first peak is probably due to the onset of the afterglow,we interpret the second peak to be produced by newly injected material,signifying a late-time activity of the central engine.

1409.6467	the nature of the late achromatic bump in grb 120326a	the long ${\it swift}$ gamma-ray burst grb 120326a at redshift $z=1.798$exhibited a multi-band light curve with a striking feature: a late-time,long-lasting achromatic rebrightening, rarely seen in such events. peaking inoptical and x-ray bands $\sim 35$ ks ($\sim 12.5$ ks in the grb rest frame)after the 70-s grb prompt burst, the feature brightens nearly two orders ofmagnitude above the underlying optical power-law decay. modelling themultiwavelength light curves, we investigate possible causes of therebrightening in the context of the standard fireball model. we exclude a rangeof scenarios for the origin of this feature: reverse-shock flash, late-timeforward shock peak due to the passage of the maximal synchrotron frequencythrough the optical band, late central engine optical/x-ray flares, interactionbetween the expanding blast wave and a density enhancement in the circumburstmedium and gravitational microlensing. instead we conclude that the achromaticrebrightening may be caused by a refreshed forward shock or a geometricaleffect. in addition, we identify an additional component after the end of theprompt emission, that shapes the observed x-ray and optical light curvesdifferently, ruling out a single overall emission component to explain theobserved early time emission.

1410.1731	liverpool telescope 2: a new robotic facility for rapid transient  follow-up	the liverpool telescope is one of the world's premier facilities for timedomain astronomy. the time domain landscape is set to radically change in thecoming decade, with surveys such as lsst providing huge numbers of transientdetections on a nightly basis; transient detections across the electromagneticspectrum from other facilities such as svom, ska and cta; and the era of`multi-messenger astronomy', wherein events are detected vianon-electromagnetic means, such as gravitational wave emission. we describehere our plans for liverpool telescope 2: a new robotic telescope designed tocapitalise on this new era of time domain astronomy. lt2 will be a 4-metreclass facility co-located with the lt at the observatorio del roque de losmuchachos on the canary island of la palma. the telescope will be designed forextremely rapid response: the aim is that the telescope will take data within30 seconds of the receipt of a trigger from another facility. the motivationfor this is twofold: firstly it will make it a world-leading facility for thestudy of fast fading transients and explosive phenomena discovered at earlytimes. secondly, it will enable large-scale programmes of low-to-intermediateresolution spectral classification of transients to be performed with greatefficiency. in the target-rich environment of the lsst era, minimisingacquisition overheads will be key to maximising the science gains from anyfollow-up programme. the telescope will have a diverse instrument suite whichis simultaneously mounted for automatic changes, but it is envisaged that theprimary instrument will be an intermediate resolution, optical/infraredspectrograph for scientific exploitation of transients discovered with the nextgeneration of synoptic survey facilities. in this paper we outline the corescience drivers for the telescope, and the requirements for the optical andmechanical design.

0804.0811	the early-time optical properties of gamma-ray burst afterglows	we present a multiwavelength analysis of 63 gamma-ray bursts observed withthe world's three largest robotic optical telescopes, the liverpool and faulkestelescopes (north and south). optical emission was detected for 24 grbs withbrightnesses ranging from r = 10 to 22 mag in the first 10 minutes after theburst. by comparing optical and x-ray light curves from t = 100 to about 10^6seconds, we introduce four main classes, defined by the presence or absence oftemporal breaks at optical and/or x-ray wavelengths. while 15/24 grbs can bemodelled with the forward-shock model, explanation of the remaining nine isvery challenging in the standard framework even with the introduction of energyinjection or an ambient density gradient. early x-ray afterglows, even segmentsof light curves described by a power-law, may be due to additional emissionfrom the central engine. 39 grbs in our sample were not detected and have deepupper limits (r &lt; 22 mag) at early time. of these, only ten were identified byother facilities, primarily at near infrared wavelengths, resulting in a darkburst fraction of about 50%. additional emission in the early time x-rayafterglow due to late-time central engine activity may also explain some darkbursts by making the bursts brighter than expected in the x-ray band comparedto the optical band.

1504.00262	kinematic and thermal structure at the onset of high-mass star formation	we want to understand the kinematic and thermal properties of young massivegas clumps prior to and at the earliest evolutionary stages of high-mass starformation. do we find signatures of gravitational collapse? do we findtemperature gradients in the vicinity or absence of infrared emission sources?do we find coherent velocity structures toward the center of the dense and coldgas clumps? to determine kinematics and gas temperatures, we used ammonia,because it is known to be a good tracer and thermometer of dense gas. weobserved the nh$_3$(1,1) and (2,2) lines within seven very young high-massstar-forming regions with the vla and the effelsberg 100m telescope. thisallows us to study velocity structures, linewidths, and gas temperatures athigh spatial resolution of 3-5$"$, corresponding to $\sim$0.05 pc. we find onaverage cold gas clumps with temperatures in the range between 10 k and 30 k.the observations do not reveal a clear correlation between infrared emissionpeaks and ammonia temperature peaks. we report an upper limit for the linewidthof $\sim$1.3 km s$^{-1}$, at the spectral resolution limit of our vlaobservation. this indicates a relatively low level of turbulence on the scaleof the observations. velocity gradients are present in almost all regions withtypical velocity differences of 1 to 2 km s$^{-1}$ and gradients of 5 to 10 kms$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$. these velocity gradients are smooth in most cases, butthere is one exceptional source (isoss23053), for which we find severalvelocity components with a steep velocity gradient toward the clump centersthat is larger than 30 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$. this steep velocity gradient isconsistent with recent models of cloud collapse. furthermore, we report aspatial correlation of ammonia and cold dust, but we also find decreasingammonia emission close to infrared emission sources.

0805.1557	grb 080319b: a naked-eye stellar blast from the distant universe	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) release copious amounts of energyacross the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and so provide a window into theprocess of black hole formation from the collapse of a massive star. over thelast forty years, our understanding of the grb phenomenon has progresseddramatically; nevertheless, fortuitous circumstances occasionally arise thatprovide access to a regime not yet probed. grb 080319b presented such anopportunity, with extraordinarily bright prompt optical emission that peaked ata visual magnitude of 5.3, making it briefly visible with the naked eye. it wascaptured in exquisite detail by wide-field telescopes, imaging the burstlocation from before the time of the explosion. the combination of these uniqueoptical data with simultaneous gamma-ray observations provides powerfuldiagnostics of the detailed physics of this explosion within seconds of itsformation. here we show that the prompt optical and gamma-ray emissions fromthis event likely arise from different spectral components within the samephysical region located at a large distance from the source, implying anextremely relativistic outflow. the chromatic behaviour of the broadbandafterglow is consistent with viewing the grb down the very narrow inner core ofa two-component jet that is expanding into a wind-like environment consistentwith the massive star origin of long grbs. these circumstances can explain theextreme properties of this grb.

astro-ph;0012375	the 2df qso redshift survey - ii. structure and evolution at high  redshift	we present a clustering analysis of qsos over the redshift range z=0.3-2.9.we use a sample of 10558 qsos taken from the preliminary catalogue of the 2dfqso redshift survey (2qz). the two-point redshift-space correlation function ofqsos is shown to follow a power law on scales s~1-35h-1mpc. fitting a power lawto qso clustering averaged over the redshift interval 0.3&lt;z&lt;2.9 we finds_0=3.99+0.28-0.34h-1mpc and gamma=1.58+0.10-0.09 for an einstein-de sittercosmology (eds). with omega_0=0.3 and lambda_0=0.7 the power law extends tos~60h-1mpc with a best fit of s_0=5.69+0.42-0.50h-1mpc andgamma=1.56+0.10-0.09. these values, measured at a mean redshift of z=1.49, arecomparable to the clustering of local optically selected galaxies. we measurethe evolution of qso clustering as a function of redshift. for an eds cosmologythere is no evolution in comoving coordinates over the redshift range of the2qz. for omega_0=0.3 and lambda_0=0.7 qso clustering shows a marginal increaseat high redshift. although the clustering of qsos is measured on large scaleswhere linear theory should apply, the evolution of qso clustering does notfollow the linear theory predictions for growth via gravitational instability(rejected at the &gt;99 per cent confidence level). a redshift dependent bias isrequired to reconcile qso clustering observations with theory. a simple biasingmodel, in which qsos have cosmologically long lifetimes (or alternatively formin peaks above a constant threshold in the density field) is acceptable in aneds cosmology, but is only marginally acceptable if omega_0=0.3 andlambda_0=0.7. biasing models which assume qsos form over a range in redshift,based on the press-schechter formalism are approximately consistent with qsoclustering evolution (abridged).

astro-ph;0106012	the 2df qso redshift survey - vi. measuring lambda and beta from  redshift-space distortions in the power spectrum	when the 2df qso redshift survey (2qz) is complete, a powerful geometric testfor the cosmological constant will be available. by comparing the clusteringalong and across the line of sight and modelling the effects of peculiarvelocities and bulk motions in redshift space, geometric distortions, whichoccur if the wrong cosmology is assumed, can be detected.  in this paper we investigate the effect of geometric and redshift-spacedistortions in the power spectrum parallel and perpendicular to the observer'sline of sight. ballinger et al. developed a model to estimate the cosmologicalconstant, $\lambda$, and the important parameter $\beta \approx\omega_m^{0.6}/b$ from these distortions. we apply this model to a detailedsimulation of the final 25k 2qz, produced using the virgo consortium's huge{\it hubble volume} n-body $\lambda$-cdm light cone simulation. we confirm theconclusions of ballinger et al.; the shape of the redshift-space and geometricdistortions are very similar. when all the uncertainties are taken into accountwe find that only a joint $\lambda - \beta$ constraint is possible.  by combining this result with a second constraint based on mass clusteringevolution, however, we can make significant progress. we predict that thismethod should allow us to constrain $\beta$ to approximately $\pm0.1$, and$\omega_{m}$ to $\pm0.25$ using the final catalogue. we apply the method to the2qz catalogue of 10000 qsos and find that this incomplete catalogue marginallyfavours a $\lambda$ cosmology.

astro-ph;0107348	the 2df qso redshift survey - vii. constraining cosmology from redshift  space distortions via xi(sigma,pi)	we describe a method from which cosmology may be constrained from the 2qzsurvey. by comparing clustering properties parallel and perpendicular to theline of sight and by modeling the effects of redshift space distortions, we areable to study geometric distortions in the clustering pattern which occur if awrong cosmology is assumed when translating redshifts into comoving distances.  using mock 2qz catalogues, drawn from the hubble volume simulation, we find,that there is a degeneracy between the geometric and the redshift-spacedistortions that makes it difficult to obtain an unambiguous estimate ofomega_{m}(0) from the geometric tests alone. however, we demonstrate a newmethod to determine the cosmology which works by combining the above geometrictest with a test based on the evolution of the qso clustering amplitude. wefind that we are able to break the degeneracy and that independent constraintsto +-20% (1 sigma) accuracy on omega_{m}(0) and +-10% (1 sigma) accuracy onbeta_{qso}(z) should be possible in the full 2qz survey.  finally we apply the method to the 10k catalogue of 2qz qsos. the smallernumber of qsos and the current status of the survey mean that a strong resulton cosmology is not possible but we do constrain beta_{qso}(z) to 0.35+-0.2. bycombining this constraint with the further constraint available from theamplitude of qso clustering, we find tentative evidence favouring a model withnon-zero omega_{lambda}(0), although an omega_{m}(0)=1 model provides only amarginally less good fit. a model with omega_{lambda}(0)=1 is ruled out. theresults are in agreement with those found by outram et al. using a similaranalysis in fourier space.

astro-ph;0211624	the 2df qso redshift survey - x. lensing of background qsos by galaxy  groups	we cross-correlate qsos from the 2df survey with galaxy groups. the galaxysamples are limited to b &lt; 20.5. we use an objective algorithm to detect galaxygroups. a 3sigma anti-correlation is observed between qsos and galaxy groups.this paucity of faint qsos around groups is neither a selection effect nor dueto restrictions on the placement of 2df fibres. by observing the colours ofqsos on the scales of the anti-correlation, we limit dust in galaxy groups,finding a maximum reddening of e(b_j-r) &lt; 0.012 at the 95% level. the smallamount of dust thus inferred is insufficient to cause the anti-correlation,supporting the suggestion by croom &amp; shanks that the signal is due togravitational lensing. the possibility remains that tailored dust models, suchas grey dust, heavy patches of dust or a combination of dust and lensing, couldexplain the anti-correlation. assuming the signal is caused by lensing ratherthan dust, we measure the average velocity dispersion of a singular isothermalsphere that would cause the anti-correlation as around 1150 km/s. simulationsreject 600 km/s at the 5% significance level. we also model foreground lensesas nfw haloes and measure the typical mass within 1.5 mpc/h of the halo centreas m_{1.5} = (1.2 +/- 0.9) x 10^{15} solarmasses/h. regardless of whether weutilise a sis or nfw dark matter profile, our model favours more mass in groupsthan accounted for in a universe with density parameter omega_m = 0.3. detailedsimulations and galaxy group redshifts will significantly reduce the currentsystematic uncertainties in these $\omega_m$ estimates. reducing the remaininguncertainty will require larger qso and galaxy group surveys (abridged).

astro-ph;0302280	the 2df qso redshift survey - xi. the qso power spectrum	we present a power spectrum analysis of the final 2df qso redshift surveycatalogue containing 22652 qsos. utilising the huge volume probed by the qsos,we can accurately measure power out to scales of ~500mpc and derive newconstraints, at z~1.4, on the matter and baryonic contents of the universe.importantly, these new cosmological constraints are derived at an intermediateepoch between the cmb observations at z~1000, and local (z~0) studies oflarge-scale structure; the average qso redshift corresponds to a look-back timeof approximately two-thirds of the age of the universe. we find that theamplitude of clustering of the qsos at z~1.4 is similar to that of present daygalaxies. the power spectra of the qsos at high and low redshift are comparedand we find little evidence for any evolution in the amplitude. assuming alambda cosmology to derive the comoving distances, r(z), to the qsos, the powerspectrum derived can be well described by a model with shape parametergamma=0.13+-0.02. if an einstein-de sitter model r(z) is instead assumed, aslightly higher value of gamma=0.16+-0.03 is obtained. a comparison with thehubble volume lcdm simulation shows very good agreement over the whole range ofscales considered. a standard (omega_m=1) cdm model, however, predicts a muchhigher value of gamma than is observed, and it is difficult to reconcile such amodel with these data. we fit cdm model power spectra (assuming scale-invariantinitial fluctuations), convolved with the survey window function, and correctedfor redshift space distortions, and find that models with baryon oscillationsare slightly preferred, with the baryon fraction omega_b/omega_m=0.18+-0.10.the overall shape of the power spectrum provides a strong constraint onomega_m*h (where h is the hubble parameter), with omega_m*h=0.19+-0.05.

astro-ph;0304290	ghosts of the milky way: a search for topology in new quasar catalogues	we revisit the possibility that we inhabit a compact multi-connected flat, ornearly-flat, universe. analysis of cobe data has shown that, for such a case,the size of the fundamental domain must be a substantial fraction of thehorizon size. nevertheless, there could be several copies of the universewithin the horizon. if the milky way was once a quasar we might detect its`ghost' images. using new large quasar catalogues we repeat the search byfagundes &amp; wichoski for antipodal quasar pairs. by applying linear theory toaccount for the peculiar velocity of the local group, we are able to narrow thesearch radius to 134 arcsec. we find seven candidate antipodal quasar pairswithin this search radius. however, a similar number would be expected bychance. we argue that, even with larger quasar catalogues, and more accuratevalues of the cosmological parameters, it is unlikely to be possible toidentify putative ghost pairs unambiguously, because of the uncertainty of thecorrection for peculiar motion of the milky way.

astro-ph;0304541	emission line widths and qso black hole mass estimates from the 2df qso  redshift survey	we have used composite spectra generated from more than 22000 qsos observedin the course of the 2df and 6df qso redshift surveys to investigate therelationship between the velocity width of emission lines and qso luminosity.we find that the velocity width of the broad emission lines hbeta, hgamma,mgii, ciii] and civ are correlated with the continuum luminosity, with asignificance of more than 99 per cent. of the major narrow emission lines([oiii] 5007, [oii] 3727, neiii 3870 and nev 3426) only [oiii] exhibits asignificant correlation between line width and luminosity. assuming that thegas is moving in keplerian orbits and that the radius of the broad line regionis related to the qso continuum luminosity, we use the velocity widths of thebroad lines to derive average black hole masses for the qsos contributing tothe composite spectra. the resultant qso mass-luminosity relationship isconsistent with m ~ l^0.97+-0.16. we find that the correlation between linewidth and redshift, if present, must be weak, and only civ shows significantevidence of evolution. this enables us to constrain the redshift evolution ofthe black hole mass-luminosity ratio to be ~(1+z)^beta with beta ~&lt; 1, muchless than the ~(1+z)^3 evolution seen in qso luminosity evolution. assumingthat the motion of the broad line region gas is keplerian and that its radiusdepends on the qso luminosity, our models indicate that the observed weakredshift dependence is too small for the observed qso luminosity function to bedue to the evolution of a single long-lived population of sources.

astro-ph;0403065	200 mpc sized structure in the 2df qso redshift survey	the completed 2df qso redshift (2qz) survey has been used to search forextreme large-scale cosmological structure (around 200 mpc) over the redshiftrange 0&lt;z&lt;2.5. we demonstrate that statistically significant overdensities andunderdensities do exist and hence represent the detection of cosmologicalfluctuations on comoving scales that correspond to those presently detected inthe cosmic microwave background. however, the fractional overdensities onscales &gt;100mpc are in the linear or only weakly non-linear regime and do notrepresent collapsed non-linear structures. we compare the measurements with theexpectation of a standard lcdm model by measuring the variance of counts incells and find that, provided the distribution of qsos on large scales exhibitsa mild bias with respect to the distribution of dark matter, the observedfluctuations are found to be in good agreement with the model. there is noevidence on such scales for any extreme structures that might require, forexample, departures from the assumption of gaussian initial perturbations. thusthe power-spectrum derived from the 2qz survey appears to provide a completedescription of the distribution of qsos. the amount of bias and its redshiftdependence that is required is consistent with that found from studying theclustering of 2qz qsos on 10 mpc scales, and may be adequately described by anapproximately redshift-invariant power spectrum with normalisation sigma_8=1.0corresponding to a bias at z=0 of b=1.1 rising to b=2 at the survey's meanredshift z=1.5.

astro-ph;0409314	the 2df qso redshift survey - xiv. structure and evolution from the  two-point correlation function	we present a clustering analysis of qsos using over 20000 objects from thefinal catalogue of the 2df qso redshift survey (2qz), measuring the z-spacecorrelation function, xi(s). when averaged over the range 0.3&lt;z&lt;2.2 we findthat xi(s) is flat on small scales, steepening on scales above ~25h-1mpc. in awmap/2df cosmology we find a best fit power law with s_0=5.48+0.42-0.48h-1mpcand gamma=1.20+-0.10 on scales s=1-25h-1mpc. a cdm model assuming wmap/2dfcosmological parameters is a good description of the qso xi(s) after accountingfor non-linear clustering and z-space distortions, and a linear bias ofb_qso(z=1.35)=2.02+-0.07. we subdivide the 2qz into 10 redshift intervals fromz=0.53 to 2.48 and find a significant increase in clustering amplitude at highredshift in the wmap/2df cosmology. we derive the bias of the qsos which is astrong function of redshift with b_qso(z=0.53)=1.13+-0.18 andb_qso(z=2.48)=4.24+-0.53. we use these bias values to derive the mean darkmatter halo (dmh) mass occupied by the qsos. at all redshifts 2qz qsos inhabitapproximately the same mass dmhs with m_dh=(3.0+-1.6)x10^12h-1m_sun, which isclose to the characteristic mass in the press-schechter mass function, m*, atz=0. if the relation between black hole (bh) mass and m_dh or host velocitydispersion does not evolve, then we find that the accretion efficiency(l/l_edd) for l* qsos is approximately constant with redshift. thus the fadingof the qso population from z~2 to 0 appears to be due to less massive bhs beingactive at low redshift. we apply different methods to estimate, t_qso, theactive lifetime of qsos and constrain this to be in the range 4x10^6-6x10^8years at z~2.

astro-ph;0502481	on statistical lensing and the anti-correlation between 2df qsos and  foreground galaxies	we cross-correlate apm and sdss galaxies with background qsos from the 2dfqso redshift survey, and detect a significant (2.8sigma) anti-correlation. thelack of a signal between 2df stars and our galaxy samples suggests theanti-correlation is not due to a systematic error. the possibility that dust inthe foreground galaxies could produce the anti-correlation is marginallyrejected, at the 2sigma level through consideration of qso colours. it ispossible that dust that obscures qsos without reddening them, or preferentiallydiscards reddened qsos from the 2qz sample, could produce such ananti-correlation, however, such models are at odds with the positive qso-galaxycorrelations found at bright magnitudes by other authors. our detection of agalaxy-qso anti-correlation is consistent with statistical lensing theory. whencombined with earlier results that have reported a positive galaxy-qsocorrelation, a consistent, compelling picture emerges that spans faint andbright qso samples showing positive or negative correlations according to theqso n(m) slope. we find that galaxies are highly anti-biased on small scales.we consider two models that use different descriptions of the lensing matterand find they yield consistent predictions for the strength of galaxy bias on0.1mpc/h scales of b~0.1 (for lcdm). whilst the slope of our power-law fit tothe qso-galaxy cross-correlation does not rule out linear bias, when we compareour measurement of b on 100 kpc/h scales to independent methods that determineb~1 on mpc/h scales, we conclude that bias, on these small scales, isscale-dependent. these results indicate more mass, at least on the 100 kpc/hscales probed, than predicted by simple lcdm biasing prescriptions, and canthus constrain halo occupation models of the galaxy distribution.

astro-ph;0504438	the 2df qso redshift survey - xv. correlation analysis of redshift-space  distortions	we analyse the redshift-space (z-space) distortions of qso clustering in the2df qso redshift survey (2qz). to interpret the z-space correlation function,xi(sigma,pi), we require an accurate model for the qso real-space correlationfunction, xi(r). although a single power-law xi(r) model fits the projectedcorrelation function (wp(sigma)) at small scales, it implies somewhat tooshallow a slope for both wp(sigma) and the z-space correlation function, xi(s),at larger scales &gt; 20 h^(-1) mpc. motivated by the form for xi(r) seen in the2df galaxy redshift survey (2dfgrs) and in standard lcdm predictions, we use adouble power-law model for xi(r) which gives a good fit to xi(s) and wp(sigma).the model is parametrized by a slope of gamma=1.45 for 1&lt;r&lt;10 h^(-1) mpc andgamma=2.30 for 10&lt;r&lt;40 h^(-1) mpc. as found for 2dfgrs, the value of betadetermined from the ratio of xi(s)/xi(r) depends sensitively on the form ofxi(r) assumed. with our double power-law form for xi(r), we measurebeta(z=1.4)=0.32(+0.09)(-0.11). assuming the same model for xi(r) we thenanalyse the z-space distortions in the 2qz xi(sigma,pi) and put constraints onthe values of omega m and beta(z=1.4), using an improved version of the methodof hoyle et al. the constraints we derive are omega m=0.35(+0.19)(-0.13),beta(z=1.4)=0.50(+0.13)(-0.15), in agreement with our xi(s)/\xi(r) results atthe ~1 sigma level.

astro-ph;9506093	the environments of z&lt;0.3 qsos	we have carried out an investigation of the galaxy environments of lowredshift ($z&lt;0.3$) qsos by cross-correlating the positions on the sky ofx-ray-selected qsos/agn identified in the {\it einstein} medium sensitivitysurvey (emss) with those of $b_j&lt;20.5$ galaxies in the apm galaxy catalogues.at $&lt;5\,$arcmin, we find a significant ($5\sigma$) galaxy excess around $z&lt;0.3$qsos. the amplitude of the low redshift ($z&lt;0.3$) qso-galaxy angularcross-correlation function is identical to that of the apm galaxy angularcorrelation function, implying that these (predominantly radio-quiet) qsosinhabit environments similar to those of normal galaxies. no significant galaxyexcess was found around a `control' sample of $z&gt;0.3$ qsos. coupled withprevious observations, these results imply that the environment of radio-quietqsos undergoes little evolution over a wide range in redshift ($0 less than zless than 1.5$). this is in marked contrast to the rapid increase in therichness of the environments associated with radio-loud qsos over the sameredshift range. the similarity between qso-galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxyclustering also suggests that qsos are unbiased with respect to galaxies andmake useful tracers of large-scale structure in the universe.

astro-ph;9701155	peculiar motions of clusters in the perseus-pisces region	we present results of a new study of peculiar motions of 7 clusters in theperseus-pisces (pp) region, using the fundamental plane as a distanceindicator. the sample is calibrated by reference to 9 additional clusters withdata from the literature. careful attention is paid to the matching ofspectroscopic and photometric data from several sources. for six clusters inthe pp supercluster no significant peculiar motions are detected. for theseclusters we derive a bulk motion of 60 +/- 220 km/s, in the cmb frame, directedtowards the local group. this non-detection is in marginal conflict withprevious tully-fisher studies. two clusters in the background of thesupercluster exhibit significant negative peculiar velocities, characteristicof backside infall into pp. a bulk-flow fit to all 16 clusters reveals astatistically insignificant motion of 430 +/- 280 km/s towards l=265, b=26 (cmbframe). comparison with the velocity field predicted from the iras 1.2jy surveyyields \beta = 1.0 +/- 0.5. we find no evidence for residual bulk motionsgenerated by mass concentrations beyond the limiting depth of the iras densityfield.

astro-ph;9707025	galaxy clusters in the perseus-pisces region - i. spectroscopic and  photometric data for early-type galaxies	we present new spectroscopic and photometric data for 137 early-type galaxiesin nine clusters, and for a set of nearby standard galaxies. the clustersstudied are perseus (a0426), pisces, a0262, a0347, j8, hms0122+3305, 7s21,a2199 and a2634. our spectroscopic data comprise radial velocities (cz),central velocity dispersions (sigma) and magnesium line strength indices (mg).internal errors (derived from repeat observations) are 7.6% on each measurementof sigma, and 0.010 mag on each mg measurement. we correct the major publisheddatasets to a standard aperture size, and define a new `standard system' by theaperture-corrected lick data of davies et al. through extensiveintercomparisons with data from the literature, we present the correctionsrequired to bring the major published datasets onto the standard system. wedemonstrate that our new velocity dispersion data can be brought intoconsistency with the standard system, to an uncertainty of &lt;0.01 dex. fromr-band ccd photometry, we derive effective diameter (a_e), mean surfacebrightness within effective diameter (mu_e) and an r-band diameter equivalentto the d_n parameter of dressler et al. internal comparisons indicate anaverage error of 0.005 in each measurement of log(d_n). the combinationlog(a_e) - 0.3 mu_e, approximately the quantity used in the fundamental planedistance indicator, has an uncertainty of 0.006 per measurement. thephotometric data can be brought onto a system consistent with external data atthe level of 0.5% in distance. these data will be used in a companion paper toderive distance and peculiar velocity estimates for the nine clusters studied.(abridged)

astro-ph;9707026	galaxy clusters in the perseus-pisces region - ii. the peculiar velocity  field	we have measured the mean peculiar motions of 103 early-type galaxies in 7clusters in the perseus-pisces (pp) ridge or pp background, and a further 249such galaxies in 9 calibrating clusters from the literature, using the inversefundamental plane relation. this relation is found to have a distance error of20% per galaxy. none of the 6 clusters in the pp ridge has a significant motionwith respect to the cmb frame, but the pp background cluster j8 shows marginalevidence of `backside infall' into the pp supercluster. the full 16 clustersample has a mean cmb-frame bulk motion of 420 +/- 280 km/s, towards l=262,b=-25. this result is consistent both with no bulk motion in the cmb frame andwith the ~350 km/s bulk motion found by courteau et al. it is inconsistent atthe 98% confidence level with the ~700 km/s bulk flow found by lauer &amp; postman(lp). the pp ridge clusters are found to have a small and statisticallyinsignificant mean radial motion with respect to the cmb frame: -60 +/- 220km/s. a comparison between our cluster peculiar velocities and the predictedpeculiar velocities from the iras 1.2 jy density field, smoothed on a 500 km/sscale, yields beta_i = omega^0.6/b_i = 0.95 +/- 0.48, consistent with previousresults. we find agreement between our peculiar motions and publishedtully-fisher results for the same clusters. the disagreement between the 11clusters common to our sample and that of lp, based on bcgs, is statisticallysignificant at the &gt;~ 99.7% confidence level indicating that the errors of oneor both of these data sets are underestimated. when the bcg distances correctedfor the x-ray luminosity of the host cluster are used, the disagreement isreduced to the ~94% confidence level.
