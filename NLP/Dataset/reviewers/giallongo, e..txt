0706.1669	the elongated structure of the hercules dsph from deep lbt imaging	we present a deep, wide-field photometric survey of the newly-discoveredhercules dwarf spheroidal galaxy, based on data from the large binoculartelescope. images in b, v and r were obtained with the large binocular cameracovering a 23' times 23' field of view to a magnitude of ~25.5 (5 sigma). thispermitted the construction of colour-magnitude diagrams that reachapproximately 1.5 magnitudes below the hercules main sequence turnoff.three-filter photometry allowed us to preferentially select probable herculesmember stars, and examine the structure of this system at a previouslyunattained level. we find that the hercules dwarf is highly elongated (3:1),considerably more so than any other dsph satellite of the milky way except thedisrupting sagittarius dwarf. while we cannot rule out that the unusualstructure is intrinsic to hercules as an equilibrium system, our resultssuggest tidal disruption as a likely cause of this highly elliptical structure.given the relatively large galactocentric distance of this system (132 +/- 12kpc), signs of tidal disruption would require the hercules dwarf to be on ahighly eccentric orbit around the milky way.

0901.2898	the fraction of quiescent massive galaxies in the early universe	aims: the aim of this work is to collect a complete, mass--selected sample ofgalaxies with very low specific star formation rate, for a comparison with theprediction of recent theoretical models. method: we use the 24/k flux ratio,complemented by the sed fitting to the full 0.35-8.0 mum spectral distribution,to select quiescent galaxies from z~0.4 to z~4 in the goods--music sample. ourobservational selection can be translated into thresholds on the specific starformation rate sfr/m_*, that can be used to compare with the theoreticalpredictions. results: we find that, in the framework of the well known globaldecline of the quiescent fraction with redshift, a non-negligible fraction~15-20% of massive galaxies with very low specific star formation rate existsup to z~4, including a tail of "red&amp;dead" galaxies with sfr/m_*&lt;10^{-11}/yr.recent theoretical models vary to a large extent in the prediction of thefraction of galaxies with very low specific star formation rates, and areunable to provide a global match to our data.

0901.3540	uncertainties and systematic effects on the estimate of stellar masses  in high z galaxies	we discuss the uncertainties and the systematic effects that exist in theestimates of the stellar masses of high redshift galaxies, using broad bandphotometry, and how they affect the deduced galaxy stellar mass function. weuse at this purpose the latest version of the goods-music catalog. inparticular, we discuss the impact of different synthetic models, of the assumedinitial mass function and of the selection band. using charlot &amp; bruzual 2007and maraston 2005 models we find masses lower than those obtained from bruzual&amp; charlot 2003 models. in addition, we find a slight trend as a function of themass itself comparing these two mass determinations with that from bruzual &amp;charlot 2003 models. as consequence, the derived galaxy stellar mass functionsshow diverse shapes, and their slope depends on the assumed models. despitethese differences, the overall results and scenario remains unchanged. themasses obtained with the assumption of the chabrier initial mass function arein average 0.24 dex lower than those from the salpeter assumption, at allredshifts, causing a shift of galaxy stellar mass function of the same amount.finally, using a 4.5 um-selected sample instead of a ks-selected one, we add anew population of highly absorbed, dusty galaxies at z\simeq 2-3 of relativelylow masses, yielding stronger constraints on the slope of the galaxy stellarmass function at lower masses.

0903.3952	a comprehensive study of large scale structures in the goods-south field  up to z \sim 2.5	the aim of this paper is to identify and study the properties and galacticcontent of groups and clusters in the goods-south field up to z\sim2.5, and toanalyse the physical properties of galaxies as a continuous function ofenvironmental density up to high redshift. we use the deep (z850\sim26),multi-wavelength goods-music catalogue, which has a 15% of spectroscopicredshifts and accurate photometric redshifts for the remaining fraction. onthese data, we apply a (2+1)d algorithm, previously developed by our group,that provides an adaptive estimate of the 3d density field. we support ouranalysis with simulations to evaluate the purity and the completeness of thecluster catalogue produced by our algorithm. we find several high density peaksembedded in larger structures in the redshift range 0.4-2.5. from the analysisof their physical properties (mass profile, m200, \sigmav, lx, u-b vs. bdiagram), we derive that most of them are groups of galaxies, while two arepoor clusters with masses of few times 10^14 mo. for these two clusters wefind, from the chandra 2ms data, an x-ray emission significantly lower thanexpected from their optical properties, suggesting that the two clusters areeither not virialised or gas poor. we also analyse the dependance onenvironment of galaxy colours, luminosities, stellar masses, ages and starformations. we find that galaxies in high density regions are, on average, moreluminous and massive than field galaxies up to z\sim 2. the fraction of redgalaxies increases with luminosity and with density up to z\sim 1.2. at higherz this dependance on density disappears. the variation of galaxy properties asa function of redshift and density suggests that a significant change occurs atz\sim 1.5-2.

0905.0683	star formation and mass assembly in high redshift galaxies	we study the star formation and the mass assembly process of 0.3&lt;=z&lt;2.5galaxies using their ir emission from mips 24um band. we used an updatedversion of the goods-music catalog, extended by the addition of mid-ir fluxes.we compared two different estimators of the star formation rate: the totalinfrared emission derived from 24um, estimated using both synthetic andempirical ir templates, and the multiwavelength fit to the full galaxy sed. forboth estimates, we computed the sfr density and the specific sfr. the two sfrtracers are roughly consistent, given the uncertainties involved. however, theyshow a systematic trend, ir-based estimates exceeding the fit-based ones as thesfr increases. we show that: a) at z&gt;0.3, the sfr is well correlated withstellar mass, and this relationship seems to steepen with redshift (usingir-based sfrs); b) the contribution to the global sfrd by massive galaxiesincreases with redshift up to ~2.5, more rapidly than for galaxies of lowermass, but appears to flatten at higher z; c) despite this increase, the mostimportant contributors to the sfrd at any z are galaxies of about, orimmediately lower than, the characteristic stellar mass; d) at z~2, massivegalaxies are actively star-forming, with a median sfr 300 msun/yr. during thisepoch, they assemble a substantial part of their final stellar mass; e) thessfr shows a clear bimodal distribution. the analysis of the sfrd and the ssfrseems to support the downsizing scenario, according to which high mass galaxieshave formed their stars earlier and faster than their low mass counterparts. acomparison with theoretical models indicates that they follow the globalincrease in the ssfr with redshift and predict the existence of quiescentgalaxies even at z&gt;1.5, but they systematically underpredict the average ssfr.

0906.4035	wide and deep near-uv (360nm) galaxy counts and the extragalactic  background light with the large binocular camera	deep multicolour surveys are the main tool to explore the formation andevolution of the faint galaxies which are beyond the spectroscopic limit withthe present technology. the photometric properties of these faint galaxies areusually compared with current renditions of semianalytical models to provideconstraints on the fundamental physical processes involved in galaxy formationand evolution, namely the mass assembly and the star formation. galaxy countsover large sky areas in the near-uv band are important because they aredifficult to obtain given the low efficiency of near-uv instrumentation, evenat 8m class telescopes. a large instrumental field of view helps in minimizingthe biases due to the cosmic variance. we have obtained deep images in the360nm u band provided by the blue channel of the large binocular camera at theprime focus of the large binocular telescope. we have derived over an area of~0.4 sq. deg. the galaxy number counts down to u=27 in the vega system(corresponding to u=27.86 in the ab system) at a completeness level of 30%reaching the faintest current limit for this wavelength and sky area. the shapeof the galaxy counts in the u band can be described by a double power-law, thebright side being consistent with the shape of shallower surveys of comparableor greater areas. the slope bends over significantly at u&gt;23.5 ensuring theconvergence of the contribution by star forming galaxies to the ebl in thenear-uv band to a value which is more than 70% of the most recent upper limitsderived for this band. we have jointly compared our near-uv and k band countscollected from the literature with few selected hierarchical cdm modelsemphasizing critical issues in the physical description of the galaxy formationand evolution.

0707.1783	a photometrically detected forming cluster of galaxies at redshift 1.6  in the goods field	we report the discovery of a localized overdensity at z~1.6 in thegoods-south field, presumably a poor cluster in the process of formation. thethree-dimensional galaxy density has been estimated on the basis of wellcalibrated photometric redshifts from the multiband photometric goods-musiccatalog using the (2+1)d technique. the density peak is embedded in the largerscale overdensity of galaxies known to exist at z=1.61 in the area. theproperties of the member galaxies are compared to those of the surroundingfield and we found that the two populations are significantly differentsupporting the reality of the structure. the reddest galaxies, once evolvedaccording to their best fit models, have colors consistent with the redsequence of lower redshift clusters. the estimated m_200 total mass of thecluster is in the range 1.3 x 10^14 - 5.7x 10^14 msun, depending on the assumedbias factor b. an upper limit for the 2-10 kev x-ray luminosity, based on the1ms chandra observations, is l_x=0.5 x 10^43 erg s^-1, suggesting that thecluster has not yet reached the virial equilibrium.

1002.2068	physical and morphological properties of z~3 lbgs: dependence on lyalpha  line emission	we investigate the physical and morphological properties of lbgs at z ~2.5 to~3.5, to determine if and how they depend on the nature and strength of thelyalpha emission. we selected u-dropout galaxies from the z-detected goodsmusic catalog, by adapting the classical lyman break criteria on the goodsfilter set. we kept only those galaxies with spectroscopic confirmation, mainlyfrom vimos and fors public observations. using the full multi-wavelength14-bands photometry, we determined the physical properties of the galaxies,through a standard spectral energy distribution fitting with the updatedcharlot &amp; bruzual (2009) templates. we also added other relevant observations,i.e. the 24mu m observations from spitzer/mips and the 2 msec chandra x-rayobservations. finally, using non parametric diagnostics (gini, concentration,asymmetry, m_20 and ellipticity), we characterized the rest-frame uv morphologyof the galaxies. we then analyzed how these physical and morphologicalproperties correlate with the presence of the lyalpha line in the opticalspectra. we find that, unlike at higher redshift, the dependence of physicalproperties on the lyalpha line is milder: galaxies without lyalpha in emissiontend to be more massive and dustier than the rest of the sample, but all otherparameters, ages, sfrs, x-ray emission as well as uv morphology do not dependstrongly on the presence of the line emission. a simple scenario where all lbgshave intrinsically high lyalpha emission, but where dust and neutral hydrogencontent (which shape the final appearance of the lyalpha) depend on the mass ofthe galaxies, is able to reproduce the majority of the observed properties atz~3. some modification might be needed to account for the observed evolution ofthese properties with cosmic epoch, which is also discussed.

1009.1140	the great observatories origins deep survey: constraints on the lyman  continuum escape fraction distribution of lyman--break galaxies at 3.4&lt;z&lt;4.5	we use ultra-deep ultraviolet vlt/vimos intermediate-band and vlt/fors1narrow-band imaging in the goods southern field to derive limits on thedistribution of the escape fraction (f_esc) of ionizing radiation for l &gt;~l*(z=3) lyman break galaxies (lbgs) at redshift 3.4--4.5. only one lbg, atredshift z=3.795, is detected in its lyman continuum (lyc; s/n~5.5), thehighest redshift galaxy currently known with a direct detection. itsultraviolet morphology is quite compact (r_eff=0.8, kpc physical). three out ofseven agn are also detected in their lyc, including one at redshift z=3.951 andz850 = 26.1. from stacked data (lbgs) we set an upper limit to the averagef_esc in the range 5%--20%, depending on the how the data are selected (e.g.,by magnitude and/or redshift). we undertake extensive monte carlo simulationsthat take into account intergalactic attenuation, stellar population synthesismodels, dust extinction and photometric noise in order to explore the momentsof the distribution of the escaping radiation. various distributions(exponential, log-normal and gaussian) are explored. we find that the medianf_esc is lower than ~6% with an 84% percentile limit not larger than 20%. ifthis result remains valid for fainter lbgs down to current observationallimits, then the lbg population might be not sufficient to account for theentire photoionization budget at the redshifts considered here, with the exactdetails dependent upon the assumed ionizing background and qso contributionthereto. it is possible that f_esc depends on the uv luminosity of thegalaxies, with fainter galaxies having higher f_esc, and estimates of f_escfrom a sample of faint lbg from the hudf (i775&lt;28.5) are in broad quantitativeagreement with such a scenario.

1011.6569	a critical analysis of the uv luminosity function at redshift~7 from  deep wfc3 data	the study of the luminosity function (lf) of lyman break galaxies (lbgs) atz=7 is important for ascertaining their role in the reionization of theuniverse. we perform a detailed and critical analysis of the statistical andsystematic errors in the z~7 lf determination: we have assembled a large sampleof candidate lbgs at z~7 from different surveys, spanning a large variety ofareas and depths. in particular, we have combined data from the deep (j&lt;27.4)and ultradeep (j&lt;29.2) surveys recently acquired with the new wfc3 nir cameraon hst, over the goods-ers and the hudf fields, with ground based surveys inwide and shallow areas from vlt and subaru. we have used public acs images inthe z-band to select z-dropout galaxies, and other public data both in the blue(bvi) and in the red bands to reject possible low-redshift interlopers. we havecompared our results with extensive simulations to quantify the observationaleffects of our selection criteria as well as the effects of photometricscatter, color selections or the morphology of the candidates. we have foundthat the number density of faint lbgs at z~7 is only marginally sensitive tothe color selection adopted, but it is strongly dependent from the assumptionmade on the half light distributions of the simulated galaxies, used to correctthe observed sample for incompleteness. the slope of the faint end of the lbgslf has thus a rather large uncertainty, due to the unknown distribution ofphysical sizes of the z~7 lbgs. we conclude that galaxies at z~7 are unable toreionize the universe unless there is a significant evolution in the clumpinessof the igm or in the escape fraction of ionising photons or, alternatively,there is a large population of z~7 lbgs with large physical dimensions butstill not detected by the present observations.

(2011), wefind that our data require a change of the neutral hydrogen fraction of theorder delta chi_{hi} ~ 0.6 in a time delta z ~ 1, provided that the escapefraction does not increase dramatically over the same redshift interval.

1109.1757	the blue uv slopes of z~4 lyman break galaxies: implications for the  corrected star formation rate density	we plan to analyse dust extinction in lyman break galaxies (lbgs) byintroducing a new and more reliable approach to their selection and to thecharacterization of their distribution of uv slopes beta, using deep ir imagesfrom hst. we exploit deep wfc3 ir observations of the ers and hudf fields overgoods-south, combined with hst-acs optical data, to select z~4 lbgs through anew (b-v) vs. (v-h) colour diagram. the uv slope of the selected galaxies isrobustly determined by a linear fit over their observed i, z, y, j magnitudes,coherently with the original definition of beta. the same fit is used todetermine their rest-frame uv magnitudes m1600 through a simple interpolation.we estimate the effect of observational uncertainties with detailed simulationsthat we also exploit, under a parametric maximum-likelihood approach, toconstrain the probability density function of uv slopes pdf(beta) as a functionof rest-frame magnitude. we find 142 and 25 robust lbgs in the ers and hudffields respectively, limiting our sample to s/n(h)&gt;10 objects. our newlydefined criteria improve the selection of z~4 lbgs and allow us to exclude redinterlopers at lower redshift, especially z~3-3.5 objects. we find that z~4lbgs are characterized by blue uv slopes, suggesting a low dust extinction: alll&lt;l* galaxies have an average uv slope &lt;beta&gt;\simeq-2.1, while brighter objectsonly are slightly redder (&lt;beta&gt; -1.9). we find an intrinsic dispersion ~ 0.3for pdf(beta) at all magnitudes. the sfrd at z~4 corrected according to theseestimates turns out to be lower than previously found: log(sfrd)\simeq-1.09m_sun/yr/mpc^3. finally, we discuss how the uv slope of z~4 galaxies changes asa function of the dust-corrected uv magnitude (i.e. sfr) showing that mostgalaxies with a high sfr (&gt; 80 m_sun/yr) are highly extincted objects.[abridged]

1111.5728	the evolving slope of the stellar mass function at 0.6 &lt;= z &lt; 4.5 from  deep wfc3 data	we used early release science (ers) observations taken with the wide fieldcamera 3 (wfc3) in the goods-s field to study the galaxy stellar mass function(gsmf) at 0.6&lt;=z&lt;4.5. deep wfc3 near-ir data (for y as faint as 27.3, j and has faint as 27.4 ab mag at 5 sigma), as well as deep ks (as faint as 25.5 at 5sigma) hawk-i band data, provide an exquisite data set with which determine inan unprecedented way the low-mass end of the gsmf, allowing an accurate probeof masses as low as m~7.6 10^9 msun at z~3. although the area used isrelatively small (~33 arcmin^2), we found generally good agreement withprevious studies on the entire mass range. our results show that the slope ofthe faint-end increases with redshift, from alpha=-1.44+/-0.03 at z~0.8 toalpha=-1.86+/-0.16 at z~3, although indications exist that it does not steepenfurther between z~3 and z~4. this result is insensitive to any uncertainty inthe m* parameter. the steepness of the gsmf faint-end solves the well-knowndisagreement between the stellar mass density (smd) and the integrated starformation history at z&gt;2. however, we confirm the that there appears to be anexcess of integrated star formation with respect to the smd at z&lt;2, by a factorof ~2-3. our comparison of the observations with theoretical predictions showsthat the models forecast a greater abundance of low mass galaxies, at least upto z~3, as well as a dearth of massive galaxies at z~4 with respect to thedata, and that the predicted smd is generally overestimated at z&lt;~2.

0710.3704	the red and blue galaxy populations in the goods field: evidence for an  excess of red dwarfs	we study the evolution of the galaxy population up to z\sim3 as a function ofits colour properties. in particular, luminosity functions and luminositydensities have been derived as a function of redshift for the blue/late andred/early populations. we use data from the goods-music catalogue which havetypical magnitude limits z&lt;26 and ks&lt;23.5 for most of the sample. about 8% ofthe galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts; the remaining have well calibratedphotometric redshifts derived from the extremely wide multi-wavelength coveragein 14 bands (from the u band to the spitzer 8 \mu m band). we have derived acatalogue of galaxies complete in rest-frame b-band, which has been divided intwo subsamples according to their rest-frame u-v colour (or derived specificstar formation rate, ssfr) properties. we confirm a bimodality in the u-vcolour and ssfr of the galaxy sample up to z\sim 3. this bimodality is used tocompute the lfs of the blue/late and red/early subsamples. the lfs of theblue/late and total samples are well represented by steep schechter functionsevolving in luminosity with increasing redshifts. the volume density of the lfsof the red/early populations decreases with increasing redshift. the shape ofthe red/early lfs shows an excess of faint red dwarfs with respect to theextrapolation of a flat schechter function and can be represented by the sum oftwo schechter functions. our model for galaxy formation in the hierarchicalclustering scenario, which also includes external feedback due to a diffuse uvbackground, shows a general broad agreement with the lfs of both populations,the larger discrepancies being present at the faint end for the red population.hints on the nature of the red dwarf population are given on the basis of theirstellar mass and spatial distributions.

1206.2950	agns as main contributors to the uv ionizing emissivity at high  redshifts: predictions from a lambda-cdm model with linked agn/galaxy  evolution	we have evaluated the contribution of the agn population to the ionizationhistory of the universe based on a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation andevolution in the cdm cosmological scenario. the model connects the growth ofblack holes and of the ensuing agn activity to galaxy interactions. in themodel we have included a self consistent physical description of the escape ofionizing uv photons; this is based on the blast-wave model for the agn feedbackwe developed in a previous paper to explain the distribution of hydrogen columndensities in agns of various redshifts and luminosities, due to absorption bythe host galaxy gas. the model predicts uv luminosity functions for agns whichare in good agreement with those derived from the observations especially atlow and intermediate redshifts (z=3). at higher redshifts (z&gt;5) the model tendsto overestimate the data at faint luminosities. critical biases both in thedata and in the model are discussed to explain such apparent discrepancies. thepredicted hydrogen photoionization rate as a function of redshift is found tobe consistent with that derived from the observations. all that suggests toreconsider the role of the agns as the main driver of the ionization history ofthe universe.

0712.2239	go long, go deep: finding optical jet breaks for swift-era grbs with the  lbt	using the 8.4m large binocular telescope, we observed six grb afterglows from2.8 hours to 30.8 days after the burst triggers to systematically probe thelate time behaviors of afterglows including jet breaks, flares, and supernovabumps. we detected five afterglows with sloan r' magnitudes ranging from23.0-26.3 mag. the depth of our observations allows us to extend the temporalbaseline for measuring jet breaks by another decade in time scale. we detectedtwo jet breaks and a third candidate, all of which are not detectable withoutdeep, late time optical observations. in the other three cases, we do notdetect the jet breaks either because of contamination from the host galaxylight, the presence of a supernova bump, or the intrinsic faintness of theoptical afterglow.  this suggests that the basic picture that grbs are collimated is still validand that the apparent lack of swift jet breaks is due to poorly sampledafterglow light curves, particularly at late times.

0801.1474	the performance of the blue prime focus large binocular camera at the  large binocular telescope	we present the characteristics and some early scientific results of the firstinstrument at the large binocular telescope (lbt), the large binocular camera(lbc). each lbt telescope unit will be equipped with similar prime focuscameras. the blue channel is optimized for imaging in the uv-b bands and thered channel for imaging in the vriz bands. the corrected field-of-view of eachcamera is approximately 30 arcminutes in diameter, and the chip area isequivalent to a 23x23 arcmin2 field. in this paper we also present thecommissioning results of the blue channel. the scientific and technicalperformance of the blue channel was assessed by measurement of the astrometricdistortion, flat fielding, ghosts, and photometric calibrations. thesemeasurements were then used as input to a data reduction pipeline applied toscience commissioning data. the measurements completed during commissioningshow that the technical performance of the blue channel is in agreement withoriginal expectations. since the red camera is very similar to the blue one weexpect similar performance from the commissioning that will be performed in thefollowing months in binocular configuration. using deep uv image, acquiredduring the commissioning of the blue camera, we derived faint uv galaxy-countsin a ~500 sq. arcmin. sky area to u(vega)=26.5. these galaxy counts imply thatthe blue camera is the most powerful uv imager presently available and in thenear future in terms of depth and extent of the field-of-view. we emphasize thepotential of the blue camera to increase the robustness of the ugr multicolourselection of lyman break galaxies at redshift z~3.

0801.4027	the structural properties and star formation history of leo t from deep  lbt photometry	we present deep, wide-field g and r photometry of the transition type dwarfgalaxy leo t, obtained with the blue arm of the large binocular telescope. thedata confirm the presence of both very young (&lt;1 gyr) as well as much older (&gt;5gyr) stars. we study the structural properties of the old and young stellarpopulations by preferentially selecting either population based on their colorand magnitude. the young population is significantly more concentrated than theold population, with half-light radii of 104+-8 and 148+-16 pc respectively,and their centers are slightly offset. approximately 10% of the total stellarmass is estimated to be represented by the young stellar population. comparisonof the color-magnitude diagram (cmd) with theoretical isochrones as well asnumerical cmd-fitting suggest that star formation began over 10 gyr ago andcontinued in recent times until at least a few hundred myr ago. the cmd-fittingresults are indicative of two distinct star formation bursts, with a quiescentperiod around 3 gyr ago, albeit at low significance. the results are consistentwith no metallicity evolution and [fe/h] ~ -1.5 over the entire age of thesystem. finally, the data show little if any sign of tidal distortion of leo t.

1311.1921	diffuse optical intracluster light as a measure of stellar tidal  stripping: the cluster cl0024+17 at $z\sim $0.4 observed at lbt	we have evaluated the diffuse intracluster light (icl) in the central core ofthe galaxy cluster cl0024+17 at $z\sim 0.4$ observed with the prime focuscamera (lbc) at lbt. the measure required an accurate removal of the galaxieslight within $\sim 200$ kpc from the center. the residual background intensityhas then been integrated in circular apertures to derive the average iclintensity profile. the latter shows an approximate exponential decline asexpected from theoretical cold dark matter models. the radial profile of theicl over the galaxies intensity ratio (icl fraction) is increasing withdecreasing radius but near the cluster center it starts to bend and thendecreases where the overlap of the halos of the brightest cluster galaxiesbecomes dominant. theoretical expectations in a simplified cdm scenario showthat the icl fraction profile can be estimated from the stripped over galaxystellar mass ratio in the cluster. it is possible to show that the latterquantity is almost independent of the properties of the individual hostgalaxies but mainly depends on the average cluster properties. the predictedicl fraction profile is thus very sensitive to the assumed cdm profile, totalmass and concentration parameter of the cluster. adopting values very similarto those derived from the most recent lensing analysis in cl0024+17 we find agood agreement with the observed icl fraction profile. the galaxy counts in thecluster core have then been compared with that derived from composite clustersamples in larger volumes, up to the clusters virial radius. the galaxy countsin the cl0024+17 core appear flatter and the amount of bending respect to theaverage cluster galaxy counts imply a loss of total emissivity in broadagreement with the measured icl fraction.

1312.6299	characterizing faint galaxies in the reionization epoch: lbt confirms  two l&lt;0.2l* sources at z=6.4 behind the clash/frontier fields cluster  macs0717.5+3745	we report the lbt/mods1 spectroscopic confirmation of two images of faintlyman alpha emitters at $z=6.4$ behind the frontier fields galaxy clustermacsj0717.5+3745. a wide range of lens models suggests that the two images arehighly magnified, with a strong lower limit of mu&gt;5. these are the faintest z&gt;6candidates spectroscopically confirmed to date. these may be also multipleimages of the same z=6.4 source as supported by their similar intrinsicproperties, but the lens models are inconclusive regarding this interpretation.to be cautious, we derive the physical properties of each image individually.thanks to the high magnification, the observed near-infrared (restframeultraviolet) part of the spectral energy distributions and ly-alpha lines arewell detected with s/n(m_1500)&gt;~10 and s/n(ly-alpha)~10-15. adopting mu&gt;5, theabsolute magnitudes, m_1500, and ly-alpha fluxes, are fainter than -18.7 and2.8x10^(-18)erg/s/cm2, respectively. we find a very steep ultraviolet spectralslope beta=-3.0+/-0.5 (f_lambda=lambda^(beta)), implying that these are veryyoung, dust-free and low metallicity objects, made of standard stellarpopulations or even extremely metal poor stars (age&lt;~30myr, e(b-v)=0 andmetallicity 0.0-0.2 z/zsolar). the objects are compact (&lt; 1 kpc^(2)), and witha stellar mass m* &lt; 10^(8) m_solar. the very steep beta, the presence of thely-alpha line and the intrinsic fwhm (&lt;300 km/s) of these newborn objects donot exclude a possible leakage of ionizing radiation. we discuss thepossibility that such faint galaxies may resemble those responsible for cosmicreionization.

0802.2613	the blue straggler population in the globular cluster m53 (ngc5024): a  combined hst, lbt, cfht study	we used a proper combination of multiband high-resolution and wide fieldmulti-wavelength observations collected at three different telescopes (hst, lbtand cfht) to probe blue straggler star (bss) populations in the globularcluster m53. almost 200 bss have been identified over the entire clusterextension. the radial distribution of these stars has been found to be bimodal(similarly to that of several other clusters) with a prominent dip at ~60'' (~2r_c) from the cluster center. this value turns out to be a factor of twosmaller than the radius of avoidance (r_avoid, the radius within which all thestars of ~1.2 m_sun have sunk to the core because of dynamical friction effectsin an hubble time). while in most of the clusters with a bimodal bss radialdistribution, r_avoid has been found to be located in the region of theobserved minimum, this is the second case (after ngc6388) where thisdiscrepancy is noted. this evidence suggests that in a few clusters thedynamical friction seems to be somehow less efficient than expected.  we have also used this data base to construct the radial star density profileof the cluster: this is the most extended and accurate radial profile everpublished for this cluster, including detailed star counts in the very innerregion. the star density profile is reproduced by a standard king model with anextended core (~25'') and a modest value of the concentration parameter(c=1.58). a deviation from the model is noted in the most external region ofthe cluster (at r&gt;6.5' from the center). this feature needs to be furtherinvestigated in order to address the possible presence of a tidal tail in thiscluster.

1403.0743	constraints on the star-formation rate of z~3 lbgs with measured  metallicity in the candels goods-south field	we analyse 14 lbgs at z~2.8-3.8 constituting the only sample where both aspectroscopic measurement of their metallicity and deep ir observations(candels+hugs survey) are available. fixing the metallicity of populationsynthesis models to the observed values, we determine best-fit physicalparameters under different assumptions about the star-formation history andalso consider the effect of nebular emission. for comparison we determine theuv slope of the objects, and use it to estimate their sfr_uv99 by correctingthe uv luminosity following meurer et al. (1999). a comparison between sfrobtained through sed-fitting (sfr_fit) and the sfr_uv99 shows that the latterare underestimated by a factor 2-10, regardless of the assumed sfh. other sfrindicators (radio, far-ir, x-ray, recombination lines) coherently indicate sfrsa factor of 2-4 larger than sfr_uv99 and in closer agreement with sfr_fit. thisdiscrepancy is due to the solar metallicity implied by the usual beta-a1600conversion factor. we propose a refined relation, appropriate for sub-solarmetallicity lbgs: a1600 = 5.32+1.99beta. this relation reconciles thedust-corrected uv with the sed-fitting and the other sfr indicators. we showthat the fact that z~3 galaxies have sub-solar metallicity implies an upwardrevision by a factor of ~1.5-2 of the global sfrd, depending on the assumptionsabout the age of the stellar populations. we find very young best-fit ages(10-500 myrs) for all our objects. from a careful examination of theuncertainties in the fit and the amplitude of the balmer break we conclude thatthere is little evidence of the presence of old stellar population in at leasthalf of the lbgs in our sample, suggesting that these objects are probablycaught during a huge star-formation burst, rather than being the result of asmooth evolution.

1412.0532	the galaxy stellar mass function at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5 in the candels/uds,  goods-south, and hudf fields	the galaxy stellar mass function (gsmf) at high-z provides key information onstar-formation history and mass assembly in the young universe. we aimed to usethe unique combination of deep optical/nir/mir imaging provided by hst, spitzerand the vlt in the candels-uds, goods-south, and hudf fields to determine thegsmf over the redshift range 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5. we utilised the hst wfc3/ir nir imagingfrom candels and hudf09, reaching h~27-28.5 over a total area of 369 arcmin2,in combination with associated deep hst acs optical data, deep spitzer iracimaging from the seds programme, and deep y and k-band vlt hawk-i images fromthe hugs programme, to select a galaxy sample with high-quality photometricredshifts. these have been calibrated with more than 150 spectroscopicredshifts in the range 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5, resulting in an overall precision ofsigma_z/(1+z)~0.037. we have determined the low-mass end of the high-z gsmfwith unprecedented precision, reaching down to masses as low as m*~10^9 msun atz=4 and ~6x10^9 msun at z=7. we find that the gsmf at 3.5&lt;z&lt;7.5 depends onlyslightly on the recipes adopted to measure the stellar masses, namely thephoto-z, the sfhs, the nebular contribution or the presence of agn on theparent sample. the low-mass end of the gsmf is steeper than has been found atlower redshifts, but appears to be unchanged over the redshift range probedhere. our results are very different from previous gsmf estimates based onconverting uv galaxy luminosity functions into mass functions via tight m/lrelations. integrating our evolving gsmf over mass, we find that the growth ofstellar mass density is barely consistent with the time-integral of the sfrdensity over cosmic time at z&gt;4. these results confirm the unique synergy ofthe candels+hudf, hugs, and seds surveys for the discovery and study ofmoderate/low-mass galaxies at high redshifts.

1502.02562	faint agns at z&gt;4 in the candels goods-s field: looking for contributors  to the reionization of the universe	in order to derive the agn contribution to the cosmological ionizingemissivity we have selected faint agn candidates at $z&gt;4$ in the candelsgoods-south field which is one of the deepest fields with extensivemultiwavelength coverage from chandra, hst, spitzer and various groundbasedtelescopes. we have adopted a relatively novel criterion. as a first step highredshift galaxies are selected in the nir $h$ band down to very faint levels($h\leq27$) using reliable photometric redshifts. this corresponds at $z&gt;4$ toa selection criterion based on the galaxy rest-frame uv flux. agn candidatesare then picked up from this parent sample if they show x-ray fluxes above athreshold of $f_x\sim 1.5\times 10^{-17}$ cgs (0.5-2 kev). we have found 22 agncandidates at $z&gt;4$ and we have derived the first estimate of the uv luminosityfunction in the redshift interval $4&lt;z&lt;6.5$ and absolute magnitude interval$-22.5\lesssim m_{1450} \lesssim -18.5$ typical of local seyfert galaxies. thefaint end of the derived luminosity function is about two/four magnitudesfainter at $z\sim 4-6$ than that derived from previous uv surveys. we have thenestimated ionizing emissivities and hydrogen photoionization rates in the sameredshift interval under reasonable assumptions and after discussion of possiblecaveats, the most important being the large uncertainties involved in theestimate of photometric redshift for sources with featureless, almost power-lawseds and/or low average escape fraction of ionizing photons from the agn hostgalaxies. we argue that, under reasonable evaluations of possible biases, theprobed agn population can produce at $z=4-6.5$ photoionization rates consistentwith that required to keep highly ionized the intergalactic medium observed inthe lyman-$\alpha$ forest of high redshift qso spectra, providing an importantcontribution to the cosmic reionization.

1502.04708	peering through the holes: the far uv color of star-forming galaxies at  z~3-4 and the escaping fraction of ionizing radiation	we aim to investigate the effect of the escaping ionizing radiation on thecolor selection of high redshift galaxies and identify candidate lymancontinuum (lyc) emitters. the intergalactic medium prescription of inoue etal.(2014) and galaxy synthesis models of bruzual&amp;charlot (2003) have been usedto properly treat the ultraviolet stellar emission, the stochasticity of theintergalactic transmission and mean free path in the ionizing regime. colortracks are computed by turning on/off the escape fraction of ionizingradiation. at variance with recent studies, a careful treatment of igmtransmission leads to no significant effects on the high-redshift broad-bandcolor selection. the decreasing mean free path of ionizing photons withincreasing redshift further diminishes the contribution of the lyc tobroad-band colors. we also demonstrate that prominent lyc sources can beselected under suitable conditions by calculating the probability of a nullescaping ionizing radiation. the method is applied to a sample of galaxiesextracted from the goods-s field. a known lyc source at z=3.795 is successfullyrecovered as a lyc emitter candidate and another convincing candidate atz=3.212 is reported. a detailed analysis of the two sources (including theirvariability and morphology) suggests a possible mixture of stellar andnon-stellar (agn) contribution in the ultraviolet. conclusions: classicalbroad-band color selection of 2.5&lt;z&lt;4.5 galaxies does not prevent the inclusionof lyc emitters in the selected samples. large fesc in relatively brightgalaxies (l&gt;0.1l*) could be favored by the presence of a faint agn not easilydetected at any wavelength. a hybrid stellar and non-stellar (agn) ionizingemission could coexist in these systems and explain the tensions found amongthe uv excess and the stellar population synthesis models reported inliterature.

1509.07402	the detection of ultra-faint low surface brightness dwarf galaxies in  the virgo cluster: a probe of dark matter and baryonic physics	we have discovered 11 ultra-faint ($r\lesssim 22.1$) low surface brightness(lsb, central surface brightness $23\lesssim \mu_r\lesssim 26$) dwarf galaxycandidates in one deep virgo field of just $576$ arcmin$^2$ obtained by thelarge binocular camera (lbc) at the large binocular telescope (lbt). theirassociation with the virgo cluster is supported by their distinct position inthe central surface brightness - total magnitude plane with respect to thebackground galaxies of similar total magnitude. they have typical absolutemagnitudes and scale sizes, if at the distance of virgo, in the range$-13\lesssim m_r\lesssim -9$ and $250\lesssim r_s\lesssim 850$ pc,respectively. their colors are consistent with a gradually declining starformation history with a specific star formation rate of the order of$10^{-11}$ yr$^{-1}$, i.e. 10 times lower than that of main sequence starforming galaxies. they are older than the cluster formation age and appearregular in morphology. they represent the faintest extremes of the populationof low luminosity lsb dwarfs that has been recently detected in wider surveysof the virgo cluster. thanks to the depth of our observations we are able toextend the virgo luminosity function down to $m_r\sim -9.3$ (corresponding tototal masses $m\sim 10^7$ m$_{\odot}$), finding an average faint-end slope$\alpha\simeq -1.4$. this relatively steep slope puts interesting constraintson the nature of the dark matter and in particular on warm dark matter (wdm)often invoked to solve the overprediction of the dwarf number density by thestandard cdm scenario. we derive a lower limit on the wdm particle mass $&gt;1.5$kev.

0705.2864	unveiling obscured accretion in the chandra deep field south	a large population of heavily obscured, compton thick agns is predicted bymodels of galaxy formation, models of cosmic x-ray background and by the``relic'' super-massive black-hole mass function measured from local bulges.however, so far only a handful of compton thick agns have been possiblydetected using even the deepest chandra and xmm surveys. compton-thick agns canbe recovered thanks to the reprocessing of the agn uv emission in the infraredby selecting sources with agn luminosity's in the mid-infrared and faintnear-infrared and optical emission. to this purpose, we make use of deep hst,vlt, spitzer and chandra data on the chandra deep field south to constrain thenumber of compton thick agn in this field. we show that sources with high24$\mu$m to optical flux ratios and red colors form a distinct sourcepopulation, and that their infrared luminosity is dominated by agn emission.analysis of the x-ray properties of these extreme sources shows that most ofthem (80$\pm15%$) are indeed likely to be highly obscured, compton thick agns.the number of infrared selected, compton thick agns with 5.8$\mu$m luminosityhigher than $10^{44.2}$ erg s$^{-1}$ turns out to be similar to that of x-rayselected, unobscured and moderately obscured agns with 2-10 kev luminosityhigher than $10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the redshift bin 1.2-2.6. this ``factorof 2'' source population is exactly what it is needed to solve thediscrepancies between model predictions and x-ray agn selection.

0808.0193	the lbt panoramic view on the recent star-formation activity in ic2574	we present deep imaging of the star-forming dwarf galaxy ic2574 in the m81group taken with the large binocular telescope in order to study in detail therecent star-formation history of this galaxy and to constrain the stellarfeedback on its hi gas. we identify the star-forming areas in the galaxy byremoving a smooth disk component from the optical images. we constructpixel-by-pixel maps of stellar age and stellar mass surface density in theseregions by comparing their observed colors with simple stellar populationssynthesized with starburst99. we find that an older burst occurred about 100myr ago within the inner 4 kpc and that a younger burst happened in the last 10myr mostly at galactocentric radii between 4 and 8 kpc. we analyze the stellarpopulations residing in the known hi holes of ic2574. our results indicatethat, even at the remarkable photometric depth of the lbt data, there is noclear one-to-one association between the observed hi holes and the most recentbursts of star formation in ic2574. the stellar populations formed during theyounger burst are usually located at the periphery of the hi holes and are seento be younger than the holes dynamical age. the kinetic energy of the holesexpansion is found to be on average 10% of the total stellar energy released bythe stellar winds and supernova explosions of the young stellar populationswithin the holes. with the help of control apertures distributed across thegalaxy we estimate that the kinetic energy stored in the hi gas in the form ofits local velocity dispersion is about 35% of the total stellar energy.

(2000) in the hdf-s and williams et al. (1996) inthe hdf-n, while the corresponding counts in the hdf-n provided byfernandez-soto et al. (1999) are systematically lower by a factor 1.5 beyondi_ab=26. after correcting for the incompleteness of the source counts, theobject surface density at i_ab&lt;27.5 is estimated to be 220 per square arcmin,providing an estimate of the extragalactic background light in the i bandconsistent with the work of madau &amp; pozzetti(2000). the comparison between themedian v-i color in the hdf-north and south shows a significant differencearound i_ab~26, possibly due to the presence of large scale structure at z~1 inthe hdf-n. high-z galaxy candidates (90 u dropout and 17 b dropout) wereselected by means of color diagrams, down to a magnitude i_ab=27, with asurface density of (21+-1) and (3.9+-0.9) per square arcmin, respectively. 11eros (with (i-k)_ab&gt;2.7) were selected down to k_ab=24, plus 3 objects whoseupper limit to the ks flux is still compatible with the selection criterion.the corresponding surface density of eros is (2.5+-0.8) per sq.arcmin((3.2+-0.9) per sq.arcmin if we include the three ks upper limits). they show aremarkably non-uniform spatial distribution and are classified with roughlyequal fractions in the categories of elliptical and starburst galaxies.

astro-ph;0109453	measuring the redshift evolution of clustering: the hubble deep field  south	we present an analysis of the evolution of galaxy clustering in the redshiftinterval 0&lt;z&lt;4.5 in the hdf-s. the hst optical data are combined with infraredisaac/vlt observations, and photometric redshifts are used for all the galaxiesbrighter than i_ab&lt;27.5. the clustering signal is obtained in differentredshift bins using two different approaches: a standard one, which uses thebest redshift estimate of each object, and a second one, which takes intoaccount the redshift probability function of each object. this second methodmakes it possible to improve the information in the redshift intervals wherecontamination from objects with insecure redshifts is important. with bothmethods, we find that the clustering strength up to z~3.5 in the hdf-s isconsistent with the previous results in the hdf-n. while at redshift lower thanz~1 the hdf galaxy population is un/anti-biased (b&lt;1) with respect to theunderlying dark matter, at high redshift the bias increases up to b~2-3,depending on the cosmological model. these results support previous claimsthat, at high redshift, galaxies are preferentially located in massive haloes,as predicted by the biased galaxy formation scenario. the impact of cosmicerrors on our analyses has been quantified, showing that errors in theclustering measurements in the hdf surveys are indeed dominated by shot-noisein most regimes. future observations with instruments like the acs on hst willimprove the s/n by at least a factor of two and more detailed analyses of theerrors will be required. in fact, pure shot-noise will give a smallercontribution with respect to other sources of errors, such as finite volumeeffects or non-poissonian discreteness effects.

astro-ph;0204178	binary aggregations in hierarchical galaxy formation: the evolution of  the galaxy luminosity function	we develop a semi-analytic model of hierarchical galaxy formation with animproved treatment of the evolution of galaxies inside dark matter haloes. wetake into account not only dynamical friction processes building up the centraldominant galaxy, but also binary aggregations of satellite galaxies inside acommon halo described using the kinetic smoluchowski equation. the descriptionof gas cooling, star formation and evolution, and supernova feedback followsthe standard prescriptions widely used in semi-analytic modelling. we find thatbinary aggregations are effective in depleting the number of small/intermediatemass galaxies over the redshift range 1&lt;z&lt;3, thus flattening the slope of theluminosity function at the faint end. at z~0 the flattening occurs for-20&lt;m_b&lt;-18, but an upturn is obtained at the very faint end for m_b&gt;-16. wecompare our predicted luminosity functions with those obtained from deepmulticolor surveys in the rest-frame b and uv bands for the redshift ranges0&lt;z&lt;1 and 2.5&lt;z&lt;3.5, respectively. the comparison shows that the discrepancy ofthe predictions of other semi-analytic models with the observations isconsiderably reduced at z&gt;1 and even more at z ~ 3 by the effect of binaryaggregations. the predictions from our dynamical model are discussed andcompared with the effects of complementary processes which may conspire inaffecting the shape of the luminosity function.

astro-ph;0303332	quasar evolution driven by galaxy encounters in hierarchical structures	we link the evolution of the galaxies in the hierarchical clustering scenariowith the changing accretion rates of cold gas onto the central massive blackholes that power the quasars. we base on galaxy interactions as main triggersof accretion; the related scaling laws are taken up from cavaliere &amp; vittorini(2000), and grafted to a semi-analytic code for galaxy formation. as a result,at high $z$ the protogalaxies grow rapidly by hierarchical merging; meanwhile,much fresh gas is imported and also destabilized, so the holes are fueled attheir full eddington rates. at lower $z$ the galactic dynamical events aremostly encounters in hierarchically growing groups; now the refueling petersout, as the residual gas is exhausted while the destabilizing encountersdwindle. so, with no parameter tuning other than needed for stellarobservables, our model uniquely produces at $z&gt;3$ a rise, and at $z\lesssim 2.5$ a decline of the bright quasar population as steep as observed. in addition,our results closely fit the observed luminosity functions of quasars, theirspace density at different magnitudes from $z\approx 5$ to $z\approx 0$, andthe local $m_{bh}-\sigma$ relation.

astro-ph;0412044	the b-band luminosity function of red and blue galaxies up to z=3.5	we have explored the redshift evolution of the luminosity function of red andblue galaxies up to $z=3.5$. this was possible joining a deep i band compositegalaxy sample, which includes the spectroscopic k20 sample and the hdfssamples, with the deep $h_{ab}=26$ and $k_{ab}=25$ samples derived from thedeep nir images of the hubble deep fields north and south, respectively. about30% of the sample has spectroscopic redshifts and the remaining fractionwell-calibrated photometric redshifts. this allowed to select and measuregalaxies in the rest-frame blue magnitude up to $z\sim 3$ and to derive theredshift evolution of the b-band luminosity function of galaxies separated bytheir rest-frame $u-v$ color or specific (i.e. per unit mass) star-formationrate. the class separation was derived from passive evolutionary tracks or fromtheir observed bimodal distributions. both distributions appear bimodal atleast up to $z\sim 2$ and the locus of red/early galaxies is clearly identifiedup to these high redshifts. both luminosity and density evolutions are neededto describe the cosmological behaviour of the red/early and blue/latepopulations. the density evolution is greater for the early population with adecrease by one order of magnitude at $z\sim 2-3$ with respect to the value at$z\sim 0.4$. the luminosity densities of the early and late type galaxies with$m_b&lt;-20.6$ appear to have a bifurcation at $z&gt;1$. indeed while star-forminggalaxies slightly increase or keep constant their luminosity density, "early"galaxies decrease in their luminosity density by a factor $\sim 5-6$ from$z\sim 0.4$ to $z\sim 2.5-3$. a comparison with one of the latest versions ofthe hierarchical cdm models shows a broad agreement with the observed numberand luminosity density evolutions of both populations.

astro-ph;0506387	bimodal color distribution in hierarchical galaxy formation	we show how the observed bimodality in the color distribution of galaxies canbe explained in the framework of the hierarchical clustering picture in termsof the interplay between the properties of the merging histories and thefeedback/star-formation processes in the progenitors of local galaxies. using asemi-analytic model of hierarchical galaxy formation, we compute the colordistributions of galaxies with different luminosities and compare them with theobservations. our fiducial model matches the fundamental properties of theobserved distributions, namely: 1) the distribution of objects brighter thanm_r = -18 is clearly bimodal, with a fraction of red objects increasing withluminosity; 2) for objects brighter than m_r = -21 the color distribution isdominated by red objects with color u-r = 2.2-2.4; 3) the spread on thedistribution of the red population is smaller than that of the blue population;4) the fraction of red galaxies is larger in denser environments, even forlow-luminosity objects; 5) the bimodality in the distribution persists up to z= 1.5. we discuss the role of the different physical processes included in themodel in producing the above results.

astro-ph;0512147	probing the evolution of the near-ir luminosity function of galaxies to  z ~ 3 in the hubble deep field south	[abridged] we present the rest-frame js-band and ks-band luminosity functionof a sample of about 300 galaxies selected in the hdf-s at ks&lt;23 (vega). we usecalibrated photometric redshift together with spectroscopic redshift for 25% ofthe sample. the sample has allowed to probe the evolution of the lf in thethree redshift bins [0;0.8), [0.8;1.9) and [1.9;4) centered at the medianredshift z_m ~ [0.6,1.2,3]. the values of alpha we estimate are consistent withthe local value and do not show any trend with redshift. we do not see evidenceof evolution from z=0 to z_m ~ 0.6 suggesting that the population of localbright galaxies was already formed at z&lt;0.8. on the contrary, we clearly detectan evolution of the lf to z_m ~ 1.2 characterized by a brightening of m* and bya decline of phi*. to z_m ~ 1.2 m* brightens by about 0.4-0.6 mag and phi*decreases by a factor 2-3. this trend persists, even if at a less extent, downto z_m ~ 3 both in the js-band and in the ks-band lf. the decline of the numberdensity of bright galaxies seen at z&gt;0.8 suggests that a significant fractionof them increases their stellar mass at 1&lt;z&lt;2-3 and that they underwent astrong evolution in this redshift range. on the other hand, this implies alsothat a significant fraction of local bright/massive galaxies was already inplace at z&gt;3. thus, our results suggest that the assembly of high-mass galaxiesis spread over a large redshift range and that the increase of their stellarmass has been very efficient also at very high redshift at least for a fractionof them.

astro-ph;0603095	the clustering evolution of distant red galaxies in the goods-music  sample	we use the goods-music sample, a catalog of ~3000 ks-selected galaxies basedon vlt and hst observation of the goods-south field with extendedmulti-wavelength coverage (from 0.3 to 8 micron) and accurate estimates of thephotometric redshifts to select 179 drgs with j-ks&gt;1.3 in an area of 135 sq.arcmin. we first show that the j-ks&gt;1.3 criterion selects a ratherheterogeneous sample of galaxies, going from the targeted high-redshiftluminous evolved systems, to a significant fraction of lower redshift (1&lt;z&lt;2)and less luminous dusty starbursts. these low-redshift drgs are significantlyless clustered than higher-z drgs. with the aid of extreme and simplifiedtheoretical models of clustering evolution we show that it is unlikely that thetwo samples are drawn from the same population observed at two different stagesof evolution. high-z drgs likely represent the progenitors of the more massiveand more luminous galaxies in the local universe and might mark the regionsthat will later evolve into structures of intermediate mass, like groups orsmall galaxy clusters. low-z drgs, on the other hand, will likely evolve intoslightly less massive field galaxies.

astro-ph;0605123	the abundance of distant and extremely red galaxies: the role of agn  feedback in hierarchical models	we investigate the effect of agn feedback associated to the bright qso phaseonto the color distribution of galaxies from z=0 up to z=4. to this aim, weinsert a blast-wave model of agn feedback in our semi-analytic model of galaxyformation, which includes the growth of supermassive black holes and the agnactivity triggered by interactions of the host galaxies. the agn feedback isdirectly related to the impulsive, luminous quasar phase. we test our model bychecking the consistency of its results against i) the qso luminosity functionsfrom z=0 to z=4; ii) the observed local relation between the black hole massm_{bh} and the mass of the host galaxy. at low redshift the inclusion of agnfeedback enhances the number of red bright galaxies, so that the colordistribution of m_r&lt;-22 objects is entirely dominated by red (u-r&gt;1.5)galaxies; at 0.5&lt; z&lt; 2 it yields rest-frame u-v color distribution in agreementwith existing observations. in the range z=1.5-2.5, we find that 31% ofgalaxies contribute to the eros population with m_k&lt;20 (vega system); at such amagnitude, the model yields an eros surface density of 6.3 10^3 /deg^2 matchingexisting data; about 80 % of the above density is contributed by passivegalaxies with old stellar populations. extending our analysis to z=4, the modelmatches the observed surface density 1.5 10^3 /deg^2 of drgs at m_k=20; such apopulation is predicted to be dominated by galaxies with old stellarpopulations for z&gt;2.5.

astro-ph;0609068	the galaxy mass function up to z=4 in the goods-music sample: into the  epoch of formation of massive galaxies	the goal of this work is to measure the evolution of the galaxy stellar massfunction and of the resulting stellar mass density up to redshift ~4, in orderto study the assembly of massive galaxies in the high redshift universe. wehave used the goods-music catalog, containing ~3000 ks-selected galaxies withmulti-wavelength coverage extending from the u band to the spitzer 8 micronband, of which 27% have spectroscopic redshifts and the remaining fraction haveaccurate photometric redshifts. on this sample we have applied a standardfitting procedure to measure stellar masses. we compute the galaxy stellar massfunction and the resulting stellar mass density up to redshift ~4, taking intoproper account the biases and incompleteness effects. within the well knowntrend of global decline of the stellar mass density with redshift, we show thatthe decline of the more massive galaxies may be described by an exponentialtimescale of ~6 gyrs up to z~1.5, and proceeds much faster thereafter, with anexponential timescale of ~0.6 gyrs. we also show that there is some evidencefor a differential evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function, with low massgalaxies evolving faster than more massive ones up to z~1-1.5 and that thegalaxy stellar mass function remains remarkably flat (i.e. with a slope closeto the local one) up to z~1-1.3. the observed behaviour of the galaxy stellarmass function is consistent with a scenario where about 50% of present-daymassive galaxies formed at a vigorous rate in the epoch between redshift 4 and1.5, followed by a milder evolution until the present-day epoch.

astro-ph;0703013	physical properties of z~4 lbgs: differences between galaxies with and  without ly-alpha emission	we have analysed the physical properties of z~4 lyman break galaxies observedin the goods-s survey, in order to investigate the possible differences betweengalaxies where the ly-alpha is present in emission, and those where the line isabsent or in absorption. the objects have been selected from their opticalcolor and then spectroscopically confirmed by vanzella et al. (2005). from thepublic spectra we assessed the nature of the ly-alpha emission and divided thesample into galaxies with ly-alpha in emission and objects without ly-alphaline (i.e. either absent or in absorption). we have then used the completephotometry, from u band to mid infrared from the goods-music database, to studythe observational properties of the galaxies, such as uv spectral slopes andoptical to mid-infrared colors, and the possible differences between the twosamples. finally through standard spectral fitting tecniques we have determinedthe physical properties of the galaxies, such as total stellar mass, stellarages and so on, and again we have studied the possible differences between thetwo samples. our results indicate that lbg with ly-alpha in emission are onaverage a much younger and less massive population than the lbgs withoutly-alpha emission. both populations are forming stars very actively and arerelatively dust free, although those with line emission seem to be even lessdusty on average. we briefly discuss these results in the context of recentmodels for the evolution of lyman break galaxies and ly-alpha emitters.

astro-ph;9802013	star-formation at z=4.7 in the environment of the qso br1202-07	we present here the spectrum of the galaxy companion to the z=4.7 quasarbr1202-0725, in the optical range 6000-9000 a, corresponding to 1050-1580 arest-frame. we detect a strong lya emission line at z=4.702, with an integratedflux of 2x10^{-16} ergs/cm^2/s, and a uv continuum longward of the lya emissionat a flux level of 3x10^{-19}ergs/cm^2/s/a. we fail to detect any civ[1550]emission with a 3 sigma upper limit of 3x10^{-17} ergs/cm^2/s $. we show thatthe ratio between lya and continuum intensity and the absence of a strong civemission imply that the uv continuum radiation is the result of an intensestar-formation activity rather than of a reprocessing of the qso flux. thetotal estimated sfr of this z=4.7 star-forming region is about 15-54 msun/yr,depending on the imf and the metallicity. the present data suggest that the lyaemission has a velocity and spatial structure, with possible velocitydifferences of about 500 km/s on scales of few kpc. these velocity patterns maybe a signature of collapsing or merging phenomena in the qso and itsenvironment, as expected from current models of galaxy formation at high z.

astro-ph;9802340	the photometric redshift distribution and evolutionary properties of  galaxies up to z= 4.5 in the field of the quasar br1202-0725	we present a deep bvrik multicolor catalog of galaxies in the field of thehigh redshift (z=4.7) quasar br 1202-0725. reliable colors have been measuredfor galaxies selected down to r=25. the choice of the optical filters has beenoptimized to define a robust multicolor selection of galaxies at 3.8&lt;z&lt; 4.5.within this interval the surface density of galaxy candidates with z~4 in thisfield is 1 arcmin^{-2}. photometric redshifts have been derived for thegalaxies in the field with the maximum likelihood analysis using the gissellibrary of ~10^6 synthetic spectra. the accuracy of the method used has beendiscussed and tested using galaxies in the hubble deep field (hdf) with knownspectroscopic redshifts and accurate photometry. a peak in the redshiftdistribution is present at z~0.6 with relatively few galaxies at z&gt;1.5. atvariance with brighter surveys (i&lt;22.5) there is a tail in the distributiontowards high redshifts up to z~4. the luminosity function at z~0.6 shows asteepening for m_b&gt;-19. the observed cosmological ultraviolet luminositydensity is computed in the overall redshift interval z=0.3-4.5 reaching a value2x10^{19} w/hz/mpc^3 at z~0.8. we have derived in a homogeneous way, using thegissel libraries, the physical parameters connected with the fitted spectralenergy distributions. the bulk of the blue intermediate redshift populationwith z=0.4-1 mostly consists of very young star-forming galaxies with a medianstarburst age of the order of a few 10^8 yr and typical mass in luminous stars~2x10^8 mo.

astro-ph;9806204	the size and geometry of the ly_alpha clouds	spectra of the qso pair q0307-195a,b have been obtained in the ly-alphaforest (3660 - 3930 a) and c iv (4720 - 4850 a) regions with a fwhm resolutionbetween 0.7 and 0.5 a. 46 lines have been detected in the spectrum of object awhile 36 in the spectrum of object b, of them 29 and 20 were identified asly-alpha absorptions respectively. the present observations have beensupplemented with data of comparable quality on other 7 qso pairs available inthe literature to give an enlarged sample of 217 ly-alpha lines with restequivalent width w_o &gt; 0.3 a. the analysis of the hits (i.e. when an absorptionline appears in both qso spectra) and misses (i.e. when a line is seen in anyof the qso spectra, but no line is seen in the other), carried out with animproved statistical approach, indicates that the absorbers have typically alarge size (h = h_0/100 km/s/mpc, q_0 = 0.5): r = 362 h^{-1} kpc, with 95 %confidence limits 298&lt; r &lt;426 h^{-1} kpc and r = 412 h^{-1} kpc, with 95 %confidence limits 333&lt; r &lt;514 h^{-1} kpc for the radius in idealized sphericaland disc geometries, respectively. the present data do not allow to establishany correlation of the typical inferred size with the proper separation or withthe redshift of the pairs. the correlation between the observed equivalentwidths of the absorbers in the adjacent lines of sight becomes poorer andpoorer with increasing proper separation. a disc geometry with a column densityprofile n(r) \propto (r/r_0)^{-gamma}, gamma=4, is found to reasonablyreproduce the data with r_0 ~ 100-200 h^{-1} kpc, but also spherical cloudswith the same column density profile and a power-law distribution of radii maygive a satisfactory representation of the observations.

astro-ph;9809258	the gravitational lensing in the qso 1208+10 from the proximity effect  in its lyman alpha forest	the quasar q1208+1011 (z_{em}=3.8) is the second highest redshift doublequasar ever detected. several indications point toward it being a gravitationallensed system, although a definitive proof is still lacking. we present newevidence of its lensed nature based on the weakness of the ``proximity effect''measured in the high resolution lyman absorption spectrum of the qso. aluminosity amplification as large as 22 has been derived from this analysis.indications on the redshift of the lensing galaxy can be obtained from theanalysis of the intervening heavy element absorption systems discovered in theqso high resolution spectrum. on statistical and dynamical grounds a mgiisystem present at z=1.13 appears as the most likely candidate for the lensinggalaxy. we compare the observed parameters with a simple isothermal model forthe lens to derive the properties of the lensing galaxy. the resultingmagnification factor is smaller, although marginally consistent with thatderived by the analysis of the proximity effect.

astro-ph;9901359	the vlt observations of the hdf-s nicmos field: photometric catalog and  high redshift galaxy candidates	we present the deep ubvri observations of the hdf-s nicmos field obtained aspart of the science verification of the vlt unit 1 telescope. the images havebeen used to construct object catalogs and to obtain photometric redshifts. theeffective field of view is $\simeq 70\times70$ arcsec$^2$, and the formal$5\sigma$ limiting magnitudes (in a 2 fwhm aperture) are 26.3, 27.8, 27.5,26.9, 25.2 in the $u$, $b$, $v$, $r$ and $i$ bands, respectively. thanks to thesub-arcsecond image quality, relatively long exposure time, and largecollecting area of the vlt, this is the deepest set of multicolor images everobtained from a ground-based telescope. galaxy counts have been derivedindependently in each band, and show no significant departures from previousdata from wider areas. a multicolor photometric catalog of all the galaxiesselected in the $r$ band has also been obtained and used to derive photometricredshifts for all galaxies with $r \leq 26.5 $, using also the j,h and kmagnitudes from the nicmos deep observations. a significant fraction (\simeq28%)of the galaxies is placed at $z\geq 2$. among them, six robust candidatesare found at $z \geq 2.5$ .

astro-ph;9909126	high redshift evolution of optically and ir-selected galaxies: a  comparison with cdm scenarios	a combination of ground-based (ntt and vlt) and hst (hdf-n and hdf-s) publicimaging surveys have been used to collect a sample of 1712 i-selected and 319$k\leq 21$ galaxies. photometric redshifts have been obtained for all thesegalaxies. the results have been compared with the prediction of an analyticrendition of the current cdm hierarchical models for galaxy formation. we focusin particular on two observed quantities: the galaxy redshift distribution atk&lt;21 and the evolution of the uv luminosity density. the derived photometricredshift distribution is in agreement with the hierarchical cdm prediction,with a fraction of only 5% of galaxies detected at z&gt;2. this result stronglysupports hierarchical scenarios where present-day massive galaxies are theresult of merging processes. the observed uv luminosity density in thei-selected sample is confined within a factor of 4 over the whole range0&lt;z&lt;4.5. cdm models in a critical universe are not able to produce the densityof uv photons that is observed at z&gt;3. cdm models in $\lambda$-dominateduniverse are in better agreement at 3&lt;z&lt;4.5, but predict a pronounced peak atz~1.5 and a drop by a factor of 8 from z=1.5 to z=4 that is not observed in thedata. we conclude that improvements are required in the treatment of thephysical processes directly related to the sfr, e.g. the starbust activity inmerger processes and/or different feedback to the star formation activity.

astro-ph;9910537	the evolution of the galaxy sizes in the ntt deep field: a comparison  with cdm models	the sizes of the field galaxies with i&lt;25 have been measured in the ntt deepfield. intrinsic sizes have been obtained after deconvolution of the psf with amultigaussian method. the reliability of the method has been tested using bothsimulated data and hst observations of the same field. the distribution of thehalf light radii is peaked at r_{hl} 0.3 arcsec, in good agreement with thatderived from hst images at the same magnitude. an approximate morphologicalclassification has been obtained using the asymmetry and concentrationparameters. the intrinsic sizes of the galaxies are shown as a function oftheir redshifts and absolute magnitudes using photometric redshifts derivedfrom the multicolor catalog. while the brighter galaxies with morphologicalparameters typical of the normal spirals show a flat distribution in the ranger_{d}=1-6 kpc, the fainter population at 0.4&lt;z&lt;0.8 dominates at small sizes. toexplore the significance of this behaviour, an analytical rendition of thestandard cdm model for the disc size evolution has been computed. the modelshowing the best fit to the local luminosity function and the tully-fisherrelation is able to reproduce at intermediate redshifts a size distribution ingeneral agreement with the observations, although it tends to underestimate thenumber of galaxies fainter than m_b~ -19 with disk sizes r_d~ 1-2 kpc.

0811.1861	the physical properties of lyalpha emitting galaxies: not just primeval  galaxies?	we have analyzed a sample of lbgs from z =3.5 to z=6 selected from thegoods-s field as b,v and i-dropouts, and with spectroscopic observationsshowing that they have the lyalpha line in emission. our main aim is toinvestigate their physical properties and their dependence on the emission linecharacteristics, to shed light on the relation between galaxies with lyalphaemission and the general lbg population.the objects were selected from theircontinuum colors and then spectroscopically confirmed by the goodscollaboration and other campaigns. from the spectra we derived the line fluxand ew. we then used u-band to mid-ir photometry from goods-music to derive thephysical properties of the galaxies, such as total stellar mass, age and so on,through standard sed fitting techniques.although most galaxies are fit by youngstellar populations, a small but non negligible fraction has seds that requireconsiderably older stellar component, up to 1 gyr. there is no apparentrelation between age and ew: some of the oldest galaxies have large ew, andshould be also selected in narrow band surveys. therefore not all lyalphaemitters are primeval galaxies in the very early stages of formation,as iscommonly assumed. we also find a large range of stellar populations, withmasses from 5x10^8 msol to 5x10^10 msol and sfr from few to 60 msol/yr.although there is no correlation between mass and ew, we find a significantlack of massive galaxies with high ew, which could be explained if the mostmassive galaxies were more dusty and/or contained more neutral gas than lessmassive objects. finally we find that more than half of the galaxies containsmall but non negligible amounts of dust: the mean e(b-v) and the ew are wellcorrelated, although with a large scatter, as already found at lower redshift
