0902.0898	early optical observations of grbs by the tarot telescopes: period  2001-2008	the tarot telescopes (telescopes a action rapide pour les objetstransitoires) are two robotic observatories designed to observe the promptoptical emission counterpart and the early afterglow of gamma ray bursts(grbs). we present data acquired between 2001 and 2008 and discuss theproperties of the optical emission of grbs, noting various interesting results.the optical emission observed during the prompt grb phase is rarely verybright: we estimate that 5% to 20% of grbs exhibit a bright optical flash(r&lt;14) during the prompt gamma-ray emission, and that more than 50% of the grbshave an optical emission fainter than r=15.5 when the gamma-ray emission isactive. we study the apparent optical brightness distribution of grbs at 1000 sshowing that our observations confirm the distribution derived by other groups.the combination of these results with those obtained by other rapid slewingtelescopes allows us to better characterize the early optical emission of grbsand to emphasize the importance of very early multi-wavelength grb studies forthe understanding of the physics of the ejecta.

1104.2048	origin: metal creation and evolution from the cosmic dawn	origin is a proposal for the m3 mission call of esa aimed at the study ofmetal creation from the epoch of cosmic dawn. using high-spectral resolution inthe soft x-ray band, origin will be able to identify the physical conditions ofall abundant elements between c and ni to red-shifts of z=10, and beyond. themission will answer questions such as: when were the first metals created? howdoes the cosmic metal content evolve? where do most of the metals reside in theuniverse? what is the role of metals in structure formation and evolution? toreach out to the early universe origin will use gamma-ray bursts (grbs) tostudy their local environments in their host galaxies. this requires thecapability to slew the satellite in less than a minute to the grb location. bystudying the chemical composition and properties of clusters of galaxies we canextend the range of exploration to lower redshifts (z ~ 0.2). for this task weneed a high-resolution spectral imaging instrument with a large field of view.using the same instrument, we can also study the so far only partially detectedbaryons in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim). the less dense part of thewhim will be studied using absorption lines at low redshift in the spectra forgrbs.

1104.5552	toward an optimal search strategy of optical and gravitational wave  emissions from binary neutron star coalescence	observations of an optical source coincident with gravitational wave emissiondetected from a binary neutron star coalescence will improve the confidence ofdetection, provide host galaxy localisation, and test models for theprogenitors of short gamma ray bursts. we employ optical observations of threeshort gamma ray bursts, 050724, 050709, 051221, to estimate the detection rateof a coordinated optical and gravitational wave search of neutron star mergers.model r-band optical afterglow light curves of these bursts that include ajet-break are extrapolated for these sources at the sensitivity horizon of anadvanced ligo/virgo network. using optical sensitivity limits of threetelescopes, namely tarot (m=18), zadko (m=21) and an (8-10) meter classtelescope (m=26), we approximate detection rates and cadence times for imaging.we find a median coincident detection rate of 4 yr^{-1} for the three bursts.grb 050724 like bursts, with wide opening jet angles, offer the most optimisticrate of 13 coincident detections yr^{-1}, and would be detectable by zadko upto five days after the trigger. late time imaging to m=26 could detect off-axisafterglows for grb 051221 like bursts several months after the trigger. for abroad distribution of beaming angles, the optimal strategy for identifying theoptical emissions triggered by gravitational wave detectors is rapid responsesearches with robotic telescopes followed by deeper imaging at later times ifan afterglow is not detected within several days of the trigger.

1201.2596	tests with a carlina-type diluted telescope; primary coherencing	studies are under way to propose a new generation of post-vltiinterferometers. the carlina concept studied at the haute- provence observatoryis one of the proposed solutions. it consists in an optical interferometerconfigured like a diluted version of the arecibo radio telescope: above thediluted primary mirror made of fixed cospherical segments, a helium balloon (orcables suspended between two mountains), carries a gondola containing the focaloptics. since 2003, we have been building a technical demonstrator of thisdiluted telescope. first fringes were obtained in may 2004 with twoclosely-spaced primary segments and a ccd on the focal gondola. we have beentesting the whole optical train with three primary mirrors. the main aim ofthis article is to describe the metrology that we have conceived, and testedunder the helium balloon to align the primary mirrors separate by 5-10 m on theground with an accuracy of a few microns. the servo loop stabilizes the mirrorof metrology under the helium balloon with an accuracy better than 5 mm whileit moves horizontally by 30 cm in open loop by 10-20 km/h of wind. we haveobtained the white fringes of metrology; i.e., the three mirrors are aligned(cospherized) with an accuracy of {\approx} 1 micron. we show data proving thestability of fringes over 15 minutes, therefore providing evidence that themechanical parts are stabilized within a few microns. this is an important stepthat demonstrates the feasibility of building a diluted telescope using cablesstrained between cliffs or under a balloon. carlina, like the mmt or lbt, couldbe one of the first members of a new class of telescopes named dilutedtelescopes.

0711.2222	x-ray afterglow light curves : toward standard candle ?	we investigate the clustering of afterglow light curves observed at x-ray andoptical wavelengths. we have constructed a sample of 61 bursts with known distance and x-ray afterglow. this sample includes bursts observed by bepposax,xmm-newton, chandra, and swift. we correct the light curves for cosmological effects and compare the observed x-ray fluxes one day after the burst. we checkfor correlations between the observed flux and the burst spectral and temporalproperties. we confirm the previous result of boer and gendre (2000) that x-rayafterglow light curves cluster in luminosity, even when we consider the l astswift data. we observe this clustering only for the afterglow light curves; theinclusion of prompt-related data broaden the distribution. a similar clustering is observed for the optical light curves; grb sources can be divided inthree classes, namely optical and x-ray bright afterglows, optical and x-raydim ones, and optically bright -x-ray dim ones. we argue that this clusteringis related to the fireball total energy, the external medium density, thefraction of fireball energy going in relativistic electrons and magneticfields. these parameters can be either fixed to a standard va lue, orcorrelated. we finally propose a method for the estimation of the grb sourceredshift based on the observed x-ray flux one day after the burst and opticalproperties. using this method, we compute a redshift of 1.4 +/- 0.2 for grb980519 and of 1.9 \+/- 0.3 for grb 040827. we tested this method on threerecently detected swift grbs with known redshift, and found it in goodagreement with the reported distance from optical spectroscopy .

1207.2022	measurement of the cross section for high-p_t hadron production in  scattering of 160 gev/c muons off nucleons	the differential cross section for production of charged hadrons with hightransverse momenta in scattering of 160\,gev/$c$ muons off nucleons at lowphoton virtualities has been measured at the compass experiment at cern. theresults, which cover transverse momenta from 1.1\,gev/$c$ to 3.6\,gev/$c$, arecompared to a perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pqcd) calculation, in orderto evaluate the applicability of pqcd to this process in the kinematic domainof the experiment. the shape of the calculated differential cross section as afunction of transverse momentum is found to be in good agreement with theexperimental data, but the absolute scale is underestimated by next-to-leadingorder (nlo) pqcd. the inclusion of all-order resummation of large logarithmicthreshold corrections reduces the discrepancy from a factor of three to four toa factor of two. the dependence of the cross section on the pseudo-rapidity andon virtual photon energy fraction is investigated. finally the dependence onthe charge of the hadrons is discussed.

1308.1001	the diversity of progenitors and emission mechanisms for ultra-long  bursts	grb 111209a is the longest ever recorded burst. this burst was detected byswift and konus-wind, and we obtained too time from xmm-newton as well asprompt data from tarot. we made a common reduction using data from theseinstruments together with other ones. this allows for the first time a precisestudy at high signal-to-noise ratio of the prompt to afterglow transition. weshow that several mechanisms are responsible of this phase. in its promptphase, we show that its duration is longer than 20 000 seconds. this, combinedwith the fact that the burst fluence is among the top 5% of what is observedfor other events, makes this event extremely energetic. we discuss the possibleprogenitors that could explain the extreme duration properties of this burst aswell as its spectral properties. we present evidences that this burst belong toa new, previously unidentified, class of grbs. the most probable progenitor ofthis new class is a low metalicity blue super-giant star. we show thatselection effects could prevent the detection of other bursts at largerredshift and conclude that this kind of event is intrinsically rare in thelocal universe. the afterglow presents similar features to other normal longgrbs and a late rebrightening in the optical wavelengths, as observed in otherlong grbs. a broad band sed from radio to x-rays at late times does not showsignificant deviations from the expected standard fireball afterglowsynchrotron emission.

1406.4556	improved upper limits on the stochastic gravitational-wave background  from 2009-2010 ligo and virgo data	gravitational waves from a variety of sources are predicted to superpose tocreate a stochastic background. this background is expected to contain uniqueinformation from throughout the history of the universe that is unavailablethrough standard electromagnetic observations, making its study of fundamentalimportance to understanding the evolution of the universe. we carry out asearch for the stochastic background with the latest data from ligo and virgo.consistent with predictions from most stochastic gravitational-wave backgroundmodels, the data display no evidence of a stochastic gravitational-wave signal.assuming a gravitational-wave spectrum ofomega_gw(f)=omega_alpha*(f/f_ref)^alpha, we place 95% confidence level upperlimits on the energy density of the background in each of four frequency bandsspanning 41.5-1726 hz. in the frequency band of 41.5-169.25 hz for a spectralindex of alpha=0, we constrain the energy density of the stochastic backgroundto be omega_gw(f)&lt;5.6x10^-6. for the 600-1000 hz band, omega_gw(f)&lt;0.14*(f/900hz)^3, a factor of 2.5 lower than the best previously reported upper limits. wefind omega_gw(f)&lt;1.8x10^-4 using a spectral index of zero for 170-600 hz andomega_gw(f)&lt;1.0*(f/1300 hz)^3 for 1000-1726 hz, bands in which no previousdirect limits have been placed. the limits in these four bands are the lowestdirect measurements to date on the stochastic background. we discuss theimplications of these results in light of the recent claim by the bicep2experiment of the possible evidence for inflationary gravitational waves.

1410.6211	searching for stochastic gravitational waves using data from the two  co-located ligo hanford detectors	searches for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (sgwb) usingterrestrial detectors typically involve cross-correlating data from pairs ofdetectors. the sensitivity of such cross-correlation analyses depends, amongother things, on the separation between the two detectors: the smaller theseparation, the better the sensitivity. hence, a co-located detector pair ismore sensitive to a gravitational-wave background than a non-co-locateddetector pair. however, co-located detectors are also expected to suffer fromcorrelated noise from instrumental and environmental effects that couldcontaminate the measurement of the background. hence, methods to identify andmitigate the effects of correlated noise are necessary to achieve the potentialincrease in sensitivity of co-located detectors. here we report on the firstsgwb analysis using the two ligo hanford detectors and address thecomplications arising from correlated environmental noise. we apply correlatednoise identification and mitigation techniques to data taken by the two ligohanford detectors, h1 and h2, during ligo's fifth science run. at lowfrequencies, 40 - 460 hz, we are unable to sufficiently mitigate the correlatednoise to a level where we may confidently measure or bound the stochasticgravitational-wave signal. however, at high frequencies, 460-1000 hz, thesetechniques are sufficient to set a $95%$ confidence level (c.l.) upper limit onthe gravitational-wave energy density of \omega(f)&lt;7.7 x 10^{-4} (f/ 900 hz)^3,which improves on the previous upper limit by a factor of $\sim 180$. in doingso, we demonstrate techniques that will be useful for future searches usingadvanced detectors, where correlated noise (e.g., from global magnetic fields)may affect even widely separated detectors.

1412.0605	a directed search for gravitational waves from scorpius x-1 with initial  ligo	we present results of a search for continuously-emitted gravitationalradiation, directed at the brightest low-mass x-ray binary, scorpius x-1. oursemi-coherent analysis covers 10 days of ligo s5 data ranging from 50-550 hz,and performs an incoherent sum of coherent $\mathcal{f}$-statistic powerdistributed amongst frequency-modulated orbital sidebands. all candidates notremoved at the veto stage were found to be consistent with noise at a 1% falsealarm rate. we present bayesian 95% confidence upper limits ongravitational-wave strain amplitude using two different prior distributions: astandard one, with no a priori assumptions about the orientation of scorpiusx-1; and an angle-restricted one, using a prior derived from electromagneticobservations. median strain upper limits of 1.3e-24 and 8e-25 are reported at150 hz for the standard and angle-restricted searches respectively. this proofof principle analysis was limited to a short observation time by unknowneffects of accretion on the intrinsic spin frequency of the neutron star, butimproves upon previous upper limits by factors of ~1.4 for the standard, and2.3 for the angle-restricted search at the sensitive region of the detector.

1508.01180	optical and x-ray early follow-up of antares neutrino alerts	high-energy neutrinos could be produced in the interaction of charged cosmicrays with matter or radiation surrounding astrophysical sources. even with therecent detection of extraterrestrial high-energy neutrinos by the icecubeexperiment, no astrophysical neutrino source has yet been discovered. transientsources, such as gamma-ray bursts, core-collapse supernovae, or active galacticnuclei are promising candidates. multi-messenger programs offer a uniqueopportunity to detect these transient sources. by combining the informationprovided by the antares neutrino telescope with information coming from otherobservatories, the probability of detecting a source is enhanced, allowing thepossibility of identifying a neutrino progenitor from a single detected event.a method based on optical and x-ray follow-ups of high-energy neutrino alertshas been developed within the antares collaboration. this program, denoted astatoo, triggers a network of robotic optical telescopes (tarot and rotse) andthe swift-xrt with a delay of only a few seconds after a neutrino detection,and is therefore well-suited to search for fast transient sources. to identifyan optical or x-ray counterpart to a neutrino signal, the images provided bythe follow-up observations are analysed with dedicated pipelines. a total of 42alerts with optical and 7 alerts with x-ray images taken with a maximum delayof 24 hours after the neutrino trigger have been analysed. no optical or x-raycounterparts associated to the neutrino triggers have been found, and upperlimits on transient source magnitudes have been derived. the probability toreject the gamma-ray burst origin hypothesis has been computed for each alert.

1510.03474	a search of the orion spur for continuous gravitational waves using a  "loosely coherent" algorithm on data from ligo interferometers	we report results of a wideband search for periodic gravitational waves fromisolated neutron stars within the orion spur towards both the inner and outerregions of our galaxy. as gravitational waves interact very weakly with matter,the search is unimpeded by dust and concentrations of stars. one search disk(a) is $6.87^\circ$ in diameter and centered on$20^\textrm{h}10^\textrm{m}54.71^\textrm{s}+33^\circ33'25.29"$, and the other(b) is $7.45^\circ$ in diameter and centered on$8^\textrm{h}35^\textrm{m}20.61^\textrm{s}-46^\circ49'25.151"$. we explored thefrequency range of 50-1500 hz and frequency derivative from $0$ to $-5\times10^{-9}$ hz/s. a multi-stage, loosely coherent search program allowed probingmore deeply than before in these two regions, while increasing coherence lengthwith every stage.  rigorous followup parameters have winnowed initial coincidence set to only 70candidates, to be examined manually. none of those 70 candidates proved to beconsistent with an isolated gravitational wave emitter, and 95% confidencelevel upper limits were placed on continuous-wave strain amplitudes. near $169$hz we achieve our lowest 95% cl upper limit on worst-case linearly polarizedstrain amplitude $h_0$ of $6.3\times 10^{-25}$, while at the high end of ourfrequency range we achieve a worst-case upper limit of $3.4\times 10^{-24}$ forall polarizations and sky locations.

1510.03621	first low frequency all-sky search for continuous gravitational wave  signals	in this paper we present the results of the first low frequency all-skysearch of continuous gravitational wave signals conducted on virgo vsr2 andvsr4 data. the search covered the full sky, a frequency range between 20 hz and128 hz with a range of spin-down between $-1.0 \times 10^{-10}$ hz/s and $+1.5\times 10^{-11}$ hz/s, and was based on a hierarchical approach. the startingpoint was a set of short fast fourier transforms (fft), of length 8192 seconds,built from the calibrated strain data. aggressive data cleaning, both in thetime and frequency domains, has been done in order to remove, as much aspossible, the effect of disturbances of instrumental origin. on each dataset anumber of candidates has been selected, using the frequencyhough transform inan incoherent step. only coincident candidates among vsr2 and vsr4 have beenexamined in order to strongly reduce the false alarm probability, and the mostsignificant candidates have been selected. the criteria we have used forcandidate selection and for the coincidence step greatly reduce the harmfuleffect of large instrumental artifacts. selected candidates have been subjectto a follow-up by constructing a new set of longer ffts followed by a furtherincoherent analysis. no evidence for continuous gravitational wave signals wasfound, therefore we have set a population-based joint vsr2-vsr4 90$\%$confidence level upper limit on the dimensionless gravitational wave strain inthe frequency range between 20 hz and 128 hz. this is the first all-sky searchfor continuous gravitational waves conducted at frequencies below 50 hz. we setupper limits in the range between about $10^{-24}$ and $2\times 10^{-23}$ atmost frequencies. our upper limits on signal strain show an improvement of upto a factor of $\sim$2 with respect to the results of previous all-sky searchesat frequencies below $80~\mathrm{hz}$.

1512.05053	leading-order determination of the gluon polarisation using a novel  method	a re-evaluation of the gluon polarisation $\delta g/g$ in the nucleon ispresented, which is based on the measurement of the longitudinal double-spinasymmetry using semi-inclusive events with photon virtuality $q^2&gt;1~({\rmgev}/c)^2$. the data were obtained by the compass experiment at cern using a160 gev/$c$ polarised muon beam scattering off a polarised $^6$lid target. thegluon polarisation is evaluated for three intervals of the nucleon momentumfraction carried by gluons, $x_{\rm g}$, covering the range $0.04 \!&lt;\! x_{ \rmg}\! &lt;\! 0.28$ . a novel method covering the full range in hadron transversemomentum $p_{\rm t}$ and a neural network approach are used. the valuesobtained at leading order in pqcd do not show any significant dependence on$x_{\rm g}$. averaged over the three intervals, the result is $\langle \deltag/g \rangle = 0.113 \pm 0.038_{\rm (stat.)}\pm 0.036_{\rm (syst.)}$ at $\langlex_{\rm g} \rangle \approx 0.10$ and a hard scale of $\mu^2= \langle q^2 \rangle= 3 ({\rm gev}/c)^2$. the obtained result suggests that the gluon polarisationis positive in the measured $x_{\rm g}$ range.

astro-ph;0204306	xmm-newton observation of the distant (z=0.6) galaxy cluster rx  j1120.1+4318	we report on a 20 ksec xmm observation of the distant cluster rxj1120.1+4318,discovered at z=0.6 in the sharc survey. the cluster has a regular sphericalmorphology, suggesting it is in a relaxed state. the combined fit of theepic/mos&amp;pn camera gives a cluster mean temperature of kt=5.3\pm0.5 kev with aniron abundance of 0.47\pm0.19. the temperature profile, measured for the firsttime at such a redshift, is consistent with an isothermal atmosphere up to halfthe virial radius. the surface brightness profile, measured nearly up to thevirial radius, is well fitted by a beta-model, with beta =0.78[+0.06,-0.04] anda core radius of thetac = 0.44[+0.06,-0.04] arcmin. we compared the propertiesof rxj1120.1+4318 with the properties of nearby clusters for two cosmologicalmodels: an einstein - de sitter universe and a flat low density universe withomega0=0.3. for both models, the scaled emission measure profile beyond thecore, the gas mass fraction and luminosity are consistent with the expectationsof the self-similar model of cluster formation, although a slightly betteragreement is obtained for a low density universe. there is no evidence of acentral cooling flow, in spite of the apparent relaxed state of the cluster.this is consistent with its estimated cooling time, larger than the age of theuniverse at the cluster redshift. the entropy profile shows a flat core with acentral entropy of ~ 140 kev cm^2, remarkably similar to the entropy floorobserved in nearby clusters, and a rising profile beyond typically 0.1 virialradius. implications of our results, in terms of non-gravitational physics incluster formation, are discussed.

astro-ph;0311381	the xmm--newton omega project: ii.cosmological implications from the  high redshift l-t relation of x-ray clusters	the evolution with redshift of the temperature-luminosity relation of x-raygalaxy clusters is a key ingredient to break degeneracies in the interpretationof x-ray clusters redshift number counts. we therefore take advantage of therecent measurements of the temperature-luminosity relation of distant clustersobserved with xmm-newton and chandra satellites to examine theoretical numbercounts expected for different available x-rays cluster samples, namely therdcs, emss, sharc, 160deg^2 and the macs at redshift greater than 0.3. wederive these counts without any adjustment, using models previously normalizedto the local temperature distribution function and to the high-z (z = 0.33)tdf. we find that these models having omega_m in the range [0.85-1.] predictcounts in remarkable agreement with the observed counts in the differentsamples. we illustrate that this conclusion is weakly sensitive to the variousingredients of the modeling. therefore number counts provide a robust evidenceof an evolving population. a realistic flat low density model (omega_m = 0.3),normalized to the local abundance of clusters is found to overproduce clusterabundance at high redshift (above z = 0.5) by nearly an order of magnitude.this result is in conflict with the popular concordance model. the conflictcould indicate a deviation from the expected scaling of the m-t relation withredshift.

astro-ph;0408453	high energy observations of xrf 030723: evidence for an off-axis  gamma-ray burst?	we report high energy transient explorer 2 (hete-2) wide field x-raymonitor/french gamma telescope observations of xrf030723 along withobservations of the xrf afterglow made using the 6.5m magellan clay telescopeand the chandra x-ray observatory. the observed peak energy e_pk_obs of the nuf_nu burst spectrum is found to lie within (or below) the wxm 2-25 kev passbandat 98.5% confidence, and no counts are detected above 30 kev. our best fitvalue is e_pk_obs=8.4+3.5/-3.4 kev. the ratio of x-ray to gamma-ray flux forthe burst follows a correlation found for grbs observed with hete-2, and theduration of the burst is similar to that typical of long-duration grbs. if werequire that the burst isotropic equivalent energy e_iso and e_pk_rest satisfythe relation discovered by amati et al. (2002), a redshift of z=0.38+0.36/-0.18can be determined, in agreement with constraints determined from opticalobservations. we are able to fit the x-ray afterglow spectrum and to measureits temporal fade. although the best-fit fade is shallower than the concurrentfade in the optical, the spectral similarity between the two bands indicatesthat the x-ray fade may actually trace the optical fade. if this is the case,the late time rebrightening observed in the optical cannot be due to asupernova bump. we interpret the prompt and afterglow x-ray emission as arisingfrom a jetted grb observed off-axis and possibly viewed through a complexcircumburst medium due to a progenitor wind.

astro-ph;0409128	global characteristics of x-ray flashes and x-ray-rich grbs observed by  hete-2	we describe and discuss the global properties of 45 gamma-ray bursts (grbs)observed by hete-2 during the first three years of its mission, focusing on theproperties of x-ray flashes (xrfs) and x-ray-rich grbs (xrrs). we find that thenumbers of xrfs, xrrs, and grbs are comparable. we find that the durations andthe sky distributions of xrfs and xrrs are similar to those of grbs. we alsofind that the spectral properties of xrfs and xrrs are similar to those ofgrbs, except that the values of the peak energy $e^{\rm obs}_{\rm peak}$ of theburst spectrum in $\nu f_\nu$, the peak energy flux $\fp$, and the energyfluence $s_e$ of xrfs are much smaller -- and those of xrrs are smaller -- thanthose of grbs. finally, we find that the distributions of all three kinds ofbursts form a continuum in the [$s_e$(2-30 kev),$s_e$(30-400) kev]-plane, the[$s_e$(2-400 kev), $e_{\rm peak}$]-plane, and the [$f_{\rm peak}$(50-300 kev),$e_{\rm peak}$]-plane. these results provide strong evidence that all threekinds of bursts arise from the same phenomenon.

astro-ph;0411410	the eclairs micro-satellite for multi-wavelength studies of gamma-ray  burst prompt emission	the cosmological revolution of 1997 has established that (at least longduration) gamma-ray bursts (grb) are among the most energetic events in theuniverse and occur at cosmological distances. the eclairs micro-satellite, tobe launched in 2009, will provide multi-wavelength observations forastrophysical studies of grb and for their possible use as cosmological probes.it is expected to be the only space borne grb trigger available for groundbased robotic telescopes operational at that time. this paper presents theeclairs project and its status. an x/gamma-ray camera onboard eclairs with awide field of view of 2 sr, will detect ~100 grb/yr in the 4-50 kev energyrange, localize the grb with a precision of ~10 arcmin on the sky, and transmitthis information to the ground in near real-time, as a grb trigger for groundbased optical telescopes. inspired by the integral imager ibis, it is based ona cdte detection plane covering 1000 cm^2, placed 35 cm below a coded mask. anoptical camera, sensitive to magnitude-15 stars, covering up to 1/4th of thex/gamma-ray camera's field of view, will observe the prompt emission and apossible precursor of ~10 grb/yr in the visible-band. used in a continuousacquisition mode at a rate of ~5 images/s dumped into an on-board memory, a grbevent sent by the x/gamma-ray camera triggers a seek-back in memory for the grboptical precursor. the full x/gamma-ray and visible-band data of a grb are sentto ground when a high data-rate telemetry ground receiver is reachable.

astro-ph;0603431	the gamma-ray burst 050904 : evidence for a termination shock ?	we analyze optical and x-ray observations of grb 050904 obtained with tarotand swift. we perform temporal and spectral analysis of the x-ray and opticaldata. we find significant absorption in the early phase of the x-ray lightcurve, with some evidence (3 sigma level) of variability. we interpret this asa progressive photo-ionization. we investigate the environment of the burst andconstrain its density profile. we find that the overall behavior of theafterglow is compatible with a fireball expanding in a wind environment duringthe first 2000 seconds after the burst (observer frame). on the other hand, thelate (after 0.5 days, observer frame) afterglow is consistent with aninterstellar medium, suggesting the possible presence of a termination shock.we estimate the termination shock position to be r_t ~ 1.8 x 10^{-2} pc, andthe wind density parameter to be a_* ~ 1.8. we try to explain the simultaneousflares observed in optical and x-ray bands in light of different models :delayed external shock from a thick shell, inverse compton emission fromreverse shock, inverse compton emission from late internal shocks or a verylong internal shock activity. among these models, those based on a singleemission mechanism, are unable to account for the broad-band observations.models invoking late internal shocks, with the inclusion of ic emission, or aproperly tuned very long internal shock activity, offer possible explanations.

astro-ph;0605570	hete-2 localizations and observations of four short gamma-ray bursts:  grbs 010326b, 040802, 051211 and 060121	here we report the localizations and properties of four short-duration grbslocalized by the high energy transient explorer 2 satellite (hete-2): grbs010326b, 040802, 051211 and 060121, all of which were detected by the frenchgamma telescope (fregate) and localized with the wide-field x-ray monitor (wxm)and/or soft x-ray camera (sxc) instruments. we discuss eight possible criteriafor determining whether these grbs are "short population bursts" (spbs) or"long population bursts" (lpbs). these criteria are (1) duration, (2) pulsewidths, (3) spectral hardness, (4) spectral lag, (5) energy egamma radiated ingamma rays (or equivalently, the kinetic energy e_ke of the grb jet), (6)existence of a long, soft bump following the burst, (7) location of the burstin the host galaxy, and (8) type of host galaxy. in particular, we havedeveloped a likelihood method for determining the probability that a burst isan spb or a lpb on the basis of its t90 duration alone. a striking feature ofthe resulting probability distribution is that the t90 duration at which aburst has an equal probability of being a spb or a lpb is t90 = 5 s, not t90 =2 s, as is often used. all four short-duration bursts discussed in detail inthis paper have t90 durations in the fregate 30-400 kev energy band of 1.90,2.31, 4.25, and 1.97 sec, respectively, yielding probabilities p(s|t90) = 0.97,0.91, 0.60, and 0.95 that these bursts are spbs on the basis of their t90durations alone. all four bursts also have spectral lags consistent with zero.these results provide strong evidence that all four grbs are spbs (abstractcontinues).

astro-ph;0605726	the interplanetary network supplement to the batse 5b catalog of cosmic  gamma-ray bursts	we present interplanetary network (ipn) localization information for 343gamma-ray bursts observed by the burst and transient source experiment (batse)between the end of the 4th batse catalog and the end of the compton gamma-rayobservatory (cgro) mission, obtained by analyzing the arrival times of thesebursts at the ulysses, near earth asteroid rendezvous (near), and cgrospacecraft. for any given burst observed by cgro and one other spacecraft,arrival time analysis (or "triangulation") results in an annulus of possiblearrival directions whose half-width varies between 11 arcseconds and 21degrees, depending on the intensity, time history, and arrival direction of theburst,as well as the distance between the spacecraft. this annulus generallyintersects the batse error circle, resulting in an average reduction of thearea of a factor of 20. when all three spacecraft observe a burst, the resultis an error box whose area varies between 1 and 48000 square arcminutes,resulting in an average reduction of the batse error circle area of a factor of87.

astro-ph;0610157	x-ray flashes or soft gamma-ray bursts? the case of the likely distant  xrf 040912	in this work, we present a multi-wavelength study of xrf 040912, aimed atmeasuring its distance scale and the intrinsic burst properties. we performed adetailed spectral and temporal analysis of both the prompt and the afterglowemission and we estimated the distance scale of the likely host galaxy. we thenused the currently available sample of xrfs with known distance to discuss theconnection between xrfs and classical gamma-ray bursts (grbs). we found thatthe prompt emission properties unambiguously identify this burst as an xrf,with an observed peak energy of e_p=17+/-13 kev and a burst fluence ratios(2-30kev)/s(30-400kev)&gt;1. a non-fading optical source with r~24 mag and withan apparently extended morphology is spatially consistent with the x-rayafterglow, likely the host galaxy. xrf 040912 is a very dark burst since noafterglow optical counterpart is detected down to r&gt;25 mag (3 sigma limitingmagnitude) at 13.6 hours after the burst. the host galaxy spectrum detectedfrom 3800a to 10000a, shows a single emission line at 9552a. the lack of anyother strong emission lines blue-ward of the detected one and the absence ofthe ly alpha cut-off down to 3800a are consistent with the hypothesis of the[oii] line at redshift z=1.563+/-0.001. the intrinsic spectral properties rankthis xrf among the soft grbs in the e_peak-e_iso diagram. similar results wereobtained for most xrfs at known redshift. only xrf 060218 and xrf 020903represent a good example of instrinsic xrf(i-xrf) and are possibly associatedwith a different progenitor population. this scenario may calls for a newdefinition of xrfs.
