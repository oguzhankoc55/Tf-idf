0903.3967	asteroseismic analysis of the roap star alpha circini: 84 days of  high-precision photometry from the wire satellite	we present a detailed study of the pulsation of alpha circini, the brightestof the rapidly oscillating ap stars. we have obtained 84 days of high-precisionphotometry from four runs with the star tracker on the wire satellite.simultaneously, we collected ground-based johnson b observations on 16 nightsat the south african astronomical observatory. in addition to the dominantoscillation mode at 2442 microhz, we detect two new modes that liesymmetrically around the principal mode to form a triplet. the averageseparation between these modes is 30.173+-0.004 microhz and they are nearlyequidistant with the separations differing by only 3.9 nhz. we compare theobserved frequencies with theoretical pulsation models based on constraintsfrom the recently determined interferometric radius and effective temperature,and the recently updated hipparcos parallax. we show that the theoretical largeseparations for models of alpha cir with global parameters within the 1-sigmaobservational uncertainties vary between 59 and 65 microhz. this is consistentwith the large separation being twice the observed value, indicating that thethree main modes are of alternating even and odd degrees. the frequencydifferences in the triplet are significantly smaller than those predicted fromour models, for all possible combinations of mode degrees, and may indicatethat the effects of magnetic perturbations need to be taken into account. thewire light curves are modulated by a double wave with a period of 4.479 days,and a peak-to-peak amplitude of 4 mmag. this variation is due to the rotationof the star and is a new discovery, made possible by the high precision of thewire photometry. the rotational modulation confirms an earlier indirectdetermination of the rotation period.

0904.4859	confirmation of simultaneous p and g mode excitation in hd 8801 and  gamma peg from time-resolved multicolour photometry of six candidate "hybrid"  pulsators	we carried out a multi-colour time-series photometric study of six starsclaimed as "hybrid" p and g mode pulsators in the literature. gamma peg wasconfirmed to show short-period oscillations of the beta cep type andsimultaneous long-period pulsations typical of slowly pulsating b (spb) stars.  from the measured amplitude ratios in the stromgren uvy passbands, thestronger of the two short period pulsation modes was identified as radial; thesecond is l=1. three of the four spb-type modes are most likely l=1 or 2.comparison with theoretical model calculations suggests that gamma peg iseither an 8.5 solar mass radial fundamental mode pulsator or a 9.6 solar massfirst radial overtone pulsator. hd 8801 was corroborated as a "hybrid" deltasct gamma dor star; four pulsation modes of the gamma dor type were detected,and two modes of the delta sct type were confirmed. two pulsational signalsbetween the frequency domains of these two known classes of variables wereconfirmed and another was newly detected. these are either previously unknowntypes of pulsation, or do not originate from hd 8801. the o-type star hd 13745showed small-amplitude slow variability on a time scale of 3.2 days. thisobject may be related to the suspected new type of supergiant spb stars, but arotational origin of its light variations cannot be ruled out at this point. 53psc is an spb star for which two pulsation frequencies were determined andidentified with low spherical degree. the behaviour of 53 ari and iota her isconsistent with non-variability during our observations, and we could notconfirm light variations of the comparison star 34 psc previously suspected.the use of signal-to-noise criteria in the analysis of data sets with strongaliasing is critically discussed.

1001.0747	hybrid gamma doradus - delta scuti pulsators: new insights into the  physics of the oscillations from kepler observations	observations of the pulsations of stars can be used to infer their interiorstructure and test theoretical models. the main sequence $\gamma$ doradus (dor)and $\delta$ scuti (sct) stars with masses 1.2-2.5 $m_{\sun}$ are particularlyuseful for these studies. the $\gamma$ dor stars pulsate in high-order $g$modes with periods of order 1 day, driven by convective blocking at the base oftheir envelope convection zone. the $\delta$ sct stars pulsate in low-order $g$and $p$ modes with periods of order 2 hours, driven by the $\kappa$ mechanismoperating in the heii ionization zone. theory predicts an overlap region in thehertzsprung-russell diagram between instability regions, where 'hybrid' starspulsating in both types of modes should exist. the two types of modes withproperties governed by different portions of the stellar interior providecomplementary model constraints. among the known $\gamma$ dor and $\delta$ sctstars, only four have been confirmed as hybrids. now, analysis of combinedquarter 0 and quarter 1 kepler data for hundreds of variable stars shows thatthe frequency spectra are so rich that there are practically no pure $\delta$sct or $\gamma$ dor pulsators, i.e. essentially all of the stars showfrequencies in both the $\delta$ sct and $\gamma$ dor frequency range. a newobservational classification scheme is proposed that takes into account theamplitude as well as the frequency, and is applied to categorize 234 stars as$\delta$ sct, $\gamma$ dor, $\delta$ sct/$\gamma$ dor or $\gamma$ dor/$\delta$sct hybrids.

1001.1116	photometric multi-site campaign on the open cluster ngc 884 i. detection  of the variable stars	context: recent progress in the seismic interpretation of field beta cepstars has resulted in improvements of the physics in the stellar structure andevolution models of massive stars. further asteroseismic constraints can beobtained from studying ensembles of stars in a young open cluster, which allhave similar age, distance and chemical composition.  aims: to improve our comprehension of the beta cep stars, we studied theyoung open cluster ngc 884 to discover new b-type pulsators, besides the twoknown beta cep stars, and other variable stars.  methods: an extensive multi-site campaign was set up to gather accurate ccdphotometry time series in four filters (u, b, v, i) of a field of ngc884.fifteen different instruments collected almost 77500 ccd images in 1286 hours.the images were calibrated and reduced to transform the ccd frames intointerpretable differential light curves. various variability indicators andfrequency analyses were applied to detect variable stars in the field. absolutephotometry was taken to deduce some general cluster and stellar properties.  results: we achieved an accuracy for the brightest stars of 5.7 mmag in v,6.9 mmag in b, 5.0 mmag in i and 5.3 mmag in u. the noise level in theamplitude spectra is 50 micromag in the v band. our campaign confirms thepreviously known pulsators, and we report more than one hundred new multi- andmono-periodic b-, a- and f-type stars. their interpretation in terms ofclassical instability domains is not straightforward, pointing to imperfectionsin theoretical instability computations. in addition, we have discovered sixnew eclipsing binaries and four candidates as well as other irregular variablestars in the observed field.

1004.3743	discovery of a nova-like cataclysmic variable in the kepler mission  field	we announce the identification of a new cataclysmic variable star in thefield of the kepler mission, kic j192410.81+445934.9. this system wasidentified during a search for compact pulsators in the kepler field.high-speed photometry reveals coherent large-amplitude variability with aperiod of 2.94 h. rapid, large-amplitude quasi-periodic variations are alsodetected on time scales of ~1200 s and ~650 s. time-resolved spectroscopycovering one half photometric period shows shallow, broad balmer and he iabsorption lines with bright emission cores as well as strong he ii and bowenblend emission. radial velocity variations are also observed in the balmer andhe i emission lines that are consistent with the photometric period. wetherefore conclude that kic j192410.81+445934.9 is a nova-like variable of theux uma class in or near the period gap, and it may belong to the rapidlygrowing subclass of sw sex systems. based on 2mass photometry and companionstar models, we place a lower limit on the distance to the system of ~500 pc.due to limitations of our discovery data, additional observations includingspectroscopy and polarimetry are needed to confirm the nature of this object.such data will help to further understanding of the behavior of nova-likevariables in the critical period range of 3-4 h, where standard cataclysmicvariable evolutionary theory finds major problems. the presence of this systemin the kepler mission field-of-view also presents a unique opportunity toobtain a continuous photometric data stream of unparalleled length andprecision on a cataclysmic variable system.

1007.3170	first kepler results on compact pulsators i. survey target selection and  the first pulsators	we present results from the first two quarters of a survey to search forpulsations in compact stellar objects with the kepler spacecraft. the surveysample and the various methods applied in its compilation are described, andspectroscopic observations are presented to separate the objects into accurateclasses. from the kepler photometry we clearly identify nine compact pulsators,and a number of interesting binary stars. of the pulsators, one shows thestrong, rapid pulsations typical for a v361 hya type sdb variable (sdbv), sevenshow long-period pulsations characteristic of v1093 her type sdbvs, and oneshows low-amplitude pulsations with both short and long periods. we deriveeffective temperatures and surface gravities for all the subdwarf b stars inthe sample and demonstrate that below the boundary region where hybrid sdbpulsators are found, all our targets are pulsating. for the stars hotter thanthis boundary temperature a low fraction of strong pulsators (&lt;10 per cent) isconfirmed. interestingly, the short-period pulsator also shows a low-amplitudemode in the long-period region, and several of the v1093 her pulsators show lowamplitude modes in the short-period region, indicating that hybrid behaviourmay be common in these stars, also outside the boundary temperature regionwhere hybrid pulsators have hitherto been found.

1008.0553	first kepler results on compact pulsators v: slowly pulsating subdwarf b  stars in short-period binaries	the survey phase of the kepler mission includes a number of hot subdwarf b(sdb) stars to search for nonradial pulsations. we present our analysis of twosdb stars that are found to be g-mode pulsators of the v1093 her class. thesetwo stars also display the distinct irradiation effect typical of sdb starswith a close m-dwarf companion with orbital periods of less than half a day.because the orbital period is so short, the stars should be in synchronousrotation, and if so, the rotation period should imprint itself on the multipletstructure of the pulsations. however, we do not find clear evidence for suchrotational splitting. though the stars do show some frequency spacings that areconsistent with synchronous rotation, they also display multiplets withsplittings that are much smaller. longer-duration time series photometry willbe needed to determine if those small splittings are in fact rotationalsplitting, or caused by slow amplitude or phase modulation. further data shouldalso improve the signal-to-noise, perhaps revealing lower amplitudeperiodicities that could confirm the expectation of synchronous rotation. thepulsation periods seen in these stars show period spacings that are suggestiveof high-overtone g-mode pulsations.

1008.0582	first kepler results on compact pulsators iii: subdwarf b stars with  v1093~her and hybrid (dw~lyn) type pulsations	we present the discovery of nonradial pulsations in five hot subdwarf b (sdb)stars based on 27 days of nearly continuous time-series photometry using thekepler spacecraft. we find that every sdb star cooler than $\approx 27\,500\,$kthat kepler has observed (seven so far) is a long-period pulsator of thev1093~her (pg~1716) class or a hybrid star with both short and long periods.the apparently non-binary long-period and hybrid pulsators are described here.  the v1093~her periods range from one to 4.5~h and are associated with$g-$mode pulsations. three stars also exhibit short periods indicative of$p-$modes with periods of 2 to 5~m and in addition, these stars exhibitperiodicities between both classes from 15 to 45~m. we detect the coolest andlongest-period v1093~her-type pulsator to date, kic010670103 ($t_eff\approx20\,900\,$k, $p_max\approx 4.5$~h) as well as a suspected hybrid pulsator,kic002697388 which is extremely cool ($t_{\rm eff}\approx 23\,900\,$k) and forthe first time hybrid pulsators which have larger $g-$mode amplitudes than$p-$mode ones. all of these pulsators are quite rich with many frequencies andwe are able to apply asymptotic relationships to associate periodicities withmodes for kic010670103. kepler data are particularly well-suited for thesestudies as they are long-duration, extremely high duty cycle observations withwell-behaved noise properties.

1008.2356	first kepler results on compact pulsators ii: kic 010139564, a new  pulsating subdwarf b (v361 hya) star with an additional low-frequency mode	we present the discovery of nonradial pulsations in a hot subdwarf b starbased on 30.5 days of nearly continuous time-series photometry using the\emph{kepler} spacecraft. kic 010139564 is found to be a short-period pulsatorof the v361 hya (ec 14026) class with more than 10 independent pulsation modeswhose periods range from 130 to 190 seconds. it also shows one periodicity at aperiod of 3165 seconds. if this periodicity is a high order g-mode, then thisstar may be the hottest member of the hybrid dw lyn stars. in addition to theresolved pulsation frequencies, additional periodic variations in the lightcurve suggest that a significant number of additional pulsation frequencies maybe present. the long duration of the run, the extremely high duty cycle, andthe well-behaved noise properties allow us to explore the stability of theperiodic variations, and to place strong constraints on how many of them areindependent stellar oscillation modes. we find that most of the identifiedperiodicities are indeed stable in phase and amplitude, suggesting a rotationperiod of 2-3 weeks for this star, but further observations are needed toconfirm this suspicion.

1010.2747	kepler observations of the beaming binary kpd 1946+4340	the kepler mission has acquired 33.5d of continuous one-minute photometry ofkpd 1946+4340, a short-period binary system that consists of an sdb and a whitedwarf. in the light curve, eclipses are clearly seen, with the deepestoccurring when the compact white dwarf crosses the disc of the sdb (0.4%) andthe more shallow ones (0.1%) when the sdb eclipses the white dwarf. asexpected, the sdb is deformed by the gravitational field of the white dwarf,which produces an ellipsoidal modulation of the light curve. spectacularly, avery strong doppler beaming (aka doppler boosting) effect is also clearlyevident at the 0.1% level. this originates from the sdb's orbital velocity,which we measure to be 164.0\pm1.9 km/s from supporting spectroscopy. wepresent light curve models that account for all these effects, as well asgravitational lensing. we derive system parameters and uncertainties from thelight curve using markov chain monte carlo simulations. adopting a theoreticalwhite dwarf mass-radius relation, the mass of the subdwarf is found to be0.47\pm0.03 msun and the mass of the white dwarf 0.59\pm0.02 msun. theeffective temperature of the white dwarf is 15 900\pm300k. with a spectroscopiceffective temperature of teff = 34 730\pm250k and a surface gravity of log g =5.43\pm0.04, the sdb is in a shell he burning stage. the detection of dopplerbeaming in kepler light curves potentially allows one to measure radialvelocities without the need of spectroscopic data. for the first time, aphotometrically observed doppler beaming amplitude is compared to aspectroscopically established value. the sdb's radial velocity amplitudederived from the photometry 168\pm4 km/s is in perfect agreement with thespectroscopic value. after subtracting our best model for the orbital effects,we searched the residuals for stellar oscillations but did not find anysignificant pulsation frequencies.

1011.3028	constraints of a pulsation frequency on stellar parameters in the  eclipsing spectroscopic binary system: v577 oph	we present a preliminary spectroscopic analysis of the binary system v577oph,observed during the summer of 2007 on the 2.6m not telescope on la palma. wehave obtained time series spectroscopic observations, which show clear binarymotion as well as radial velocity variations due to pulsation in the primarystar. by modelling the radial velocities we determine a full orbital solutionof the system, which yields m_a sin^3 i = 1.562 +/- 0.012 m_solar and m_b sin^3i = 1.461 +/- 0.020 m_solar. an estimate of inclination from photometry yieldsa primary mass of 1.6 m_solar. using this derived mass, and the known pulsationfrequency we can impose a lower limit of 1 gyr on the age of the system, andconstrain the parameters of the oscillation mode. we show that with furtheranalysis of the spectra (extracting the atmospheric parameters), tighterconstraints could be imposed on the age, metallicity and the mode parameters.this work emphasizes the power that a single pulsation frequency can have forconstraining stellar parameters in an eclipsing binary system.

1102.5025	uvbybeta photometry of early type open cluster and field stars	the beta cephei stars and slowly pulsating b (spb) stars are massive mainsequence variables. the strength of their pulsational driving strongly dependson the opacity of iron-group elements. as many of those stars naturally occurin young open clusters, whose metallicities can be determined in severalfundamental ways, it is logical to study the incidence of pulsation in severalyoung open clusters. to provide the foundation for such an investigation,str\"omgren-crawford uvbybeta photometry of open cluster target stars wascarried out to determine effective temperatures, luminosities, and thereforecluster memberships. in the course of three observing runs, uvbybeta photometryfor 168 target stars was acquired and transformed into the standard system bymeasurements of 117 standard stars. the list of target stars also included someknown cluster and field beta cephei stars, as well as beta cephei and spbcandidates that are targets of the asteroseismic part of the kepler satellitemission. the uvbybeta photometric results are presented. the data are shown tobe on the standard system, and the properties of the target stars arediscussed: 140 of these are indeed ob stars, a total of 101 targets lie withinthe beta cephei and/or spb star instability strips, and each investigatedcluster contains such potential pulsators. these measurements will be takenadvantage of in a number of subsequent publications.

1103.0644	kepler observations of variability in b-type stars	the analysis of the light curves of 48 b-type stars observed by kepler ispresented. among these are 15 pulsating stars, all of which show lowfrequencies characteristic of spb stars. seven of these stars also show a fewweak, isolated high frequencies and they could be considered as spb/beta cephybrids. in all cases the frequency spectra are quite different from what isseen from ground-based observations. we suggest that this is because most ofthe low frequencies are modes of high degree which are predicted to be unstablein models of mid-b stars. we find that there are non-pulsating stars within thebeta cep and spb instability strips. apart from the pulsating stars, we canidentify stars with frequency groupings similar to what is seen in be stars butwhich are not be stars. the origin of the groupings is not clear, but may berelated to rotation. we find periodic variations in other stars which weattribute to proximity effects in binary systems or possibly rotationalmodulation. we find no evidence for pulsating stars between the cool edge ofthe spb and the hot edge of the delta sct instability strips. none of the starsshow the broad features which can be attributed to stochastically-excited modesas recently proposed. among our sample of b stars are two chemically peculiarstars, one of which is a hgmn star showing rotational modulation in the lightcurve.

1107.0335	the kepler characterization of the variability among a- and f-type  stars. i. general overview	the kepler spacecraft is providing time series of photometric data withmicromagnitude precision for hundreds of a-f type stars. we present a firstgeneral characterization of the pulsational behaviour of a-f type stars asobserved in the kepler light curves of a sample of 750 candidate a-f typestars. we propose three main groups to describe the observed variety inpulsating a-f type stars: gamma dor, delta sct, and hybrid stars. we assign 63%of our sample to one of the three groups, and identify the remaining part asrotationally modulated/active stars, binaries, stars of different spectraltype, or stars that show no clear periodic variability. 23% of the stars (171stars) are hybrid stars, which is a much larger fraction than what has beenobserved before. we characterize for the first time a large number of a-f typestars (475 stars) in terms of number of detected frequencies, frequency range,and typical pulsation amplitudes. the majority of hybrid stars show frequencieswith all kinds of periodicities within the gamma dor and delta sct range, alsobetween 5 and 10 c/d, which is a challenge for the current models. we findindications for the existence of delta sct and gamma dor stars beyond the edgesof the current observational instability strips. the hybrid stars occupy theentire region within the delta sct and gamma dor instability strips, andbeyond. non-variable stars seem to exist within the instability strips. thelocation of gamma dor and delta sct classes in the (teff,logg)-diagram has beenextended. we investigate two newly constructed variables 'efficiency' and'energy' as a means to explore the relation between gamma dor and delta sctstars. our results suggest a revision of the current observational instabilitystrips, and imply an investigation of other pulsation mechanisms to supplementthe kappa mechanism and convective blocking effect to drive hybrid pulsations.

0711.2244	the pulsation modes of the pre-white dwarf pg 1159-035	pg 1159-035, a pre-white dwarf with t_eff=140,000 k, is the prototype of bothtwo classes: the pg1159 spectroscopic class and the dov pulsating class.previous studies of pg 1159-035 photometric data obtained with the whole earthtelescope (wet) showed a rich frequency spectrum allowing the identification of122 pulsation modes. in this work, we used all available wet photometric datafrom 1983, 1985, 1989, 1993 and 2002 to identify the pulsation periods andidentified 76 additional pulsation modes, increasing to 198 the number of knownpulsation modes in pg 1159-035, the largest number of modes detected in anystar besides the sun. from the period spacing we estimated a mass m = 0.59 +/-0.02 solar masses for pg 1159-035, with the uncertainty dominated by themodels, not the observation. deviations in the regular period spacing suggestthat some of the pulsation modes are trapped, even though the star is apre-white dwarf and the gravitational settling is ongoing. the position of thetransition zone that causes the mode trapping was calculated at r_c = 0.83 +/-0.05 stellar radius. from the multiplet splitting, we calculated the rotationalperiod p_rot = 1.3920 +/- 0.0008 days and an upper limit for the magneticfield, b &lt; 2000 g. the total power of the pulsation modes at the stellarsurface changed less than 30% for l=1 modes and less than 50% for l=2 modes. wefind no evidence of linear combinations between the 198 pulsation modefrequencies. pg 1159-035 models have not significative convection zones,supporting the hypothesis that nonlinearity arises in the convection zones incooler pulsating white dwarf stars.

1208.4250	multisite spectroscopic seismic study of the beta cep star v2052 oph:  inhibition of mixing by its magnetic field	we used extensive ground-based multisite and archival spectroscopy to deriveobservational constraints for a seismic modelling of the magnetic beta cep starv2052 ophiuchi. the line-profile variability is dominated by a radial mode(f_1=7.14846 d^{-1}) and by rotational modulation (p_rot=3.638833 d). twonon-radial low-amplitude modes (f_2=7.75603 d^{-1} and f_3=6.82308 d^{-1}) arealso detected. the four periodicities that we found are the same as the onesdiscovered from a companion multisite photometric campaign (handler et al.2012) and known in the literature. using the photometric constraints on thedegrees l of the pulsation modes, we show that both f_2 and f_3 are progrademodes with (l,m)=(4,2) or (4,3). these results allowed us to deduce ranges forthe mass (m \in [8.2,9.6] m_o) and central hydrogen abundance (x_c \in[0.25,0.32]) of v2052 oph, to identify the radial orders n_1=1, n_2=-3 andn_3=-2, and to derive an equatorial rotation velocity v_eq \in [71,75] kms^{-1}. the model parameters are in full agreement with the effectivetemperature and surface gravity deduced from spectroscopy. only models with noor mild core overshooting (alpha_ov \in [0,0.15] local pressure scale heights)can account for the observed properties. such a low overshooting is opposite toour previous modelling results for the non-magnetic beta cep star theta ophhaving very similar parameters, except for a slower surface rotation rate. wediscuss whether this result can be explained by the presence of a magneticfield in v2052 oph that inhibits mixing in its interior.

1307.2733	time-resolved multicolour photometry of bright b-type variable stars in  scorpius	the first two of a total of six nano-satellites that will constitute thebrite-constellation space photometry mission have recently been launchedsuccessfully. in preparation for this project, we carried out time-resolvedcolour photometry in a field that is an excellent candidate for britemeasurements from space. we acquired 117 h of stromgren uvy data during 19nights. our targets comprised the beta cephei stars kappa and lambda sco, theeclipsing binary mu 1 sco, and the variable super/hypergiant zeta 1 sco. forkappa sco, a photometric mode identification in combination with results fromthe spectroscopic literature suggests a dominant (l, m) = (1, -1) betacephei-type pulsation mode of the primary star. the longer period of the starmay be a rotational variation or a g-mode pulsation. for lambda sco, we recoverthe known dominant beta cephei pulsation, a longer-period variation, andobserved part of an eclipse. lack of ultraviolet data precludes modeidentification for this star. we noticed that the spectroscopic orbitalephemeris of the closer pair in this triple system is inconsistent with eclipsetimings and propose a refined value for the orbital period of the closer pairof 5.95189 +/- 0.00003 d. we also argue that the components of the lambda scosystem are some 30% more massive than previously thought. the binary lightcurve solution of mu 1 sco requires inclusion of the irradiation effect toexplain the u light curve, and the system could show additional low amplitudevariations on top of the orbital light changes. zeta 1 sco shows long-termvariability on a time scale of at least two weeks that we prefer to interpretin terms of a variable wind or strange mode pulsations.

1307.7589	searching for solar-like oscillations in the delta scuti star rho puppis	despite the shallow convective envelopes of delta scuti pulsators, solar-likeoscillations are theoretically predicted to be excited in those stars as well.to search for such stochastic oscillations we organised a spectroscopicmulti-site campaign for the bright, metal-rich delta sct star rho puppis. weobtained a total of 2763 high-resolution spectra using four telescopes. wediscuss the reduction and analysis with the iodine cell technique, developedfor searching for low-amplitude radial velocity variations, in the presence ofhigh-amplitude variability. furthermore, we have determined the angulardiameter of rho puppis to be 1.68 \pm 0.03 mas, translating into a radius of3.52 \pm 0.07rsun. using this value, the frequency of maximum power of possiblesolar-like oscillations, is expected at ~43 \pm 2 c/d (498 \pm 23 muhz). thedominant delta scuti-type pulsation mode of rho puppis is known to be theradial fundamental mode which allows us to determine the mean density of thestar, and therefore an expected large frequency separation of 2.73 c/d (31.6muhz). we conclude that 1) the radial velocity amplitudes of the delta scutipulsations are different for different spectral lines; 2) we can excludesolar-like oscillations to be present in rho puppis with an amplitude perradial mode larger than 0.5 m/s.

1405.1493	m-dwarf fast rotators and the detection of relatively young multiple  m-star systems	we have searched the kepler light curves of ~3900 m-star targets for evidenceof periodicities that indicate, by means of the effects of starspots, rapidstellar rotation. several analysis techniques, including fourier transforms,inspection of folded light curves, 'sonograms', and phase tracking ofindividual modulation cycles, were applied in order to distinguish theperiodicities due to rapid rotation from those due to stellar pulsations,eclipsing binaries, or transiting planets. we find 178 kepler m-star targetswith rotation periods, p_rot, of &lt; 2 days, and 110 with p_rot &lt; 1 day. some 30of the 178 systems exhibit two or more independent short periods within thesame kepler photometric aperture, while several have three or more shortperiods. adaptive optics imaging and modeling of the kepler pixel responsefunction for a subset of our sample support the conclusion that the targetswith multiple periods are highly likely to be relatively young physical binary,triple, and even quadruple m star systems. we explore in detail the one objectwith four incommensurate periods all less than 1.2 days, and show that two ofthe periods arise from one of a close pair of stars, while the other two arisefrom the second star, which itself is probably a visual binary. if most ofthese m-star systems with multiple periods turn out to be bound m stars, thiscould prove a valuable way of discovering young hierarchical m-star systems;the same approach may also be applicable to g and k stars. the ~5% occurrencerate of rapid rotation among the ~3900 m star targets is consistent with spinevolution models that include an initial contraction phase followed by magneticbraking, wherein a typical m star can spend several hundred myr before spinningdown to periods longer than 2 days.

1410.6283	oscillation modes in the rapidly rotating slowly pulsating b-type star  $\bmu$ eridani	we present results of a search for identification of modes responsible forthe six most significant frequency peaks detected in the rapidly rotating spbstar $\mu$ eridani. all published and some unpublished photometric data areused in our new analysis. the mode identification is carried out with themethod developed by daszy\'nska-daszkiewicz et al. employing the phases andamplitudes from multi-band photometric data and relying on the traditionalapproximation for the treatment of oscillations in rotating stars.  models consistent with the observed mean parameters are considered. for thefive frequency peaks, the candidates for the identifications are searchedamongst unstable modes. in the case of the third frequency, which is an exactmultiple of the orbital frequency, this condition is relaxed. the systematicsearch is continued up to a harmonic degree $\ell =6$.  determination of the angular numbers, $(\ell,m)$, is done simultaneously withthe rotation rate, $v_{\rm rot}$, and the inclination angle, $i$, constrainedby the spectroscopic data on the projected rotational velocity, $v_{\rmrot}\sin i$, which is assumed constant. all the peaks may be accounted for withg-modes of high radial orders and the degrees $\ell\le 6$. there aredifferences in some identifications between the models. for the twolowest--amplitude peaks the identifications are not unique. nonetheless, theequatorial velocity is constrained to a narrow range of (135, 140) km/s.  our work presents the first application of the photometric method of modeidentification in the framework of the traditional approximation and we believethat it opens a new promising direction in studies of spb stars.

astro-ph;0202152	on the relationship between the delta scuti and gamma doradus pulsators	we searched for delta scuti-type pulsations amongst known and candidate gammadoradus stars. we acquired 270 h of observations and monitored a total of 26stars. one target, hd 209295, turned out to be a member of both classes ofpulsating star. we classify six of our targets as new bona fide gamma doradusstars, nine more as good gamma doradus candidates, and three as ellipsoidalvariables. the remainder comprise one delta scuti star and five unexplainedvariables.  we revise the blue border of the gamma doradus phenomenon towards coolertemperatures. this new blue edge extends from a temperature of about 7550 k onthe zams to 7400 k one magnitude above it. five bona fide gamma doradus starswe observed are located inside the delta scuti instability strip, but none ofthem exhibited observable delta scuti pulsations. we therefore suggest thatgamma doradus stars are less likely to be delta scuti pulsators compared toother normal stars in the same region of the lower instability strip. inaddition, we show that there is a clear separation between the pulsationconstants q of delta scuti and gamma doradus stars. the gamma doradus starsknown to date all have q&gt;0.23 d.

astro-ph;0204279	pulsation of the delta scuti star theta2 tau: new multisite photometry  and modelling of instability	the results of a multisite photometric campaign of theta2 tau are reported.this binary system consists of evolved and main-sequence a stars inside theinstability strip. the 12th delta scuti network campaign included 152 hours ofhigh-precision photometry obtained at four observatories. this leads to thederivation of 11 frequencies of pulsation in the 10.8 to 14.6 c/d range. thesefrequencies confirm the results from previous earth-based (1982-1986) as wellas satellite (2000) photometry,although amplitude variability on a time scaleof several years is present. we show that at least two high frequencies (26.18and 26.73 c/d are also present in theta 2 tau. arguments are given that thesehigh frequencies originate in the main-sequence companion and are notcombination frequencies, fi+fj, from the primary. models for both the primaryand the secondary components were checked for the instability against radialand nonradial oscillations. all hot models of the primary with teff &gt; 8000k arestable in the observed frequency range. the best fit between the theoreticaland observed frequency ranges is achieved by models with teff approximatelyequal to 7800k (or slightly higher), in agreement with photometriccalibrations. the instability range spans two or three radial orders in therange p4 to p6 for radial modes. post-main-sequence models (with or withoutovershooting) are preferable for the primary, but main-sequence models withovershooting cannot be excluded. for the less luminous secondary component theinstability range is wider and spans 5 to 7 radial orders from p2 to p8. theobserved frequencies lie around radial modes p5 to p6. the main uncertaintiesof these results are caused by a simple treatment of the convective flux in thehydrogen ionization zone.

astro-ph;0501263	asteroseismology of the beta cephei star nu eridani: photometric  observations and pulsational frequency analysis	we undertook a multisite photometric campaign for the beta cephei star nueridani. more than 600 hours of differential photoelectric uvyv photometry wereobtained with 11 telescopes during 148 clear nights. the frequency analysis ofour measurements shows that the variability of nu eri can be decomposed into 23sinusoidal components, eight of which correspond to independent pulsationfrequencies between 5 - 8 c/d. some of these are arranged in multiplets, whichsuggests rotational m-mode splitting of nonradial pulsation modes as the cause.if so, the rotation period of the star must be between 30 - 60 d. one of thesignals in the light curves of nu eri has a very low frequency of 0.432 c/d. itcan be a high-order combination frequency or, more likely, an independentpulsation mode. in the latter case nu eri would be both a beta cephei star anda slowly pulsating b (spb) star. the photometric amplitudes of the individualpulsation modes of nu eri appear to have increased by about 20 per cent overthe last 40 years. so do the amplitudes of the dominant combination frequenciesof the star. among the latter, we only could identify sum frequencies withcertainty, not difference frequencies, which suggests that neither light-curvedistortion in its simplest form nor resonant mode coupling are their singlecause. one of our comparison stars, mu eridani, turned out to be variable witha dominant time scale of 1.62 d. we believe that it is either an spb star justleaving its instability strip or that its variations are of rotational origin.

astro-ph;0502073	detection of 75+ pulsation frequencies in the delta scuti star fg vir	extensive photometric multisite campaigns of the delta scuti variable fg virare presented. for the years 2003 and 2004, 926 hours of photometry at themillimag precision level were obtained. the combinations with earlier campaignslead to excellent frequency resolution and high signal/noise. a multifrequencyanalysis yields 79 frequencies. this represents a new record for this type ofstar. the modes discovered earlier were confirmed. pulsation occurs over a widefrequency band from 5.7 to 44.3 c/d with amplitudes of 0.2 mmag or larger.within this wide band the frequencies are not distributed at random, but tendto cluster in groups. a similar feature is seen in the power spectrum of theresiduals after 79 frequencies are prewhitened. this indicates that manyadditional modes are excited. the interpretation is supported by a histogram ofthe photometric amplitudes, which shows an increase of modes with smallamplitudes. the old question of the 'missing modes' may be answered now: thelarge number of detected frequencies as well as the large number of additionalfrequencies suggested by the power spectrum of the residuals con rms thetheoretical prediction of a large number of excited modes. fg vir shows anumber of frequency combinations of the dominant mode at 12.7162 c/d (m = 0)with other modes of relatively high photometric amplitudes. the amplitudes ofthe frequency sums are higher than those of the differences. a second mode(20.2878 c/d) also shows combinations. this mode of azimuthal order m = -1 iscoupled with two other modes of m = +1.

astro-ph;0502147	an asteroseismic test of diffusion theory in white dwarfs	the helium-atmosphere (db) white dwarfs are commonly thought to be thedescendants of the hotter pg1159 stars, which initially have uniform he/c/oatmospheres. in this evolutionary scenario, diffusion builds a pure he surfacelayer which gradually thickens as the star cools. in the temperature range ofthe pulsating db white dwarfs (t_eff ~ 25,000 k) this transformation is stilltaking place, allowing asteroseismic tests of the theory. we have obtaineddual-site observations of the pulsating db star cbs114, to complement existingobservations of the slightly cooler star gd358. we recover the 7 independentpulsation modes that were previously known, and we discover 4 new ones toprovide additional constraints on the models. we perform objective globalfitting of our updated double-layered envelope models to both sets ofobservations, leading to determinations of the envelope masses and pure hesurface layers that qualitatively agree with the expectations of diffusiontheory. these results provide new asteroseismic evidence supporting one of thecentral assumptions of spectral evolution theory, linking the db white dwarfsto pg1159 stars.

astro-ph;0504238	asteroseismology of the beta cephei star nu eridani -- iv. the 2003-4  multisite photometric campaign and the combined 2002-4 data	the second multisite photometric campaign devoted to nu eri is reported. fornu eri, analysis of the new data adds four independent frequencies to the ninederived previously from the 2002-3 data, three in the range from 7.20 to 7.93c/d, and a low one, equal to 0.614 c/d. combining the new and the old dataresults in two further independent frequencies, equal to 6.7322 and 6.2236 c/d.altogether, the oscillation spectrum is shown to consist of 12 high frequenciesand two low ones. the latter have u amplitudes about twice as large as the vand y amplitudes, a signature of high radial-order g modes. thus, thesuggestion that nu eri is both a beta cephei and an spb star, put forward onthe basis of the first campaign's data, is confirmed.  nine of the 12 high frequencies form three triplets, of which two are new.the triplets represent rotationally split l=1 modes, although in case of thesmallest-amplitude one this may be questioned. mean separations and asymmetriesof the triplets are derived with accuracy sufficient for meaningful comparisonwith models.  the first comparison star, mu eri, is shown to be an spb variable with anoscillation spectrum consisting of six frequencies, three of which areequidistant in period. the star is also found to be an eclipsing variable. theeclipse is a transit, probably total, the secondary is fainter than the primaryby several magnitudes, and the system is widely detached.  the second comparison star, xi eri, is confirmed to be a delta scutivariable. to the frequency of 10.8742 c/d seen already in the first campaign'sdata, another one, equal to 17.2524 c/d, is added.

astro-ph;0510326	asteroseismology of the beta cephei star 12 (dd) lacertae: photometric  observations, pulsational frequency analysis and mode identification	we report a multisite photometric campaign for the beta cephei star 12lacertae. 750 hours of high-quality differential photoelectric stromgren,johnson and geneva time-series photometry were obtained with 9 telescopesduring 190 nights. our frequency analysis results in the detection of 23sinusoidal signals in the light curves. eleven of those correspond toindependent pulsation modes, and the remainder are combination frequencies. wefind some slow aperiodic variability such as that seemingly present in severalbeta cephei stars. we perform mode identification from our colour photometry,derive the spherical degree l for the five strongest modes unambiguously andprovide constraints on l for the weaker modes. we find a mixture of modes of 0&lt;= l &lt;= 4. in particular, we prove that the previously suspected rotationallysplit triplet within the modes of 12 lac consists of modes of different l;their equal frequency splitting must thus be accidental.  one of the periodic signals we detected in the light curves is argued to be alinearly stable mode excited to visible amplitude by nonlinear mode couplingvia a 2:1 resonance. we also find a low-frequency signal in the lightvariations whose physical nature is unclear; it could be a parent or daughtermode resonantly coupled. the remaining combination frequencies are consistentwith simple light-curve distortions.  the range of excited pulsation frequencies of 12 lac may be sufficientlylarge that it cannot be reproduced by standard models. we suspect that the starhas a larger metal abundance in the pulsational driving zone, a hypothesis alsocapable of explaining the presence of beta cephei stars in the lmc.

astro-ph;0511360	the rapidly oscillating ap star hd 99563 and its distorted dipole  pulsation mode	we undertook a time-series photometric multi-site campaign for the rapidlyoscillating ap star hd 99563 and also acquired mean light observations over twoseasons. the pulsations of the star, that show flatter light maxima thanminima, can be described with a frequency quintuplet centred on 1557.653microhertz and some first harmonics of these. the amplitude of the pulsation ismodulated with the rotation period of the star that we determine with 2.91179+/- 0.00007 d from the analysis of the stellar pulsation spectrum and of themean light data. we break the distorted oscillation mode up into its purespherical harmonic components and find it is dominated by the l=1 pulsation,and also has a notable l=3 contribution, with weak l=0 and 2 components. thegeometrical configuration of the star allows one to see both pulsation polesfor about the same amount of time; hd 99563 is only the fourth roap star forwhich both pulsation poles are seen and only the third where the distortion ofthe pulsation modes was modelled. we point out that hd 99563 is very similar tothe well-studied roap star hr 3831. finally, we note that the visual companionof hd 99563 is located in the delta scuti instability strip and may thus showpulsation. we show that if the companion was physical, the roap star would be a2.03 solar mass object, seen at a rotational inclination of 44 degrees, whichthen predicts a magnetic obliquity of 86.4 degrees.

astro-ph;0603754	photometric studies of three multiperiodic beta cephei stars: beta cma,  15 cma and kz mus	we have carried out single and multi-site photometry of the three beta cepheistars beta and 15 cma as well as kz mus. for the two stars in cma, we obtained270 h of measurement in the stromgren uvy and johnson v filters, while 150 h oftime-resolved stromgren uvy photometry was acquired for kz mus. all three starsare multi-periodic variables, with three (beta cma) and four (15 cma, kz mus)independent pulsation modes. two of the mode frequencies of 15 cma are newdiscoveries and one of the known modes showed amplitude variations over thelast 33 years. taken together, this explains the star's diverse behaviourreported in the literature fully.  mode identification by means of the amplitude ratios in the differentpassbands suggests one radial mode for each star. in addition, beta cma has adominant l=2 mode while its third mode is nonradial with unknown l. thenonradial modes of 15 cma, which are l &lt;= 3, form an almost equally splittriplet that, if physical, would imply that we see the star under aninclination angle larger than 55 degrees. the strongest nonradial mode of kzmus is l=2, followed by the radial mode and a dipole mode. its weakest knownmode is nonradial with unknown l, confirming previous mode identifications forthe star's pulsations.  the phased light curve for the strongest mode of 15 cma has a descendingbranch steeper than the rising branch. a stillstand phenomenon during the riseto maximum light is indicated. given the low photometric amplitude of thisnonradial mode this is at first sight surprising, but it can be explained bythe mode's aspect angle.

astro-ph;9801264	towards a seismic model of the delta scuti star xx pyxidis	frequencies of 13 oscillation modes in the star xx pyxidis (cd-24 7599) areaccurately measured but for none of the modes the spherical harmonic degree lis known. we present results of an attempt to construct the model whose low-lmode frequencies reproduce possibly close the observations. models areconstrained by the mean photometric and spectroscopic data for the star.however, the strongest constraint on the effective temperture is from therequirement that the modes excited in the star fall into the range of the modesdriven by the opacity mechanism.  our models are built with the standard stellar evolution code allowing noovershooting from the convective core. effects of rotation are taken intoaccount both in stellar evolution and in linear nonadiabatic oscillationcalculations. uniform rotation rate and conservation of the global angularmomentum during evolution are assumed.  we find several distinct mode identifications and associated stellar modelsleading to frequency fits of similar quality. determination of the l values forsome of the modes could remove the ambiguity. none of the fits is satifactory:the mean departures exceed the mean observational frequency error by at leastone order of magnitude. the fits could be improved by means of adjusting modelparameters that were kept fixed. however, such effort will be meaningful onlyafter improving accuracy in calculation of the effects of rotation inoscillation frequencies.

astro-ph;9811178	the photometric behaviour of the peculiar pg1159 star hs2324+3944 at  high frequency resolution	we present the results from 135 hours of nearly continuous time seriesphotometry on the ``hybrid'' (h-rich) pg1159 variable star hs2324+3944,obtained in august-september 1997. the power spectrum of the data shows severalfrequencies (about 20 or more), concentrated in three narrow and very crowdedregions near 475, 390 and 950 microhz in decreasing amplitude order. most (ifnot all) of the peaks in the latter region are linear combinations of thehigh-amplitude frequencies between 455 and 500 microhz. if we divide the dataset into two equal parts, the power spectra are different. this is probably dueto a not sufficiently long (and therefore not completely resolved) light curve;nevertheless an alternative hypothesis of a single damped oscillator may not becompletely ruled out. if we adopt the first hypothesis, the high concentrationof peaks between 455 and 500 microhz suggests the presence of both l=1 and l=2high-overtone nonradial g-modes. the insufficient frequency resolution of ourdata does not allow to obtain definite precision asteroseismology results.nevertheless a spacing of the signals is observed, probably due to stellarrotation with a period of 2.3 days. if the signal spacing was due to thesuccessive overtones, the period spacings would be equal to 18.8 (l=1) and 10.4(l=2) s.

0811.0768	2006 whole earth telescope observations of gd358: a new look at the  prototype dbv	we report on the analysis of 436.1 hrs of nearly continuous high-speedphotometry on the pulsating db white dwarf gd358 acquired with the whole earthtelescope (wet) during the 2006 international observing run, designated xcov25.the fourier transform (ft) of the light curve contains power between 1000 to4000 microhz, with the dominant peak at 1234 microhz. we find 27 independentfrequencies distributed in 10 modes, as well as numerous combinationfrequencies. our discussion focuses on a new asteroseismological analysis ofgd358, incorporating the 2006 data set and drawing on 24 years of archivalobservations. our results reveal that, while the general frequency locations ofthe identified modes are consistent throughout the years, the multipletstructure is complex and cannot be interpreted simply as l=1 modes in the limitof slow rotation. the high k multiplets exhibit significant variability instructure, amplitude and frequency. any identification of the m components forthe high k multiplets is highly suspect. the k=9 and 8 modes typically do showtriplet structure more consistent with theoretical expectations. thefrequencies and amplitudes exhibit some variability, but much less than thehigh k modes. analysis of the k=9 and 8 multiplet splittings from 1990 to 2008reveal a long-term change in multiplet splittings coinciding with the 1996"sforzando" event, where gd358 dramatically altered its pulsationcharacteristics on a timescale of hours. we explore potential implications,including the possible connections between convection and/or magnetic fieldsand pulsations. we suggest future investigations, including theoreticalinvestigations of the relationship between magnetic fields, pulsation, growthrates, and convection.
