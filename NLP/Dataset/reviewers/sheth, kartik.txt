0903.4505	increasing the number of underrepresented minorities in astronomy:  executive summary	promoting racial and ethnic diversity is critically important to the futuresuccess and growth of the field of astronomy. the raw ability, drive andinterest required to excel in the field is distributed without regard to race,gender, or socioeconomic background. by not actively promoting diversity in ourfield we risk losing talented people to other professions (or losing thementirely), which means that there will be astronomical discoveries that simplywon't get made. there is demonstrated evidence that stem fields benefit fromdiverse perspectives on problems that require more complex thought processes.this is especially relevant to a field like astronomy where more and more workis being done collaboratively. the lack of notable growth in african american,hispanic, and native american representation in astronomy indicates that the'pipeline' for these individuals is systemically leaky at critical junctures.substantially more effort must be directed toward improving the educational andcareer development of minorities to insure that these potential colleagues aresupported through the process. however, simply recognizing that the pipeline isfaulty is woefully inadequate. there must be very specific, targeted solutionsto help improve the situation. with this in mind, we offer two position papersaddressing specific areas of improvement that we identify as (a) essential forany foreseeable progress in the field, and (b) attainable in the 2010-2020decade. these position papers focus primarily on african americans, hispanics,and native americans. although we do not directly address issues of asianamericans, pacific islanders, and other groups, many of the recommendationsmade here can be adapted to address issues faced by these groups as well.

0903.4506	increasing the number of underrepresented minorities in astronomy at the  undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels (paper i)	if the ethnic makeup of the astronomy profession is to achieve parity withthe general population within one generation (~30 years), the number ofunderrepresented minorities earning graduate degrees in astronomy andastrophysics must increase in the coming decade by a factor of 5 to 10. toaccomplish this, the profession must develop and invest in mechanisms to moreeffectively move individuals across critical educational junctures to the phdand beyond. early and continuous research engagement starting in theundergraduate years is critical to this vision, in which the federally fundedresearch internship programs (e.g. nsf reu, nasa gsrp) and nationalcenters/observatories play a vital role. regionally based partnerships withminority-serving institutions (msis) are crucial for tapping extant pools ofminority talent, as are post-baccalaurate and/or masters degree "bridging"programs that provide critical stepping stones to the phd. because of thestrong undergraduate physics, engineering, and computer science backgrounds ofmany students from msis, we suggest that instrument development and large scalecomputing/data-mining are particularly promising avenues for engagement in thecoming decade.

0708.0922	star formation in ngc 5194 (m51a). ii. the spatially-resolved star  formation law	we have studied the relationship between the star formation rate (sfr)surface density and gas surface density in the spiral galaxy m51a (ngc 5194),using multi-wavelength data obtained as part of the spitzer infrared nearbygalaxies survey (sings). we introduce a new sfr index based on a linearcombination of h-alpha emission-line and 24 micron continuum luminosities, thatprovides reliable extinction-corrected ionizing fluxes and sfr densities over awide range of dust attenuations. the combination of these extinction-correctedsfr densities with aperture synthesis hi and co maps has allowed us to probethe form of the spatially-resolved star formation law on scales of 0.5 to 2kpc. we find that the resolved sfr vs gas surface density relation is wellrepresented by a schmidt power law, which is similar in form and dispersion tothe disk-averaged schmidt law. we observe a comparably strong correlation ofthe sfr surface density with the molecular gas surface density, but nosignificant correlation with the surface density of atomic gas. thebest-fitting slope of the schmidt law varies from n = 1.37 to 1.56, withzeropoint and slope that change systematically with the spatial sampling scale.we tentatively attribute these variations to the effects of areal sampling andaveraging of a nonlinear intrinsic star formation law. our data can also befitted by an alternative parametrization of the sfr surface density in terms ofthe ratio of gas surface density to local dynamical time, but with aconsiderable dispersion.

1009.3265	the bulk of the black hole growth since z~1 occurs in a secular  universe: no major merger-agn connection	what is the relevance of major mergers and interactions as triggeringmechanisms for active galactic nuclei (agn) activity? to answer thislongstanding question, we analyze 140 xmm-selected agn host galaxies and amatched control sample of 1264 inactive galaxies over z~0.3-1.0 andlog(m_*/m_sun)&lt;11.7 with high-resolution hst/acs imaging from the cosmos field.the visual analysis of their morphologies by 10 independent human classifiersyields a measure of the fraction of distorted morphologies in the agn andcontrol samples, i.e. quantifying the signature of recent mergers which mightpotentially be responsible for fueling/triggering the agn. we find that (1) thevast majority (&gt;85%) of the agn host galaxies do not show strong distortions,and (2) there is no significant difference in the distortion fractions betweenactive and inactive galaxies. our findings provide the best direct evidencethat, since z~1, the bulk of black hole accretion has not been triggered bymajor galaxy mergers, therefore arguing that the alternative mechanisms, i.e.,secular processes and minor interactions, are the leading triggers for theepisodes of major black hole growth. we also exclude an alternativeinterpretation of our results: a significant time lag between merging and theobservability of the agn phase could wash out the most significant mergingsignatures, explaining the lack of enhancement of strong distortions on the agnhosts. we show that this alternative scenario is unlikely due to: (1) recentmajor mergers being ruled out for the majority of sources due to the highfraction of disk-hosted agn, (2) the lack of a significant x-ray signal inmerging inactive galaxies as a signature of a potential buried agn, and (3) thelow levels of soft x-ray obscuration for agn hosted by interacting galaxies, incontrast to model predictions.

1012.0749	the thick disk in the galaxy ngc 4244 from s4g imaging	if thick disks are ubiquitous and a natural product of disk galaxy formationand/or evolution processes, all undisturbed galaxies which have evolved duringa significant fraction of a hubble time should have a thick disk. the late-typespiral galaxy ngc 4244 has been reported as the only nearby edge-on galaxywithout a confirmed thick disk. using data from the spitzer survey of stellarstructure in galaxies (s4g) we have identified signs of two disk components inthis galaxy. the asymmetries between the light profiles on both sides of themid-plane of ngc 4244 can be explained by a combination of the galaxy not beingperfectly edge-on and a certain degree of opacity of the thin disk. we arguethat the subtlety of the thick disk is a consequence of either a limitedsecular evolution in ngc 4244, a small fraction of stellar material in thefragments which built the galaxy, or a high amount of gaseous accretion afterthe formation of the galaxy.

1107.0529	the unusual vertical mass distribution of ngc 4013 seen through the  spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g)	ngc 4013 is a nearby sb edge-on galaxy known for its "prodigious" hi warp andits "giant" tidal stream. previous work on this unusual object shows that itcannot be fitted satisfactorily by a canonical thin+thick disk structure. wehave produced a new decomposition of ngc 4013, considering three stellarflattened components (thin+thick disk plus an extra and more extendedcomponent) and one gaseous disk. all four components are considered to begravitationally coupled and isothermal. to do so, we have used the 3.6micronimages from the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g). we findevidence for ngc4013 indeed having a thin and a thick disk and an extraflattened component. this smooth and extended component (scaleheight z_ec kpc)could be interpreted as a thick disk or as a squashed ellipsoidal halo andcontains ~20% of the total mass of all three stellar components. we argue it isunlikely to be related to the ongoing merger or due to the off-plane stars froma warp in the other two disk components. instead, we favor a scenario in whichthe thick disk and the extended component were formed in a two-stage process,in which an initially thick disk has been dynamically heated by a merger soonenough in the galaxy history to have a new thick disk formed within it.

0710.4552	evolution of the bar fraction in cosmos: quantifying the assembly of the  hubble sequence	we have analyzed the redshift-dependent fraction of galactic bars over0.2&lt;z&lt;0.84 in 2,157 luminous face-on spiral galaxies from the cosmos 2-squaredegree field. our sample is an order of magnitude larger than that used in anyprevious investigation, and is based on substantially deeper imaging data thanthat available from earlier wide-area studies of high-redshift galaxymorphology. we find that the fraction of barred spirals declines rapidly withredshift. whereas in the local universe about 65% of luminous spiral galaxiescontain bars (sb+sab), at z ~0.84 this fraction drops to about 20%. over thisredshift range the fraction of strong (sb) bars drops from about 30% to under10%. it is clear that when the universe was half its present age, the census ofgalaxies on the hubble sequence was fundamentally different from that of thepresent day. a major clue to understanding this phenomenon has also emergedfrom our analysis, which shows that the bar fraction in spiral galaxies is astrong function of stellar mass, integrated color and bulge prominence. the barfraction in very massive, luminous spirals is about constant out to z ~ 0.84whereas for the low mass, blue spirals it declines significantly with redshiftbeyond z=0.3. there is also a slight preference for bars in bulge dominatedsystems at high redshifts which may be an important clue towards theco-evolution of bars, bulges and black holes. our results thus have importantramifications for the processes responsible for galactic downsizing, suggestingthat massive galaxies matured early in a dynamical sense, and not just as aresult of the regulation of their star formation rate.

0710.4559	comparative analysis of molecular clouds in m31, m33 and the milky way	we present bima observations of a 2$\arcmin$ field in the northeastern spiralarm of m31. in this region we find six giant molecular clouds that have a meandiameter of 57$\pm$13 pc, a mean velocity width of 6.5$\pm$1.2 \kms, and a meanmolecular mass of 3.0 $\pm$ 1.6 $\times$ 10$^5$\msun. the peak brightnesstemperature of these clouds ranges from 1.6--4.2 k. we compare these clouds toclouds in m33 observed by \citet{wilson90} using the ovro millimeter array, andsome cloud complexes in the milky way observed by \cite{dame01} using the cfa1.2m telescope. in order to properly compare the single dish data to thespatially filtered interferometric data, we project several well-known milkyway complexes to the distance of andromeda and simulate their observation withthe bima interferometer. we compare the simulated milky way clouds with the m31and m33 data using the same cloud identification and analysis technique andfind no significant differences in the cloud properties in all three galaxies.thus we conclude that previous claims of differences in the molecular cloudproperties between these galaxies may have been due to differences in thechoice of cloud identification techniques. with the upcoming carma array,individual molecular clouds may be studied in a variety of nearby galaxies.with alma, comprehensive gmc studies will be feasible at least as far as thevirgo cluster. with these data, comparative studies of molecular clouds acrossgalactic disks of all types and between different galaxy disks will bepossible. our results emphasize that interferometric observations combined withthe use of a consistent cloud identification and analysis technique will beessential for such forthcoming studies that will compare gmcs in the localgroup galaxies to galaxies in the virgo cluster.

1203.0467	the s4g perspective on circumstellar dust extinction of agb stars in  m100	we examine the effect of circumstellar dust extinction on the near-ircontribution of asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars in intermediate-ageclusters throughout the disk of m100. for our sample of 17 agb-dominatedclusters we extract optical-to-mid-ir seds and find that nir brightness iscoupled to the mid-ir dust emission in such a way that a significant reductionof agb light, of up to 1 mag in k-band, follows from extinction by the dustshell formed during this stage. since the dust optical depth varies with agbchemistry (c-rich or o-rich), our results suggest that the contribution of agbstars to the flux from their host clusters will be closely linked to themetallicity and the progenitor mass of the agb star, to which dust chemistryand mass-loss rate are sensitive. our sample of clusters--each the analogue ofa ~1 gyr old post-starburst galaxy--has implications within the context of massand age estimation via sed modelling at high z: we find that the average ~0.5mag extinction estimated here may be sufficient to reduce the agb contributionin (rest-frame) k-band from ~70%, as predicted in the latest generation ofsynthesis models, to ~35%. our technique for selecting agb-dominated clustersin nearby galaxies promises to be effective for discriminating theuncertainties associated with agb stars in intermediate-age populations thatplague age and mass estimation in high-z galaxies.

1204.3879	early type galaxies with tidal debris and their scaling relations in the  spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g)	tidal debris around galaxies can yield important clues on their evolution. wehave identified tidal debris in 11 early type galaxies (t \leq 0) from a sampleof 65 early types drawn from the spitzer survey of stellar structure ingalaxies (s4g). the tidal debris includes features such as shells, ripples andtidal tails. a variety of techniques, including two-dimensional decompositionof galactic structures, was used to quantify the residual tidal features. thetidal debris contributes ~3 - 10% to the total 3.6 {\mu}m luminosity of thehost galaxy. structural parameters of the galaxies were estimated usingtwo-dimensional profile fitting. we investigate the locations of galaxies withtidal debris in the fundamental plane and kormendy relation. we find thatgalaxies with tidal debris lie within the scatter of early type galaxieswithout tidal features. assuming that the tidal debris is indicative of recentgravitational interaction or merger, this suggests that these galaxies haveeither undergone minor merging events so that the overall structural propertiesof the galaxies are not significantly altered, or they have undergone a majormerging events but already have experienced sufficient relaxation andphase-mixing so that their structural properties become similar to those of thenon-interacting early type galaxies.

1208.2893	a unified picture of breaks and truncations in spiral galaxies from sdss  and s^{4}g imaging	the mechanism causing breaks in the radial surface brightness distribution ofspiral galaxies is not yet well known. despite theoretical efforts, there isnot a unique explanation for these features and the observational results arenot conclusive. in an attempt to address this problem, we have selected asample of 34 highly inclined spiral galaxies present both in the sloan digitalsky survey and in the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies. we havemeasured the surface brightness profiles in the five sloan optical bands and inthe 3.6$\mu m$ spitzer band. we have also calculated the color and stellarsurface mass density profiles using the available photometric information,finding two differentiated features: an innermost break radius at distances of$\sim 8 \pm 1$ kpc [$0.77 \pm 0.06$ $r_{25}$] and a second characteristicradius, or truncation radius, close to the outermost optical extent ($\sim 14\pm 2$ kpc [$1.09 \pm 0.05$ $r_{25}$]) of the galaxy. we propose in this workthat the breaks might be a phenomena related to a threshold in the starformation, while truncations are more likely a real drop in the stellar massdensity of the disk associated with the maximum angular momentum of the stars.

1208.6304	hot disks and delayed bar formation	we present observational evidence for the inhibition of bar formation indispersion-dominated (dynamically hot) galaxies by studying the relationshipbetween galactic structure and host galaxy kinematics in a sample of 257galaxies between 0.1 $&lt;$ z $\leq$ 0.84 from the all-wavelength extended grothstrip international survey (aegis) and the deep extragalactic evolutionaryprobe 2 (deep2) survey. we find that bars are preferentially found in galaxiesthat are massive and dynamically cold (rotation-dominated) and on the stellartully-fisher relationship, as is the case for barred spirals in the localuniverse. the data provide at least one explanation for the steep ($\times$3)decline in the overall bar fraction from z=0 to z=0.84 in l$^*$ and brighterdisks seen in previous studies. the decline in the bar fraction at highredshift is almost exclusively in the lower mass (10 $&lt;$ log m$_{*}$(\msun)$&lt;$11), later-type and bluer galaxies. a proposed explanation for this"downsizing" of the bar formation / stellar structure formation is that thelower mass galaxies may not form bars because they could be dynamically hotterthan more massive systems from the increased turbulence of accreting gas,elevated star formation, and/or increased interaction/merger rate at higherredshifts. the evidence presented here provides observational support for thishypothesis. however, the data also show that not every disk galaxy that ismassive and cold has a stellar bar, suggesting that mass and dynamic coldnessof a disk are necessary but not sufficient conditions for bar formation -- asecondary process, perhaps the interaction history between the dark matter haloand the baryonic matter, may play an important role in bar formation.

1209.1513	breaks in thin and thick discs of edge-on galaxies imaged in the spitzer  survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g)	breaks in the radial luminosity profiles of galaxies have been until nowmostly studied averaged over discs. here we study separately breaks in thin andthick discs in 70 edge-on galaxies using imaging from the spitzer survey ofstellar structure in galaxies. we built luminosity profiles of the thin and thethick discs parallel to midplanes and we found that thin discs often truncate(77%). thick discs truncate less often (31%), but when they do, their breakradius is comparable with that in the thin disc. this suggests either twodifferent truncation mechanisms - one of dynamical origin affecting both discssimultaneously and another one only affecting the thin disc - or a singlemechanism that creates a truncation in one disc or in both depending on somegalaxy property. thin discs apparently antitruncate in around 40% of galaxies.however, in many cases, these antitruncations are an artifact caused by thesuperposition of a thin disc and a thick disc with the latter having a longerscale length. we estimate the real thin disc antitruncation fraction to be lessthan 15%. we found that the ratio of the thick and thin stellar disc mass isroughly constant (0.2&lt;m_t/m_t&lt;0.7) for circular velocities v_c&gt;120 km/s, butbecomes much larger at smaller velocities. we hypothesize that this is due to acombination of a high efficiency of supernova feedback and a slower dynamicalevolution in lower-mass galaxies causing stellar thin discs to be younger andless massive than in higher-mass galaxies.

1305.2940	on the origin of lopsidedness in galaxies as determined from the spitzer  survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g)	we study the m=1 distortions (lopsidedness) in the stellar components of 167nearby galaxies that span a wide range of morphologies and luminosities. weconfirm the previous findings of 1) a high incidence of lopsidedness in thestellar distributions, 2) increasing lopsidedness as a function of radius outto at least 3.5 exponential scale lengths, and 3) greater lopsidedness, overthese radii, for galaxies of later type and lower surface brightness.additionally, the magnitude of the lopsidedness 1) correlates with thecharacter of the spiral arms (stronger arm patterns occur in galaxies with lesslopsidedness), 2) is not correlated with the presence or absence of a bar, orthe strength of the bar when one is present, 3) is inversely correlated to thestellar mass fraction, f_*, within one radial scale length, and 4) correlatesdirectly with f_* measured within the radial range over which we measurelopsidedness. we interpret these findings to mean that lopsidedness is ageneric feature of galaxies and does not, generally, depend on a rare event,such as a direct accretion of a satellite galaxy onto the disk of the parentgalaxy. while lopsidedness may be caused by several phenomena, moderatelopsidedness (&lt;a_1&gt;_i + &lt;a_1&gt;_o)/2 &lt; 0.3) is likely to reflect halo asymmetriesto which the disk responds or a gravitationally self-generated mode . wehypothesize that the magnitude of the stellar response depends both on howcentrally concentrated the stars are with respect to the dark matter andwhether there are enough stars in the region of the lopsidedness thatself-gravity is dynamically important.

1307.7709	x-ray nuclear activity in s4g barred galaxies: no link between bar  strength and co-occurrent supermassive black hole fueling	stellar bars can lead to gas inflow toward the center of a galaxy andstimulate nuclear star formation. however, there is no compelling evidence onwhether they also feed a central supermassive black hole: by measuring thefractions of barred active and inactive galaxies, previous studies have yieldedconflicting results. in this paper, we aim to understand the lack ofobservational evidence for bar-driven active galactic nucleus (agn) activity bystudying a sample of 41 nearby (d &lt; 35 mpc) barred galaxies from the spitzersurvey for stellar structure in galaxies. we use chandra observations tomeasure nuclear 2--10 kev x-ray luminosities and estimate eddington ratios,together with spitzer 3.6um imaging to quantify the strength of the stellar barin two independent ways: (1) from its structure, as traced by its ellipticityand boxiness, and (2) from its gravitational torque q_b, taken as the maximumratio of the tangential force to the mean background radial force. in this way,rather than discretizing the presence of both stellar bars and nuclearactivity, we are able to account for the continuum of bar strengths and degreesof agn activity. we find nuclear x-ray sources in 31 out of 41 galaxies withmedian x-ray luminosity and eddington ratio of l_x=4.3x10^{38} erg/s andl_bol/l_edd=6.9x10^{-6} respectively, consistent with low-luminosity agnactivity. including upper limits for those galaxies without nuclear detections,we find no significant correlation between any of the bar strength indicatorsand the degree of nuclear activity, irrespective of galaxy luminosity, stellarmass, hubble type, or bulge size. strong bars do not favor brighter or moreefficient nuclear activity, implying that at least for the low-luminosityregime, supermassive black hole fueling is not closely connected to large scalefeatures.

1312.3384	unveiling the structure of barred galaxies at 3.6 $\mu {\rm m}$ with the  spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s$^4$g): i. disk breaks	we have performed two-dimensional multicomponent decomposition of 144 localbarred spiral galaxies using 3.6 $\mu {\rm m}$ images from the spitzer surveyof stellar structure in galaxies. our model fit includes up to four components(bulge, disk, bar, and a point source) and, most importantly, takes intoaccount disk breaks. we find that ignoring the disk break and using a singledisk scale length in the model fit for type ii (down-bending) disk galaxies canlead to differences of 40% in the disk scale length, 10% in bulge-to-totalluminosity ratio (b/t), and 25% in bar-to-total luminosity ratios. we find thatfor galaxies with b/t $\geq$ 0.1, the break radius to bar radius, $r_{\rmbr}/r_{\rm bar}$, varies between 1 and 3, but as a function of b/t the ratioremains roughly constant. this suggests that in bulge-dominated galaxies thedisk break is likely related to the outer lindblad resonance (olr) of the bar,and thus moves outwards as the bar grows. for galaxies with small bulges, b/t$&lt;$ 0.1, $r_{\rm br}/r_{\rm bar}$ spans a wide range from 1 to 6. this suggeststhat the mechanism that produces the break in these galaxies may be differentfrom that in galaxies with more massive bulges. consistent with previousstudies, we conclude that disk breaks in galaxies with small bulges mayoriginate from bar resonances that may be also coupled with the spiral arms, orbe related to star formation thresholds.

1402.5210	reconstructing the stellar mass distributions of galaxies using s4g irac  3.6 and 4.5 micron images: ii. the conversion from light to mass	we present a new approach for estimating the 3.6 micron stellar mass-to-lightratio in terms of the [3.6]-[4.5] colors of old stellar populations. ourapproach avoids several of the largest sources of uncertainty in existingtechniques. by focusing on mid-ir wavelengths, we gain a virtually dustextinction-free tracer of the old stars, avoiding the need to adopt a dustmodel to correctly interpret optical or optical/nir colors normally leveragedto assign m/l. by calibrating a new relation between nir and mid-ir colors ofglimpse giant stars we also avoid discrepancies in model predictions for the[3.6]-[4.5] colors of old stellar populations due to uncertainties in molecularline opacities. we find that the [3.6]-[4.5] color, which is driven primarilyby metallicity, provides a tight constraint on m/l_3.6, which variesintrinsically less than at optical wavelengths. the uncertainty on m/l_3.6 of~0.07 dex due to unconstrained age variations marks a significant improvementon existing techniques for estimating the stellar m/l with shorter wavelengthdata. a single m/l_3.6=0.6 (assuming a chabrier imf), independent of[3.6]-[4.5] color, is also feasible as it can be applied simultaneously to old,metal-rich and young, metal-poor populations, and still with comparable (orbetter) accuracy (~0.1 dex) as alternatives. we expect our m/l_3.6 to beoptimal for mapping the stellar mass distributions in s4g galaxies, for whichwe have developed an independent component analysis technique to first isolatethe old stellar light at 3.6 micron from non-stellar emission (e.g. hot dustand the 3.3 pah feature). our estimate can also be used to determine thefractional contribution of non-stellar emission to global (rest-frame) 3.6micron fluxes, e.g. in wise imaging, and establishes a reliable basis forexploring variations in the stellar imf.

1407.7030	star formation at $4 &lt; z &lt; 6$ from the spitzer large area survey with  hyper-suprime-cam (splash)	using the first 50% of data collected for the spitzer large area survey withhyper-suprime-cam (splash) observations on the 1.8 deg$^2$ cosmologicalevolution survey (cosmos) we estimate the masses and star formation rates of3398 $m_*&gt;10^{10}m_\odot $ star-forming galaxies at $4 &lt; z &lt; 6$ with asubstantial population up to $m_* \gtrsim 10^{11.5} m_\odot$. we find that thestrong correlation between stellar mass and star formation rate seen at lowerredshift (the "main sequence" of star-forming galaxies) extends to $z\sim6$.the observed relation and scatter is consistent with a continued increase instar formation rate at fixed mass in line with extrapolations fromlower-redshift observations. it is difficult to explain this continuedcorrelation, especially for the most massive systems, unless the most massivegalaxies are forming stars near their eddington-limited rate from their firstcollapse. furthermore, we find no evidence for moderate quenching at highermasses, indicating quenching either has not occurred prior to $z \sim 6$ orelse occurs rapidly, so that few galaxies are visible in transition betweenstar-forming and quenched.

1408.2602	irac near-infrared features in the outer parts of s4g galaxies	we present a catalogue and images of visually detected features, such asasymmetries, extensions, warps, shells, tidal tails, polar rings, and obvioussigns of mergers or interactions, in the faint outer regions (at and outside ofr_25) of nearby galaxies. this catalogue can be used in future quantitativestudies that examine galaxy evolution due to internal and external factors. weare able to reliably detect outer region features down to a brightness level of0.03 mjy/sr per pixel at 3.6 microns in the spitzer survey of stellar structurein galaxies (s4g). we also tabulate companion galaxies. we find asymmetries inthe outer isophotes in 22+/-1 per cent of the sample. the asymmetry fractiondoes not correlate with galaxy classification as an interacting galaxy ormerger remnant, or with the presence of companions. we also compare thedetected features to similar features in galaxies taken from cosmological zoomre-simulations. the simulated images have a higher fraction (33 per cent) ofouter disc asymmetries, which may be due to selection effects and an uncertainstar formation threshold in the models. the asymmetries may have either aninternal (e.g., lopsidedness due to dark halo asymmetry) or external origin.

1409.2871	the role of bars in agn fueling in disk galaxies over the last seven  billion years	we present empirical constraints on the influence of stellar bars on thefueling of active galactic nuclei (agns) out to z=0.84 using a sample ofx-ray-selected agns hosted in luminous non-interacting face-on and moderatelyinclined disk galaxies from the chandra cosmos survey. using high-resolutionhubble space telescope imaging to identify bars, we find that the fraction ofbarred active galaxies displays a similar behavior as that of inactive spirals,declining with redshift from 71% at z~0.3, to 35% at z~0.8. with activegalaxies being typically massive, we compare them against a mass-matched sampleof inactive spirals and show that, while at face value the agn bar fraction isslightly higher at all redshifts, we cannot rule out that the bar fractions ofactive and inactive galaxies are the same. the presence of a bar has noinfluence on the agn strength, with barred and unbarred active galaxies showingequivalent x-ray luminosity distributions. from our results, we conclude thatthe occurrence and the efficiency of the fueling process is independent of thelarge scale structure of a galaxy. the role of bars, if any, may be restrictedto providing the suitable conditions for bh fueling to occur, i.e., bring afresh supply of gas to the central 100 pc. at the high-redshift end, we findthat roughly 60% of active disk galaxies are unbarred. we speculate this to berelated with the known dynamical state of disks at higher redshifts---moregas-rich and prone to instabilities than local spirals---which could also leadto gas inflows without the need of bars.

1410.4473	alma observations of the antennae galaxies: i. a new window on a  prototypical merger	we present the highest spatial resolution (~0.5") co (3-2) observations todate of the "overlap" region in the merging antennae galaxies (ngc 4038/39),taken with the alma. we report on the discovery of a long (3 kpc), thin (aspectratio 30/1), filament of co gas which breaks up into roughly ten individualknots. each individual knot has a low internal velocity dispersion (~10 km/s),and the dispersion of the ensemble of knots in the filament is also low (~10km/s). at the other extreme, we find that the individual clouds in the supergiant molecular cloud 2 region discussed by wilson and collaborators have alarge range of internal velocity dispersions (10 to 80 km/s), and a largedispersion amongst the ensemble (~80 km/s). we use a combination of optical andnear-ir data from hst, radio continuum observations taken with the vla, and codata from alma to develop an evolutionary classification system which providesa framework for studying the sequence of star cluster formation and evolution,from diffuse sgmcs, to proto, embedded, emerging, young, and intermediate/oldclusters. the relative timescales have been assessed by determining thefractional population of sources at each evolutionary stage. using theevolutionary framework, we estimate the maximum age range of clusters in asingle sgmc is ~10 myr, which suggests that the molecular gas is removed overthis timescale resulting in the cessation of star formation and the destructionof the gmc within a radius of about 200 pc.

1411.2870	confirming the quiescent galaxy population out to $z=3$: a stacking  analysis of mid-, far-infrared and radio data	we present stringent constraints on the average mid-, far-infrared and radioemissions of $\sim$14200 quiescent galaxies (qgs), identified out to $z=3$ inthe cosmos field via their rest-frame nuv$-$r and r$-$j colors, and withstellar masses $m_{\star}=10^{9.8-12.2} \,m_{\odot} $. stacking in deep spitzer(mips $24\,\mu$m), herschel (pacs and spire), and vla (1.4 ghz) maps revealsextremely low dust-obscured star formation rates for qgs (sfr$&lt;0.1-3\,m_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ at $z \leqslant 2$ and $&lt;6-18\,m_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$at $z &gt; 2$), consistent with the low unobscured sfrs($&lt;0.01-1.2\,m_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) inferred from modeling theirultraviolet-to-near-infrared photometry. the average sfrs of qgs are$&gt;10\times$ below those of star-forming galaxies (sfgs) within the $m_{\star}$-and $z$-ranges considered. the stacked 1.4 ghz signals (s/n $&gt; 5$) are, ifattributed solely to star formation, in excess of the total (obscured plusunobscured) sfr limits, suggestive of a widespread presence of low-luminosityactive galactic nuclei (agn) among qgs. our results reaffirm the existence of asignificant population qgs out to $z = 3$, thus corroborating the need forpowerful quenching mechanism(s) to terminate star formation in galaxies atearlier epochs.

1411.4615	globular cluster populations: first results from s$^4$g early-type  galaxies	using 3.6$\mu$m images of 97 early-type galaxies, we develop and verifymethodology to measure globular cluster populations from the s$^4$g surveyimages. we find that 1) the ratio, t$_{\rm n}$, of the number of clusters,n$_{\rm cl}$, to parent galaxy stellar mass, m$_*$, rises weakly with m$_*$ forearly-type galaxies with m$_* &gt; 10^{10}$ m$_\odot$ when we calculate galaxymasses using a universal stellar initial mass function (imf), but that thedependence of t$_{\rm n}$ on m$_*$ is removed entirely once we correct for therecently uncovered systematic variation of imf with m$_*$, and 2) for m$_* &lt;10^{10}$ m$_\odot$ there is no trend between n$_{\rm cl}$ and m$_*$, thescatter in t$_{\rm n}$ is significantly larger (approaching 2 orders ofmagnitude), and there is evidence to support a previous, independent suggestionof two families of galaxies. the behavior of n$_{\rm cl}$ in the lower masssystems is more difficult to measure because these systems are inherentlycluster poor, but our results may add to previous evidence that largevariations in cluster formation and destruction efficiencies are to be foundamong low mass galaxies. the average fraction of stellar mass in clusters is$\sim$ 0.0014 for m$_* &gt; 10^{10}$ m$_\odot$ and can be as large as $\sim 0.02$for less massive galaxies. these are the first results from the s$^4$g sampleof galaxies, and will be enhanced by the sample of early-type galaxies nowbeing added to s$^4$g and complemented by the study of later type galaxieswithin s$^4$g.

1411.4650	the mass profile and shape of bars in the spitzer survey of stellar  structure in galaxies (s4g): search for an age indicator for bars	we have measured the radial light profiles and global shapes of bars usingtwo-dimensional 3.6 $\mu m $ image decompositions for 144 face-on barredgalaxies from the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies (s4g). thebar surface brightness profile is correlated with the stellar mass andbulge-to-total (b/t) ratio of their host galaxies. bars in massive andbulge-dominated galaxies (b/t$&gt;$0.2) show a flat profile, while bars in lessmassive, disk-dominated galaxies (b/t$\sim$0) show an exponential, disk-likeprofile with a wider spread in the radial profile than in the bulge-dominatedgalaxies. the global two-dimensional shapes of bars, however, arerectangular/boxy, independent of the bulge or disk properties. we speculatethat because bars are formed out of disk, bars initially have an exponential(disk-like) profile which evolves over time, trapping more stars into the boxybar orbits. this leads bars to become stronger and have flatter profiles. thenarrow spread of bar radial profiles in more massive disks suggests that thesebars formed earlier (z$&gt;$1), while the disk-like profiles and a larger spreadin the radial profile in less massive systems imply a later and more gradualevolution, consistent with the cosmological evolution of bars inferred fromobservational studies. therefore, we expect that the flatness of the barprofile can be used as a dynamical age indicator of the bar to measure the timeelapsed since the bar formation. we argue that cosmic gas accretion is requiredto explain our results on bar profile and the presence of gas within the barregion.

1501.01080	a turnover in the galaxy main sequence of star formation at $m_{*} \sim  10^{10} m_{\odot}$ for redshifts $z &lt; 1.3$	the relationship between galaxy star formation rates (sfr) and stellar masses($m_\ast$) is re-examined using a mass-selected sample of $\sim$62,000star-forming galaxies at $z \le 1.3$ in the cosmos 2-deg$^2$ field. using newfar-infrared photometry from $herschel$-pacs and spire and $spitzer$-mips 24$\mu$m, along with derived infrared luminosities from the nrk method based ongalaxies' locations in the restframe color-color diagram $(nuv - r)$ vs. $(r -k)$, we are able to more accurately determine total sfrs for our completesample. at all redshifts, the relationship between median $sfr$ and $m_\ast$follows a power-law at low stellar masses, and flattens to nearly constant sfrat high stellar masses. we describe a new parameterization that provides thebest fit to the main sequence and characterizes the low mass power-law slope,turnover mass, and overall scaling. the turnover in the main sequence occurs ata characteristic mass of about $m_{0} \sim 10^{10} m_{\odot}$ at all redshifts.the low mass power-law slope ranges from 0.9-1.3 and the overall scaling risesin sfr as a function of $(1+z)^{4.12 \pm 0.10}$. a broken power-law fit belowand above the turnover mass gives relationships of $sfr \propto m_{*}^{0.88 \pm0.06}$ below the turnover mass and $sfr \propto m_{*}^{0.27 \pm 0.04}$ abovethe turnover mass. galaxies more massive than $m_\ast \gtrsim 10^{10}\ m_{\rm\odot}$ have on average, a much lower specific star formation rate (ssfr) thanwould be expected by simply extrapolating the traditional linear fit to themain sequence found for less massive galaxies.

1508.05946	alma observations of the submillimeter dense molecular gas tracers in  the luminous type-1 active nucleus of ngc 7469	we present alma cycle 1 observations of the central kpc region of theluminous type-1 seyfert galaxy ngc 7469 with unprecedented high resolution(0.5$"$ $\times$ 0.4$"$ = 165 pc $\times$ 132 pc) at submillimeter wavelengths.utilizing the wide-bandwidth of alma, we simultaneously obtained hcn(4-3),hco$^+$(4-3), cs(7-6), and partially co(3-2) line maps, as well as the 860$\mu$m continuum. the region consists of the central $\sim$ 1$"$ component andthe surrounding starburst ring with a radius of $\sim$ 1.5$"$-2.5$"$. severalstructures connect these components. except for co(3-2), these dense gastracers are significantly concentrated towards the central $\sim$ 1$"$,suggesting their suitability to probe the nuclear regions of galaxies. theirspatial distribution resembles well those of centimeter and mid-infraredcontinuum emissions, but it is anti-correlated with the optical one, indicatingthe existence of dust obscured star formation. the integrated intensity ratiosof hcn(4-3)/hco$^+$(4-3) and hcn(4-3)/cs(7-6) are higher at the agn positionthan at the starburst ring, which is consistent to our previous findings(submm-hcn enhancement). however, the hcn(4-3)/hco$^+$(4-3) ratio at the agnposition of ngc 7469 (1.11$\pm$0.06) is almost half of the corresponding valueof the low-luminosity type-1 seyfert galaxy ngc 1097 (2.0$\pm$0.2), despite themore than two orders of magnitude higher x-ray luminosity of ngc 7469. but theratio is comparable to that of the close vicinity of the agn of ngc 1068($\sim$ 1.5). based on these results, we speculate that some other heatingmechanisms than x-ray (e.g., mechanical heating due to agn jet) can contributesignificantly for shaping the chemical composition in ngc 1097.

1511.05608	globular cluster populations: results including s$^4$g late-type  galaxies	using 3.6 and 4.5$\mu$m images of 73 late-type, edge-on galaxies from thes$^4$g survey, we compare the richness of the globular cluster populations ofthese galaxies to those of early type galaxies that we measured previously. ingeneral, the galaxies presented here fill in the distribution for galaxies withlower stellar mass, m$_*$, specifically $\log({\rm m}_*/{\rm m}_\odot) &lt; 10$,overlap the results for early-type galaxies of similar masses, and, by doingso, strengthen the case for a dependence of the number of globular clusters per$10^9\ {\rm m}_\odot$ of galaxy stellar mass, t$_{\rm n}$, on m$_*$. for $8.5 &lt;\log ({\rm m}_*/{\rm m}_\odot) &lt; 10.5$ we find the relationship can besatisfactorily described as t$_{\rm n} = ({\rm m}_*/10^{6.7})^{-0.56}$ whenm$_*$ is expressed in solar masses. the functional form of the relationship isonly weakly constrained and extrapolation outside this range is not advised.our late-type galaxies, in contrast to our early-types, do not show thetendency for low mass galaxies to split into two t$_{\rm n}$ families. usingthese results and a galaxy stellar mass function from the literature, wecalculate that in a volume limited, local universe sample, clusters are mostlikely to be found around fairly massive galaxies (m$_* \sim 10^{10.8}$m$_\odot$) and present a fitting function for the volume number density ofclusters as a function of parent galaxy stellar mass. we find no correlationbetween t$_{\rm n}$ and large-scale environment, but do find a tendency forgalaxies of fixed m$_*$ to have larger t$_{\rm n}$ if they have converted alarger proportion of their baryons into stars.

1512.03438	submillimeter-hcn diagram for an energy diagnostics in the centers of  galaxies	compiling data from literature and the alma archive, we show enhancedhcn(4-3)/hco$^+$(4-3) and/or hcn(4-3)/cs(7-6) integrated intensity ratios incircumnuclear molecular gas around active galactic nuclei (agns) compared tothose in starburst (sb) galaxies (submillimeter hcn-enhancement). the number ofsample galaxies is significantly increased from our previous work. we expectthis feature could potentially be an extinction-free energy diagnostic tool ofnuclear regions of galaxies. non-lte radiative transfer modelings of the abovemolecular emission lines involving both collisional and radiative excitation,as well as a photon trapping effect were conducted to investigate the cause ofthe high line ratios in agns. as a result, we found that enhanced abundanceratios of hcn-to-hco$^+$ and hcn-to-cs in agns as compared to sb galaxies by afactor of a few to even $&gt;$ 10 is a plausible explanation for the submillimeterhcn-enhancement. however, a counter argument of a systematically higher gasdensity in agns than in sb galaxies can also be a plausible scenario. althoughwe could not fully discriminate these two scenarios at this moment due toinsufficient amount of multi-transition, multi-species data, the formerscenario equivalently claims for abnormal chemical composition in agns.regarding the actual mechanism to realize the composition, we suggest it isdifficult with conventional gas phase x-ray dominated region (xdr) ionizationmodels to reproduce the observed high line ratios. we might have to take intoaccount other mechanisms such as neutral-neutral reactions that are efficientlyactivated at high temperature environments and/or mechanically heated regionsto further understand the high line ratios in agns.

astro-ph;0107211	the bima survey of nearby galaxies (bima song): i. the radial  distribution of co emission in spiral galaxies	we present the first results of the bima survey of nearby galaxies (bimasong), an imaging survey of the co j=(1-0) emission in 44 nearby spiralgalaxies at a typical resolution of 6". bima song differs from previoushigh-resolution co surveys in that: (1) co brightness was not an explicitselection criterion; (2) a larger area (200" diameter for most galaxies) ofeach galaxy was imaged; and (3) fully-sampled single-dish co data (55"resolution) were obtained for over half of the sample galaxies, so all of theco flux is imaged in these galaxies. the radial distribution of stellar lightin galactic disks is generally characterized as an exponential. it is,therefore, of interest to investigate whether the molecular gas, which is thestar-forming medium, has a similar distribution. though our low-resolutionsingle-dish radial profiles of co emission can be described by simpleexponentials, this is not true for the emission at our full 6" resolution. thescale lengths of the co disks are correlated with the scale lengths of thestellar disks with a mean ratio of the scale lengths of about one. we also findthat:(1) there is also a weak correlation between the ratio of k-band to columinosity and hubble type; (2) in half of the galaxies presented here, coemission does not peak at the location of the stellar nucleus; (3) averagedover the inner kiloparsec, the co emission in one-half of the galaxies exhibitsan excess over that expected from an exponential disk which is similar to theexcess in stellar light caused by the bulge stars; and (4) this excess coemission may be due to an increase in the total molecular gas content in thebulge region, or alternatively, to an increase in the co emissivity caused bythe increased pressure of the bulge region.

astro-ph;0108005	molecular gas properties in the central kiloparsec of barred and  unbarred spirals	we study the molecular gas properties in the central kiloparsec of 29 barredand 15 unbarred spirals from the bima survey of nearby galaxies (song). we findthat the mean nuclear molecular gas surface density of barred spirals(&lt;sigma_{nuc}&gt;=309 +/- 71 msun pc^{-2}) is three times higher than that ofunbarred spirals (&lt;sigma_{nuc}&gt;=107 +/- 29 msun pc^{-2}). nine out of theeleven bars with sigma_{nuc} &gt; 300 msun pc^{-2} are early types. comparisonwith estimates of the star formation threshold density (sigma_{crit}) indicatesthat enhanced star formation in bars may be due to a larger fraction havingsigma_{nuc} &gt; typical sigma_{crit}. we also find that barred spirals are morecentrally concentrated than unbarred spirals. the median value of theconcentration parameter for barred spirals(f_{con}=sigma_{nuc}/sigma_{disk}=27.7) is a factor of four higher than thatfor the unbarred spirals (f_{con}=6.2). finally we investigate the dependenceof the central concentration on bar properties and find it may be weaklycorrelated with the bulge size, but is not correlated with the bar length. thissuggests that inner lindblad resonances, bar ellipticity and circumnuclear starformation play important roles in determining the gas accretion in the centralkiloparsec.  see http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~kartik/thesis.html for more detaileddescription of these thesis results. this research was made possible withfunding from nsf grants ast-9981308, ast-9981289 and ast-9981546.

astro-ph;0204435	inner molecular rings in barred galaxies: bima song co observations	although inner star-forming rings are common in optical images of barredspiral galaxies, observational evidence for the accompanying molecular gas hasbeen scarce. in this paper we present images of molecular inner rings, tracedusing the co (1-0) emission line, from theberkeley-illinois-maryland-association survey of nearby galaxies (bima song).we detect inner ring co emission from all five song barred galaxies classifiedas inner ring (type (r)). we also examine the seven song barred galaxiesclassified as inner spiral (type (s)); in one of these, ngc 3627, we findmorphological and kinematic evidence for a molecular inner ring. inner ringgalaxies have been classified as such based on optical images, which emphasizerecent star formation. we consider the possibility that there may exist innerrings in which star formation efficiency is not enhanced. however, we find thatin ngc 3627 the inner ring star formation efficiency is enhanced relative tomost other regions in that galaxy. we note that the song (r) galaxies have apaucity of co and h alpha emission interior to the inner ring (except near thenucleus), while ngc 3627 has relatively bright bar co and h alpha emission; wesuggest that galaxies with inner rings such as ngc 3627 may be misclassified ifthere are significant amounts of gas and star formation in the bar.

0808.2746	relation between stellar mass and star formation activity in galaxies	for a mass-selected sample of 66544 galaxies with photometric redshifts fromthe cosmic evolution survey (cosmos), we examine the evolution of starformation activity as a function of stellar mass in galaxies. we estimate thecosmic star formation rates (sfr) over the range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1.2, using therest-frame 2800 a flux (corrected for extinction). we find the mean sfr to be astrong function of the galactic stellar mass at any given redshift, withmassive systems (log (m/m(sun)) &gt; 10.5) contributing less (by a factor of ~ 5)to the total star formation rate density (sfrd).  combining data from the cosmos and gemini deep deep survey (gdds), we extendthe sfrd-z relation as a function of stellar mass to z~2. for massive galaxies,we find a steep increase in the sfrd-z relation to z~2; for the less massivesystems, the sfrd which also increases from z=0 to 1, levels off at z~1. thisimplies that the massive systems have had their major star formation activityat earlier epochs (z &gt; 2) than the lower mass galaxies.  we study changes in the sfrds as a function of both redshift and stellar massfor galaxies of different spectral types. we find that the slope of the sfrd-zrelation for different spectral type of galaxies is a strong function of theirstellar mass. for low and intermediate mass systems, the main contribution tothe cosmic sfrd comes from the star-forming galaxies while, for more massivesystems, the evolved galaxies are the most dominant population.

astro-ph;0505393	secular evolution via bar-driven gas inflow: results from bima song	we present an analysis of the molecular gas distributions in the 29 barredand 15 unbarred spirals in bima song. for co-bright galaxies, we confirm theconclusion by sakamoto et al. (1999b) that barred spirals have higher moleculargas concentrations in the central kiloparsec. the song sample also includes 27galaxies below the co brightness limit used by sakamoto et al. even in theseco-faint galaxies we show that high central gas concentrations are more commonin barred galaxies, consistent with radial inflow driven by the bar. however,there is a significant population of early-type (sa--sbc) barred spirals (6 of19) that have little or no molecular gas detected in the nuclear region and outto the bar co-rotation radius. in these galaxies, the bar has already drivenmost of the gas within the bar to the nuclear region, where it has beenconsumed by star formation. the median nuclear gas mass is over four timeshigher in early type bars; since the gas consumption rate is an order ofmagnitude higher in early type bars, early types must have significantly higherbar-driven inflows. the lower inflow rates in late type bars can be attributedto differences in bar structure between early and late types. despitebar-driven inflows, the data indicate that it is highly unlikely for a latetype galaxy to evolve into an early type via bar-induced gas inflow.nonetheless, secular evolutionary processes are undoubtedly present, andpseudo-bulges are inevitable; evidence for pseudo-bulges is likely to beclearest in early-type galaxies because of their high gas inflow rates andhigher star formation activity (abridged).

astro-ph;0611540	a near-infrared study of 2mass bars in local galaxies: an anchor for  high redshift studies	we have measured the fraction of bars in nearby spiral galaxies usingnear-infrared j, h, and k_s images of 151 spiral galaxies from 2mass. thislocal sample provides an anchor for the study of the evolution of the barfraction and bar properties with redshift. we identify bars by analyzing thefull two-dimensional light distribution and requiring a combined ellipticityand position angle signature. the combined bar signature is found in 59% of thegalaxies. the bar fraction increases to 67% when we include "candidate" bars,where only the ellipticity signature is present. we also measure the change inthe bar fraction as a function of bar size; the bar fraction drops to 36% forbars with a semi-major axis larger than 4 kpc. we find that infrared barstypically extend to one-third of the galactic disk, with a deprojected relativesize of &lt;a_{bar}/r_{25}&gt; ~ 0.3 +/- 0.2. early-type spirals host significantlylarger bars, consistent with earlier studies. the &lt;a_{bar}/r_{25}&gt; is two timeslarger in early-types than in late-types. the typical bar axial ratio (b/a) is\~0.5, with a weak trend of higher axial ratios for larger bars.

astro-ph;9908121	molecular gas kinematics in barred spiral galaxies	to quantify the effect that bar driven mass inflow can have on the evolutionof a galaxy requires an understanding of the dynamics of the inflowing gas. inthis paper we study the kinematics of the dense molecular gas in a set of sevenbarred spiral galaxies to determine which dynamical effects dominate. thekinematics are derived from observations of the co j=(1-0) line made with theberkeley-illinois-maryland association (bima) millimeter array. we compare theobserved kinematics to those predicted by ideal gas hydrodynamic and ballisticcloud-based models of gas flow in a barred potential. the hydrodynamic model isin good qualitative agreement with both the current observations of the densegas and previous observations of the kinematics of the ionized gas. theobserved kinematics indicate that the gas abruptly changes direction uponentering the dust lanes to flow directly down the dust lanes along the leadingedge of the bar until the dust lanes approach the nuclear ring. near thelocation where the dust lanes intersect the nuclear ring, we see two velocitycomponents: a low velocity component, corresponding to gas on circular orbits,and a higher velocity component, which can be attributed to the fraction of gasflowing down the bar dust lane which sprays past the contact point toward theother half of the bar. the ballistic cloud-based model of the ism is notconsistent with the observed kinematics. the kinematics in the dust lanesrequire large velocity gradients which cannot be reproduced by an ism composedof ballistic clouds with long mean-free-paths. therefore, even the dense ismresponds to hydrodynamic forces.

astro-ph;9911280	molecular gas, dust and star formation in the barred spiral ngc 5383	we present multi-wavelength (interferometer and single-dish co j=1-0, halpha,broadband optical and near-infrared) observations of the classic barred spiralngc 5383. we compare the observed central gas and dust morphology to thepredictions of recent hydrodynamic simulations. in the nuclear region, ourobservations reveal three peaks lying along a s-shaped gas and dustdistribution. in contrast, the model predicts a circumnuclear ring, not theobserved s-shaped distribution; moreover, the predicted surface densitycontrast between the central gas accumulation and the bar dust lanes is anorder of magnitude larger than observed. the discrepancies are not due tounexplored model parameter space or a nuclear bar but are probably due to thevigorous (7 solar masses per year) star formation activity in the center.  as is common in similar bars, the star formation rate in the bar between thebar ends and the central region is low (~0.5 solar masses per yr), despite thehigh gas column density in the bar dust lanes; this is generally attributed toshear and shocks. we note a tendency for the hii regions to be associated withthe spurs feeding the main bar dust lanes, but these are located on the leadingside of the bar. we propose that stars form in the spurs, which provide a highcolumn density but low shear environment. hii regions can therefore be foundeven on the leading side of the bar because the ionizing stars passballistically through the dust lane
