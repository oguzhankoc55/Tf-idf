0903.0271	the vimos vlt deep survey: stellar mass segregation and large-scale  galaxy environment in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4	hierarchical models of galaxy formation predict that the properties of a darkmatter halo depend on the large-scale environment surrounding the halo. as aresult of this correlation, we expect massive haloes to be present in largernumber in overdense regions than in underdense ones. given that a correlationexists between a galaxy stellar mass and the hosting dark matter halo mass, thesegregation in dark matter halo mass should then result in a segregation in thedistribution of stellar mass in the galaxy population. in this work we studythe distribution of galaxy stellar mass and rest-frame optical color as afunction of the large-scale galaxy distribution using the vlt vimos deep surveysample, in order to verify the presence of segregation in the properties of thegalaxy population. we use the vvds redshift measurements and multi-bandphotometric data to derive estimates of the stellar mass, rest-frame opticalcolor, and of the large-scale galaxy density, on a scale of approximately 8mpc, for a sample of 5619 galaxies in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4. we observea significant mass and optical color segregation over the whole redshiftinterval covered by our sample, such that the median value of the massdistribution is larger and the rest-frame optical color is redder in regions ofhigh galaxy density. the amplitude of the mass segregation changes little withredshift, at least in the high stellar mass regime that we can uniformelysample over the 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.4 redshift interval. the color segregation, instead,decreases significantly for z&gt;0.7. however, when we consider only galaxies innarrow bins of stellar mass, in order to exclude the effects of the stellarmass segregation on the galaxy properties, we do not observe any more anysignificant color segregation.

0906.1788	the search for decaying dark matter	we propose an x-ray mission called xenia to search for decaying superweaklyinteracting dark matter particles (super-wimp) with a mass in the kev range.the mission and its observation plan are capable of providing a major breakthrough in our understanding of the nature of dark matter (dm). it willconfirm, or reject, predictions of a number of particle physics models byincreasing the sensitivity of the search for decaying dm by about two orders ofmagnitude through a wide-field imaging x-ray spectrometer in combination with adedicated observation program.  the proposed mission will provide unique limits on the mixing angle and massof neutral leptons, right handed partners of neutrinos, which are importantdark matter candidates. the existence of these particles is strongly motivatedby observed neutrino flavor oscillations and the problem of baryon asymmetry ofthe universe.  in super-wimp models, the details of the formation of the cosmic web aredifferent from those of lambdacdm. the proposed mission will, in addition tothe search for decaying dark matter, provide crucial insight into the nature ofdm by studying the structure of the "cosmic web". this will be done bysearching for missing baryons in emission, and by using gamma-ray bursts asbacklight to observe the warm-hot intergalactic media in absorption.

0706.4371	the vimos-vlt deep survey. the dependence of clustering on galaxy  stellar mass at z~1	aims: we use the vvds-deep first-epoch data to measure the dependence ofgalaxy clustering on galaxy stellar mass, at z~0.85.  methods: we measure the projected correlation function wp(rp) for sub-sampleswith 0.5&lt;z&lt;1.2 covering different mass ranges between 10^9 and 10^11 msun. wequantify in detail the observational selection biases using 40 mock cataloguesbuilt from the millennium run and semi-analytic models.  results: our simulations indicate that serious incompleteness in mass ispresent only for log(m/msun)&lt;9.5. in the mass range log(m/msun)=[9.0-9.5], thephotometric selection function of the vvds misses 2/3rd of the galaxies. thesample is virtually 100% complete above 10^10 msun. we present the first directevidence for a clear dependence of clustering on the galaxy stellar mass atz~0.85. the clustering length increases from r0 ~ 2.76 h^-1 mpc for galaxieswith mass m&gt;10^9 msun to r0 ~ 4.28 h^-1 mpc for galaxies more massive than10^10.5 msun. at the same time, the slope increases from ~ 1.67 to ~ 2.28.  a comparison of the observed wp(rp) to local measurements by the sdss showsthat the evolution is faster for objects less massive than ~10^10.5 msun. thisis interpreted as a higher dependence on redshift of the linear bias b_l forthe more massive objects. while for the most massive galaxies b_l decreasesfrom 1.5+/-0.2 at z~0.85 to 1.33+/-0.03 at z~0.15, the less massive populationmaintains a virtually constant value b_l~1.3. this result is in agreement witha scenario in which more massive galaxies formed at high redshift in thehighest peaks of the density field, while less massive objects form at laterepochs from the more general population of dark-matter halos.

0704.1600	the vimos vlt deep survey. the assembly history of the stellar mass in  galaxies: from the young to the old universe	we present a detailed analysis of the galaxy stellar mass function ofgalaxies up to z=2.5 as obtained from the vvds. we estimate the stellar massfrom broad-band photometry using 2 different assumptions on the galaxy starformation history and show that the addition of secondary bursts to acontinuous star formation history produces systematically higher (up to 40%)stellar masses. at low redshift (z=0.2) we find a substantial population oflow-mass galaxies (&lt;10^9 msun) composed by faint blue galaxies (m_i-m_k=0.3).in general the stellar mass function evolves slowly up to z=0.9 and moresignificantly above this redshift. conversely, a massive tail is present up toz=2.5 and have extremely red colours (m_i-m_k=0.7-0.8). we find a decline withredshift of the overall number density of galaxies for all masses (59+-5% form&gt;10^8 msun at z=1), and a mild mass-dependent average evolution(`mass-downsizing'). in particular our data are consistent with mild/negligible(&lt;30%) evolution up to z=0.7 for massive galaxies (&gt;6x10^10 msun). for lessmassive systems the no-evolution scenario is excluded. a large fraction (&gt;=50%)of massive galaxies have been already assembled and converted most of their gasinto stars at z=1, ruling out the `dry mergers' as the major mechanism of theirassembly history below z=1. this fraction decreases to 33% at z=2. low-masssystems have decreased continuously in number and mass density (by a factor upto 4) from the present age to z=2, consistently with a prolonged mass assemblyalso at z&lt;1.

0911.3740	the vimos vlt deep survey: the group catalogue	[abridged] we present a homogeneous and complete catalogue of optical groupsidentified in the purely flux limited (17.5&lt;=i&lt;=24.0) vimos-vlt deep survey(vvds). we use mock catalogues extracted from the millennium simulation, tocorrect for potential systematics that might affect the overall distribution aswell as the individual properties of the identified systems. simulated samplesallow us to forecast the number and properties of groups that can bepotentially found in a survey with vvds-like selection functions. we use themto correct for the expected incompleteness and also to asses how well galaxyredshifts trace the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of the underlying massoverdensity. in particular, we train on these mock catalogues the adoptedgroup-finding technique (the voronoi-delaunay method, vdm). the goal is tofine-tune its free parameters, recover in a robust and unbiased way theredshift and velocity dispersion distributions of groups and maximize the levelof completeness (c) and purity (p) of the group catalogue. we identify 318 vvdsgroups with at least 2 members within 0.2&lt;=z&lt;=1.0, among which 144 (/30) withat least 3 (/5) members. the sample has globally c=60% and p=50%. nearly 45% ofthe groups with at least 3 members are still recovered if we run the algorithmwith a parameter set which maximizes p (75%). we exploit the group sample tostudy the redshift evolution of the fraction f_b of blue galaxies (u-b&lt;=1)within 0.2&lt;=z&lt;=1. we find that f_b is significantly lower in groups than in thewhole ensemble of galaxies irrespectively of their environment. thesequantities increase with redshift, with f_b in groups showing a marginallysignificant steeper increase. we also confirm that, at any explored redshift,f_b decreases for increasing group richness, and we extend towards fainterluminosities the magnitude range over which this result holds.

0704.1660	the vvds type-1 agn sample: the faint end of the luminosity function	in a previous paper (gavignaud et al. 2006), we presented the type-1 activegalactic nuclei (agn) sample obtained from the first epoch data of thevimos-vlt deep survey (vvds). the sample consists of 130 faint, broad-line agnwith redshift up to z=5 and 17.5&lt; i &lt;24.0, selected on the basis of theirspectra. in this paper we present the measurement of the optical luminosityfunction up to z=3.6 derived from this sample, we compare our results withprevious results from brighter samples both at low and at high redshift. ourdata, more than one magnitude fainter than previous optical surveys, allow usto constrain the faint part of the luminosity function up to high redshift. bycombining our faint vvds sample with the large sample of bright agn extractedfrom the sdss dr3 (richards et al., 2006b) and testing a number of differentevolutionary models, we find that the model which better represents thecombined luminosity functions, over a wide range of redshift and luminosity, isa luminosity dependent density evolution (ldde) model, similar to those derivedfrom the major x-surveys. such a parameterization allows the redshift of theagn space density peak to change as a function of luminosity and explains theexcess of faint agn that we find at 1.0&lt; z &lt;1.5. on the basis of this model wefind, for the first time from the analysis of optically selected samples, thatthe peak of the agn space density shifts significantly towards lower redshiftgoing to lower luminosity objects. this result, already found in a number ofx-ray selected samples of agn, is consistent with a scenario of "agn cosmicdownsizing", in which the density of more luminous agn, possibly associated tomore massive black holes, peaks earlier in the history of the universe, thanthat of low luminosity ones.

1002.2332	gmrt observations of the ophiuchus galaxy cluster	vla observations at 1477 mhz revealed the presence of a radio mini-halosurrounding the faint central point-like radio source in the ophiuchus clusterof galaxies. in this work we present a study of the radio emission from thiscluster of galaxies at lower radio frequencies. we observed the ophiuchuscluster at 153, 240, and 614 mhz with the gmrt. the mini-halo is clearlydetected at 153 and 240 mhz while it is not detected at 610 mhz. the mostprominent feature at low frequencies is a patch of diffuse steep spectrumemission located at about 5' south-east from the cluster center. by combiningthese images with that at 1477 mhz, we derived the spectral index of themini-halo. globally, the mini-halo has a low-frequency spectral index ofalpha_240^153 ~1.4 +/- 0.3 and an high-frequency spectral index ofalpha_1477^240 ~ 1.60 +/- 0.05. moreover, we measure a systematic increase ofthe high-frequency spectral index with radius: the azimuthal radial average ofalpha_1477^240 increases from about 1.3, at the cluster center, up to about 2.0in the mini-halo outskirts. the observed radio spectral index is in agreementwith that obtained by modeling the non-thermal hard x-ray emission in thiscluster of galaxies. we assume that the x-ray component arises from inversecompton scattering between the photons of the cosmic microwave background and apopulation of non-thermal electrons which are isotropically distributed andwhose energy spectrum is a power law with index p. we derive that the electronsenergy spectrum should extend from a minimum lorentz factor of gamma_min &lt; 700up to a maximum lorentz factor of gamma_max =3.8 x 10^4 with an index p=3.8 +/-0.4. the volume-averaged strength for a completely disordered intra-clustermagnetic field is b_v ~0.3 +/- 0.1 micro-g.

1003.6129	the vimos-vlt deep survey: evolution in the halo occupation number since  z $\sim$ 1	we model the evolution of the mean galaxy occupation of dark-matter halosover the range $0.1&lt;z&lt;1.3$, using the data from the vimos-vlt deep survey(vvds). the galaxy projected correlation function $w_p(r_p)$ was computed for aset of luminosity-limited subsamples and fits to its shape were obtained usingtwo variants of halo occupation distribution models. these provide us with aset of best-fitting parameters, from which we obtain the average mass of a haloand average number of galaxies per halo. we find that after accounting for theevolution in luminosity and assuming that we are largely following the samepopulation, the underlying dark matter halo shows a growth in mass withdecreasing redshift as expected in a hierarchical structure formation scenario.using two different hod models, we see that the halo mass grows by 90% over theredshift interval z=[0.5,1.0]. this is the first time the evolution in halomass at high redshifts has been obtained from a single data survey and itfollows the simple form seen in n-body simulations with $m(z) = m_0 e^{-\betaz}$, and $\beta = 1.3 \pm 0.30$. this provides evidence for a rapid accretionphase of massive halos having a present-day mass $m_0 \sim 10^{13.5} h^{-1}m_\odot$, with a $m &gt; 0.1 m_0$ merger event occuring between redshifts of 0.5and 1.0. futhermore, we find that more luminous galaxies are found to occupymore massive halos irrespectively of the redshift. finally, the average numberof galaxies per halo shows little increase from redshift z$\sim$ 1.0 to z$\sim$0.5, with a sharp increase by a factor $\sim$3 from z$\sim$ 0.5 to z$\sim$ 0.1,likely due to the dynamical friction of subhalos within their host halos.

1005.0842	extreme flux states of ngc 4151 observed with integral	we present a comprehensive spectral analysis of all integral data obtained sofar for the x-ray--bright seyfert galaxy ngc 4151. we also use allcontemporaneous data from rxte, xmm, swift and suzaku. we find a linearcorrelation between the medium and hard-energy x-ray fluxes measured byintegral, which indicates an almost constant spectral index over six years. themajority of integral observations were made when the source was either at avery bright or very dim hard--x-ray state. we find that thermal comptonizationmodels applied to the bright state yields the plasma temperature of 50--70 kevand its optical depth of 1.3--2.6, depending on the assumed source geometry.for the dim state, these parameters are in the ranges of 180--230 kev and0.3--0.7, respectively. the compton parameter is y = 1 for all the spectra,indicating a stable geometry. using this result, we can determine thereflection effective solid angles associated with the close and distantreprocessing media as = 0.3 x 2pi and 0.2 x 2pi, respectively. the plasmaenergy balance, the weak disc reflection and a comparison of the uv fluxesilluminating the plasma to the observed ones are all consistent with an innerhot accretion surrounded by an outer cold disc. the disc truncation radius canbe determined from an approximate equipartition between the observed uv andx-ray emission, and from the fitted disc blackbody model, as 15 gravitationalradii. alternatively, our results can be explained by a mildly relativisticcoronal outflow.

1010.0360	comparison of the vimos-vlt deep survey with the munich semi-analytical  model - i. magnitude counts, redshift distribution, colour bimodality, and  galaxy clustering	this paper presents a detailed comparison between high-redshift observationsfrom the vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) and predictions from the munichsemi-analytical model of galaxy formation. in particular, we focus thisanalysis on the magnitude, redshift, and colour distributions of galaxies, aswell as their clustering properties. we constructed 100 quasi-independent mockcatalogues, using the output of the semi-analytical model presented in de lucia&amp; blaizot (2007).we then applied the same observational selection function ofthe vvds-deep survey, so as to carry out a fair comparison between models andobservations. we find that the semi-analytical model reproduces well themagnitude counts in the optical bands. it tends, however, to overpredict theabundance of faint red galaxies, in particular in the i' and z' bands. modelgalaxies exhibit a colour bimodality that is only in qualitative agreement withthe data. in particular, we find that the model tends to overpredict the numberof red galaxies at low redshift and of blue galaxies at all redshifts probed byvvds-deep observations, although a large fraction of the bluest observedgalaxies is absent from the model. in addition, the model overpredicts by about14 per cent the number of galaxies observed at 0.2&lt;z&lt;1 with i_ab&lt;24. whencomparing the galaxy clustering properties, we find that model galaxies aremore strongly clustered than observed ones at all redshift from z=0.2 to z=2,with the difference being less significant above z~1. when splitting thesamples into red and blue galaxies, we find that the observed clustering ofblue galaxies is well reproduced by the model, while red model galaxies aremuch more clustered than observed ones, being principally responsible for thestrong global clustering found in the model.

1011.3302	the cool-core bias in x-ray galaxy cluster samples i: method and  application to hiflugcs	when selecting flux-limited cluster samples, the detection efficiency ofx-ray instruments is not the same for centrally-peaked and flat objects, whichintroduces a bias in flux-limited cluster samples. we quantify this effect inthe case of a well-known cluster sample, hiflugcs. we simulate a population ofx-ray clusters with various surface-brightness profiles, and use theinstrumental characteristics of the rosat all-sky survey (rass) to selectflux-limited samples similar to the hiflugcs sample and predict the expectedbias. for comparison, we also estimate observationally the bias in the hiflugcssample using xmm-newton and rosat data. we find that the selection of x-raycluster samples is significantly biased ($\sim29%$) in favor of the peaked,cool-core (cc) objects, with respect to non-cool-core (ncc) systems.interestingly, we find that the bias affects the low-mass, nearby objects(groups, poor clusters) much more than the more luminous objects (i.e massiveclusters). we also note a moderate increase of the bias for the more distantsystems. observationally, we propose to select the objects according to theirflux in a well-defined physical range excluding the cores,$0.2r_{500}-r_{500}$, to get rid of the bias. from the fluxes in this range, wereject 13 clusters out of the 64 in the hiflugcs sample, none of which appearsto be ncc. as a result, we estimate that less than half (35-37%) of the galaxyclusters in the local universe are strong cc. in the paradigm where the ccobjects trace relaxed clusters as opposed to unrelaxed, merging objects, thisimplies that to the present day the majority of the objects are not in arelaxed state. from this result, we estimate a rate of heating events of$\sim1/3$ gyr$^{-1}$ per dark-matter halo.

1205.2559	multiwavelength campaign on mrk 509 x. lower limit on the distance of  the absorber from hst cos and stis spectroscopy	active galactic nuclei often show evidence of photoionized outflows. a majoruncertainty in models for these outflows is the distance ($r$) to the gas fromthe central black hole. in this paper we use the hst/cos data from a massivemulti-wavelength monitoring campaign on the bright seyfert i galaxy mrk 509, incombination with archival hst/stis data, to constrain the location of thevarious kinematic components of the outflow. we compare the expected responseof the photoionized gas to changes in ionizing flux with the changes measuredin the data using the following steps: 1) we compare the column densities ofeach kinematic component measured in the 2001 stis data with those measured inthe 2009 cos data; 2) we use time-dependent photionization calculations with aset of simulated lightcurves to put statistical upper limits on the hydrogennumber density that are consistent with the observed small changes in the ioniccolumn densities; 3) from the upper limit on the number density, we calculate alower limit on the distance to the absorber from the central source via theprior determination of the ionization parameter. our method offers twoimprovements on traditional timescale analysis. first, we account for thephysical behavior of agn lightcurves. second, our analysis accounts for thequality of measurement in cases where no changes are observed in the absorptiontroughs. the very small variations in trough ionic column densities (mostlyconsistent with no change) between the 2001 and 2009 epochs allow us to putstatistical lower limits on the distance between 100--200 pc for all the majoruv absorption components at a confidence level of 99%. these results are mainlyconsistent with the independent distance estimates derived for the warmabsorbers from the simultaneous x-ray spectra.

0712.2326	integral discovery of non-thermal hard x-ray emission from the ophiuchus  cluster	we present the results of deep observations of the ophiuchus cluster ofgalaxies with integral in the 3-80 kev band. we analyse 3 ms of integral dataon the ophiuchus cluster with the ibis/isgri hard x-ray imager and the jem-xx-ray monitor. in the x-ray band using jem-x, we show that the source isextended, and that the morphology is compatible with the results found byprevious missions. above 20 kev, we show that the size of the source isslightly larger than the psf of the instrument, and is consistent with the softx-ray morphology found with jem-x and asca. thanks to the constraints on thetemperature provided by jem-x, we show that the spectrum of the cluster is notwell fitted by a single-temperature thermal bremsstrahlung model, and thatanother spectral component is needed to explain the high energy data. we detectthe high energy tail with a higher detection significance (6.4 sigma) than thebepposax claim (2 sigma). because of the imaging capabilities of jem-x andisgri, we are able to exclude the possibility that the excess emission comesfrom very hot regions or absorbed agn, which proves that the excess emission isindeed of non-thermal origin. using the available radio data together with thenon-thermal hard x-ray flux, we estimate a magnetic field b ~ 0.1-0.2 mu g.

0802.1944	a test of the nature of cosmic acceleration using galaxy redshift  distortions	observations of distant supernovae indicate that the universe is now in aphase of accelerated expansion the physical cause of which is a mystery.formally, this requires the inclusion of a term acting as a negative pressurein the equations of cosmic expansion, accounting for about 75 per cent of thetotal energy density in the universe. the simplest option for this "darkenergy" corresponds to a cosmological constant, perhaps related to the quantumvacuum energy. physically viable alternatives invoke either the presence of ascalar field with an evolving equation of state, or extensions of generalrelativity involving higher-order curvature terms or extra dimensions. althoughthey produce similar expansion rates, different models predict measurabledifferences in the growth rate of large-scale structure with cosmic time. afingerprint of this growth is provided by coherent galaxy motions, whichintroduce a radial anisotropy in the clustering pattern reconstructed by galaxyredshift surveys. here we report a measurement of this effect at a redshift of0.8. using a new survey of more than 10,000 faint galaxies, we measure theanisotropy parameter b = 0.70 +/- 0.26, which corresponds to a growth rate ofstructure at that time of f = 0.91 +/- 0.36. this is consistent with thestandard cosmological-constant model with low matter density and flat geometry,although the error bars are still too large to distinguish among alternativeorigins for the accelerated expansion. this could be achieved with a furtherfactor-of-ten increase in the sampled volume at similar redshift.

1403.3691	discovery of a rich proto-cluster at z=2.9 and associated diffuse cold  gas in the vimos ultra-deep survey (vuds)	[abridged] we characterise a massive proto-cluster at z=2.895 that we foundin the cosmos field using the spectroscopic sample of the vimos ultra-deepsurvey (vuds). this is one of the rare structures at z~3 not identified aroundagns or radio galaxies, so it is an ideal laboratory to study galaxy formationin dense environments. the structure comprises 12 galaxies with securespectroscopic redshift in an area of 7'x8', in a z bin of dz=0.016. themeasured galaxy number overdensity is delta_g=12+/-2. this overdensity hastotal mass of m~8.1x10^(14)m_sun in a volume of 13x15x17 mpc^3. simulationsindicate that such an overdensity at z~2.9 is a proto-cluster that willcollapse in a cluster of total mass m~2.5x10^(15)m_sun at z=0. we compare theproperties of the galaxies within the overdensity with a control sample at thesame z but outside the overdensity. we did not find any statisticallysignificant difference between the properties (stellar mass, sfr, ssfr, nuv-r,r-k) of the galaxies inside and outside the overdensity. the stacked spectrumof galaxies in the overdensity background shows a significant absorptionfeature at the wavelength of lya redshifted at z=2.895 (lambda=4736 a), with arest frame ew = 4+/- 1.4 a. stacking only background galaxies withoutintervening sources at z~2.9 along their line of sight, we find that thisabsorption feature has a rest frame ew of 10.8+/-3.7 a, with a detection s/n of~4. these ew values imply a high column density (n(hi)~3-20x10^(19)cm^(-2)),consistent with a scenario where such absorption is due to intervening cold gasstreams, falling into the halo potential wells of the proto-cluster galaxies.however, we cannot exclude the hypothesis that this absorption is due to thediffuse gas within the overdensity.

1403.4230	vimos ultra-deep survey (vuds): witnessing the assembly of a massive  cluster at z~3.3	using new spectroscopic observations obtained as part of the vimos ultra-deepsurvey (vuds), we perform a systematic search for overdense environments in theearly universe ($z&gt;2$) and report here on the discovery of cl j0227-0421, amassive protocluster at $z=3.29$. this protocluster is characterized by boththe large overdensity of spectroscopically confirmed members,$\delta_{gal}=10.5\pm2.8$, and a significant overdensity in photometricredshift members. the halo mass of this protocluster is estimated, by a varietyof methods, to be roughly $3\times10^{14}$ $\mathcal{m}_{\odot}$ at $z\sim3.3$,which, evolved to $z=0$ results in a halo mass rivaling or exceeding that ofthe coma cluster. the properties of 19 spectroscopically confirmed membergalaxies are compared with a large sample of vuds/vvds galaxies in lowerdensity field environments at similar redshifts. we find tentative evidence foran excess of redder, brighter, and more massive galaxies within the confines ofthe protocluster relative to the field population, which suggests that we maybe observing the beginning of environmentally-induced quenching. the propertiesof these galaxies are investigated, including a discussion of the brightestprotocluster galaxy which appears to be undergoing vigorous coeval nuclear andstarburst activity. the remaining member galaxies appear to havecharacteristics which are largely similar to the field population. though wefind weaker evidence of the suppression of the median star formation ratesamongst and differences in stacked spectra of member galaxies with respect tothe field, we defer any conclusions of these trends to future work with theensemble of protostructures that are found in the full vuds sample.

1404.3863	multiwavelength campaign on mrk 509. xiii. testing ionized-reflection  models on mrk 509	active galactic nuclei (agn) are the most luminous persistent objects in theuniverse. an excess of x-ray emission below about 2 kev, called soft-excess, isvery common in type 1 agn spectra. the origin of this feature remains debated.originally modeled with a blackbody, there are now several possibilities tomodel the soft-excess, including warm comptonization and blurred ionizedreflection. in this paper, we test ionized-reflection models on mrk 509, abright seyfert 1 galaxy for which we have a unique data set, in order todetermine whether it can be responsible for the strong soft-excess. we use tensimultaneous xmm-newton and integral observations performed every four days. wepresent here the results of the spectral analysis, the evolution of theparameters and the variability properties of the x-ray emission. theapplication of blurred ionized-reflection models leads to a very strongreflection and an extreme geometry, but fails to reproduce the broad-bandspectrum of mrk 509. two different scenarios for blurred ionized reflection arediscussed: stable geometry and lamp-post configuration. in both cases we findthat the model parameters do not follow the expected relations, indicating thatthe model is fine-tuned to fit the data without physical justification. alarge, slow variation of the soft-excess without counterpart in the hard x-rayscould be explained by a change in ionization of the reflector. however, such achange does not naturally follow from the assumed geometrical configuration.warm comptonization remains the most probable origin of the soft-excess in thisobject. nevertheless, it is possible that both ionized reflection and warmcomptonization mechanisms can explain the soft-excess in all objects, onedominating the other one, depending on the physical conditions of the disk andthe corona.

1408.1394	the stripping of a galaxy group diving into the massive cluster a2142	structure formation in the current universe operates through the accretion ofgroup-scale systems onto massive clusters. the detection and study of suchaccreting systems is crucial to understand the build-up of the most massivevirialized structures we see today. we report the discovery with xmm-newton ofan irregular x-ray substructure in the outskirts of the massive galaxy clusterabell 2142. the tip of the x-ray emission coincides with a concentration ofgalaxies. the bulk of the x-ray emission of this substructure appears to belagging behind the galaxies and extends over a projected scale of at least 800kpc. the temperature of the gas in this region is 1.4 kev, which is a factor of~4 lower than the surrounding medium and is typical of the virialized plasma ofa galaxy group with a mass of a few 10^13m_sun. for this reason, we interpretthis structure as a galaxy group in the process of being accreted onto the maindark-matter halo. the x-ray structure trailing behind the group is due to gasstripped from its original dark-matter halo as it moves through theintracluster medium (icm). this is the longest x-ray trail reported to date.for an infall velocity of ~1,200 km s-1 we estimate that the stripped gas hasbeen surviving in the presence of the hot icm for at least 600 myr, whichexceeds the spitzer conduction timescale in the medium by a factor of &gt;~400.such a strong suppression of conductivity is likely related to a tangledmagnetic field with small coherence length and to plasma microinstabilities.the long survival time of the low-entropy intragroup medium suggests that theinfalling material can eventually settle within the core of the main cluster.

1412.1171	astro-h white paper - agn winds	in this white paper we describe the prospects for astro-h for the study ofoutflows from active galactic nuclei. the most important breakthroughs in thisfield are expected to arise from the high spectral resolution and sensitivityin the fe-k band, combined with broad-band sensitivity over the full x-ray bandand spectral capabilities also at lower energies. the sensitivity in the fe-kregion allows to extend the absorption measure distribution of the outflow outto the highest ionisation states accessible, where observations with currentx-ray missions indicate that most of the outflowing gas is to be found. due tothe high-resolution and sensitivity it will also be able to give the definitiveproof for the existence of ultra-fast outflows, and if so, characterise theirphysical properties in great detail. these ultra-fast outflows carry very largeamounts of energy and momentum, and are of fundamental importance for feedbackstudies. we show how the astro-h observations in general can help to constrainnumerical models for outflows. the link to reflection and emission processes isalso discussed, as well as the possible relation between outflows andrelativistic emission lines. finally, we discuss the prospects for otherrelated categories of objects like bal quasars, partially covered sources andcompton thick outflows.

1501.03426	anatomy of the agn in ngc 5548: iii. the high-energy view with nustar  and integral	we describe the analysis of the seven broad-band x-ray continuum observationsof the archetypal seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548 that were obtained with xmm-newtonor chandra, simultaneously with high-energy (&gt; 10 kev) observations with nustarand integral. these data were obtained as part of a multiwavelength campaignundertaken from the summer of 2013 till early 2014. we find evidence of ahigh-energy cut-off in at least one observation, which we attribute to thermalcomptonization, and a constant reflected component that is likely due toneutral material at least a few light months away from the continuum source. weconfirm the presence of strong, partial covering x-ray absorption as theexplanation for the sharp decrease in flux through the soft x-ray band. theobscurers appear to be variable in column density and covering fraction on timescales as short as weeks. a fit of the average spectrum over the range 0.3-400kev with a realistic comptonization model indicates the presence of a hotcorona with a temperature of 40(+40,-10) kev and an optical depth of2.7(+0.7,-1.2) if a spherical geometry is assumed.

0804.4568	the vimos vlt deep survey: global properties of 20000 galaxies in the  i_ab&lt;=22.5 wide survey	the vvds-wide survey has been designed with the general aim of tracing thelarge-scale distribution of galaxies at z~1 on comoving scales reaching~100mpc/h, while providing a good control of cosmic variance over areas aslarge as a few square degrees. this is achieved by measuring redshifts withvimos at the eso vlt to a limiting magnitude i_ab=22.5, targeting fourindependent fields with size up to 4 sq.deg. each. the whole survey covers 8.6sq.deg., here we present the general properties of the current redshift sample.this includes 32734 spectra in the four regions (19977 galaxies, 304 type iagns, and 9913 stars), covering a total area of 6.1 sq.deg, with a samplingrate of 22 to 24%. the redshift success rate is above 90% independently ofmagnitude. it is the currently largest area coverage among redshift surveysreaching z~1. we give the mean n(z) distribution averaged over 6.1 sq.deg.comparing galaxy densities from the four fields shows that in a redshift bindeltaz=0.1 at z~1 one still has factor-of-two variations over areas as large as~0.25 sq.deg. this level of cosmic variance agrees with that obtained byintegrating the galaxy two-point correlation function estimated from the f22field alone, and is also in fairly good statistical agreement with thatpredicted by the millennium mocks. the variance estimated over the surveyfields shows explicitly how clustering results from deep surveys of even ~1sq.deg. size should be interpreted with caution. this paper accompanies thepublic release of the first 18143 redshifts of the vvds-wide survey from the 4sq.deg. contiguous area of the f22 field at ra=22h, publicly available athttp://cencosw.oamp.fr

0805.0537	a deep integral hard x-ray survey of the 3c 273/coma region	(abridged) we present an analysis of the deepest hard x-ray survey to date ofabout 2500 deg^2 performed by the ibis instrument on board integral in the20-60 kev band, with a total exposure time of 4 ms. we find 34 candidatesources. the ratio of seyfert 1 to seyfert 2 is significantly more than theratio found in the optical, which may be evidence for a receding torus, butcould also be due to absorption columns &gt; 10^{25} cm^{-2}. none of thepredicted compton-thick objects is detected unambiguously; when taking lowerlimits on nh into account, the fraction of these objects is found to be lowerthan 24%. we do not see, but cannot exclude, a relationship between absorptionand luminosity similar to what is seen in the 2-10 kev band. our data suggeststhe possibility of a lack of objects with 10^{21} &lt; nh &lt; 10^{22} cm^{-2}, asexpected if absorption originates either in a torus-like structure or in thehost galaxy. we find that the log n-log s diagram of our sources is compatiblewith those obtained in other surveys in hard x-rays. compared to models of theagn population selected in the 2-10 kev band, the log n-log s diagram isgenerally in good agreement, but the nh distribution is significantlydifferent, with significantly less unabsorbed sources (nh&lt;10^{22} cm^{-2}) at agiven flux limit compared to the models. we resolve here about 2.5% of thecosmic x-ray background. we also study the local hard x-ray luminosityfunction, which is compatible with what is found in other recent hard x-raysurveys. the characteristic luminosity log l*_{20-60 kev}=43.66 is found to bea factor about 5 lower than the value observed in the 2-10 kev band. we find aspace density of 10^{-3} agn with l&gt;10^{41} per mpc^3 and a correspondingluminosity density of 0.9 10^{39} erg s^{-1} mpc^{-3}.

1505.02562	anatomy of the agn in ngc 5548 iv. the short-term variability of the  outflows	during an extensive multiwavelength campaign that we performed in 2013-14 theprototypical seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 5548 has been found in an unusual conditionof heavy and persistent obscuration. the newly discovered "obscurer" absorbsmost of the soft x-ray continuum along our line of sight and lowers theionizing luminosity received by the classical warm absorber. here we presentthe analysis of the high resolution x-ray spectra collected with xmm-newton andchandra throughout the campaign, which are suitable to investigate thevariability of both the obscurer and the classical warm absorber. the timeseparation between these x-ray observations range from 2 days to 8 months. onthese timescales the obscurer is variable both in column density and incovering fraction. this is consistent with the picture of a patchy wind. themost significant variation occurred in september 2013 when the sourcebrightened for two weeks. a higher and steeper intrinsic continuum and a lowerobscurer covering fraction are both required to explain the spectral shapeduring the flare. we suggest that a geometrical change of the soft x-ray sourcebehind the obscurer cause the observed drop in the covering fraction. due tothe higher soft x-ray continuum level the september 2013 chandra spectrum isthe only x ray spectrum of the campaign where individual features of the warmabsorber could be detected. the spectrum shows absorption from fe-uta,\ion{o}{iv}, and \ion{o}{v}, consistent to belong to the lower-ionizationcounterpart of the historical ngc 5548 warm absorber. hence, we confirm thatthe warm absorber has responded to the drop in the ionizing luminosity causedby the obscurer.

0705.2438	the swire-vvds-cfhtls surveys: stellar mass assembly over the last 10  gyears. evidence for a major build up of the red sequence between z=2 and z=1	(abridged abstract) we present an analysis of the stellar mass growth overthe last 10 gyrs using a large 3.6$\mu$ selected sample. we split our sampleinto active (blue) and quiescent (red) galaxies. our measurements of the k-lfsand ld evolution support the idea that a large fraction of galaxies is alreadyassembled at $z\sim 1.2$. based on the analysis of the evolution of the stellarmass-to-light ratio (in k-band) for the spectroscopic sub-sample, we derive thestellar mass density for the entire sample. we find that the global evolutionof the stellar mass density is well reproduced by the star formation ratederived from uv dust corrected measurements. over the last 8gyrs, we observethat the stellar mass density of the active population remains approximatelyconstant while it gradually increases for the quiescent population over thesame timescale. as a consequence, the growth of the stellar mass in thequiescent population must be due to the shutoff of star formation in activegalaxies that migrate into the quiescent population. from $z=2$ to $z=1.2$, weobserve a major build-up of the quiescent population with an increase by afactor of 10 in stellar mass, suggesting that we are observing the epoch whenan increasing fraction of galaxies are ending their star formation activity andstart to build up the red sequence.

0805.3411	the multiwavelength variability of 3c 273	we present an update of 3c 273's database hosted by the isdc, completed withdata from radio to gamma-ray observations over the last 10 years. we use thislarge data set to study the multiwavelength properties of thisquasar,especially focussing on its variability behaviour. we study theamplitude of the variations and the maximum variability time scales across thebroad-band spectrum and correlate the light curves in different bands,specifically with the x-rays, to search for possible connections between theemission at different energies. 3c 273 shows variability at all frequencies,with amplitudes and time scales strongly depending on the energy and being thesignatures of the different emission mechanisms. the variability properties ofthe x-ray band imply the presence of either two separate components (possibly aseyfert-like and a blazar-like) or at least two parameters with distinct timingproperties to account for the x-ray emission below and above ~20 kev. thedominant hard x-ray emission is most probably not due to electrons acceleratedby the shock waves in the jet as their variability does not correlate with theflaring millimeter emission, but seems to be associated to long-timescalevariations in the optical. this optical component is consistent with beingoptically thin synchrotron radiation from the base of the jet and the hardx-rays would be produced through inverse compton processes (ssc and/or ec) bythe same electron population. we show evidence that this synchrotron componentextends from the optical to the near-infrared domain, where it is blended byemission of heated dust that we find to be located within about 1 light-yearfrom the ultraviolet source.

1509.01101	the lyman continuum escape fraction of galaxies at z=3.3 in the  vuds-lbc/cosmos field	the lyman continuum (lyc) flux escaping from high-z galaxies into the igm isa fundamental quantity to understand the physical processes involved in thereionization epoch. we have investigated a sample of star-forming galaxies atz~3.3 in order to search for possible detections of lyc photons escaping fromgalaxy halos. uv deep imaging in the cosmos field obtained with the prime focuscamera lbc at the lbt telescope was used together with a catalog ofspectroscopic redshifts obtained by the vimos ultra deep survey (vuds) to builda sample of 45 galaxies at z~3.3 with l&gt;0.5l*. we obtained deep lbc images ofgalaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the interval 3.27&lt;z&lt;3.40 both in the rand deep u bands. a sub-sample of 10 galaxies apparently shows escapefractions&gt;28% but a detailed analysis of their properties reveals that, withthe exception of two marginal detections (s/n~2) in the u band, all the other 8galaxies are most likely contaminated by the uv flux of low-z interloperslocated close to the high-z targets. the average escape fraction derived fromthe stacking of the cleaned sample was constrained to fesc_rel&lt;2%. the impliedhi photo-ionization rate is a factor two lower than that needed to keep the igmionized at z~3, as observed in the lyman forest of high-z qso spectra or by theproximity effect. these results support a scenario where high redshift,relatively bright (l&gt;0.5l*) star-forming galaxies alone are unable to sustainthe level of ionization observed in the cosmic igm at z~3. star-forminggalaxies at higher redshift and at fainter luminosities (l&lt;&lt;l*) can be themajor contributors to the reionization of the universe only if their physicalproperties are subject to rapid changes from z~3 to z~6-10. alternatively,ionizing sources could be discovered looking for fainter sources among the agnpopulation at high-z.

1512.03814	the xxl survey. xiii. baryon content of the bright cluster sample	traditionally, galaxy clusters have been expected to retain all the materialaccreted since their formation epoch. for this reason, their matter contentshould be representative of the universe as a whole, and thus their baryonfraction should be close to the universal baryon fraction. we make use of thesample of the 100 brightest galaxy clusters discovered in the xxl survey toinvestigate the fraction of baryons in the form of hot gas and stars in thecluster population. we measure the gas masses of the detected halos and use amass--temperature relation directly calibrated using weak-lensing measurementsfor a subset of xxl clusters to estimate the halo mass. we find that theweak-lensing calibrated gas fraction of xxl-100-gc clusters is substantiallylower than was found in previous studies using hydrostatic masses. our best-fitrelation between gas fraction and mass reads $f_{\rmgas,500}=0.055_{-0.006}^{+0.007}\left(m_{\rm500}/10^{14}m_\odot\right)^{0.21_{-0.10}^{+0.11}}$. the baryon budget of galaxyclusters therefore falls short of the universal baryon fraction by about afactor of two at $r_{\rm 500}$. our measurements require a hydrostatic bias$1-b=m_x/m_{\rm wl}=0.72_{-0.07}^{+0.08}$ to match the gas fraction obtainedusing lensing and hydrostatic equilibrium. comparing our gas fractionmeasurements with the expectations from numerical simulations, our resultsfavour an extreme feedback scheme in which a significant fraction of thebaryons are expelled from the cores of halos. this model is, however, incontrast with the thermodynamical properties of observed halos, which mightsuggest that weak-lensing masses are overestimated. we note that a mass bias$1-b=0.58$ as required to reconcile planck cmb and cluster counts shouldtranslate into an even lower baryon fraction, which poses a major challenge toour current understanding of galaxy clusters.

astro-ph;0409134	the vimos-vlt deep survey: evolution of the galaxy luminosity function  up to z=2 in first epoch data	we investigate the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function from thevimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) from the present to z=2 in five (u, b, v, r and i)rest-frame band-passes. we use the first epoch vvds deep sample of 11,034spectra selected at 17.5 &lt;= i_{ab} &lt;= 24.0, on which we apply the algorithm forluminosity function (alf), described in this paper. we observe a substantialevolution with redshift of the global luminosity functions in all bands. fromz=0.05 to z=2, we measure a brightening of the characteristic magnitude m*included in the magnitude range 1.8-2.5, 1.7-2.4, 1.2-1.9, 1.1-1.8 and 1.0-1.6in the u, b, v, r and i rest-frame bands, respectively. we confirm thisdifferential evolution of the luminosity function with rest-frame wavelength,from the measurement of the comoving density of bright galaxies (m &lt;m*(z=0.1)). this density increases by a factor of around 2.6, 2.2, 1.8, 1.5,1.5 between z=0.05 and z=1 in the u, b, v, r, i bands, respectively. we alsomeasure a possible steepening of the faint-end slope of the luminosityfunctions, with \delta\alpha ~ -0.3 between z=0.05 and z=1, similar in allbands.

astro-ph;0409135	the vimos vlt deep survey - the evolution of galaxy clustering to z=2  from first epoch observations	this paper presents the evolution of the clustering of the main population ofgalaxies from z=2.1 to z=0.2, from the first epoch vimos vlt deep survey(vvds), a magnitude limited sample with 17.5&lt;=i_{ab}&lt;=24. we have computed thecorrelation functions \xi(r_p,\pi) and w_p(r_p), and the correlation lengthr_0(z), for the vvds-02h and vvds-cdfs fields, for a total of 7155 galaxies ina 0.61deg^2 area. we find that the correlation length in this sample staysroughly constant from z=0.5 to z=1.1, with r_0(z)=2.5-2.8 h^{-1} mpc(comoving), for galaxies comparable in luminosity to the local 2dfgrs and sdsssamples, indicating that the amplitude of the correlation function was ~2.5xlower at z~1 than observed locally. the correlation length in our lowestredshift bin z=[0.2,0.5] is r_0=2.4 h^{-1} mpc, lower than for any otherpopulation at the same redshift, indicating the low clustering of very lowluminosity galaxies, 1.5 magnitudes fainter than in the 2dfgrs or sdss. thecorrelation length is increasing to r_0~3.0 h^{-1} mpc at higher redshiftsz=[1.3,2.1], as we are observing increasingly brighter galaxies, comparable togalaxies with mb_ab=-20.5 locally. we compare our measurement to the deep2measurements in the range z=[0.7,1.35] \citep{coil} on the population selectedapplying the same magnitude and color selection criteria as in their survey,and find comparable results. the slowly varying clustering of vvds galaxies asredshift increases is markedly different from the predicted evolution of theclustering of dark matter, indicating that bright galaxies are already tracingthe large scale structures emerging from the dark matter distribution 9-10billion years ago, a supporting evidence for a strong evolution of the galaxyvs. dark matter bias.

astro-ph;0409138	the vimos vlt deep survey: computing the two point correlation  statistics and associated uncertainties	we are presenting in this paper a detailed account of the methods used tocompute the three-dimensional two-point galaxy correlation function in thevimos-vlt deep survey (vvds). we investigate how instrumental selection effectsand observational biases affect the measurements and identify the methods tocorrect them. we quantify the accuracy of our correction method using anensemble of fifty mock galaxy surveys generated with the galics semi-analyticmodel of galaxy formation which incorporate the same selection biases andtiling strategy as the real data does. we demonstrate that we are able torecover the real-space two-point correlation function xi(s) to an accuracybetter than 10% on scales larger than 1 h^{-1} mpc, and of about 30% on scalesbelow 1 h^{-1} mpc, with the sampling strategy used for the first epoch vvdsdata. the projected correlation function w_p(r_p) is recovered with an accuracybetter than 10% on all scales 0.1 &lt;= r &lt;= 10 h^{-1} mpc. there is a tendencyfor a small but systematic under-estimate of the correlation length derivedfrom w_p(r_p) of 6% on average, remaining after our correction process. thelarge number of simulated surveys allows us to provide a reliable estimate ofthe cosmic error on the measurements of the correlation length r_0, of about15-20% for the first epoch vvds observation (le fevre et al.2004,astro-ph/0409133). the error estimation and measurement techniques outlined inthis paper are being used in several studies which investigate in detail theclustering properties of galaxies in the vvds data.

astro-ph;0412420	on the high coherence of kilo-hz quasi-periodic oscillations	we have carried out a systematic study of the properties of the kilo-hertzquasi-periodic oscillations (qpo) observed in the x-ray emission of the neutronstar low-mass x-ray binary 4u1608-52, using archival data obtained with therossi x-ray timing explorer. we have investigated the quality factor, q, of theoscillations (defined as the ratio of the frequency of the qpo peak to its fullwidth at half maximum). in order to minimise the effect of long-term frequencydrifts, power spectra were computed over the shortest times permitted by thedata statistics. we show that the high q of ~200 reported by berger et al.(1996) for the lower frequency kilo-hz qpo in one of their observations is byno means exceptional, as we observe a mean q value in excess of 150 in 14 outof the 21 observations analysed and q can remain above 200 for thousands ofseconds. the frequency of the qpo varies over the wide range 560--890 hz and wefind a systematic trend for the coherence time of the qpo, estimated as tau=q/(pi nu), to increase with the frequency, up to a maximum level at ~ 800 hz,beyond which it appears to decrease, at frequencies where the qpo weakens.there is a more complex relationship between tau and the qpo root mean squaredamplitude (rms), in which positive and negative correlations can be found. ahigher-frequency qpo, revealed by correcting for the frequency drift of the560-890 hz one, has a much lower q (~10) which does not follow the samepattern. we discuss these results in the framework of competing qpo models andshow that those involving clumps orbiting within or above the accretion diskare ruled out.

astro-ph;0502296	the mass of the black hole in 3c 273	in this paper we apply the reverberation method to determine the mass of theblack hole in 3c273 from the ly a and c iv emission lines using archival iueobservations. following the standard assumptions of the method, we find amaximum-likelihood estimate of the mass of 6.59 10^9 mo, with a 1 sigmaconfidence interval 5.69-8.27 10^9 mo. this estimate is more than one order ofmagnitude larger than that obtained in a previous study using balmer lines. wereanalyze the optical data and show that the method applied to the ha, hb, andhg balmer lines produce mass estimates lower by a factor 2.5, but already muchlarger than the previous estimate derived from the same lines. the finding ofsuch a high mass in a face-on object is a strong indication that the gas motionis not confined to the accretion disk. the new mass estimate makes 3c273accreting with an accretion rate about six times lower than the eddington rate.we discuss the implications of our result for the broad-line-region size andblack-hole mass vs luminosity relationships for the set of objects for whichreverberation black-hole masses have been obtained. we find that, while objectswith super-eddington luminosities might theoretically be possible, theirexistence is not necessarily implied by this sample.

astro-ph;0508620	agn variability time scales and the discrete-event model	we analyse the ultraviolet variability time scales in a sample of 15 type 1active galactic nuclei (agn) observed by iue. using a structure functionanalysis, we demonstrate the existence in most objects of a maximum variabilitytime scale of the order of 0.02-1.00 year. we do not find any significantdependence of these maximum variability time scales on the wavelength, but weobserve a weak correlation with the average luminosity of the objects. we alsoobserve in several objects the existence of long-term variability, which seemsdecoupled from the short-term one. we interpret the existence of a maximumvariability time scale as a possible evidence that the light curves of type 1agn are the result of the superimposition of independent events. in theframework of the so-called discrete-event model, we study the event energy andevent rate as a function of the object properties. we confront our results topredictions from existing models based on discrete events. we show that modelsbased on a fixed event energy, like supernova explosions, can be ruled out. intheir present form, models based on magnetic blobs are also unable to accountfor the observed relations. stellar collision models, while not completelysatisfactory, cannot be excluded.

astro-ph;0509628	a large population of galaxies 9 to 12 billion years back in the history  of the universe	to understand the evolution of galaxies, we need to know as accurately aspossible how many galaxies were present in the universe at different epochs.galaxies in the young universe have hitherto mainly been identified using theirexpected optical colours, but this leaves open the possibility that asignificant population remains undetected because their colours are the resultof a complex mix of stars, gas, dust or active galactic nuclei. here we reportthe results of a flux-limited i-band survey of galaxies at look-back times of 9to 12 billion years. we find 970 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts between1.4 and 5. this population is 1.6 to 6.2 times larger than previous estimates,with the difference increasing towards brighter magnitudes. strong ultravioletcontinua (in the rest frame of the galaxies) indicate vigorous star formationrates of more than 10 to 100 solar masses per year. as a consequence, thecosmic star formation rate is higher than previously measured at redshifts of 3to 4.

astro-ph;0602329	evidence for environment-dependent galaxy luminosity function up to  z=1.5 in the vimos-vlt deep survey	we measure the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function as a function oflarge-scale environment up to z=1.5 from the vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) firstepoch data. the 3d galaxy density field is reconstructed using a sample of 6582galaxies with 17.5 &lt; i_{ab} &lt; 24 and measured spectroscopic redshifts. we splitthe sample in four redshift bins up to z=1.5 and in under-dense and over-denseenvironments according to the average density contrast \delta=0. there is astrong dependence of the luminosity function (lf) with large-scale environmentup to z=1.2: the lf shape is observed to have a steeper slope in under-denseenvironments. we find a continuous brightening of \delta m* ~0.6 mag fromz=0.25 to z=1.5 both in under-dense and over-dense environments. the rest-frameb-band luminosity density continuously increases in under-dense environmentsfrom z=0.25 to z=1.5 whereas its evolution in over-dense environments presentsa peak at z~0.9. we interpret the peak by a complex interplay between thedecrease of the star formation rate and the increasing fraction of galaxies at\delta&gt;0 due to hierarchical growth of structures. as the environmentaldependency of the lf shape is already present at least up to z=1.2, wetherefore conclude that either the shape of the lf is imprinted very early onin the life of the universe, a `nature' process, or that `nurture' physicalprocesses shaping up environment relation have already been efficient earlierthan a look-back time corresponding to 30% of the current age of the universe.

astro-ph;0603202	the vimos vlt deep survey: the build-up of the colour-density relation	we investigate the redshift and luminosity evolution of the galaxycolour-density relation using the data from the first epoch vimos-vlt deepsurvey (vvds). the size (6582 galaxies), depth (i_ab&lt;=24) and redshift samplingrate of the survey enable us to reconstruct the 3d galaxy environment onrelatively local scales (r=5 mpc) up to z~1.5. particular attention has beendevoted to calibrate a density reconstruction scheme, which factors out surveyselection effects and reproduces in an unbiased way the underlying `real'galaxy environment. while at lower redshift we confirm the existence of a steepcolour-density relation, with the fraction of the reddest(/bluest) galaxies ofthe same luminosity increasing(/decreasing) as a function of density, thistrend progressively disappears in the highest redshift bins investigated. therest frame u*-g' colour-magnitude diagram shows a bimodal pattern in both lowand high density environments up to z~1.5. we find that the bimodaldistribution is not universal but strongly depends upon environment: at lowerredshifts the colour-magnitude diagrams in low and high density regions aresignificantly different while the progressive weakening of the colour-densityrelation causes the two bimodal distributions to nearly mirror each other inthe highest redshift bin investigated. both the colour-density and thecolour-magnitude-density relations appear to be a transient, cumulative productof genetic and environmental factors operating over at least a period of 9 gyr.these findings support an evolutionary scenario in which star formation/gasdepletion processes are accelerated in more luminous objects and in highdensity environments: star formation activity is shifting with cosmic timetowards lower luminosity (downsizing), and out of high density environments.

astro-ph;0607075	the vimos-vlt deep survey. color bimodality and the mix of galaxy  populations up to z~2	in this paper we discuss the mix of star-forming and passive galaxies up toz~2, based on the first epoch vimos-vlt deep survey (vvds) data.in agreementwith previous works we find that the galaxy rest-frame color distributionfollows a bimodal distribution at z&lt;=1, and we establish that this bimodalityholds up to z~2. the details of the rest-frame color distribution dependhowever on redshift and on galaxy luminosity: faint galaxies are bluer than theluminous ones over the whole redshift range of our data, and galaxies becomebluer as redshift increases. this blueing trend does not depend, to a firstapproximation, on galaxy luminosity. using our spectroscopic dataset we canalso separate galaxies based on a star-formation, estimated combining theequivalent width of the [oii] emission line and the strength of the dn(4000)break. the comparison between this spectral classification and the rest-framecolors shows that about 35-40 % of the red objects are star forming galaxies.hence we conclude that the red sequence cannot be used to effectively isolate asample of purely passively evolving objects within a cosmological survey. wealso find that the color-magnitude relations derived for the color and for thespectroscopically selected early-type galaxies have remarkably similarproperties, with the contaminating star-forming galaxies within the redsequence objects introducing no significant offset in the rest frame colors.therefore the average color of the red objects does not appear to be a verysensitive indicator for measuring the evolution of the early-type galaxypopulation.finally, we use the multi-band vvds photometric data and sed fittingto derive multi-color galaxy types, which have a slightly higher efficiencythan rest-frame color in isolating the passive, non star-forming galaxieswithin the vvds sample.

astro-ph;0608176	the vimos vlt deep survey:the ultraviolet galaxy luminosity function and  luminosity density at 3&lt;z&lt;4	we study the lf of the high-z galaxy population with 3&lt;z&lt;4 using a purelyi-band magnitude-selected spectroscopic sample obtained in the framework of thevvds. we determine the lf from the vvds, taking care to add as few assumptionsand as simple corrections as possible, and compare our results with thoseobtained from photometric studies, based on lyman-break selections or photo-zmeasurements. we find that in the range 3&lt;z&lt;4, the vvds lf is parameterized byphi*=1.24+-0.50 10-3 mag-1 mpc-3 and m*=-21.49+-0.19, assuming a slopealpha=-1.4 consistent with most previous studies. while phi* is comparable topreviously found values, m* is significantly brighter by about 0.5 mag atleast. using the conservative slope -1.4, we find a ld at 1700arho(m&lt;-18.5)=2.4 10 19 w mpc-3 and rho tot=3.1 10 19 w mpc-3, comparable tothat estimated in other studies. the unexpectedly large number of very brightgalaxies found in the vvds indicates that the color-selection and photo-ztechniques that are generally used to build high-z galaxy samples may beaffected by a significant fraction of color-measurement failures or byincomplete modelling of the mix of stellar emission, agn contribution, dustabsorption and intergalactic extinction assumed to identify high-z galaxies,making pure magnitude selection better able to trace the full population.because of the difficulty to identify all low-luminosity galaxies in aspectroscopic survey, the ld could still be significantly underestimated. wealso find that the relative contribution of the most luminous galaxies comparedto the fainter ones is at least twice as large in the vvds compared to formerestimates. therefore, the vvds paints a quite different picture of the role ofthe most actively star-forming galaxies in the history of star formation.

astro-ph;0612120	witnessing the build-up of the colour-density relation	we investigate the redshift and luminosity evolution of the galaxycolour-density relation using the data from the first epoch vimos-vlt deepsurvey (vvds) on scales of r=5 h^(-1)mpc up to redshift z ~ 1.5. while at lowerredshift we confirm the existence of a steep colour-density relation, with thefraction of the reddest(/bluest) galaxies of the same luminosityincreasing(/decreasing) as a function of density, this trend progressivelydisappears in the highest redshift bins investigated.our results suggest theexistence of an epoch (more remote for brighter galaxies) characterized by theabsence of the colour-density relation on the r=5 h^(-1)mpc scalesinvestigated. the rest frame u*-g' colour-magnitude diagram shows a bimodalpattern in both low and high density environments up to redshift z ~ 1.5. wefind that the bimodal distribution is not universal but strongly depends uponenvironment. both the colour-density and colour-magnitude-density relations, onthe r=5 h^(-1)mpc scales, appear to be a transient, cumulative product ofgenetic and environmental factors that have been operating over at least aperiod of 9 gyr. these findings support an evolutionary scenario in which starformation/gas depletion processes are accelerated in more luminous objects andin high density environments: star formation activity is progressively shiftingwith cosmic time towards lower luminosity galaxies (downsizing), and out ofhigh density environments.

astro-ph;0612311	the xmm-newton wide-field survey in the cosmos field: i. survey  description	we present the first set of xmm-newton epic observations in the 2 squaredegree cosmos field. the strength of the cosmos project is the unprecedentedcombination of a large solid angle and sensitivity over the wholemultiwavelength spectrum. the xmm-newton observations are very efficient inlocalizing and identifying active galactic nuclei (agn) and clusters as well asgroups of galaxies. one of the primary goals of the xmm-newton cosmos survey isto study the co-evolution of active galactic nuclei as a function of theirenvironment in the cosmic web. here we present the log of observations, imagesand a summary of first research highlights for the first pass of 25 xmm-newtonpointings across the field. in the existing dataset we have detected 1416 newx-ray sources in the 0.5-2, 2-4.5 and 4.5-10 kev bands to an equivalent 0.5-2kev flux limit of 7x10-16 erg cm-2 s-1. the number of sources is expected togrow to almost 2000 in the final coverage of the survey. from an x-ray colorcolor analysis we identify a population of heavily obscured, partially leaky orreflecting absorbers, most of which are likely to be nearby, compton-thick agn.

astro-ph;0701713	vvds-swire: clustering evolution from a spectroscopic sample of galaxies  with redshift 0.2&lt;z&lt;2.1 selected from spitzer irac 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron  photometry	by combining the vvds with the swire data, we have built the currentlylargest spectroscopic sample of galaxies selected in the rest-framenear-infrared. these allow us to investigate, for the first time usingspectroscopic redshifts, the clustering evolution of galaxies selected fromtheir rest-frame near-infrared luminosity in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;2.1.therefore we use the projected two-point correlation function wp(rp) to studythe three dimensional clustering properties of galaxies detected at 3.6 and 4.5microns with irac and for which we have spectroscopic redshifts from firstepoch vvds. we find that in the flux limited samples at 3.6 and 4.5 microns,the clustering length does not change from redshift ~2 to the present. inaddition, we find that the clustering lengths are systematically higher whengalaxy samples are selected from increasingly redder wavelengths. these valuesare larger than the typical values found for i-band selected galaxies in thesame redshift range, but we find that the difference in clustering lengthbetween i-band and 3.6/4.5 microns selected samples is decreasing withincreasing redshift to become comparable at z~1.5. we interpret this asevidence that galaxies with older stellar populations and galaxies activelyforming stars reside in comparably overdense environments at epochs earlierthan z~1.5. the increasing difference in clustering length observed betweenrest-frame uv-optical and infrared selected samples could then be an indicationthat star formation is gradually shifting to lower density regions as cosmictime increases.

astro-ph;9706203	very rapid optical variability of pks 2155-304	we have performed an optical observation campaign on pks 2155-304, whose aimwas to determine the variability properties of this object on very short timescales in several photometric bands. we detected variability on time scales asshort as 15 min. the fourier properties of the light curves have beeninvestigated using structure function analysis. the power spectra are welldescribed by a power-law with an index -2.4. it is compatible with the indexfound in the x-ray domain. the value of this index shows that the light curvescannot be generated by a sum of exponential pulses. using historical data, wefind that the longest time scale of variability in the optical domain liesbetween 10 and 40 days. we find a strong correlation between flux and spectralindex, which we interpret as the signature of an underlying constant component.as a result we do not find evidence of spectral variation for the activenucleus in the optical domain. a lag has been found between the light curves indifferent optical bands. the short-wavelength light curves lead thelong-wavelength ones. the amplitude of the lag is about 40 min for a factor 2in wavelength. our results are compared with predictions from different models.none of them can explain naturally the set of results obtained with thiscampaign, but we bring out some clues for the origin of the variability.

astro-ph;9807283	30 years of multi-wavelength observations of 3c 273	we present a wide multi-wavelength database of most observations of thequasar 3c 273 obtained during the last 30 years. this database is the mostcomplete set of observations available for an active galactic nucleus (agn). itcontains nearly 20'000 observations grouped together into 70 light curvescovering 16 orders of magnitude in frequency from the radio to the gamma-raydomain.  the database is constituted of many previously unpublished observations andof most publicly available data gathered in the literature and on the worldwide web (www). it is complete to the best of our knowledge, except in theoptical (ubv) domain where we chose not to add all observations from theliterature. in addition to the photometric data, we present the spectra of 3c273 obtained by the international ultraviolet explorer (iue) satellite. in thex-ray domain, we used the spectral fit parameters from the literature toconstruct the light curves.  apart from describing the data, we show the most representative light curvesand the average spectrum of 3c 273. the database is available on the www in ahomogeneous and clear form and we wish to update it regularly by adding newobservations.

astro-ph;9809113	the blue-bump of 3c 273	we present optical and ultraviolet observations of 3c273 covering the wholelife of the iue satellite. we analyze the variability properties of the lightcurves, and find that two variable components, written b and r respectively,must contribute to the blue-bump emission in this object. the b componentproduces most of the variability in the ultraviolet domain. a maximum timescale of variability of about 2 yr identical at all wavelengths is found. ifdiscrete events produce this component, the event rate is ~3-30 yr^-1. assumingan isotropic emission, each event must liberate about 10^51 erg in the form ofoptical-to-ultraviolet radiation. the spectral properties of the b componentsuggest that reprocessing on a truncated disk, or partially- thickbremsstrahlung may be the emission mechanism. we find evidence of a lag of afew days between the light curves of the b component at optical and ultravioletwavelengths. neither the variability properties, nor the spectral properties ofthe r component can be accurately measured. this component varies on very longtime scales, and may completely dominate the historical light curve of 3c 273in the optical domain. combining knowledge from other wavelengths, we obtainseveral indications that this component could reveal the ``blazar'' 3c 273. inparticular, its light curve is very similar to the hard x-ray light curve.

astro-ph;9906274	modelling the submillimetre-to-radio flaring behaviour of 3c 273	we present a new approach to derive the observed properties of synchrotronoutbursts in relativistic jets. the idea is to use the very well sampledsubmillimetre-to-radio long-term light curves of 3c 273 to extract the spectraland temporal evolution of a typical outburst. the method consists in adecomposition of these light curves into a series of twelve self-similarflares. with a model-independent parameterization, we find that the obtainedoutburst's evolution is in good qualitative agreement with the expectations ofshock models in relativistic jets. we then derive, by a second approach, therelevant parameters of three-stage shock models.  we observe for the first time that the optically thin spectral index issteeper during the initial rising phase of the evolution than during the finaldeclining phase as expected by the shock model of marscher &amp; gear (1985). weobtain that this index flattens from alpha=-1.1 to alpha=-0.5, in goodagreement with what is expected from a power law electron energy distributionwith an index of -2.0. the observed flattening gives support to the idea thatradiative (synchrotron and/or compton) losses are the dominant cooling processof the electrons during the initial phase of the shock evolution.  two other results give us confidence in our decomposition: 1) the outburststhat we identify do well correspond to the vlbi components observed in the jetand 2) there is strong evidence that high-frequency peaking outbursts evolvefaster than low-frequency peaking outbursts. we propose that this lastcorrelation is related to the distance from the core of the jet at which theshock forms.

0810.2172	eddington ratios of faint agn at intermediate redshift: evidence for a  population of half-starved black holes	we use one of the deepest spectroscopic samples of broad line active galacticnuclei (agn) currently available, extracted from the vimos vlt deep survey(vvds), to compute mgii and civ virial masses estimate of 120 super-massiveblack holes in the redshift range 1.0&lt;z&lt;1.9 and 2.6&lt;z&lt;4.3. we find that themass-luminosity relation shows considerably enhanced dispersion towards low agnluminosities (log l_bol ~ 45). at these luminosities, there is a substantialfraction of black holes accreting far below their eddington limit (l_bol/l_edd&lt; 0.1), in marked contrast to what is generally found for agn of higherluminosities. we speculate that these may be agn on the decaying branch oftheir light-curves, well past their peak activity. this would agree with recenttheoretical predictions of agn evolution.  in the electronic appendix of this paper we publish an update of the vvdstype-1 agn sample, including the first and most of the second epochobservations. this sample contains 298 objects of which 168 are new.

0811.0446	agn population in the deepest hard x-ray extragalactic survey	we present the results of the analysis of the agn population in the deepestextragalactic hard x-ray survey. the survey is based on integral observation ofthe 3c 273/coma cluster region, and covers 2500 deg2 with a 20-60 kev fluxlimit 1.5 times lower than other surveys at similar energies, resolving about2.5% of the cosmic hard x-ray background. using this survey, we can constrainin an unbiased way the distribution of hydrogen column absorption up tonh=10^25 cm-2. we put an upper limit of 24% to the fraction of compton-thickobjects. compared to models of the agn population selected in the 2-10 kevband, the log n-log s diagram is generally in good agreement, but the nhdistribution is significantly different, with significantly less unabsorbedsources (nh&lt;10^22 cm-2) at a given flux limit compared to the models. we alsostudy the local hard x-ray luminosity function (lf), which is compatible withwhat is found in other recent hard x-ray surveys. the extrapolation of the 2-10kev lf is lower than the hard x-ray lf. the discrepancy is resolved if agnspectra typically present reflection humps with reflection fraction r~1.finally, we use the population properties of this survey to show that a futureultra-deep integral extragalactic survey can result in a quite large agn samplewith enough objects at redshifts larger than z=0.05 so that we can detectevolution in the hard x-ray lf.

0811.1653	the vvds-vla deep field - iv: radio-optical properties	(abridged) we use the 1.4 ghz vimos-vla deep survey and the optical vvds andthe cfht-ls to compare the properties of radio loud galaxies with respect tothe whole population of optical galaxies. the availability of multibandphotometry and high quality photometric redshifts allows to derive rest framecolors and radio luminosity functions down to a limit of a b rest-framemagnitude of m=-20.  galaxy properties and luminosity functions (lfs) are estimated up to z~1 forradio loud and radio quiet early and late type galaxies. radio loud late typegalaxies are redder than radio quiet objects of the same class and this is aneffect related to the presence of more dust in stronger star forming galaxies.moreover, we estimate optical lfs, stellar masses and star formation ratedistributions for radio sources and compare them with those derived for a welldefined control sample, finding that the probability for a galaxy to be a radioemitter significantly increases at high values of these parameters. radio loudearly type galaxies show luminosity evolution of their bivariate radio-opticallf, due to an evolution in the radio-optical ratio. the lack of evolution ofthe mass function of radio loud early type galaxies means that no new agn areformed at z&lt;1. on the contrary, radio loud late type objects show a strongevolution, both in luminosity and in density, of the radio lf for z&gt;0.7. thisevolution is the direct effect of the strong optical evolution of this classand no significant change with redshift of the radio-optical ratio is required.with the knowledge of the radio-optical ratio and the optical and radio lfs forlate type galaxies, we estimated the star formation history of the universe upto z~1.5, using optical galaxies as tracers of the global radio emission.

0811.2053	physical properties of galaxies and their evolution in the vimos vlt  deep survey. i. the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation up to z~0.9	we derive the mass-metallicity relation of star-forming galaxies up to$z\sim0.9$, using data from the vimos vlt deep survey. automatic measurement ofemission-line fluxes and equivalent widths have been performed on the fullspectroscopic sample. this sample is divided into two sub-samples depending onthe apparent magnitude selection: wide ($i_{\mathrm{ab}}&lt;22.5$) and deep$i_{\mathrm{ab}}&lt;24$). these two samples span two different ranges of stellarmasses. emission-line galaxies have been separated into star-forming galaxiesand active galactic nuclei using emission line ratios. for the star-forminggalaxies the emission line ratios have also been used to estimate gas-phaseoxygen abundance, using empirical calibrations renormalized in order to giveconsistent results at low and high redshifts. the stellar masses have beenestimated by fitting the whole spectral energy distributions with a set ofstellar population synthesis models. we assume at first order that the shape ofthe mass-metallicity relation remains constant with redshift. then we find astronger metallicity evolution in the wide sample as compared to the deepsample. we thus conclude that the mass-metallicity relation is flatter athigher redshift. the observed flattening of the mass-metallicity relation athigh redshift is analyzed as an evidence in favor of the open-closed model.
