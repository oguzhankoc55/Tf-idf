0812.3947	mojave: monitoring of jets in agn with vlba experiments. v. multi-epoch  vlba images	we present images from a long term program (mojave: monitoring of jets in agnwith vlba experiments) to survey the structure and evolution of parsec-scalejet phenomena associated with bright radio-loud active galaxies in the northernsky. the observations consist of 2424 15 ghz vlba images of a completeflux-density limited sample of 135 agn above declination -20 degrees, spanningthe period 1994 august to 2007 september. these data were acquired as part ofthe mojave and 2 cm survey programs, and from the vlba archive. the sampleselection criteria are based on multi-epoch parsec-scale (vlba) flux density,and heavily favor highly variable and compact blazars. the sample includesnearly all the most prominent blazars in the northern sky, and is well-suitedfor statistical analysis and comparison with studies at other wavelengths. ourmulti-epoch and stacked-epoch images show 94% of the sample to have apparentone-sided jet morphologies, most likely due to the effects of relativisticbeaming. of the remaining sources, five have two-sided parsec-scale jets, andthree are effectively unresolved by the vlba at 15 ghz, with essentially all ofthe flux density contained within a few tenths of a milliarcsecond.

0902.2085	on the relation between agn gamma-ray emission and parsec-scale radio  jets	we have compared the radio emission from a sample of parsec-scale agn jets asmeasured by the vlba at 15 ghz, with their associated gamma-ray properties thatare reported in the fermi lat 3-month bright source list. we find in ourradio-selected sample that the gamma-ray photon flux correlates well with thequasi-simultaneously measured compact radio flux density. the lat-detected jetsin our radio-selected complete sample generally have higher compact radio fluxdensities, and their parsec-scale cores are brighter (i.e., have higherbrightness temperature) than the jets in the lat non-detected objects. thissuggests that the jets of bright gamma-ray agn have preferentially higherdoppler-boosting factors. in addition, agn jets tend to be found in a moreactive radio state within several months from lat-detection of their stronggamma-ray emission. this result becomes more pronounced for confirmed gamma-rayflaring sources. we identify the parsec-scale radio core as a likely locationfor both the gamma-ray and radio flares, which appear within typical timescalesof up to a few months of each other.

0902.2087	a connection between apparent vlba jet speeds and initial active  galactic nucleus detections made by the fermi gamma-ray observatory	in its first three months of operations, the fermi gamma-ray observatory hasdetected approximately one quarter of the radio-flux-limited mojave sample ofbright flat-spectrum active galactic nuclei (agns) at energies above 100 mev.we have investigated the apparent parsec-scale jet speeds of 26 mojave agnsmeasured by the very long baseline array (vlba) that are in the lat bright agnsample (lbas). we find that the gamma-ray bright quasars have faster jets onaverage than the non-lbas quasars, with a median of 15 c, and values ranging upto 34 c. the lbas agns in which the lat has detected significant gamma-ray fluxvariability generally have faster jets than the nonvariable ones. thesefindings are in overall agreement with earlier results based on nonuniformegret data which suggested that gamma-ray bright agns have preferentiallyhigher doppler boosting factors than other blazar jets. however, the relativelylow lat detection rates for the full mojave sample (24%) and previously knownmojave egret-detected blazars (43%) imply that doppler boosting is not the solefactor that determines whether a particular agn is bright at gamma-rayenergies. the slower apparent jet speeds of lbas bl lac objects and theirhigher overall lat detection rate as compared to quasars suggest that theformer are being detected by fermi because of their higher intrinsic (unbeamed)gamma-ray to radio luminosity ratios.

0903.3583	spectral analysis of the accretion flow in ngc 1052 with suzaku	we present an analysis of the 101 ks, 2007 suzaku spectrum of the linergalaxy ngc 1052. the 0.5-10 kev continuum is well-modeled by a power-lawmodified by galactic and intrinsic absorption, and it exhibits a soft, thermalemission component below 1 kev. both a narrow core and a broader component offe k emission centered at 6.4 kev are robustly detected. while the narrow lineis consistent with an origin in material distant from the black hole, the broadline is best fit empirically by a model that describes fluorescent emissionfrom the inner accretion disk around a rapidly rotating black hole. we find noevidence in this observation for comptonized reflection of the hard x-raysource by the disk above 10 kev, however, which casts doubt on the hypothesisthat the broad iron line originates in the inner regions of a standardaccretion disk. we explore other possible scenarios for producing this spectralfeature and conclude that the high equivalent width (ew ~ 185 kev) andfull-width-half-maximum velocity of the broad iron line (v ~ 0.37c) necessitatean origin within d ~ 8 gravitational radii of the hard x-ray source. based onthe confirmed presence of a strong radio jet in this galaxy nucleus, the broadiron line may be produced in dense plasma near the base of the jet, implyingthat emission mechanisms in the centralmost portions of active galactic nucleiare more complex than previously thought.

0908.4152	identification of the early fermi lat gamma-ray bright objects with  extragalactic vlbi sources	a list of 205 gamma-ray strong objects was reported recently as a result of a3-month integration with the large area telescope on board the fermi gamma-rayspace telescope. we attempted identification of these objects,cross-correlating the gamma-ray positions with vlbi positions of a largeall-sky sample of extragalactic radio sources selected on the basis of theirparsec-scale flux density. the original associations reported by the fermi teamare confirmed and six new identifications are suggested. a monte-carlo analysisshows that the fraction of chance associations in our analysis is less than 5per cent, and confirms that the vast majority of gamma-ray bright extragalacticsources are radio loud blazars with strong parsec-scale jets. a correlationbetween the parsec-scale radio and gamma-ray flux is supported by our analysisof a complete vlbi flux-density-limited sample of extragalactic jets. theeffectiveness of using a vlbi catalog to find associations between gamma-raydetections and compact extragalactic radio sources, especially near thegalactic plane, is demonstrated. it is suggested that vlbi catalogs should beused for future identification of fermi lat objects.

0909.5100	mojave: monitoring of jets in active galactic nuclei with vlba  experiments. vi. kinematics analysis of a complete sample of blazar jets	we discuss the jet kinematics of a complete flux-density-limited sample of135 radio-loud active galactic nuclei (agn) resulting from a 13 year program toinvestigate the structure and evolution of parsec-scale jet phenomena. ouranalysis is based on new 2 cm very long baseline array (vlba) images obtainedbetween 2002 and 2007, but includes our previously published observations madeat the same wavelength, and is supplemented by vlba archive data. in all, wehave used 2424 images spanning the years 1994-2007 to study and determine themotions of 526 separate jet features in 127 jets. the data quality and temporalcoverage (a median of 15 epochs per source) of this complete agn jet samplerepresents a significant advance over previous kinematics surveys. in all butfive agns, the jets appear one-sided, most likely the result of differentialdoppler boosting. in general the observed motions are directed along the jetridge line, outward from the optically thick core feature. we directly observechanges in speed and/or direction in one third of the well-sampled jetcomponents in our survey. while there is some spread in the apparent speeds ofseparate features within an individual jet, the dispersion is about three timessmaller than the overall dispersion of speeds among all jets. this supports theidea that there is a characteristic flow that describes each jet, which we havecharacterized by the fastest observed component speed. the observed maximumspeed distribution is peaked at ~10c, with a tail that extends out to ~50c.this requires a distribution of intrinsic lorentz factors in the parentpopulation that range up to ~50. we also note the presence of some rarelow-pattern speeds or even stationary features in otherwise rapidly flowingjets...

0909.5102	mojave: monitoring of jets in agn with vlba experiments. vii. blazar jet  acceleration	we discuss acceleration measurements for a large sample of extragalacticradio jets from the mojave program which studies the parsec-scale jet structureand kinematics of a complete, flux-density-limited sample of active galacticnuclei (agn). accelerations are measured from the apparent motion of individualjet features or "components" which may represent patterns in the jet flow. wefind that significant accelerations are common both parallel and perpendicularto the observed component velocities. parallel accelerations, representingchanges in apparent speed, are generally larger than perpendicular accelerationthat represent changes in apparent direction. the trend for larger parallelaccelerations indicates that a significant fraction of these changes inapparent speed are due to changes in intrinsic speed of the component ratherthan changes in direction to the line of sight. we find an overall tendency forcomponents with increasing apparent speed to be closer to the base of theirjets than components with decreasing apparent speed. this suggests a linkbetween the observed pattern motions and the underlying flow which, in somecases, may increase in speed close to the base and decrease in speed furtherout; however, common hydro-dynamical processes for propagating shocks may alsoplay a role. about half of the components show "non-radial" motion, or amisalignment between the component's structural position angle and its velocitydirection, and these misalignments generally better align the component motionwith the downstream emission. perpendicular accelerations are closely linkedwith non-radial motion. when observed together, perpendicular accelerations areusually in the correct direction to have caused the observed misalignment.

0910.1813	jet opening angles and gamma-ray brightness of agn	we have investigated the differences in apparent opening angles between theparsec-scale jets of the active galactic nuclei (agn) detected by the fermilarge area telescope (lat) during its first three months of operations andthose of non-lat-detected agn. we used 15.4 ghz vlba observations of sourcesfrom the 2 cm vlba mojave program, a subset of which comprise the statisticallycomplete flux density limited mojave sample. we determined the apparent openingangles by analyzing transverse jet profiles from the data in the image planeand by applying a model fitting technique to the data in the (u,v) plane. bothmethods provided comparable opening angle estimates. the apparent openingangles of gamma-ray bright blazars are preferentially larger than those ofgamma-ray weak sources. at the same time, we have found the two groups to havesimilar intrinsic opening angle distributions, based on a smaller subset ofsources. this suggests that the jets in gamma-ray bright agn are oriented atpreferentially smaller angles to the line of sight resulting in a strongerrelativistic beaming. the intrinsic jet opening angle and bulk flow lorentzfactor are found to be inversely proportional, as predicted by standard modelsof compact relativistic jets. if a gas dynamical jet acceleration model isassumed, the ratio of the initial pressure of the plasma in the core region p_0to the external pressure p_ext lies within the range 1.1 to 34.6, with a bestfit estimate of p_0/p_ext=2.

0910.4540	multiwavelength monitoring of the enigmatic narrow-line seyfert 1 pmn  j0948+0022 in march-july 2009	following the recent discovery of gamma rays from the radio-loud narrow-lineseyfert 1 galaxy pmn j0948+0022 (z=0.5846), we started a multiwavelengthcampaign from radio to gamma rays, which was carried out between the end ofmarch and the beginning of july 2009. the source displayed activity at all theobserved wavelengths: a general decreasing trend from optical to gamma-rayfrequencies was followed by an increase of radio emission after less than twomonths from the peak of the gamma-ray emission. the largest flux change, abouta factor of about 4, occurred in the x-ray band. the smallest was atultraviolet and near-infrared frequencies, where the rate of the detectedphotons dropped by a factor 1.6-1.9. at optical wavelengths, where the samplingrate was the highest, it was possible to observe day-scale variability, withflux variations up to a factor of about 3. the behavior of pmn j0948+0022observed in this campaign and the calculated power carried out by its jet inthe form of protons, electrons, radiation and magnetic field are quite similarto that of blazars, specifically of flat-spectrum radio quasars. these resultsconfirm the idea that radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies hostrelativistic jets with power similar to that of average blazars.

0911.4924	relativistic beaming and gamma-ray brightness of blazars	we investigate the dependence of gamma-ray brightness of blazars on intrinsicproperties of their parsec-scale radio jets and the implication forrelativistic beaming. by combining apparent jet speeds derived fromhigh-resolution vlba images from the mojave program with millimetre-wavelengthflux density monitoring data from metsahovi radio observatory, we estimate thejet doppler factors, lorentz factors, and viewing angles for a sample of 62blazars. we study the trends in these quantities between the sources which weredetected in gamma-rays by the fermi large area telescope (lat) during its firstthree months of science operations and those which were not detected. thelat-detected blazars have on average higher doppler factors thannon-lat-detected blazars, as has been implied indirectly in several earlierstudies. we find statistically significant differences in the viewing angledistributions between gamma-ray bright and weak sources. most interestingly,gamma-ray bright blazars have a distribution of comoving frame viewing anglesthat is significantly narrower than that of gamma-ray weak blazars and centredroughly perpendicular to the jet axis. the lack of gamma-ray bright blazars atlarge comoving frame viewing angles can be explained by relativistic beaming ofgamma-rays, while the apparent lack of gamma-ray bright blazars at smallcomoving frame viewing angles, if confirmed with larger samples, may suggest anintrinsic anisotropy or lorentz factor dependence of the gamma-ray emission.

1002.2588	vlbi detection of the hst-1 feature in the m87 jet at 2 cm	a bright feature 80 pc away from the core in the powerful jet of m87 showshighly unusual properties. earlier radio, optical and x-ray observations haveshown that this feature, labeled hst-1, is superluminal, and is possiblyconnected with the tev flare detected by hess in 2005. it has been claimed thatthis feature might have a blazar nature, due to these properties. to examinethe possible blazar-like nature of hst-1, we analyzed lambda 2 cm vlba archivaldata from dedicated full-track observations and the 2 cm survey/mojave vlbimonitoring programs obtained between 2000 and 2009. applying vlbi wide-fieldimaging techniques, the hst-1 region was imaged at milliarcsecond resolution.here we present the first 2 cm vlbi detection of this feature in observationsfrom early 2003 to early 2007, and analyze its evolution over this time. usingthe detections of hst-1, we find that the projected apparent speed is 0.61 +/-0.31 c. a comparison of the vla and vlba flux densities of this featureindicate that is mostly resolved on molliarcsecond scales. this feature isoptically thin between lambda 2 cm and lambda 20 cm. we do not find evidence ofa blazar nature for hst-1.

0709.1528	multiwavelength observations of the powerful gamma-ray quasar pks  1510-089: clues on the jet composition	we present the results from a multiwavelength campaign of the powerfulgamma-ray quasar pks 1510-089. this campaign commenced with a deep suzakuobservation lasting three days for a total exposure time of 120 ks, andcontinued with swift monitoring over 18 days. besides swift observations, thecampaign included ground-based optical and radio data, and yielded aquasi-simultaneous broad-band spectral energy distribution from 10^9 hz to10^{19} hz. the suzaku observation provided a high s/n x-ray spectrum, which iswell represented by an extremely hard power-law with photon index gamma ~ 1.2,augmented by a soft component apparent below 1 kev, which is well described bya black-body model with temperature kt ~ 0.2 kev. monitoring by suzaku revealedtemporal variability which is different between the low and high energy bands,again suggesting the presence of a second, variable component in addition tothe primary power-law emission.we model the broadband spectrum of pks 1510-089assuming that the high energy spectral component results from comptonization ofinfrared radiation produced by hot dust located in the surrounding moleculartorus. in the adopted internal shock scenario, the derived model parametersimply that the power of the jet is dominated by protons but with a number ofelectrons/positrons exceeding a number of protons by a factor ~10. we also findthat inhomogeneities responsible for the shock formation, prior to thecollision may produce bulk-compton radiation which can explain the observedsoft x-ray excess and possible excess at ~18 kev. we note, however, that thebulk-compton interpretation is not unique, and the observed soft excess couldarise as well via some other processes discussed briefly in the text.

1103.6032	a vlba survey of the core shift effect in agn jets i. evidence for  dominating synchrotron opacity	the effect of a frequency dependent shift of the vlbi core position (known asthe "core shift") was predicted more than three decades ago and has since beenobserved in a few sources, but often within a narrow frequency range. thiseffect has important astrophysical and astrometric applications. to achieve abroader understanding of the core shift effect and the physics behind it, weconducted a dedicated survey with nrao's very long baseline array (vlba). weused the vlba to image 20 pre-selected sources simultaneously at ninefrequencies in the 1.4-15.4 ghz range. the core position at each frequency wasmeasured by referencing it to a bright, optically thin feature in the jet. asignificant core shift has been successfully measured in each of the twentysources observed. the median value of the core shift is found to be 1.21 mas ifmeasured between 1.4 and 15.4 ghz, and 0.24 mas between 5.0 and 15.4 ghz. thecore position, r, as a function of frequency, n, is found to be consistent withan r n^-1 law. this behavior is predicted by the blandford &amp; koenigl model of apurely synchrotron self-absorbed conical jet in equipartition. no systematicdeviation from unity of the power law index in the r(n) relation has beenconvincingly detected. we conclude that neither free-free absorption norgradients in pressure and/or density in the jet itself and in the ambientmedium surrounding the jet play a significant role in the sources observedwithin the 1.4-15.4 ghz frequency range. these results support theinterpretation of the parsec-scale core as a continuous blandford-koenigl typejet with smooth gradients of physical properties along it.

1205.0490	faraday rotation in the mojave blazars: connection with gamma-ray  studies	we have conducted a survey of faraday rotation in a sample of 191 compactradio-loud agns as part of the mojave (monitoring of jets in active galacticnuclei with vlba experiments) project. the observations were carried out withthe vlba at 8.1, 8.4, 12.1 and 15.3 ghz over 12 epochs in 2006. we detectsufficiently strong linear polarization in 159 out of 211 observations tocalculate the rotation measure values, resulting in a large enough sample forstatistical analysis of the faraday rotation in blazars. these faraday rotationmeasures can be used to study the intrinsic magnetic field order andorientation in parsec-scale blazar jets. our sample includes 119 sources listedin the 1fgl or 2fgl catalogs and we detect rotation measure values in 111 outof 131 maps. of the 72 sources that are not in the gamma-ray catalogs we detectrm in 48 out of 80 maps. the median rm values of the lat-detected sources donot differ significantly from the non-lat-detected sources. nine of the sourcesin our sample have resolved enough jets to study the transverse faradayrotation structure, and we detect significant transverse rotation measuregradients in four sources. in two of these (3c~273 and 3c~454.3) there isadditional evidence to support helical magnetic field in the parsec-scale jets.the two others (0923+392 and 2230+114) require further observations to identifythe nature of the gradient. it is interesting that three of the four sourceswith significant rotation measure gradients are sources that have shown largegamma-ray flares.

1205.5559	single-epoch vlbi imaging study of bright active galactic nuclei at 2  and 8 ghz	we investigate statistical and individual astrophysical properties of activegalactic nuclei (agns), such as parsec-scale flux density, core dominance,angular and linear sizes, maximum observed brightness temperatures of vlbi corecomponents, spectral index distributions for core and jet components, andevolution of brightness temperature along the jets. furthermore, westatistically compare core flux densities and brightness temperature as well asjet spectral indices of gamma-ray bright and weak sources. we used 19 very longbaseline interferometry (vlbi) observing sessions carried out simultaneously at2.3 and 8.6 ghz with the participation of 10 very long baseline array (vlba)stations and up to 10 additional geodetic telescopes. the observations span theperiod 1998-2003. we present here single-epoch results from high-resolutionradio observations of 370 agns. our vlbi images at 2.3 and 8.6 ghz as well asgaussian models are presented and analyzed. at least one-fourth of the coresare completely unresolved on the longest baselines of the global vlbiobservations. the vlbi core components are partially opaque with the medianvalue of spectral index of alpha_core=0.3, while the jet features are usuallyoptically thin alpha_jet=-0.7. the spectral index typically decreases along thejet ridge line owing to the spectral aging, with a median value of -0.05mas^-1. brightness temperatures are found to be affected by doppler boostingand reaching up to \sim10^13 k with a median of \sim2.5x10^11 k at bothfrequencies. the brightness temperature gradients along the jets typicallyfollow a power law t_b\simr^-2.2 at both frequencies. 147 sources (40%)positionally associated with gamma-ray detections from the fermi lat secondsource catalog have higher core flux densities and brightness temperatures, andare characterized by the less steep radio spectrum of the optically thin jetemission.

1205.6746	mojave: monitoring of jets in active galactic nuclei with vlba  experiments. viii. faraday rotation in parsec-scale agn jets	we report observations of faraday rotation measures (rms) for a sample of 191extragalactic radio jets observed within the mojave program. multifrequencyvlba observations were carried out over twelve epochs in 2006 at fourfrequencies between 8 and 15 ghz. we detect parsec-scale faraday rms in 149sources and find the quasars to have larger rms on average than bl lac objects.the median core rms are significantly higher than in the jet components. thisis especially true for quasars where we detect a significant negativecorrelation between the magnitude of the rm and the de-projected distance fromthe core. we perform detailed simulations of the observational errors of totalintensity, polarization and faraday rotation, and concentrate on the errors oftransverse faraday rm gradients in unresolved jets. our simulations show thatthe finite image restoring beam size has a significant effect on the observedrm gradients, and spurious gradients can occur due to noise in the data if thejet is less than two beams wide in polarization. we detect significanttransverse rm gradients in four sources (0923+392, 1226+023, 2230+114 and2251+158). in 1226+023 the rm is for the first time seen to change sign frompositive to negative over the transverse cuts, which supports the presence of ahelical magnetic field in the jet. in this source we also detect variations inthe jet rm over a time scale of three months, which are difficult to explainwith external faraday screens and suggest internal faraday rotation. bycomparing fractional polarization changes in jet components between the fourfrequency bands to depolarization models we find that an external purely randomfaraday screen viewed through only a few lines of sight can explain most of ourpolarization observations but in some sources, such as 1226+023 and 2251+158,internal faraday rotation is needed.

1209.5867	radio-to-gamma-ray monitoring of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy pmn  j0948+0022 from 2008 to 2011	we present more than three years of observations at different frequencies,from radio to high-energy gamma-rays, of the narrow-line seyfert 1 (nls1)galaxy pmn j0948+0022 (z=0.585). this source is the first nls1 detected atenergies above 100 mev and therefore can be considered the prototype of thisemerging new class of gamma-ray emitting active galactic nuclei (agn). theobservations performed from 2008 august 1 to 2011 december 31 confirmed thatpmn j0948+0022 generates a powerful relativistic jet, able to develop anisotropic luminosity at gamma-rays of the order of 10^48 erg s^-1, at the levelof powerful quasars. the evolution of the radiation emission of this source in2009 and 2010 followed the canonical expectations of relativistic jets, withcorrelated multiwavelength variability (gamma-rays followed by radio emissionafter a few months), but it was difficult to retrieve a similar pattern in thelight curves of 2011. the comparison of gamma-ray spectra before and including2011 data suggested that there was a softening of the high-energy spectralslope. we selected five specific epochs to be studied by modelling thebroad-band spectrum, characterised by an outburst at gamma-rays or verylow/high flux at other wavelengths. the observed variability can largely beexplained either by changes in the injected power, the bulk lorentz factor ofthe jet or the electron spectrum. the characteristic time scale ofdoubling/halving flux ranges from a few days to a few months, depending on thefrequency and the sampling rate. the shortest doubling time scale at gamma-raysis 2.3+-0.5 days. these small values underline the need of highly-sampledmultiwavelength campaigns to better understand the physics of these sources.

1404.0014	mojave: monitoring of jets in active galactic nuclei with vlba  experiments. xi. spectral distributions	we have obtained milliarcsecond-scale spectral index distributions for asample of 190 extragalactic radio jets through the mojave project. the sourceswere observed in 2006 at 8.1, 8.4, 12.1, and 15.4 ghz, and we study thefour-frequency spectrum in individual jet features. we performed detailedsimulations to study the effects of image alignment and (u,v)-plane coverage onthe spectral index maps to verify our results. the core spectral indices are onaverage flat, while the jet spectrum is in general steep with a mean index of-1.04. a simple power-law fit is often inadequate for the core regions, asexpected if the cores are partially self-absorbed. the overall jet spectrumsteepens at a rate of about -0.001 to -0.004 per deprojected parsec when movingfurther out from the core with flat spectrum radio quasars having significantlysteeper spectra than the bl lac objects. the spectrum in both types of objectsflattens at the locations of the jet components indicating particleacceleration or density enhancements along the jet. the mean spectral index atthe component locations of -0.81 corresponds to a power-law index of ~2.6 forthe electron energy distribution. we find a significant trend that jetcomponents with linear polarization parallel to the jet (magnetic fieldperpendicular to the jet) have flatter spectra, as expected for transverseshocks. compared to quasars, bl lacs have more jet components withperpendicular magnetic field alignment, which may explain their generallyflatter spectra. the overall steepening of the spectra with distance can beexplained with radiative losses if the jets are collimating or with theevolution of the high-energy cutoff in the electron spectrum if the jets areconical. this interpretation is supported by a significant correlation with theage of the component and the spectral index, with older components havingsteeper spectra.

1404.0976	studies of the jet in bl lacertae i. recollimation shock and moving  emission features	parsec-scale vlba images of bl lac at 15 ghz show that the jet contains apermanent quasi-stationary emission feature 0.26 mas (0.34 pc projected) fromthe core, along with numerous moving features. in projection, the tracks of themoving features cluster around an axis at position angle -166.6 deg thatconnects the core with the standing feature. the moving features appear toemanate from the standing feature in a manner strikingly similar to the resultsof numerical 2-d relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (rmhd) simulations in whichmoving shocks are generated at a recollimation shock. because of this, and theclose analogy to the jet feature hst-1 in m87, we identify the standing featurein bl lac as a recollimation shock. we assume that the magnetic field dominatesthe dynamics in the jet, and that the field is predominantly toroidal. fromthis we suggest that the moving features are compressions established by slowand fast mode magneto-acoustic mhd waves. we illustrate the situation with asimple model in which the slowest moving feature is a slow-mode wave, and thefastest feature is a fast-mode wave. in the model the beam has lorentz factorabout 3.5 in the frame of the host galaxy, and the fast mode wave has lorentzfactor about 1.6 in the frame of the beam. this gives a maximum apparent speedfor the moving features 10c. in this model the lorentz factor of the pattern inthe galaxy frame is approximately 3 times larger than that of the beam itself.

1409.0530	discovery of substructure in the scatter-broadened image of sgr a*	we have detected substructure within the smooth scattering disk of thecelebrated galactic center radio source sagittarius a* (sgra*). we observedthis structure at 1.3 cm wavelength with the very long baseline array togetherwith the green bank telescope, on baselines of up to 3000 km, long enough tocompletely resolve the average scattering disk. such structure is predictedtheoretically, as a consequence of refraction by large-scale plasmafluctuations in the interstellar medium. along with the much-studied$\theta_\mathrm{d}\propto \lambda^2$ scaling of angular broadening$\theta_\mathrm{d}$ with observing wavelength $\lambda$, our observationsindicate that the spectrum of interstellar turbulence is shallow, with an innerscale larger than 300 km. the substructure is consistent with an intrinsic sizeof about 1 mas at 1.3 cm wavelength, as inferred from deconvolution of theaverage scattering. further observations of the substructure can set strongerconstraints on the properties of scattering material and on the intrinsic sizeof sgra*. these constraints will guide understanding of effects ofscatter-broadening and emission physics of the black hole, in images with theevent horizon telescope at millimeter wavelengths.

1409.3599	studies of the jet in bl lacertae. ii. superluminal alfv\'en waves	we study the kinematics of ridge lines on the pc-scale jet of the activegalactic nucleus bl lac. we show that the ridge lines display transversepatterns that move superluminally downstream, and that the moving patterns areanalogous to waves on a whip. their apparent speeds $\beta_\mathrm{app}$ (unitsof $c$) range from 3.9 to 13.5, corresponding to$\beta_\mathrm{wave}^\mathrm{gal}= 0.981 - 0.998$ in the galaxy frame. we showthat the magnetic field in the jet is well-ordered with a strong transversecomponent, and assume that it is helical and that the transverse patterns arealfv\'en waves propagating downstream on the longitudinal component of themagnetic field. the wave-induced transverse speed of the jet isnon-relativistic ($\beta_\mathrm{tr}^\mathrm{gal} \lesssim 0.09$). in 2010 thewave activity subsided and the jet then displayed a mild wiggle that had acomplex oscillatory behaviour. the alfv\'en waves appear to be excited bychanges in the position angle of the recollimation shock, in analogy toexciting a wave on a whip by shaking the handle. a simple model of the systemwith plasma sound speed $\beta_\mathrm{s}=0.3$ and apparent speed of a slow mhdwave $\beta_\mathrm{app,s}=4$ yields lorentz factor of the beam$\gamma_\mathrm{beam} \sim 4.5$, pitch angle of the helix (in the beam frame)$\alpha\sim 67^\circ$, alfv\'en speed $\beta_\mathrm{a}\sim 0.64$, andmagnetosonic mach number $m_\mathrm{ms}\sim 4.7$. this describes a plasma inwhich the magnetic field is dominant and in a rather tight helix, and alfv\'enwaves are responsible for the moving transverse patterns.

1409.3716	properties of flat-spectrum radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies	we have conducted a multiwavelength survey of 42 radio loud narrow-1ineseyfert 1 galaxies (rlnls1s), selected by searching among all the known sourcesof this type and omitting those with steep radio spectra. we analyse data fromradio frequencies to x-rays, and supplement these with information availablefrom online catalogs and the literature in order to cover the fullelectromagnetic spectrum. this is the largest known multiwavelength survey forthis type of source. we detected 90% of the sources in x-rays and found 17% atgamma rays. extreme variability at high energies was also found, down totimescales as short as hours. in some sources, dramatic spectral and fluxchanges suggest interplay between a relativistic jet and the accretion disk.the estimated masses of the central black holes are in the range $\sim10^{6-8}m_{\odot}$, smaller than those of blazars, while the accretionluminosities span a range from $\sim 0.01$ to $\sim 0.49$ times the eddingtonlimit, with an outlier at $0.003$. the distribution of the calculated jet powerspans a range from $\sim 10^{42.6}$ to $\sim 10^{45.6}$ erg s$^{-1}$, generallylower than quasars and bl lac objects, but partially overlapping with thelatter. once normalised by the mass of the central black holes, the jet powerof the three types of active galactic nuclei are consistent with each other,indicating the scalability of the jet. despite the observational differences,the central engine of rlnls1s is apparently quite similar to that of blazars.the historical difficulties in finding radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1galaxies might be due to their low power and to intermittent jet activity.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1410.8502	mojave xii: acceleration and collimation of blazar jets on parsec scales	we report on the acceleration properties of 329 features in 95 blazar jetsfrom the mojave vlba program. nearly half the features and three-quarters ofthe jets show significant changes in speed and/or direction. in general,apparent speed changes are distinctly larger than changes in direction,indicating that changes in the lorentz factors of jet features dominate theobserved speed changes rather than bends along the line of sight. observedaccelerations tend to increase the speed of features near the jet base,$\lesssim 10-20$ parsecs projected, and decrease their speed at longerdistances. the range of apparent speeds at fixed distance in an individual jetcan span a factor of a few, indicating that shock properties and geometry mayinfluence the apparent motions; however, we suggest that the broad trend of jetfeatures increasing their speed near the origin is due to an overallacceleration of the jet flow out to de-projected distances of order $10^2$parsecs, beyond which the flow begins to decelerate or remains nearly constantin speed. we estimate intrinsic rates of change of the lorentz factors in thegalaxy frame of order $\dot{\gamma}/\gamma \simeq 10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ peryear which can lead to total lorentz factor changes of a factor of a few on thelength scales observed here. finally, we also find evidence for jet collimationat projected distances of $\lesssim 10$ parsecs in the form of the non-radialmotion and bending accelerations that tend to better align features with theinner jet.

1412.1992	intrinsic physical conditions and structure of relativistic jets in  active galactic nuclei	the analysis of the frequency dependence of the observed shift of the coresof relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei (agn) allows us to evaluate thenumber density of the outflowing plasma n and, hence, the multiplicityparameter, which is a ratio of particle number density to goldreich-juliannumber density. we have obtained the median value for the multiplicityparameter to be 3x10^13 and the median value for the michel magnetizationparameter is 8 from an analysis of 97 sources. since the magnetizationparameter can be interpreted as the maximum possible lorentz factor of the bulkmotion which can be obtained for relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) flow,this estimate is in agreement with the observed superluminal motion of brightfeatures in agn jets. moreover, knowing these key parameters, one can determinethe transverse structure of the flow. we show that the poloidal magnetic fieldand particle number density are much larger in the center of the jet than nearthe at boundary. the mhd model can also explain the typical observed level ofjet acceleration. finally, casual connectivity of strongly collimated jets isdiscussed.

1507.02459	milky way scattering properties and intrinsic sizes of active galactic  nuclei cores probed by very long baseline interferometry surveys of compact  extragalactic radio sources	we have measured the angular sizes of radio cores of active galactic nuclei(agn) and analyzed their sky distributions and frequency dependencies to studysynchrotron opacity in agn jets and the strength of angular broadening in theinterstellar medium. we have used archival very long baseline interferometry(vlbi) data of more than 3000 compact extragalactic radio sources observed atfrequencies, $\nu$, from 2 to 43 ghz to measure the observed angular size ofvlbi cores. we have found a significant increase in the angular sizes of theextragalactic sources seen through the galactic plane ($|b|\lesssim10^\circ$)at 2, 5 and 8 ghz, about 1/3 of which show significant scattering. thesesources are mainly detected in directions to the galactic bar, the cygnusregion, and a region with galactic longitudes $220^\circ\lesssiml\lesssim260^\circ$ (the fitzgerald window). the strength of interstellarscattering of the agns is found to correlate with the galactic h$\alpha$intensity, free-electron density, and galactic rotation measure. the dependenceof scattering strengths on source redshift is insignificant, suggesting thatthe dominant scattering screens are located in our galaxy. the observed angularsize of sgr a$^\ast$ is found to be the largest among thousands of agn observedover the sky; we discuss possible reasons of this strange result. excludingextragalactic radio sources with significant scattering, we find that angularsize of opaque cores in agn scales typically as $\nu^{-1}$ confirmingpredictions of a conical synchrotron jet model with equipartition.

astro-ph;0603837	intrinsic brightness temperatures of agn jets	we present a new method for studying the intrinsic brightness temperatures ofthe parsec-scale jet cores of active galactic nuclei (agn). our method usesobserved superluminal motions and observed brightness temperatures for a largesample of agn to constrain the characteristic intrinsic brightness temperatureof the sample as a whole. to study changes in intrinsic brightness temperature,we assume that the doppler factors of individual jets are constant in time asjustified by their relatively small changes in observed flux density. we findthat in their median-low brightness temperature state, the sources in oursample have a narrow range of intrinsic brightness temperatures centered on acharacteristic temperature, t_int = 3 x 10^10 k, which is close to the valueexpected for equipartition, when the energy in the radiating particles equalsthe energy stored in the magnetic fields. however, in their maximum brightnessstate, we find that sources in our sample have a characteristic intrinsicbrightness temperature greater than 2 x 10^11 k, which is well in excess of theequipartition temperature. in this state, we estimate the energy in radiatingparticles exceeds the energy in the magnetic field by a factor of ~ 10^5. wesuggest that the excess of particle energy when sources are in their maximumbrightness state is due to injection or acceleration of particles at the baseof the jet. our results suggest that the common method of estimating jetdoppler factors by using a single measurement of observed brightnesstemperature and/or the assumption of equipartition may lead to large scatter orsystematic errors in the derived values.
