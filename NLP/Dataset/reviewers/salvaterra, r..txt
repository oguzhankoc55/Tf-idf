0901.4038	the optical afterglows and host galaxies of three short/hard gamma-ray  bursts	short grbs are commonly thought to originate from the merging of doublecompact object binaries but direct evidence for this scenario is still missing.optical observations of short grbs allow us to measure redshifts, firmlyidentify host galaxies, characterize their properties, and accurately localizegrbs within them. multiwavelength observations of grb afterglows provide usefulinformation on the emission mechanisms at work. these are all key issues thatallow one to discriminate among different models of these elusive events. wecarried out photometric observations of the short/hard grb 051227, grb 061006,and grb 071227 with the eso-vlt starting from several hours after the explosiondown to the host galaxy level several days later. for grb 061006 and grb 071227we also obtained spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy. we compared theresults obtained from our optical observations with the available x-ray data ofthese bursts. for all the three above bursts, we discovered optical afterglowsand firmly identified their host galaxies. about half a day after the burst,the optical afterglows of grb 051227 and grb 061006 present a decaysignificatly steeper than in the x-rays. in the case of grb 051227, the opticaldecay is so steep that it likely indicates different emission mechanisms in thetwo wavelengths ranges. the three hosts are blue, star forming galaxies atmoderate redshifts and with metallicities comparable to the solar one. theprojected offsets of the optical afterglows from their host galaxies centersspan a wide range, but all afterglows lie within the light of their hosts andpresent evidence for local absorption in their x-ray spectra. we discuss ourfindings in light of the current models of short grb progenitors.

0907.0337	lyman alpha emitter evolution in the reionization epoch	combining cosmological sph simulations with a previously developed lymanalpha production/transmission model and the early reionization model (erm,reionization ends at redshift z~7), we obtain lyman alpha and uv luminosityfunctions (lfs) for lyman alpha emitters (laes) for redshifts between 5.7 and7.6. matching model results to observations at z~5.7 requires escape fractionsof lyman alpha, f_alpha=0.3, and uv (non-ionizing) continuum photons, f_c=0.22,corresponding to a color excess, e(b-v)=0.15. we find that (i) f_c increasestowards higher redshifts, due the decreasing mean dust content of galaxies,(ii) the evolution of f_alpha/f_c hints at the dust content of the ism becomingprogressively inhomogeneous/clumped with decreasing redshift. the clusteringphotoionization boost is important during the initial reionization phases buthas little effect on the lyman alpha lf for a highly ionized igm. halo(stellar) masses are in the range 10.0 &lt; \log m_h &lt; 11.8 (8.1 &lt; \log m_* &lt;10.4) with m_h \propto m_*^{0.64}. the star formation rates are between 3-120solar masses per year, mass-weighted mean ages are greater than 20 myr at allredshifts, while the mean stellar metallicity increases from z=0.12 to 0.22solar metallicity from z~7.6 to z~5.7; both age and metallicity positivelycorrelate with stellar mass. the brightest laes are all characterized by largestar formation rates and intermediate ages (~200 myr), while objects in thefaint end of the lyman alpha lf show large age and star formation rate spreads.with no more free parameters, the spectral energy distributions of three lae atz~5.7 observed by lai et al. (2007) are well reproduced by an intermediate age(182-220 myr) stellar population and the above e(b-v) value.

0912.2693	constraining cosmic reionization with quasar, gamma ray burst, and lya  emitter observations	we investigate the cosmic reionization history by comparing semi-analyticalmodels of the lya forest with observations of high-z quasars and gamma raybursts absorption spectra. in order to constrain the reionization epoch z_rei,we consider two physically motivated scenarios in which reionization endseither early (erm, z_rei&gt;= 7) or late (lrm, z_rei~6). we analyze thetransmitted flux in a sample of 17 quasars spectra at 5.7&lt;z&lt;6.4 and in thespectrum of the gamma ray burst 050904 at z=6.3, studying the wide darkportions (gaps) in the observed absorption spectra. by comparing the statisticsof these spectral features with our models, we conclude that currentobservational data do not require any sudden change in the ionization state ofthe igm at z~6, favouring indeed a highly ionized universe at these epochs, aspredicted by the erm. moreover, we test the predictions of this model throughlya emitters observations, finding that the erm provide a good fit to theevolution of the luminosity function of lya emitting galaxies in the redshiftrange z=5.7-6.5. the overall result points towards an extended reionizationprocess which starts at z&gt;=11 and completes at z_rei&gt;=7, in agreement with therecent wmap5 data.

1003.3873	simulating high-redshift galaxies	recent observations have gathered a considerable sample of high redshiftgalaxy candidates and determined the evolution of their luminosity function(lf). to interpret these findings, we use cosmological sph simulationsincluding, in addition to standard physical processes, a detailed treatment ofthe pop iii-pop ii transition in early objects. the simulated high-z galaxiesmatch remarkably well the amplitude and slope of the observed lf in theredshift range 5&lt;z&lt;10. the lf shifts towards fainter luminosities withincreasing redshift, while its faint-end slope keeps an almost constant value,\alpha ~-2. the stellar populations of high-z galaxies have ages of 100-300(40-130) myr at z=5 (z=7-8), implying an early (z&gt;9.4) start of their starformation activity; the specific star formation rate is almost independent ofgalactic stellar mass. these objects are enriched rapidly with metals andgalaxies identified by hst/wfc3 (m_uv &lt; -18) show metallicities ~0.1 zsun evenat z=7-8. most of the simulated galaxies at z~7 (noticeably the smallest ones)are virtually dust-free, and none of them has an extinction larger than e(b-v)= 0.01. the bulk (50%) of the ionizing photons is produced by objectspopulating the faint-end of the lf (m_uv &lt; -16), which jwst will resolve up toz=7.3. popiii stars continue to form essentially at all redshifts; however, atz=6 (z=10) the contribution of pop iii stars to the total galactic luminosityis always less than 5% for m_uv &lt; -17 (m_uv &lt; -16). the typical high-z galaxiesclosely resemble the grb host galaxy population observed at lower redshifts,strongly encouraging the use of grbs to detect the first galaxies.

1004.2042	on the offset of short gamma-ray bursts	short gamma-ray bursts (sgrbs) are expected to form from the coalescence ofcompact binaries, either of primordial origin or from dynamical interactions inglobular clusters. in this paper, we investigate the possibility that theoffset and afterglow brightness of a sgrb can help revealing the origin of itsprogenitor binary. we find that a sgrb is likely to result from the primordialchannel if it is observed within 10 kpc from the center of a massive galaxy andshows a detectable afterglow. the same conclusion holds if it is 100 kpc awayfrom a small, isolated galaxy and shows a weak afterglow. on the other hand, adynamical origin is suggested for those sgrbs with observable afterglow eitherat a large separation from a massive, isolated galaxy or with an offset of10-100 kpc from a small, isolated galaxy. we discuss the possibility that sgrbsfrom the dynamical channel are hosted in intra-cluster globular clusters andfind that grb 061201 may fall within this scenario.

1005.1569	the sooner: a large robotic telescope	the approach of observational astronomy is mainly aimed at the constructionof larger aperture telescopes, more sensitive detectors and broader wavelengthcoverage. certainly fruitful, this approach turns out to be not completelyfulfilling the needs when phenomena related to the formation of black holes(bh), neutron stars (ns) and relativistic stars in general are concerned.recently, mainly through the vela, beppo-sax and swift satellites, we reached areasonable knowledge of the most violent events in the universe and of some ofthe processes we believe are leading to the formation of black holes (bh). weplan to open a new window of opportunity to study the variegated physics ofvery fast astronomical transients, particularly the one related to extremecompact objects. the innovative approach is based on three cornerstones: 1) thedesign (the conceptual design has been already completed) of a 3m robotictelescope and related focal plane instrumentation characterized by the uniquefeatures: "no telescope points faster"; 2) simultaneous multi-wavelengthsobservations (photometry, spectroscopy o\&amp; polarimetry); 3) high timeresolution observations. the conceptual design of the telescope and relatedinstrumentation is optimized to address the following topics: high frequencya-periodic variability, polarization, high z grbs, short grbs, grb-supernovaeassociation, multi-wavelengths simultaneous photometry and rapid low dispersionspectroscopy. this experiment will turn the "exception" (like the opticalobservations of grb 080319b) to "routine".

1006.0800	the afterglow and host galaxy of grb 090205: evidence for a ly-alpha  emitter at z=4.65	gamma-ray bursts have been proved to be detectable up to distances muchlarger than any other astrophysical object, providing the most effective way,complementary to ordinary surveys, to study the high redshift universe. to thisend, we present here the results of an observational campaign devoted to thestudy of the high-z grb 090205. we carried out optical/nir spectroscopy andimaging of grb 090205 with the eso-vlt starting from hours after the event upto several days later to detect the host galaxy. we compared the resultsobtained from our optical/nir observations with the available swift high-energydata of this burst. our observational campaign led to the detection of theoptical afterglow and host galaxy of grb 090205 and to the first measure of itsredshift, z=4.65. similar to other, recent high-z grbs, grb 090205 has a shortduration in the rest-frame with t_{90,rf}=1.6 s, which suggests the possibilitythat it might belong to the short grbs class. the x-ray afterglow of grb 090205shows a complex and interesting behaviour with a possible rebrightening at500-1000s from the trigger time and late flaring activity. photometricobservations of the grb 090205 host galaxy argue in favor of a starburst galaxywith a stellar population younger than ~ 150 myr. moreover, the metallicity ofz &gt; 0.27 z_sun derived from the grb afterglow spectrum is among the highestderived from grb afterglow measurement at high-z, suggesting that the burstoccurred in a rather enriched envirorment. finally, a detailed analysis of theafterglow spectrum shows the existence of a line corresponding to lyman-alphaemission at the redshift of the burst. grb 090205 is thus hosted in a typicallyman-alpha emitter (lae) at z=4.65. this makes the grb 090205 host thefarthest grb host galaxy, spectroscopically confirmed, detected to date.

1008.3054	probing the very high redshift universe with gamma-ray bursts: prospects  for observations with future x-ray instruments	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are the most violent explosions in the universe. longduration grbs are associated with the collapse of massive stars, rivaling theirhost galaxies in luminosity. the discovery of the most distantspectroscopically confirmed object in the universe, grb090423, opened a newwindow on the high redshift universe, making it possible to study the cosmic're-ionization' epoch and the preceding dark ages, as well as the generation ofthe first stars (population iii) using grbs. obviously this enables a wealth ofnew studies using the near infrared (nir) characteristics of grb afterglows.here we explore a different path, focusing on the next generation of x-raymissions with large area focusing telescopes and fast repointing capabilities.we found that x-ray data can complement nir observations and for the brightestgrbs can provide an accurate and independent redshift determination.metallicity studies can also be carried out profitably once the redshift isknown. finally we discuss observational signatures of grbs arising frompopulation iii stars in the x-ray band.

1011.4506	the metallicity of the long grb hosts and the fundamental metallicity  relation of low-mass galaxies	we investigate the metallicity properties of host galaxies of long gamma-raybursts (grbs) in the light of the fundamental metallicity relation (fmr), thetight dependence of metallicity on mass and sfr recently discovered for sdssgalaxies with stellar masses above 10^9.2 msun. as most of the grb hosts havemasses below this limit, the fmr can only be used after an extension towardslower masses. at this aim, we study the fmr for galaxies with masses down to~10^8.3 msun, finding that the fmr does extend smoothly at lower masses, albeitwith a much larger scatter. we then compare the resulting fmr with themetallicity properties of 18 host galaxies of long grbs. while the grb hostsshow a systematic offset with respect to the mass-metallicity relation, theyare fully consistent with the fmr. this shows that the difference with themass-metallicity relation is due to higher than average sfrs, and that grbswith optical afterglows do not preferentially select low-metallicity hostsamong the star-forming galaxies. the apparent low metallicity is therefore aconsequence of the occurrence of long grb in low mass, actively star-forminggalaxies, known to dominate the current cosmic sfr.

1104.2048	origin: metal creation and evolution from the cosmic dawn	origin is a proposal for the m3 mission call of esa aimed at the study ofmetal creation from the epoch of cosmic dawn. using high-spectral resolution inthe soft x-ray band, origin will be able to identify the physical conditions ofall abundant elements between c and ni to red-shifts of z=10, and beyond. themission will answer questions such as: when were the first metals created? howdoes the cosmic metal content evolve? where do most of the metals reside in theuniverse? what is the role of metals in structure formation and evolution? toreach out to the early universe origin will use gamma-ray bursts (grbs) tostudy their local environments in their host galaxies. this requires thecapability to slew the satellite in less than a minute to the grb location. bystudying the chemical composition and properties of clusters of galaxies we canextend the range of exploration to lower redshifts (z ~ 0.2). for this task weneed a high-resolution spectral imaging instrument with a large field of view.using the same instrument, we can also study the so far only partially detectedbaryons in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (whim). the less dense part of thewhim will be studied using absorption lines at low redshift in the spectra forgrbs.

1105.1378	the metallicity properties of simulated long-grb galaxy hosts and the  fundamental metallicity relation	we study the implication of the collapsar model for long gamma-ray bursts(lgrbs) on the metallicity properties of the host galaxies, by combininghigh-resolution n-body simulations with semi-analytic models of galaxyformation. the cosmological model that we use reproduces the fundamentalmetallicity relation recently discovered for the sdss galaxies, whereby themetallicity decreases with increasing star formation rate for galaxies of agiven stellar mass. we select host galaxies housing pockets of gas-particles,young and with different thresholds in metallicities, that can be sites of lrgbevents, according to the collapsar model. the simulated samples are comparedwith 18 observed lgrb hosts in the aim at discriminating whether themetallicity is a primary parameter. we find that a threshold in metallicity forthe lgrb progenitors, within the model galaxies, is not necessary in order toreproduce the observed distribution of host metallicities. the lowmetallicities of observed lgrb hosts is a consequence of the high starformation environment. the star formation rate appears to be the primaryparameter to generate a burst event. finally, we show that only a few lgrbs areobserved in massive, highly extincted galaxies, while these galaxies areexpected to produce many such events. we identify these missing events with thefraction of dark lgrbs.

1106.1439	population iii stars and the long gamma ray burst rate	because massive, low-metallicity population iii (popiii) stars may producevery powerful long gamma-ray bursts (lgrbs), high-redshift grb observationscould probe the properties of the first stars. we analyze the correlationbetween early popiii stars and lgrbs by using cosmologicaln-body/hydrodynamical simulations, which include detailed chemical evolution,cooling, star formation, feedback effects and the transition between popiii andmore standard population i/ii (popii/i) stars. from the swift observed rate oflgrbs, we estimate the fraction of black holes that will produce a grb frompopii/i stars to be in the range 0.028&lt;f_{grb}&lt;0.140, depending on the assumedupper metallicity of the progenitor. assuming that as of today no grb event hasbeen associated to a popiii star, we estimate the upper limit for the fractionof lgrbs produced by popiii stars to be in the range 0.006&lt;f_{grb}&lt;0.022. whenwe apply a detection threshold compatible with the bat instrument, we find thatthe expected fraction of popiii grbs (grb3) is ~10% of the full lgrb populationat z&gt;6, becoming as high has 40% at z&gt;10. finally, we study the properties ofthe galaxies hosting our sample of grb3. we find that the average metallicityof the galaxies hosting a grb3 is typically higher than the criticalmetallicity used to select the popiii stars, due to the efficiency in pollutingthe gas above such low values. we also find that the highest probability offinding a grb3 is within galaxies with a stellar mass &lt;10^7 msun, independentlyfrom the redshift.

0710.1303	testing reionization with gamma ray burst absorption spectra	we propose to study cosmic reionization using absorption line spectra ofhigh-redshift gamma ray burst (grb) afterglows. we show that the statistics ofthe dark portions (gaps) in grb absorption spectra represent exquisite tools todiscriminate among different reionization models. we then compute theprobability to find the largest gap in a given width range [wmax, wmax + dw] ata flux threshold fth for burst afterglows at redshifts 6.3 &lt; z &lt; 6.7. we showthat different reionization scenarios populate the (wmax, fth) plane in a verydifferent way, allowing to distinguish among different reionization histories.we provide here useful plots that allow a very simple and direct comparisonbetween observations and model results. finally, we apply our methods to grb050904 detected at z = 6.29. we show that the observation of this burststrongly favors reionization models which predict a highly ionizedintergalactic medium at z~6, with an estimated mean neutral hydrogen fractionxhi = 6.4 \pm 0.3 \times 10^-5 along the line of sight towards grb 050904.

1112.0018	a minor body falling onto a neutron star as an explanation for the  unusual gamma-ray burst grb 101225a	the tidal disruption of a solar mass star around a supermassive black holehas been extensively studied analytically and numerically. in these events thestar develops into an elongated banana-shaped structure. after completing aneccentric orbit, the bound debris fall onto the black hole, forming anaccretion disk and emitting radiation. the same process may occur on planetaryscales, if a minor body orbits too close to its star. in the solar system,comets fall directly onto our sun or onto planets. if the star is a compactobject, the minor body can become tidally disrupted. indeed, one of the firstmechanisms invoked to produce strong gamma-ray emission involved accretion ofcomets onto neutron stars in our galaxy. here we report that the peculiaritiesof the `christmas' gamma-ray burst (grb 101225a) can be explained by a tidaldisruption event of a minor body around a galactic isolated neutron star. thisresult would indicate either that minor bodies can be captured by compactstellar remnants more frequently than it occurs in our solar system or thatminor body formation is relatively easy around millisecond radio pulsars. apeculiar supernova associated to a grb may provide an alternative explanation.

1112.1700	a complete sample of bright swift long gamma-ray bursts: sample  presentation, luminosity function and evolution	we present a carefully selected sub-sample of swift long gamma-ray bursts(grbs), that is complete in redshift. the sample is constructed by consideringonly bursts with favorable observing conditions for ground-based follow-upsearches, that are bright in the 15-150 kev swift/bat band, i.e. with 1-s peakphoton fluxes in excess to 2.6 ph s^-1 cm^-2. the sample is composed by 58bursts, 52 of them with redshift for a completeness level of 90%, while anothertwo have a redshift constraint, reaching a completeness level of 95%. for onlythree bursts we have no constraint on the redshift. the high level of redshiftcompleteness allows us for the first time to constrain the grb luminosityfunction and its evolution with cosmic times in a unbiased way. we find thatstrong evolution in luminosity (d_l=2.3\pm 0.6) or in density (d_d=1.7\pm 0.5)is required in order to account for the observations. the derived redshiftdistribution in the two scenarios are consistent with each other, in spite oftheir different intrinsic redshift distribution. this calls for otherindicators to distinguish among different evolution models. complete samplesare at the base of any population studies. in future works we will use thisunique sample of swift bright grbs to study the properties of the population oflong grbs.

1112.4480	the dark bursts population in a complete sample of bright swift long  gamma-ray bursts	we study the properties of the population of optically dark events present ina carefully selected complete sample of bright swift long gamma-ray bursts. thehigh level of completeness in redshift of our sample (52 objects out of 58)allow us to establish the existence of a genuine dark population and we areable to estimate the maximum fraction of dark burst events (~30%) expected forthe whole class of long gamma-ray burst. the redshift distribution of thispopulation of dark bursts is similar to the one of the whole sample.interestingly, the rest-frame x-ray luminosity (and the de-absorbed x-ray flux)of the sub-class of dark bursts is slightly higher than the average luminosityof the non-dark events. at the same time the prompt properties do not differand the optical flux of dark events is at the lower tail of the optical fluxdistribution, corrected for galactic absorption. all these properties suggestthat dark bursts events generate in much denser environments with respect tonormal bright events. we can therefore exclude the high-z and the low-densityscenarios and conclude that the major cause of the origin of optically darkevents is the dust extinction.

1112.5111	the x-ray absorbing column density of a complete sample of bright swift  gamma-ray bursts	a complete sample of bright swift gamma-ray bursts (grbs) has been recentlyselected by salvaterra et al.

0710.4280	gamma ray bursts from the early universe: predictions for present-day  and future instruments	long gamma ray bursts (grbs) constitute an important tool to study theuniverse near and beyond the epoch of reionization. we delineate here thecharacteristics of an 'ideal' instrument for the search of grbs at z&gt;6-10. wefind that the detection of these objects requires soft band detectors with ahigh sensitivity and moderately large fov. in the light of these results, wecompare available and planned grb missions, deriving conservative predictionson the number of high-z grbs detectable by these instruments along with themaximum accessible redshift. we show that the swift satellite will be able todetect various grbs at z&gt;6, and likely at z&gt;10 if the trigger threshold isdecreased by a factor of ~2. furthermore, we find that integral and glast arenot the best tool to detect bursts at z&gt;6: the former being limited by thesmall fov, and the latter by its hard energy band and relatively lowsensitivity. finally, future missions (svom, edge, but in particular exist)will provide a good sample of grbs at z&gt;6 in a few years of operation.

1203.0003	the impact of selection biases on the ep-liso correlation of gamma ray  bursts	we study the possible effects of selection biases on the ep-liso correlationcaused by the unavoidable presence of flux-limits in the existing samples ofgamma ray bursts (grbs). we consider a well defined complete sample of swiftgrbs and perform monte carlo simulations of the grb population under differentassumptions for their luminosity functions. if we assume that there is nocorrelation between the peak energy ep and the isotropic luminosity liso, weare unable to reproduce it as due to the flux limit threshold of the swiftcomplete sample. we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no intrinsiccorrelation between ep and liso at more than 2.7 sigma level of confidence.this result is robust against the assumptions of our simulations and it isconfirmed if we consider, instead of swift, the trigger threshold of the batseinstrument. therefore, there must be a physical relation between these twoquantities. our simulations seem to exclude, at a lower confidence level of 1.6sigma, the possibility that the observed ep-liso correlation among differentbursts is caused by a boundary, i.e. such that for any given ep, we see onlythe largest liso, which has a flux above the threshold of the currentinstruments.

1203.1864	on the environment of short gamma-ray bursts	in this paper we present a sample of 10 short gamma-ray bursts (grbs) with arobust redshift determination, discovered by the swift satellite up to january2011. we measure their x-ray absorbing column densities and collect data on thehost galaxy offsets. we find evidence for intrinsic absorption and nocorrelation between the intrinsic absorbing column density and the projectedoffset of the grb from its host galaxy center. we find that the properties inthe gamma regime (t90, fluence and 1-s peak photon flux) of short grbs with"bright" and "faint" x-ray afterglow likely disfavour different prompt emissionmechanisms. host galaxy offset and grb duration (t90) do not correlate.instead, there is a hint of anti-correlation between the effective radiusnormalised host galaxy offset and t90. finally, we examine the properties ofshort grbs with short-lived and long-lived x-ray afterglows, finding that someshort grbs with short-lived x-ray afterglows have their optical afterglowdetected. in light of this, the x-ray afterglow duration does not seem to be anunique indicator of a specific progenitor and/or environment for short grbs.

1204.2417	metallicity effects on the cosmic snib/c and grb rates	supernovae ib/c are likely to be associated to long grbs, therefore it isimportant to compare the sn rate in galaxies with the grb rate. to do that wecomputed type ib/c sn rates in galaxies of different morphological type byassuming different histories of star formation and different supernova ib/cprogenitors. we included some recent suggestions about the dependence of theminimum mass of single wolf-rayet (wr) stars upon the stellar metallicity andtherefore upon galactic chemical evolution. we adopted several cosmic starformation rates as functions of cosmic time, either observationally ortheoretically derived, including the one computed with our galaxy models. thenwe computed the cosmic type ib/c sn rates. we derived the followingconclusions: i) the ratio cosmic grb - type ib/c rate varies in the range10^{-2}-10^{-4} in the whole redshift range, thus suggesting that only a smallfraction of all the type ib/c sne gives rise to grbs. ii) the metallicitydependence of type ib/c sn progenitors produces lower cosmic sn ib/c rates atearly times, for any chosen cosmic star formation rate. iii) differenttheoretical cosmic star formation rates, computed under different scenarios ofgalaxy formation, produce sn ib/c cosmic rates which differ mainly at very highredshift. however, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions on the highredshift trend because of the large uncertainties in the data. iv) grbs can beimportant tracers of star formation at high redshift if their luminosityfunction does not vary with redshift and they can help in discriminating amongdifferent galaxy formation models.

1206.2357	a complete sample of bright swift gamma-ray bursts: x-ray afterglow  luminosity and its correlation with the prompt emission	we investigate wheter there is any correlation between the x-ray afterglowluminosity and the prompt emission properties of a carefully selectedsub-sample of bright swift long gamma-ray bursts (grbs) nearly complete inredshift (~90%). being free of selection effects (except flux limit), thissample provides the possibility to compare the rest frame physical propertiesof grb prompt and afterglow emission in an unbiased way. the afterglow x-rayluminosities are computed at four different rest frame times (5 min, 1 hr, 11hr and 24 hr after trigger) and compared with the prompt emission isotropicenergy e_iso, the isotropic peak luminosity l_iso and the rest frame peakenergy e_peak. we find that the rest frame afterglow x-ray luminosity docorrelate with these prompt emission quantities, but the significance of eachcorrelation decreases over time. this result is in agreement with the idea thatthe grb x-ray light curve can be described as the result of a combination ofdifferent components whose relative contribution and weight change with time,with the prompt and afterglow emission dominating at early and late time,respectively. in particular, we found evidence that the plateau and the shallowdecay phase often observed in grb x-ray light curves are powered by activityfrom the central engine. the existence of the l_x-e_iso correlation at latetimes (t_rf &gt; 11 hr) suggests a similar radiative efficiency among differentbursts with on average about 6% of the total kinetic energy powering the promptemission.

1206.5532	the optical sn 2012bz associated with the long grb 120422a	the association of type ic sne with long-duration grbs is well established.we endeavor, through accurate ground-based observational campaigns, tocharacterize these sne at increasingly high redshifts. we obtained a series ofoptical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the type ic sn2012bzassociated with the swift long-duration grb120422a (z=0.283) using the 3.6-mtng and the 8.2-m vlt telescopes. the peak times of the light curves ofsn2012bz in various optical filters differ, with the b-band and i'-band lightcurves reaching maximum at ~9 and ~23 rest-frame days, respectively. thebolometric light curve has been derived from individual bands photometricmeasurements, but no correction for the unknown contribution in thenear-infrared (probably around 10-15%) has been applied. therefore, the presentlight curve should be considered as a lower limit to the actual uv-optical-irbolometric light curve. this pseudo-bolometric curve reaches its maximum (mbol= -18.56 +/- 0.06) at 13 +/- 1 rest-frame days; it is similar in shape andluminosity to the bolometric light curves of the sne associated with z&lt;0.2 grbsand more luminous than those of sne associated with xrfs. a comparison with themodel generated for the bolometric light curve of sn2003dh suggests thatsn2012bz produced only about 15% less 56ni than sn2003dh, about 0.35 msol.similarly the vlt spectra of sn2012bz, after correction for galactic extinctionand for the contribution of the host galaxy, suggest comparable explosionparameters with those observed in sn2003dh (ek~3.5 x 10^52 erg, mej~7 msol) anda similar progenitor mass (~25-40 msol). grb120422a is consistent with theepeak-eiso and the ex,iso-egamma,iso-e_peak relations. grb120422a/sn2012bzshows the grb-sn connection at the highest redshift so far accurately monitoredboth photometrically and spectroscopically.

1210.1215	the faster the narrower: characteristic bulk velocities and jet opening  angles of gamma ray bursts	the jet opening angle theta_jet and the bulk lorentz factor gamma_0 arecrucial parameters for the computation of the energetics of gamma ray bursts(grbs). from the ~30 grbs with measured theta_jet or gamma_0 it is known that:(i) the real energetic e_gamma, obtained by correcting the isotropic equivalentenergy e_iso for the collimation factor ~theta_jet^2, is clustered around10^50-10^51 erg and it is correlated with the peak energy e_p of the promptemission and (ii) the comoving frame e'_p and e'_gamma are clustered aroundtypical values. current estimates of gamma_0 and theta_jet are based onincomplete data samples and their observed distributions could be subject tobiases. through a population synthesis code we investigate whether differentassumed intrinsic distributions of gamma_0 and theta_jet can reproduce a set ofobservational constraints. assuming that all bursts have the same e'_p ande'_gamma in the comoving frame, we find that gamma_0 and theta_jet cannot bedistributed as single power-laws. the best agreement between our simulation andthe available data is obtained assuming (a) log-normal distributions fortheta_jet and gamma_0 and (b) an intrinsic relation between the peak values oftheir distributions, i.e theta_jet^2.5*gamma_0=const. on average, larger valuesof gamma_0 (i.e. the "faster" bursts) correspond to smaller values of theta_jet(i.e. the "narrower"). we predict that ~6% of the bursts that point to usshould not show any jet break in their afterglow light curve since they havesin(theta_jet)&lt;1/gamma_0. finally, we estimate that the local rate of grbs is~0.3% of all local snib/c and ~4.3% of local hypernovae, i.e. snib/c withbroad-lines.

1210.6377	spectrum of the unresolved cosmic x ray background: what is unresolved  50 years after its discovery	we study the spectral properties of the unresolved cosmic x-ray background(cxrb) in the 1.5-7.0 kev energy band with the aim of providing anobservational constraint on the statistical properties of those sources thatare too faint to be individually probed. we made use of the swift x-rayobservation of the chandra deep field south complemented by the chandra data.exploiting the lowest instrument background (swift) together with the deepestobservation ever performed (chandra) we measured the unresolved emission at thedeepest level and with the best accuracy available today. we find that theunresolved cxrb emission can be modeled by a single power law with a very hardphoton index gamma=0.1+/-0.7 and a flux of 5(+/-3)e-12 cgs in the 2.0-10 kevenergy band (1 sigma error). thanks to the low instrument background of theswift-xrt, we significantly improved the accuracy with respect to previousmeasurements. these results point towards a novel ingredient in agn populationsynthesis models, namely a positive evolution of the compton-thick agnpopulation from local universe to high redshift.

0712.0538	detectable signatures of cosmic radiative feedback	we use a semi-analytical model to study the impact of reionization, and theassociated radiative feedback, on galaxy formation. two feedback models havebeen considered: (i) a standard prescription, according to which star formationis totally suppressed in galaxies with circular velocity below a criticalthreshold (model cf06) and (ii) a characterization based on the filtering scale(model g00), allowing for a gradual reduction of the gas available for starformation in low-mass galaxies. in model cf06 reionization starts at z ~ 15-20,is 85% complete by z ~ 10; at the same z, the ionized fraction is 16% in modelg00. the models match sdss constraints on the evolution of the neutral hydrogenfraction at z &lt; 7, but predict different thomson optical depths, tau_e = 0.1017(cf06), and 0.0631 (g00); such values are within 1 sigma of the wmap 3-yrdetermination. both models are in remarkable good agreement with additionalexisting data (evolution of lyman-limit systems, cosmic star formation history,high-z galaxy counts, igm thermal history), which therefore cannot be used todiscriminate among different feedback models. deviations among radiativefeedback prescriptions emerge when considering the expected hi 21 cm backgroundsignal, where a ~ 15 mk absorption feature in the range 75-100 mhz is presentin model g00 and a global shift of the emission feature preceding reionizationtowards larger frequencies occurs in the same model. single dish observationswith existing or forthcoming low-frequency radio telescopes can achieve mksensitivity, allowing the identification of these features provided thatforegrounds can be accurately subtracted.

1211.2062	grbs have preferred jet opening angles and bulk lorentz factors	we recently found that gamma ray burst energies and luminosities, in theircomoving frame, are remarkably similar. this, coupled with the clustering ofenergetics once corrected for the collimation factor, suggests the possibilitythat all bursts, in their comoving frame, have the same peak energy e'peak (ofthe order of a few kev) and the same energetics of the prompt emission e'gamma(of the order of 2e48 erg). the large diversity of bursts energies is then dueto the different bulk lorentz factor gamma and jet aperture angle theta_jet. weinvestigated, through a population synthesis code, what are the distributionsof gamma and theta_jet compatible with the observations. both quantities musthave preferred values, with log-normal best fitting distributions and &lt;gamma0&gt;~ 275 and &lt;\theta_jet&gt; ~ 8.7 degree. moreover, the peak values of the gamma andtheta_jet distributions must be related - theta_jet^2.5 gamma =const: thenarrower the jet angle, the larger the bulk lorentz factor. we predict that ~6%of the bursts that point to us should not show any jet break in their afterglowlight curve since they have sin(theta_jet)&lt;1/gamma. finally, we estimate thatthe local rate of grbs is ~0.3% of all local snib/c and ~2.5% of localhypernovae, i.e. snib/c with broad absorption lines.

1212.0856	simulating high-z gamma-ray burst host galaxies	we investigate the nature of high-z host galaxies of long gamma-ray bursts(lgrbs) by means of state-of-the-art numerical simulations of cosmic structureformation and evolution of galaxies. we combine results from different runswith various box sizes and resolutions. by assigning to each simulated galaxythe probability to host a lgrb, assumed to be proportional to the mass of youngstars, we provide a full description of the physical properties of high-z lgrbhost galaxy population. we find that lgrbs at z&gt;6 are hosted in galaxies withtypical star formation rates sfr \sim 0.03-0.3 msun yr^{-1}, stellar masses m\sim 10^{6-8} msun, and metallicities z \sim 0.01-0.1 zsun. furthermore, theratio between their doubling time and the corresponding cosmic time seems to beuniversally equal to ~0.1-0.3, independently from the redshift. thedistribution of their uv luminosity places lgrb hosts in the faint-end of thegalaxy luminosity function, well below the current capabilities of space- orground-based optical facilities. this is in line with recent reports ofnon-detection of lgrb hosts using extremely deep hst and vlt observations. inconclusion, high-z lgrbs are found to trace the position of those faintgalaxies that are thought to be the major actors in the re-ionization of theuniverse.

0712.1913	cmb polarization constraints on radiative feedback	we compute the imprints left on the cmb by two cosmic reionization modelsconsistent with current observations but characterized by alternative radiativefeedback prescriptions (suppression and filtering) resulting in a differentsuppression of star formation in low-mass halos. the models imply differentionization and thermal histories and 21 cm background signals. the derivedcomptonization, u, and free-free distortion, y_b, parameters are below currentobservational limits for both models. however, the value of u = 1.69 * 10^-7(9.65 * 10^-8) for the suppression (filtering) model is in the detectabilityrange of the next generation of cmb spectrum experiments. through the dedicatedboltzmann code cmbfast, modified to include the above ionization histories, wecompute the cmb angular power spectrum (aps) of the tt, te, and ee modes. forthe ee mode the differences between these models are significantly larger thanthe cosmic and sampling variance over the multipole range l = 5-15, leaving agood chance of discriminating between these feedback mechanisms withforthcoming/future cmb polarization experiments. the main limitations come fromforeground contamination: it should be subtracted at per cent level in terms ofaps, a result potentially achievable by novel component separation techniquesand mapping of galactic foreground.

1303.4743	dust extinction for an unbiased sample of grb afterglows	in this paper we compute rest-frame extinctions for the afterglows of asample of gamma-ray bursts complete in redshift. the selection criteria of thesample are based on observational high-energy parameters of the prompt emissionand therefore our sample should not be biased against dusty sight-lines. it istherefore expected that our inferences hold for the general population ofgamma-ray bursts. our main result is that the optical/near-infrared extinctionof gamma-ray burst afterglows in our sample does not follow a singledistribution. 87% of the events are absorbed by less than 2 mag, and 50% sufferfrom less than 0.3-0.4 mag extinction. the remaining 13% of the afterglows arehighly absorbed. the true percentage of gamma-ray burst afterglows showing highabsorption could be even higher since a fair fraction of the events withoutreliable redshift measurement are probably part of this class. these events maybe due to highly dusty molecular clouds/star forming regions associated withthe gamma-ray burst progenitor or along the afterglow line of sight, and/or tomassive dusty host galaxies. no clear evolution in the dust extinctionproperties is evident within the redshift range of our sample, although thelargest extinctions are at z~1.5-2, close to the expected peak of the starformation rate. those events classified as dark are characterized, on average,by a higher extinction than typical events in the sample. a correlation betweenoptical/near-infrared extinction and hydrogen-equivalent column density basedon x-ray studies is shown although the observed nh appears to be well in excesscompared to those observed in the local group. dust extinction does not seem tocorrelate with grb energetics or luminosity.

1306.0013	how to switch on and off a gamma-ray burst through a magnetar	one of the most elusive features of gamma ray bursts (grbs) is the sporadicemission prior to the main prompt event observed in at least $\sim 15\%$ ofcases. these precursors have spectral and temporal properties similar to themain prompt emission, and smaller, but comparable, energetics. they areseparated from the main event by a quiescent time that may be extremely longand, in some cases, more than one precursor has been observed in the sameburst. precursors are still a puzzle: despite many attempts none of theproposed models can account for all the observed features. based on thecomplete sample of bright long grbs observed by swift (bat6), we propose a newscenario for which precursors are explained by assuming that the central grbengine is a newly born magnetar. in this model the precursor and the promptemission arise from accretion of matter onto the surface of the magnetar. theaccretion process can be halted by the centrifugal drag exerted by the rotatingmagnetosphere onto the in-falling matter, allowing for multiple precursors andvery long quiescent times.

1307.7704	radio afterglows of a complete sample of bright swift grbs: predictions  from present days to the ska era	radio observations of gamma ray bursts afterglows are fundamental inproviding insights into their physics and environment, and in constraining thetrue energetics of these sources. nonetheless, radio observations of grbafterglows are presently sparse in the time/frequency domain. starting from acomplete sample of 58 bright swift long bursts (bat6), we constructed ahomogeneous sub-sample of 38 radio detections/upper limits which preserves allthe properties of the parent sample. one half of the bursts have detectionsbetween 1 and 5 days after the explosion with typical fluxes f&gt;100 mujy at 8.4ghz. through a population synthesis code coupled with the standard afterglowhydrodynamical emission model (psyche) we reproduce the radio flux distributionof the radio sub-sample. based on these results we study the detectability inthe time/frequency domain of the entire long grb population by present andfuture radio facilities. we find that the grbs that typically trigger swift canbe detected at 8.4 ghz by jvla within few days with modest exposures even athigh redshifts. the final ska can potentially observe the whole grb populationprovided that there will be a dedicated grb gamma-ray detector more sensitivethan swift. for a sizable fraction (50%) of these bursts, ska will allow us toperform radio-calorimetry, after the trans-relativistic transition (occurring~100 d), providing an estimate of the true (collimation corrected) energeticsof grbs.

1409.1213	luminosity function and jet structure of gamma ray bursts	the structure of gamma ray burst (grb) jets impacts on their prompt andafterglow emission properties. the jet of grbs could be uniform, with constantenergy per unit solid angle within the jet aperture, or it could instead bestructured, namely with energy and velocity that depend on the angular distancefrom the axis of the jet. we try to get some insight about the still unknownstructure of grbs by studying their luminosity function. we show that low(1e46-1e48 erg/s) and high (i.e. with l &gt; 1e50 erg/s) luminosity grbs can bedescribed by a unique luminosity function, which is also consistent withcurrent lower limits in the intermediate luminosity range (1e48-1e50} erg/s).we derive analytical expressions for the luminosity function of grbs in uniformand structured jet models and compare them with the data. uniform jets canreproduce the entire luminosity function with reasonable values of the freeparameters. a structured jet can also fit adequately the current data, providedthat the energy within the jet is relatively strongly structured, i.e. e proptotheta^{-k} with k &gt; 4. the classical e propto theta^{-2} structured jet modelis excluded by the current data.

1409.7064	are lgrbs biased tracers of star formation? clues from the host galaxies  of the swift/bat6 complete sample of lgrbs. i: stellar mass at z&lt;1	lgrbs are associated with massive stars and are therefore linked to starformation. the conditions necessary to produce lgrbs can affect the relationbetween the lgrb rate and star formation. by using the power of a complete lgrbsample, our aim is to understand whether such a bias exists and, if it does,what is its origin. in this first paper, we build the sed of the z&lt;1 hostgalaxies of the bat6 lgrb sample, and determine their stellar masses from sedfitting. we compare the resulting stellar mass distribution (i) withstar-forming galaxies observed in deep surveys (ultravista); (ii) withsemi-analitical models of the z&lt;1 star forming galaxy population and (iii) withnumerical simulations of lgrb hosts having different metallicity thresholds forthe progenitor star environment. we find that at z&lt;1 lgrbs tend to avoidmassive galaxies and are powerful in selecting faint low-mass star-forminggalaxies. the stellar mass distribution of the hosts is not consistent withthat of the ultravista star-forming galaxies weighted for their sfr. thisimplies that, at least at z&lt;1, lgrbs are not unbiased tracers of starformation. to make the two distributions consistent, a much steeper faint-endof the mass function would be required, or a very shallow sfr-mass relation forthe low mass galaxy population. grb host galaxy simulations indicates that, toreproduce the stellar mass distribution, a metallicity threshold of the orderof z_th=0.3-0.5z_sun is necessary. models without a metallicity threshold orwith an extreme threshold of z_th = 0.1z_sun are excluded at z&lt;1. the use ofthe bat6 complete sample makes this result not affected by possible biaseswhich could have influenced past results based on incomplete samples. thepreference for low metallicities (z&lt;~0.5z_sun) can be a consequence of theparticular conditions needed for the progenitor star to produce a grb.(abridged)

1410.0489	circular polarization in the optical afterglow of grb 121024a	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) are most probably powered by collimated relativisticoutflows (jets) from accreting black holes at cosmological distances. brightafterglows are produced when the outflow collides with the ambient medium.afterglow polarization directly probes the magnetic properties of the jet, whenmeasured minutes after the burst, and the geometric properties of the jet andthe ambient medium when measured hours to days after the burst. high values ofoptical polarization detected minutes after burst in grb 120308a indicate thepresence of large-scale ordered magnetic fields originating from the centralengine (the power source of the grb). theoretical models predict low degrees oflinear polarization and negligable circular polarization at late times, whenthe energy in the original ejecta is quickly transferred to the ambient mediumand propagates farther into the medium as a blastwave. here we report thedetection of circularly polarized optical light in the afterglow of grb121024a, measured 0.15 days after the burst. we show that the circularpolarization is intrinsic to the afterglow and unlikely to be produced by dustscattering or plasma propagation effects. a possible explanation is to invokeanisotropic (rather than the commonly assumed isotropic) electron pitch angledistributions, and we suggest that new models are required to produce thecomplex microphysics of realistic shocks in relativistic jets.

1501.00913	missing cosmic metals revealed by x-ray absorption towards distant  sources	the census of heavy elements (metals) produced by all stars through cosmictimes up to present-day is limited to ~50%; of these only half are still foundwithin their parent galaxy. the majority of metals is expelled from galaxiesinto the circumgalactic (or even more distant, intergalactic) space by powerfulgalactic winds, leaving unpleasant uncertainty on the amount, thermalproperties and distribution of these key chemical species. these dispersedmetals unavoidably absorb soft x-ray photons from distant sources. we show thattheir integrated contribution can be detected in the form of increasing x-rayabsorption with distance, for all kinds of high-energy cosmic sources. based onextensive cosmological simulations, we assess that $\sim$ 10\% of all cosmicmetals reside in the intergalactic medium. most of the x-ray absorption arisesinstead from a few discrete structures along the line of sight. these extendedstructures, possibly pin-pointing galaxy groups, contain million degree,metal-enriched gas, 100-1,000 times denser than the cosmic mean. an additional~10% of cosmic metals could reside in this phase.

1502.02676	accessing the population of high redshift gamma ray bursts	gamma ray bursts (grbs) are a powerful probe of the high redshift universe.we present a tool to estimate the detection rate of high-z grbs by a genericdetector with defined energy band and sensitivity. we base this on a populationmodel that reproduces the observed properties of grbs detected by swift, fermiand cgro in the hard x-ray and gamma-ray bands. we provide the expectedcumulative distributions of the flux and fluence of simulated grbs in differentenergy bands. we show that scintillator detectors, operating at relatively highenergies (e.g. tens of kev to the mev), can detect only the most luminous grbsat high redshifts due to the link between the peak spectral energy and theluminosity (ep-liso) of grbs. we show that the best strategy for catching thelargest number of high-z bursts is to go softer (e.g. in the soft x-ray band)but with a very high sensitivity. for instance, an imaging soft x-ray detectoroperating in the 0.2-5 kev energy band reaching a sensitivity, corresponding toa fluence of ~10^-8 erg cm^-2, is expected to detect ~40 grbs yr^-1 sr^-1 atz&gt;5 (~3 grbs yr^-1 sr^-1 at z&gt;10). once high-z grbs are detected the principalissue is to secure their redshift. to this aim we estimate their nir afterglowflux at relatively early times and evaluate the effectiveness of following themup and construct usable samples of events with any forthcoming grb missiondedicated to explore the high-z universe.

1503.01118	popiii signatures in the spectra of popii/i grbs	we investigate signatures of population iii (popiii) stars in themetal-enriched environment of grbs originating from population ii-i (popii/i)stars by using abundance ratios derived from numerical simulations that followstellar evolution and chemical enrichment. we find that at $z&gt;10$ more than$10%$ of popii/i grbs explode in a medium previously enriched by popiii stars(we refer to them as grbii$\rightarrow$iii). although the formation ofgrbii$\rightarrow$iii is more frequent than that of pristine popiii grbs(grbiiis), we find that the expected grbii$\rightarrow$iii observed rate iscomparable to that of grbiiis, due to the usually larger luminosities of theselatter. grbii$\rightarrow$iii events take place preferentially in smallproto-galaxies with stellar masses $\rm m_\star \sim 10^{4.5} - 10^7\,\rmm_\odot$, star formation rates $\rm sfr \sim 10^{-3}-10^{-1}\,\rm m_\odot/yr$and metallicities $z \sim 10^{-4}-10^{-2}\,\rm z_\odot$. on the other hand,galaxies with $z &lt; 10^{-2.8}\,\rm z_\odot$ are dominated by metal enrichmentfrom popiii stars and should preferentially host grbii$\rightarrow$iii. hence,measured grb metal content below this limit could represent a strong evidenceof enrichment by pristine stellar populations. we discuss how to discriminatepopiii metal enrichment on the basis of various abundance ratios observable inthe spectra of grbs' afterglows. by employing such analysis, we conclude thatthe currently known candidates at redshift $z\simeq 6$ -- i.e. grb 050904\cite[][]{2006natur.440..184k} and grb 130606a \cite[][]{2013arxiv1312.5631c}-- are likely not originated in environments pre-enriched by popiii stars.

1503.01131	gamma-ray burst jets: uniform or structured?	the structure of gamma-ray burst (grb) jets impacts on their prompt andafterglow emission properties. insights into the still unknown structure ofgrbs can be achieved by studying how different structures impact on theluminosity function (lf): i) we show that low ($10^{46} &lt; l_{\rm iso} &lt;10^{48}$ erg/s) and high (i.e. with $l_{\rm iso} &gt; 10^{50}$ erg/s) luminositygrbs can be described by a unique lf; ii) we find that a uniform jet (seen on-and off-axis) as well as a very steep structured jet (i.e. $\epsilon(\theta)\propto \theta^{-s}$ with $s &gt; 4$) can reproduce the current lf data; iii)taking into account the emission from the whole jet (i.e. includingcontributions from mildly relativistic, off-axis jet elements) we find that$e_{\rm iso}(\theta_{\rm v})$ (we dub this quantity "apparent structure") canbe very different from the intrinsic structure $\epsilon(\theta)$: inparticular, a jet with a gaussian intrinsic structure has an apparent structurewhich is more similar to a power law. this opens a new viewpoint on thequasi-universal structured jet hypothesis.

1504.02096	unveiling the population of orphan gamma ray bursts	gamma ray bursts are detectable in the gamma-ray band if their jets areoriented towards the observer. however, for each grb with a typical theta_jet,there should be ~2/theta_jet^2 bursts whose emission cone is oriented elsewherein space. these off-axis bursts can be eventually detected when, due to thedeceleration of their relativistic jets, the beaming angle becomes comparableto the viewing angle. orphan afterglows (oa) should outnumber the currentpopulation of bursts detected in the gamma-ray band even if they have not beenconclusively observed so far at any frequency. we compute the expected flux ofthe population of orphan afterglows in the mm, optical and x-ray bands througha population synthesis code of grbs and the standard afterglow emission model.we estimate the detection rate of oa by on-going and forthcoming surveys. theaverage duration of oa as transients above a given limiting flux is derived anddescribed with analytical expressions: in general oa should appear as dailytransients in optical surveys and as monthly/yearly transients in the mm/radioband. we find that ~ 2 oa yr^-1 could already be detected by gaia and up to 20oa yr^-1 could be observed by the ztf survey. a larger number of 50 oa yr^-1should be detected by lsst in the optical band. for the x-ray band, ~ 26 oayr^-1 could be detected by the erosita. for the large population of oadetectable by lsst, the x-ray and optical follow up of the light curve (for thebrightest cases) and/or the extensive follow up of their emission in the mm andradio band could be the key to disentangle their grb nature from otherextragalactic transients of comparable flux density.

1506.05463	the rate and luminosity function of long gamma ray bursts	we derive, adopting a direct method, the luminosity function and theformation rate of long gamma ray bursts through a complete, flux-limited,sample of swift bursts which has a high level of completeness in redshift z(~82%). we parametrise the redshift evolution of the grb luminosity as l =l_0(1+ z)^k and we derive k = 2.5, consistently with recent estimates. thede-evolved luminosity function of grbs can be represented by a broken power lawwith slopes a = -1.32 +- 0.21 and b = -1.84 +- 0.24 below and above,respectively, a characteristic break luminosity l_0,b = 10^51.45+-0.15 erg/s.under the hypothesis of luminosity evolution we find that the grb formationrate increases with redshift up to z~2, where it peaks, and then decreases inagreement with the shape of the cosmic star formation rate. we test the directmethod through numerical simulations and we show that if it is applied toincomplete (both in redshift and/or flux) grb samples it can misleadinglyresult in an excess of the grb formation rate at low redshifts.

0805.4104	evidence for luminosity evolution of long gamma-ray bursts in swift data	we compute the luminosity function (lf) and the formation rate of long gammaray bursts (grbs) by fitting the observed differential peak flux distributionobtained by the batse experiment in two different scenarios: i) the grbluminosity evolves with redshift and ii) grbs form preferentially inlow-metallicity environments. in both cases, model predictions are consistentwith the swift number counts and with the number of detections at z&gt;2.5 andz&gt;3.5. to discriminate between the two evolutionary scenarios, we compare themodel results with the number of luminous bursts (i.e. with isotropic peakluminosity in excess of 10^53 erg s^-1) detected by swift in its first threeyears of mission. our sample conservatively contains only bursts with goodredshift determination and measured peak energy. we find that pure luminosityevolution models can account for the number of sure identifications. in thecase of a pure density evolution scenario, models with z_th&gt;0.3 zsun are ruledout with high confidence. for lower metallicity thresholds, the model resultsare still statistically consistent with available lower limits. however, manyfactors can increase the discrepancy between model results and data, indicatingthat some luminosity evolution in the grb lf may be needed also for such lowvalues of z_th. finally, using these new constraints, we derive robust upperlimits on the bright-end of the grb lf, showing that this cannot be steeperthan ~2.6.

1512.00467	extras discovery of an 1.2-s x-ray pulsar in m 31	during a search for coherent signals in the x-ray archival data ofxmm-newton, we discovered a modulation at 1.2 s in 3xmm j004301.4+413017 (3xj0043), a source lying in the direction of an external arm of m 31. this shortperiod indicates a neutron star (ns). between 2000 and 2013, the position of 3xj0043 was imaged by public xmm-newton observations 35 times. the analysis ofthese data allowed us to detect an orbital modulation at 1.27 d and study thelong-term properties of the source. the emission of the pulsar was rather hard(most spectra are described by a power law with $\gamma &lt; 1$) and, assuming thedistance to m 31, the 0.3-10 kev luminosity was variable, from$\sim$$3\times10^{37}$ to $2\times10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. the analysis ofoptical data shows that, while 3x j0043 is likely associated to a globularcluster in m 31, a counterpart with $v\gtrsim22$ outside the cluster cannot beexcluded. considering our findings, there are two main viable scenarios for 3xj0043: a peculiar low-mass x-ray binary, similar to 4u 1822-37 or 4u 1626-67,or an intermediate-mass x-ray binary resembling her x-1. regardless of theexact nature of the system, 3x j0043 is the first accreting ns in m 31 in whichthe spin period has been detected.

astro-ph;0203294	a joint study of early and late spectral distortions of the cosmic  microwave background and of the millimetric foreground	we have compared the absolute temperature data of the cmb spectrum withmodels for cmb spectra distorted by a single or two heating processes atdifferent cosmic times. the constraints on the fractional energy injected inthe radiation field, de/e, are mainly provided by the firas instrument aboardthe cobe satellite. under the hypothesis that two heating processes haveoccurred at different epochs, the limits on de/e are relaxed by a factor 2 bothfor the earlier and the later process with respect to the case in which asingle energy injection in the thermal history of the universe is considered.in general, the constraints on de/e are weaker for early processes than forrelatively late processes, because of the wavelength coverage of firas data.  we considered also the firas calibration as revised by battistelli et al.2000, that, in the case of the favourite calibrator emissivity law proposed bythe authors, implies significant deviations from a planckian spectrum. anastrophysical explanation of this, although intriguing, seems difficult, bothin terms of cmb spectral distortions and in terms of a relevant millimetricforeground.  future precise measurements at longer wavelengths as well as current andfuture cmb anisotropy space missions will provide independent, direct orindirect, cross checks.

astro-ph;0210331	the imprint of the cosmic dark ages on the near infrared background	the redshifted light of the first (pop iii) stars might substantiallycontribute to the near infrared background (nirb). by fitting recent data withmodels including up-to-date pop iii stellar spectra, we find that such starscan indeed account for the whole nirb residual (i.e. after `normal' galaxycontribution subtraction) if the high redshift star formation efficiency is f =10%-50%, depending on the imf (the top-heaviest requiring lowest efficiency)and on the unknown galaxy contribution in the l band (our models, however,suggest it to be negligible). such epoch of pop iii star formation ends in allmodels by z_end ~ 8.8, with a hard limit z_end &lt; 9 set by j band observations.to prevent an associated igm over-enrichment with heavy elements compared toobserved levels in the igm, pair-instability supernovae must be the dominantheavy element sources. alternative explanations must break the light-metalproduction link by advocating very massive stars (m &gt; 260 m_sun) locking theirnucleosynthetic products in the compact remnant or by postulating an extremelyinhomogeneous metal enrichment of the ly alpha forest. we discuss thesepossibilities in detail along with the uncertainties related to the adoptedzodiacal light model.

astro-ph;0304074	induced formation of primordial low-mass stars	we show that the explosion of the first supernovae can trigger low-mass starformation via gravitational fragmentation of the supernova-driven gas shell. ifthe shell mass does not exceed the host galaxy gas mass, all explosions withenergies e_sn &gt; 10^{51} erg can lead to shell fragmentation. however, theminimum ambient density required to induce such fragmentation is much larger,n_0 &gt; 300 cm^{-3}, for type ii supernovae than for pair-instability ones, whichcan induce star formation even at lower ambient densities. the typical mass ofthe unstable fragments is 10^{4-7} msun; their density is in the range110-6x10^7 cm{-3}. fragments have a metallicity strictly lower than 10^{-2.6}zsun and large values of the gravitational-to-pressure force ratio f ~ 8. basedon these findings, we conclude that the second generation of stars produced bysuch self-propagating star formation is predominantly constituted by low-mass,long-living, extremely metal-poor (or even metal-free, if mixing is suppressed)stars. we discuss the implications of such results for pop iii star formationscenarios and for the most iron-poor halo star he0107-5240.

astro-ph;0304254	low-mass relics of early star formation	the earliest stars to form in the universe were the first sources of light,heat and metals after the big bang. the products of their evolution will havehad a profound impact on subsequent generations of stars. recent studies ofprimordial star formation have shown that, in the absence of metals (elementsheavier than helium), the formation of stars with masses 100 times that of thesun would have been strongly favoured, and that low-mass stars could not haveformed before a minimum level of metal enrichment had been reached. the valueof this minimum level is very uncertain, but is likely to be between 10^{-6}and 10^{-4} that of the sun. here we show that the recent discovery of the mostiron-poor star known indicates the presence of dust in extremelylow-metallicity gas, and that this dust is crucial for the formation oflower-mass second-generation stars that could survive until today. the dustprovides a pathway for cooling the gas that leads to fragmentation of theprecursor molecular cloud into smaller clumps, which become the lower-massstars.

astro-ph;0304280	first stars contribution to the near infrared background fluctuations	we show that the emission from the first, metal-free stars inside populationiii objects (popiiis) are needed to explain the level of fluctuations in thenear infrared background (nirb) recently discovered by kashlinsky et al.(2002), at least at the shortest wavelengths. clustering of (unresolved) popiiis can in fact account for the entire signal at almost all the ~1-30 arcsecscales probed by observations in the j band. their contribution fades away atshorter frequencies and becomes negligible in the k band. ``normal'', highlyclustered, &lt;z&gt;~3 galaxies undergoing intense star-formation such as those foundin the hubble deep fields can 'fill in' this gap and provide for the missingsignal. it is in fact found that their contribution to the intensityfluctuations is the dominant one at lambda=2.17 mum, while it gradually loosesimportance in the h and j bands. the joint contribution from these twopopulations of cosmic objects is able, within the errors, to reproduce theobserved power spectrum in the whole near infrared range on small angularscales (theta &lt; 200" for pop iii protogalaxies). signals on larger scalesdetected by other experiments instead require the presence of more localsources.

astro-ph;0309509	mapping the thermal history of the universe with the new generation of  cmb spectrum space experiments	we have studied the implications of the new generation of cmb spectrum spaceexperiments for our knowledge of the thermal history of the universe.  the combination of two experiments with the sensitivity and the frequencycoverage jointly forseen for dimes and firas ii will be able to greatly changeour vision of the capability of the cmb spectrum information to constrainphysical processes at different cosmic ages. the limits on the energydissipations at the all cosmic times accessible to cmb spectrum investigations(z &lt; z_therm) could be improved by about two order of magnitudes and evendissipation processes with de/e ~ 10^-6 could be detected and possiblyaccurately studied. these results are possible because such levels of accuracyon a so wide frequency range allow to remove the approximate degeneracy bothbetween free-free and bose-einstein (be) like distortions and betweencomptonization and be-like distortions.  finally, we discussed the different signatures imprinted on the cmb spectrumby some late astrophysical and particle decay models recently proposed in theliterature and possibly related to the reionization of the universe indicatedby wmap, and compared them with the sensitivity of such classes of cmb spacespectrum experiments.

astro-ph;0410615	gamma-ray constraints on the infrared background excess	motivated by the idea that the recently detected near-infrared (1.2-4 micron)excess over the contribution of known galaxies is due to redshifted light fromthe first cosmic stars (salvaterra &amp; ferrara 2003), we have used the effectcaused by photon-photon absorption on gamma-ray spectra of blazars to putconstraints on extragalactic background light (ebl) from the optical to thefar-ir bands. our analysis is mainly based on the blazar h 1426+428, for whichwe assume a power-law unabsorbed spectrum. we find that an ebl model with noexcess over known galaxies in the near-infrared background (nirb) is inagreement with all the considered blazars; however, it implies a very peculiarintrinsic spectrum for h 1426+428. additional data on the blazars 1es1101-232,h 2356-309 and pks 2155-304 exclude the existence of a strong nirb excessconsistent with kelsall's model of zodiacal light subtraction (zl); thecobe/dirbe measurements, after wright's model zl subtraction, represent a firmnirb upper limit. the constraints on the optical ebl are weaker, due to thefact that predictions from different optical ebl models are often comparable tothe experimental errors. in the mid-infrared the spitzer measurement at 24micron gives a good fit for all the considered blazars.

astro-ph;0411134	extragalactic background light: new constraints from the study of the  photon-photon absorption on blazar spectra	the study of the extragalactic background light (ebl) is crucial tounderstand many astrophysical problems (as the formation of first stars, theevolution of galaxies and the role of dust emission). at present, one of themost powerful ways to put constraints on ebl is represented by the study of thephoton-photon absorption on gamma-ray spectra of tev blazars. adopting thismethod, we found that, if the only contribution to the optical and nearinfrared (nir) background is given by galaxies, the spectrum of the blazarh1426+428 cannot be fitted. to reproduce the observational data of h1426+428 anear infrared excess with respect to galaxy counts is required, with amplitudeconsistent with both the matsumoto et al. (2000) data with kelsall's model ofzodiacal light (zl) subtraction and the dirbe data with wright's model of zlsubtraction. the derived constraints on the optical ebl are weaker, because theexperimental errors on blazar data are still bigger than the differences amongvarious optical ebl models. in the mid-infrared the spitzer measurement at 24micron provides the best fit of the blazar spectrum.

astro-ph;0605624	on the search of electromagnetic cosmological counterparts to  coalescences of massive black hole binaries	we explore the nature of possible electromagnetic counterparts ofcoalescences of massive black hole binaries at cosmological distancesdetectable by the laser interferometer space antenna (lisa). an electromagneticprecursor, during the last year of gravitational wave (gw)-driven inspiral, oran afterglow within few years after coalescence, may highlight the position inthe sky of galaxies hosting lisa sources. we show that observations ofprecursors and afterglows are mutually exclusive, depending on the mass of theprimary black hole. precursors are expected to occur in binaries where theprimary (more massive) black hole is heavier than ~10^7 \msun. they maycorrespond to on-off states of accretion, i.e., to a bright x-ray sourcedecaying into quiescence before black hole coalescence, and are likelyassociated to disturbed galaxies showing signs of ongoing starbursts.coalescences of lighter binaries, with masses &lt;5x10^6 \msun, lack of anyprecursor, as gas is expected to be consumed long before the gw-driven orbitaldecay. such events would not be hosted by (massive) galaxies with an associatedstarburst, given the slow binary inspiral time compared to the typical timescale of starbursts. by contrast, coalescence, for such light binaries, isfollowed by an electromagnetic afterglow, i.e., an off-on accretion staterising in &lt;20 yrs. using a cosmological merger tree algorithm, we show thatfuture x-ray missions such as xeus will be able to identify, in 20 yrsoperation, almost all the massive bh binary detectable by lisa, and, in only 5yrs, all the lisa sources at z&gt;6.

astro-ph;0610329	unresolved x-ray background: clues on galactic nuclear activity at z&gt;6	we study, by means of dedicated simulations of massive black hole build-up,the possibility to constraint the existence and nature of the agn population atz&gt;6 with available and planned x-ray and near infrared space telescopes. wefind that x-ray deep-field observations can set important constraints to thefaint-end of the agn luminosity function at very high redshift. planned x-raytelescopes should be able to detect agn hosting black holes with masses down to&gt;10^5 msun (i.e., x-ray luminosities in excess of 10^42 erg s^-1), and canconstrain the evolution of the population of massive black hole at early times(6&lt;z&lt;10). we find that this population of agn should contribute substantially(~25%) to the unresolved fraction of the cosmic x-ray background in the 0.5-10kev range, and that a significant fraction (~3-4%) of the total backgroundintensity would remain unaccounted even after future x-ray observations. asbyproduct, we compute the expected uv background from agn at z&gt;6 and we discussthe possible role of agn in the reionization of the universe at these earlyepochs, showing that agn alone can provide enough ionizing photons only in the(improbable) case of an almost completely homogeneous inter-galactic medium.finally, we show that super-eddington accretion, suggested by the observed qsosat z&gt;6, must be a very rare event, confined to black holes living in thehighest density peaks.

astro-ph;0612278	the gamma ray burst luminosity function in the light of the swift 2-year  data	we compute the luminosity function (lf) and the formation rate of long gammaray bursts (grbs) by fitting the observed differential peak flux distributionobtained by the batse satellite in three different scenarios: i) grbs followthe cosmic star formation and their lf is constant in time; ii) grbs follow thecosmic star formation but the lf varies with redshift; iii) grbs formpreferentially in low-metallicity environments. we find that the differentialpeak flux number counts obtained by batse and by swift can be reproduced usingthe same lf and grb formation rate, indicating that the two satellites areobserving the same grb population. we then check the resulting redshiftdistributions in the light of swift 2-year data, focusing in particular on therelatively large sample of grbs detected at z&gt;2.5. we show that models in whichgrbs trace the cosmic star formation and are described by a constant lf areruled out by the number of high-z swift detections. this conclusion does notdepend on the redshift distribution of bursts that lack of opticalidentification, nor on the existence of a decline in star formation rate atz&gt;2, nor on the adopted faint-end of the grb lf. swift observations can beexplained by assuming that the lf varies with redshift and/or that grbformation is limited to low-metallicity environments.

0706.0657	on the detection of very high redshift gamma ray bursts with swift	we compute the probability to detect long gamma ray bursts (grbs) at z&gt;5 withswift, assuming that grbs form preferentially in low-metallicity environments.the model fits well both the observed batse and swift grb differential peakflux distribution and is consistent with the number of z&gt;2.5 detections in the2-year swift data. we find that the probability to observe a burst at z&gt;5becomes larger than 10% for photon fluxes p&lt;1 ph s^{-1} cm^{-2}, consistentwith the number of confirmed detections. the corresponding fraction of z&gt;5bursts in the swift catalog is ~10%-30% depending on the adopted metallicitythreshold for grb formation. we propose to use the computed probability as atool to identify high redshift grbs. by jointly considering promptly-availableinformation provided by swift and model results, we can select reliable z&gt;5candidates in a few hours from the bat detection. we test the procedure againstlast year swift data: only three bursts match all our requirements, two beingconfirmed at z&gt;5. other three possible candidates are picked up by slightlyrelaxing the adopted criteria. no low-z interloper is found among the sixcandidates.
