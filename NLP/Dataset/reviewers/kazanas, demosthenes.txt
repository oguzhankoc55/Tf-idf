0901.2858	qpos from random x-ray bursts around rotating black holes	we continue our earlier studies of quasi-periodic oscillations (qpos) in thepower spectra of accreting, rapidly-rotating black holes that originate fromthe geometric "light echoes" of x-ray flares occurring within the black holeergosphere. our present work extends our previous treatment tothree-dimensional photon emission and orbits to allow for arbitrary latitudesin the positions of the distant observers and the x-ray sources in place of themainly equatorial positions and photon orbits of the earlier consideration.following the trajectories of a large number of photons we calculate theresponse functions of a given geometry and use them to produce model lightcurves which we subsequently analyze to compute their power spectra andautocorrelation functions. in the case of an optically-thin environment,relevant to advection-dominated accretion flows, we consistently find qpos atfrequencies of order of ~khz for stellar-mass black hole candidates while orderof ~mhz for typical active galactic nuclei (~10^7 msun) for a wide range ofviewing angles (30 to 80deg) from x-ray sources predominantly concentratedtoward the equator within the ergosphere. as in our previous treatment, heretoo, the qpo signal is produced by the frame-dragging of the photons by therapidly-rotating black hole, which results in photon "bunches" separated byconstant time-lags, the result of multiple photon orbits around the hole. ourmodel predicts for various source/observer configurations the robust presenceof a new class of qpos, which is inevitably generic to curved spacetimestructure in rotating black hole systems.

0706.3187	simulations of the poynting--robertson cosmic battery in resistive  accretion disks	we describe the results of numerical "2.5--dimensional" mhd simulations of aninitially unmagnetized disk model orbiting a central point--mass and respondingto the continual generation of poloidal magnetic field due to a secular sourcethat emulates the poynting--robertson (pr) drag on electrons in the vicinity ofa luminous stellar or compact accreting object. the fluid in the disk and inthe surrounding hotter atmosphere has finite electrical conductivity and allowsfor the magnetic field to diffuse freely out of the areas where it isgenerated, while at the same time, the differential rotation of the disk twiststhe poloidal field and quickly induces a substantial toroidal--field component.the secular pr term has dual purpose in these simulations as the source of themagnetic field and the trigger of a magnetorotational instability (mri) in thedisk. the mri is especially mild and does not destroy the disk because a smallamount of resistivity dampens the instability efficiently. in simulations withmoderate resistivities (diffusion timescales up to $\sim$16 local dynamicaltimes) and after $\sim$100 orbits, the mri has managed to transfer outwardsubstantial amounts of angular momentum and the inner edge of the disk, alongwith azimuthal magnetic flux, has flowed toward the central point--mass where anew, magnetized, nuclear disk has formed. the toroidal field in this nucleardisk is amplified by differential rotation and it cannot be contained; when itapproaches equipartition, it unwinds vertically and produces episodic jet--likeoutflows. the poloidal field in the inner region cannot diffuse back out if thecharacteristic diffusion time is of the order of or larger than the dynamicaltime; it continues to grow linearly in time undisturbed and without saturation,as the outer sections of many poloidal loops are being drawn radially outward.

0706.3205	exact solutions of the isothermal lane--emden equation with rotation and  implications for the formation of planets and satellites	we have derived exact solutions of the isothermal lane--emden equation withand without rotation in a cylindrical geometry. the corresponding hydrostaticequilibria are most relevant to the dynamics of the protosolar nebula beforeand during the stages of planet and satellite formation. the nonrotatingsolution for the mass density is analytic, nonsingular, monotonicallydecreasing with radius, and it satisfies easily the usual physical boundaryconditions at the center. when differential rotation is added to thelane--emden equation, an entire class of exact solutions for the mass densityappears. we have determined all of these solutions analytically as well. withinthis class, solutions that are power laws or combinations of power laws are notcapable of satisfying the associated boundary--value problem, but they arenonetheless of profound importance because they constitute "baselines" to whichthe actual solutions approach when the central boundary conditions are imposed.numerical integrations that enforce such physical boundary conditions show thatthe actual radial equilibrium density profiles emerge from the center close tothe nonrotating solution, but once they cross below the correspondingbaselines, they cease to be monotonic. the actual solutions are forced tooscillate permanently about the baseline solutions without ever settling ontothem because the central boundary conditions strictly prohibit such settling,even in the asymptotic regime of large radii. based on our results, we expectthat quasistatically--evolving protoplanetary disks should develop oscillatorydensity profiles in their midplanes during their isothermal phase. the peaks inthese profiles correspond to local potential minima and their locations areideal sites for the formation of protoplanets ...

0907.3619	the invariant twist of magnetic fields in the relativistic jets of  active galactic nuclei	the origin of cosmic magnetic (b) fields remains an open question. it isgenerally believed that very weak primordial b fields are amplified by dynamoprocesses, but it appears unlikely that the amplification proceeds fast enoughto account for the fields presently observed in galaxies and galaxy clusters.in an alternative scenario, cosmic b fields are generated near the inner edgesof accretion disks in active galactic nuclei (agns) by azimuthal electriccurrents due to the difference between the plasma electron and ion velocitiesthat arises when the electrons are retarded by interactions with photons. whiledynamo processes show no preference for the polarity of the (presumably random)seed field that they amplify, this alternative mechanism uniquely relates thepolarity of the poloidal b field to the angular velocity of the accretion disk,resulting in a unique direction for the toroidal b field induced by diskrotation. observations of the toroidal fields of 29 agn jets revealed byparsec-scale faraday rotation measurements show a clear asymmetry that isconsistent with this model, with the probability that this asymmetry came aboutby chance being less than 1%. this lends support to the hypothesis that theuniverse is seeded by b fields that are generated in agn via this mechanism andsubsequently injected into intergalactic space by the jet outflows.

0707.2028	mass outflows from dissipative shocks in hot accretion flows	we consider stationary, axisymmetric hydrodynamic accretion flows in kerrgeometry. as a plausible means of efficiently separating a small population ofnonthermal particles from the bulk accretion flows, we investigate theformation of standing dissipative shocks, i.e. shocks at which fraction of theenergy, angular momentum and mass fluxes do not participate in the shocktransition of the flow that accretes onto the compact object but are lost intocollimated (jets) or uncollimated (winds) outflows. the mass loss fraction (ata shock front) is found to vary over a wide range (0 - 95%) depending on flow'sangular momentum and energy. on the other hand, the associated energy lossfraction appears to be relatively low (&lt;1%) for a flow onto a non-rotatingblack hole case, whereas the fraction could be an order of magnitude higher(&lt;10%) for a flow onto a rapidly-rotating black hole. by estimating the escapevelocity of the outflowing particles with a mass-accretion rate relevant fortypical active galactic nuclei, we find that nearly 10% of the accreting masscould escape to form an outflow in a disk around a non-rotating black hole,while as much as 50% of the matter may contribute to outflows in a disk arounda rapidly-rotating black hole. in the context of disk-jet paradigm, our modelsuggests that shock-driven outflows from accretion can occur in regions not toofar from a central engine. our results imply that a shock front under someconditions could serve as a plausible site where (nonthermal) seed particles ofthe outflows (jets/winds) are efficiently decoupled from bulk accretion.

0910.3001	mhd accretion-disk winds as x-ray absorbers in agns	we present the 2d ionization structure of self-similar mhd winds offaccretion disks around irradiated by a central x-ray source. based on earlierobservational clues and theoretical arguments, we focus our attention on asubset of these winds, namely those with radial density dependence n(r)~1/r. weemploy the photoionization code xstar to compute the ionic abundances of alarge number of ions of different elements and then compile their line-of-sight(los) absorption columns. particular attention is paid to the absorptionmeasure distribution (amd), namely their hydrogen-equivalent column perlogarithmic ionization parameter \xi interval, d n_h/(d \log \xi), whichprovides a measure of the winds' radial density profiles. for n(r)~1/r the amdis found to be independent of \xi, in good agreement with its behavior inferredfrom the x-ray spectra of several agns. for the specific wind structure andx-ray spectrum we also compute detailed absorption line profiles for a numberof ions to obtain their los velocities, v~100-300 km/sec (at \log \xi~2-3) forfe xvii and v~1,000-4,000 km/sec (at \log \xi~4-5) for fe xxv, in goodagreement with the observation. our models describe the x-ray absorptionproperties of these winds with only two parameters, namely the mass-accretionrate \dot{m} and los angle \theta. the probability of obscuration of the x-rayionizing source in these winds decreases with increasing \dot{m} and increasessteeply with \theta. as such, we concur with previous authors that these windconfigurations, viewed globally, incorporate all the requisite properties ofthe parsec scale "torii" invoked in agn unification schemes. we indicate that acombination of the amd and absorption line profile observations can uniquelydetermine these model parameters and their bearing on agn populationdemographics.

0708.2360	can gravitational collapse sustain singularity-free trapped surfaces?	in singularity generating spacetimes both the out-going and in-goingexpansions of null geodesic congruences $\theta ^{+}$ and $\theta ^{-}$ shouldbecome increasingly negative without bound, inside the horizon. this behaviorleads to geodetic incompleteness which in turn predicts the existence of asingularity. in this work we inquire on whether, in gravitational collapse,spacetime can sustain singularity-free trapped surfaces, in the sense that sucha spacetime remains geodetically complete. as a test case, we consider a wellknown solution of the einstien field equations which is schwarzschild-like atlarge distances and consists of a fluid with a $p=-\rho $ equation of statenear $r=0$. by following both the expansion parameters $\theta ^{+}$ and$\theta ^{-}$ across the horizon and into the black hole we find that both$\theta ^{+}$ and $\theta ^{+}\theta ^{-}$ have turning points inside thetrapped region. further, we find that deep inside the black hole there is aregion $0\leq r&lt;r_{0}$ (that includes the black hole center) which is nottrapped. thus the trapped region is bounded both from outside and inside. thespacetime is geodetically complete, a result which violates a condition forsingularity formation. it is inferred that in general if gravitational collapsewere to proceed with a $p=-\rho $ fluid formation, the resulting black hole maybe singularity-free.

0704.2159	accretion disk illumination in schwarzschild and kerr geometries:  fitting formulae	we describe the methodology and compute the illumination of geometricallythin accretion disks around black holes of arbitrary spin parameter $a$ exposedto the radiation of a point-like, isotropic source at arbitrary height abovethe disk on its symmetry axis. we then provide analytic fitting formulae forthe illumination as a function of the source height $h$ and the black holeangular momentum $a$. we find that for a source on the disk symmetry axis and$h/m &gt; 3$, the main effect of the parameter $a$ is allowing the disk to extendto smaller radii (approaching $r/m \to 1$ as $a/m \to 1$) and thus allow theillumination of regions of much higher rotational velocity and redshift. wealso compute the illumination profiles for anisotropic emission associated withthe motion of the source relative to the accretion disk and present thefractions of photons absorbed by the black hole, intercepted by the disk orescaping to infinity for both isotropic and anisotropic emission for $a/m=0$and $a/m=0.99$. as the anisotropy (of a source approaching the disk) increasesthe illumination profile reduces (approximately) to a single power-law, whoseindex, $q$, because of absorption of the beamed photons by the black hole,saturates to a value no higher than $q \gtrsim 3$. finally, we compute thefluorescence fe line profiles associated with the specific illumination andcompare them among various cases.

1009.5644	modeling high-velocity qso absorbers with photoionized mhd disk-winds	we extend our modeling of the ionization structure of magnetohydrodynamic(mhd) accretion-disk winds, previously applied to seyfert galaxies, to apopulation of quasi-stellar-objects (qsos) of much lower x-ray-to-uv fluxratios, i.e. smaller $\alpha_{\rm ox}$ index, motivated by uv/x-ray ionizedabsorbers with extremely high outflow velocities in uv-luminous qsos. wedemonstrate that magnetically-driven winds ionized by a spectrum with$\alpha_{\rm ox} \simeq -2$ can produce the charge states responsible for \civ~and \fexxv/\fexxvi ~absorption in wind regions with corresponding maximumvelocities of $v$(\civ) $\lsim 0.1c$ and $v({\rm \fexxv}) \lsim 0.6 c$ (where$c$ is the speed of light) and column densities $n_h \sim 10^{23}-10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$, in general agreement with observations. in contrast to theconventional radiation-driven wind models, {\it high-velocity flows are alwayspresent in our mhd-driven winds} but manifest in the absorption spectra onlyfor $\alpha_{\rm ox} \lsim -2$, as larger $\alpha_{\rm ox}$ values ionize thewind completely out to radii too large to demonstrate the presence of thesehigh velocities. we thus predict increasing velocities of these ionizedabsorbers with decreasing (steeper) $\alpha_{\rm ox}$, a quantity that emergesas the defining parameter in the kinematics of the agn uv/x-ray absorbers.

1108.2138	toward a realistic pulsar magnetosphere	we present the magnetic and electric field structures as well as the currentsand charge densities of pulsar magnetospheres which do not obey the idealcondition, ${\bf e \cdot b =0}$. since the acceleration of particles and theproduction of radiation requires the presence of an electric field componentparallel to the magnetic field, ${\bf e}_\parallel$, the structure of non-idealpulsar magnetospheres is intimately related to the production of pulsarradiation. therefore, knowledge of the structure of non-ideal pulsarmagnetospheres is important because their comparison (including models for theproduction of radiation) with observations will delineate the physics and theparameters underlying the pulsar radiation problem. we implement a variety ofprescriptions that support nonzero values for ${\bf e}_\parallel$ and exploretheir effects on the structure of the resulting magnetospheres. we producefamilies of solutions that span the entire range between the vacuum and the(ideal) force-free electrodynamic solutions. we also compute the amount ofdissipation as a fraction of the poynting flux for pulsars of different anglesbetween the rotation and magnetic axes and conclude that this is at most 20-40%(depending on the non-ideal prescription) in the aligned rotator and 10% in theperpendicular one. we present also the limiting solutions with the property$j=\rho c$ and discuss their possible implication on the determination of the"on/off" states of the intermittent pulsars. finally, we find that solutionswith values of $j$ greater than those needed to null ${\bf e}_\parallel$locally produce oscillations, potentially observable in the data.

1206.5022	toward a unified agn structure	we present a unified model for the structure and appearance of accretionpowered sources across their entire luminosity range from galactic x-raybinaries to luminous quasars, with emphasis on agn and their phenomenology.central to this model is the notion of mhd winds launched from the accretiondisks that power these objects. these winds provide the matter that manifestsas blueshifted absorption features in the uv and x-ray spectra of a largefraction of these sources; furthermore, their density distribution in thepoloidal plane determines the "appearance" (i.e. the column and velocitystructure of these absorption features) as a function of the observerinclination angle. this work focuses on just the broadest characteristics ofthese objects; nonetheless, it provides scaling laws that allow one toreproduce within this model the properties of objects spanning a very wideluminosity range and viewed at different inclination angles, and trace them toa common underlying dynamical structure. its general conclusion is that the agnphenomenology can be accounted for in terms of three parameters: the wind massflux in units of the eddington value, $\dot m$, the observer's inclinationangle $\theta$ and the logarithmic slope between the o/uv and x-ray fluxes$\alpha_{ox}$. however, because of a significant correlation between$\alpha_{ox}$ and uv luminosity, we conclude that the agn structure depends ononly two parameters. interestingly, the correlations implied by this modelappear to extend to and consistent with the characteristics of galactic x-raysources, suggesting the presence of a truly unified underlying structure foraccretion powered sources.

1208.1680	luminosity correlations for gamma-ray bursts and implications for their  prompt and afterglow emission mechanisms	we present the relation between the ($z-$ and $k-$corrected) spectral lags,$\tau$, for the standard swift energy bands 50-100 kev and 100-200 kev and thepeak isotropic luminosity, $l_{\mathrm{iso}}$ (a relation reported first bynorris et al.), for a subset of 12 long swift grbs taken from a recent study ofthis relation by ukwatta et al. the chosen grbs are also a subset of thedainotti et al. sample, a set of swift grbs of known redshift, employed inestablishing a relation between the (grb frame) luminosity, $l_x$, of theshallow (or constant) flux portion of the typical xrt grb-afterglow light curveand the (grb frame) time of transition to the normal decay rate,$t_{\mathrm{brk}}$. we also present the $l_x-t_{\mathrm{brk}}$ relation usingonly the bursts common in the two samples. the two relations exhibit asignificant degree of correlation ($\rho = -0.65$ for the$l_{\mathrm{iso}}-\tau$ and $\rho = -0.88$ for the $l_{x} - t_{\mathrm{brk}}$relation) and have surprisingly similar best-fit power law indices ($-1.19 \pm0.17$ for $l_{\mathrm{iso}}-\tau$ and $-1.10 \pm 0.03$ for $l_{x} -t_{\mathrm{brk}}$). even more surprisingly, we noted that although $\tau$ and$t_{\mathrm{brk}}$ represent different grb time variables, it appears that thefirst relation ($l_{\mathrm{iso}}-\tau$) extrapolates into the second one fortimescales $\tau \simeq t_{\mathrm{brk}}$. this fact suggests that these tworelations have a common origin, which we conjecture to be kinematic. thisrelation adds to the recently discovered relations between properties of theprompt and afterglow grb phases, indicating a much more intimate relationbetween these two phases than hitherto considered.

1209.2053	a method for localizing energy dissipation in blazars using fermi  variability	the distance of the fermi-detected blazar gamma-ray emission site from thesupermassive black hole is a matter of active debate. here we present a methodfor testing if the gev emission of powerful blazars is produced within thesub-pc scale broad line region (blr) or farther out in the pc-scale moleculartorus (mt) environment. if the gev emission takes place within the blr, theinverse compton (ic) scattering of the blr ultraviolet (uv) seed photons thatproduces the gamma-rays takes place at the onset of the klein-nishina regime.this causes the electron cooling time to become practically energy independentand the variation of the gamma-ray emission to be almost achromatic. if on theother hand the gamma-ray emission is produced farther out in the pc-scale mt,the ic scattering of the infrared (ir) mt seed photons that produces thegamma-rays takes place in the thomson regime, resulting to energy-dependentelectron cooling times, manifested as faster cooling times for higher fermienergies. we demonstrate these characteristics and discuss the applicabilityand limitations of our method.

0712.1084	light echoes in kerr geometry: a source of high frequency qpos from  random x-ray bursts	we propose that high frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (hfqpos) can beproduced from randomly-formed x-ray bursts (flashes) by plasma interior to theergosphere of a rapidly-rotating black hole. we show by direct computation oftheir orbits that the photons comprising the observed x-ray light curves, ifdue to a multitude of such flashes, are affected significantly by the blackhole's dragging of inertial frames; the photons of each such burst arrive to anobserver at infinity in multiple (double or triple), distinct "bunches"separated by a roughly constant time lag of t/m~14, regardless of the bursts'azimuthal position. we argue that every other such "bunch" represents photonsthat follow trajectories with an additional orbit around the black hole at thephoton circular orbit radius (a photon "echo"). the presence of this constantlag in the response function of the system leads to a qpo feature in its powerdensity spectra, even though the corresponding light curve consists of atotally stochastic signal. this effect is by and large due to the black holespin and is shown to gradually diminish as the spin parameter a decreases orthe radial position of the burst moves outside the static limit surface(ergosphere). our calculations indicate that for a black hole with kerrparameter of a/m=0.99 and mass of m=10*msun the qpo is expected at a frequencyof ~ 1.3-1.4 khz. we discuss the plausibility and observational implications ofour model/results as well as its limitations.

1309.0568	the supercritical pile gamma-ray burst model: the grb afterglow  steep-decline-and-plateau phase	we present a process that accounts for the steep-decline-and-plateau phase ofthe swift-xrt light curves, vexing features of grb phenomenology. this processis an integral part of the "supercritical pile" grb model, proposed a few yearsago to provide an account for the conversion of the grb kinetic energy intoradiation with a spectral peak at $e_{\rm pk} \sim m_ec^2$. we compute theevolution of the relativistic blast wave (rbw) lorentz factor $\gamma$ to showthat the radiation--reaction force due to the grb emission can produce anabrupt, small ($\sim 25%$) decrease in $\gamma$ at a radius which is smaller(depending on conditions) than the deceleration radius $r_d$. because of thisreduction, the kinematic criticality criterion of the "supercritical pile" isno longer fulfilled. transfer of the proton energy into electrons ceases, andthe grb enters abruptly the afterglow phase at a luminosity smaller by $\simm_p/m_e$ than that of the prompt emission. if the radius at which thisslow-down occurs is significantly smaller than $r_d$, the rbw internal energycontinues to drive the rbw expansion at a constant (new) $\gamma$, and itsx-ray luminosity remains constant until $r_d$ is reached, at which point itresumes its more conventional decay, thereby completing the "unexpected" xrtlight curve phase. if this transition occurs at $r \simeq r_d$, the steepdecline is followed by a flux decrease instead of a "plateau", consistent withthe conventional afterglow declines. besides providing an account of thesepeculiarities, the model suggests that the afterglow phase may in fact beginbefore the rbw reaches $r \simeq r_d$, thus introducing novel insights into thegrb phenomenology.

1310.3545	gamma-ray emission in dissipative pulsar magnetospheres: from theory to  fermi observations	we compute the patterns of $\gamma$-ray emission due to curvature radiationin dissipative pulsar magnetospheres. our ultimate goal is to constructmacrophysical models that are able to reproduce the observed $\gamma$-raylight-curve phenomenology recently published in the second fermi pulsarcatalog. we apply specific forms of ohm's law on the open field lines using abroad range for the macroscopic conductivity values that result in solutionsranging, from near-vacuum to near force-free. using these solutions, wegenerate model $\gamma$-ray light curves by calculating realistic trajectoriesand lorentz factors of radiating particles, under the influence of both theaccelerating electric fields and curvature radiation-reaction. we furtherconstrain our models using the observed dependence of the phase-lags betweenthe radio and $\gamma$-ray emission on the $\gamma$-ray peak-separation. weperform a statistical comparison of our model radio-lag vs peak-separationdiagram and the one obtained for the fermi standard pulsars. we find that formodels of uniform conductivity over the entire open magnetic field line region,agreement with observations favors higher values of this parameter. we find,however, significant improvement in fitting the data with models that employ ahybrid form of conductivity; specifically, infinite conductivity interior tothe light-cylinder and high but finite conductivity on the outside. in thesemodels the $\gamma$-ray emission is produced in regions near the equatorialcurrent sheet but modulated by the local physical properties. these models haveradio-lags near the observed values and statistically best reproduce theobserved light-curve phenomenology. additionally, these models produce gevphoton cut-off energies.

1310.4931	a new standard pulsar magnetosphere	in view of recent efforts to probe the physical conditions in the pulsarcurrent sheet, we revisit the standard solution that describes the mainelements of the ideal force-free pulsar magnetosphere. the simple physicalrequirement that the electric current contained in the current layer consistsof the local electric charge moving outward at close to the speed of light,yields a new standard solution for the pulsar magnetosphere everywhere idealforce-free except in the current layer. the main elements of the new solutionare a) the pulsar spindown rate of the aligned rotator is 23% times larger thanthat of the orthogonal vacuum rotator, b) only 60% of the magnetic flux thatcrosses the light cylinder opens up to infinity, c) the electric current closesalong the other 40% which gradually converges to the equator, d) this transfers40% of the total pulsar spindown energy flux in the equatorial current sheetwhich is then dissipated in the acceleration of particles and in high-energyelectromagnetic radiation, e) there is no separatrix current layer. oursolution is a minimum free-parameter solution in that the equatorial currentlayer is electrostatically supported against collapse and thus does not requirea thermal particle population. in that respect, it is one more step toward thedevelopment of a new standard solution. we discuss the implications forintermittent pulsars and long duration gamma-ray bursts. we conclude that thephysical conditions in the equatorial current layer determine the globalstructure of the pulsar magnetosphere.

1510.05534	the case against dark matter and modified gravity: flat rotation curves  are a rigorous requirement in rotating self-gravitating newtonian gaseous  disks	by solving analytically the various types of lane-emden equations withrotation, we have discovered two new coupled fundamental properties ofrotating, self-gravitating, gaseous disks in equilibrium: isothermal disksmust, on average, exhibit strict power-law density profiles in radius $x$ ontheir equatorial planes of the form $a x^{k-1}$, where $a$ and $k-1$ are theintegration constants, and "flat" rotation curves precisely such as thoseobserved in spiral galaxy disks. polytropic disks must, on average, exhibitstrict density profiles of the form $\left[\ln(a x^k)\right]^n$, where $n$ isthe polytropic index, and "flat" rotation curves described by square roots ofupper incomplete gamma functions. by "on average," we mean that, irrespectiveof the chosen boundary conditions, the actual profiles must oscillate aroundand remain close to the strict mean profiles of the analytic singularequilibrium solutions. we call such singular solutions the "intrinsic"solutions of the differential equations because they are demanded by thesecond-order equations themselves with no regard to the cauchy problem. theresults are directly applicable to gaseous galaxy disks that have long beenknown to be isothermal and to protoplanetary disks during the extendedisothermal and adiabatic phases of their evolution. in galactic gas dynamics,they have the potential to resolve the dark matter--modified gravitycontroversy in a sweeping manner, as they render both of these hypothesesunnecessary. in protoplanetary disk research, they provide observers withpowerful new probing tool, as they predict a clear and simple connectionbetween the radial density profiles and the rotation curves of self-gravitatingdisks in their very early (pre-class 0 and perhaps the youngest class youngstellar objects) phases of evolution.

astro-ph;0101020	exact expressions for the critical mach numbers in the two-fluid model  of cosmic-ray modified shocks	the acceleration of relativistic particles due to repeated scattering acrossa shock wave remains the most attractive model for the production of energeticcosmic rays. this process has been analyzed extensively during the past twodecades using the ``two-fluid'' model of diffusive shock acceleration. it iswell known that 1, 2, or 3 distinct solutions for the flow structure can befound depending on the upstream parameters. the precise nature of the criticalconditions delineating the number and character of shock transitions hasremained unclear, mainly due to the inappropriate choice of parameters used inthe determination of the upstream boundary conditions. we derive the exactcritical conditions by reformulating the upstream boundary conditions in termsof two individual mach numbers defined with respect to the cosmic-ray and gassound speeds, respectively. the gas and cosmic-ray adiabatic indices areassumed to remain constant throughout the flow, although they may havearbitrary, independent values. our results provide for the first time acomplete, analytical classification of the parameter space of shock transitionsin the two-fluid model. when multiple solutions are possible, we propose usingthe associated entropy distributions as a means for indentifying the moststable configuration.

astro-ph;0110183	towards resolving the crab $\sigma-$problem: a linear accelerator?	using the exact solution of the axisymmetric pulsar magnetosphere derived ina previous publication and the conservation laws of the associated mhd flow, weshow that the lorentz factor of the outflowing plasma increases linearly withdistance from the light cylinder. therefore, the ratio of the poynting toparticle energy flux, generically referred to as $\sigma$, decreases inverselyproportional to distance, from a large value (typically $\gsim 10^4$)near thelight cylinder to $\s \simeq 1$ at a transistion distance $r_{\rm trans}$.beyond this distance the inertial effects of the outflowing plasma becomeimportant and the magnetic field geometry must deviate from the almostmonopolar form it attains between $r_{lc}$ and $r_{\rm trans}$. we anticipatethat this is achieved by collimation of the poloidal field lines toward therotation axis, ensuring that the magnetic field pressure in the equatorialregion will fall-off faster than $1/r^2$ ($r$ being the cylindrical radius).this leads both to a value $\s=\ss \ll 1$ at the nebular reverse shock atdistance $r_s$ ($r_s \gg r_{\rm trans}$) and to a component of the flowperpendicular to the equatorial component, as required by observation. thepresence of the strong shock at $r = r_s$ allows for the efficient conversionof kinetic energy into radiation. we speculate that the crab pulsar is uniquein requiring $\ss \simeq 3 \times 10^{-3}$ because of its small translationalvelocity, which allowed for the shock distance $r_s$ to grow to values $\ggr_{\rm trans}$.

astro-ph;0307404	decelerating flows in tev blazars: a resolution to the bl lac -- fr i  unification problem	tev emission from bl lacertae (bl) objects is commonly modeled assynchrotron-self compton (ssc) radiation from relativistically movinghomogeneous plasma blobs. in the context of these models, the blob lorentzfactors needed to reproduce the corrected for absorption by the diffuse irbackground (dirb) tev emission are large ($\delta \gtrsim 50$). the main reasonfor this is that stronger beaming eases the problem of the lack of $\sim$ ir-uvsynchrotron seed photons needed to produce the de-absorbed $\sim $ few tev peakof the spectral energy distribution (sed). however, such high doppler factorsare in strong disagreement with the unified scheme, according to which bls arefr i radio galaxies with their jets closely aligned to the line of sight. here,motivated by the detection of sub-luminal velocities in the sub-pc scale jetsof the best studied tev blazars, mkn 421 and mkn 501, we examine thepossibility that the relativistic flows in the tev bls decelerate. in thiscase, the problem of the missing seed photons is solved because of upstreamcompton (uc) scattering, a process in which the upstream energetic electronsfrom the fast base of the flow `see' the synchrotron seed photons produced inthe slow part of the flow relativistically beamed. modest lorentz factors($\gamma \sim 15$), decelerating down to values compatible with the recentradio interferometric observations, reproduce the $\sim $ few tev peak energyof these sources. furthermore, such decelerating flows are shown to be inagreement with the bl - fr i unification, naturally reproducing the observedbl/fr i broad band luminosity ratios.

astro-ph;0311509	the "supercritical pile" model of grb: thresholds, polarization, time  lags	the essence of the ``supercritical pile'' model is a process for convertingthe energy stored in the relativistic protons of a relativistic blast wave(rbw) of lorentz factor $\gamma$ into electron -- positron pairs of similarlorentz factor, while at the same time emitting most of the grb luminosity atan energy $e_p \simeq 1$ mev. this is achieved by scattering the synchrotronradiation emitted by the rbw in an upstream located ``mirror'' and thenre-intercepting it by the rbw. the repeated scatterings of radiation betweenthe rbw and the ``mirror'', along with the threshold of the pair productionreaction $p \gamma \to p e^-e^+$, lead to a maximum in the grb luminosity at anenergy $e_p \simeq 1$ mev, {\sl independent of the value of $\gamma$}.furthermore, the same threshold implies that the prompt $\gamma-$ray emissionis only possible for $\gamma$ larger than a minimum value, thereby providing a``natural'' account for the termination of this stage of the grb as the rbwslows down. within this model the $\gamma-$ray ($e \sim 100$ kev -- 1 mev)emission process is due to inverse compton scattering and it is thus expectedto be highly polarized if viewed at angles $\theta \simeq 1/\gamma$ to therbw's direction of motion. finally, the model also predicts lags in the lightcurves of the lower energy photons with respect to those of higher energy;these are of purely kinematic origin and of magnitude $\delta t \simeq 10^{-2}$s, in agreement with observation.

astro-ph;0402317	witnessing the gradual slow-down of powerful extragalactic jets: the  x-ray -- optical -- radio connection	a puzzling feature of the {\it chandra}--detected quasar jets is that theirx-ray emission decreases faster along the jet than their radio emission,resulting to an outward increasing radio to x-ray ratio. in some sources thisbehavior is so extreme that the radio emission peak is located clearlydownstream of that of the x-rays. this is a rather unanticipated behavior giventhat the inverse  compton nature of the x-rays and the synchrotron radio emission areattributed to roughly the same electrons of the jet's non-thermal electrondistribution. in this note we show that this morphological behavior can resultfrom the gradual deceleration of a relativistic flow and that the offsets inpeak emission at different wavelengths carry the imprint of this deceleration.this notion is consistent with another recent finding, namely that the jetsfeeding the terminal hot spots of powerful radio galaxies and quasars are stillrelativistic with lorentz factors $\gamma \sim 2-3$. the picture of thekinematics of powerful jets emerging from these considerations is that theyremain relativistic as they gradually decelerate from kpc scales to the hotspots, where, in a final collision with the intergalactic medium, theyslow-down rapidly to the subrelativistic velocities of the hot spot advancespeed.

astro-ph;9805044	formation of relativistic outflows in shearing black hole accretion  coronae	we examine the possibility that the relativistic jets observed in many activegalactic nuclei may be powered by the fermi acceleration of protons in atenuous corona above a two-temperature accretion disk. in this picture theacceleration arises as a consequence of the shearing motion of the magneticfield in the corona, which is anchored in the underlying keplerian disk. theprotons in the corona have a power-law distribution because the density thereis too low for proton-proton collisions to thermalize the energy supplied viafermi acceleration. the same shear acceleration mechanism also operates in thedisk itself, however, there the density is high enough for thermalization tooccur and consequently the disk protons have a maxwellian distribution.particle acceleration in the corona leads to the development of apressure-driven wind that passes through a critical point and subsequentlytransforms into a relativistic jet at large distances from the black hole. wecombine the critical conditions for the wind with the structure equations forthe disk and the corona to obtain a coupled disk/corona/wind model. using thecoupled model we compute the asymptotic lorentz factor $\gamma_\infty$ of thejet as a function of the cylindrical starting radius at the base of theoutflow, in the corona. our results suggest that $\gamma_\infty \lapprox 10$,which is consistent with observations of superluminal motion in blazars. weshow that collisions between the jet and broad-line emission clouds can producehigh-energy radiation with a luminosity sufficient to power the $\gamma$-raysobserved from blazars.  subject headings: radiation mechanisms: non-thermal, accretion, accretiondisks, acceleration of particles, gamma rays: theory

astro-ph;9908279	magnetar spin-down	we examine the effects of a relativistic wind on the spin down of a neutronstar and apply our results to the study of soft gamma repeaters (sgrs), thoughtto be neutron stars with magnetic fields &gt; 10^{14} g. we derive a spin-downformula that includes torques from both dipole radiation and episodic orcontinuous particle winds. we find that if sgr1806-20 puts out a continuousparticle wind of 10^{37} {\rm erg} {\rm s}^{-1}, then the pulsar age isconsistent with that of the surrounding supernova remnant, but the derivedsurface dipole magnetic field is only 3 \times 10^{13} g, in the range ofnormal radio pulsars. if instead, the particle wind flows are episodic withsmall duty cycle, then the observed period derivatives imply magnetar-strengthfields, while still allowing characteristic ages within a factor of two of theestimated supernova remnant age. close monitoring of the periods of sgrs willbe able to establish or place limits on the wind duty cycle and thus themagnetic field and age of the neutron star.

astro-ph;9909359	thermal instability and photoionized x-ray reflection in accretion disks	we study the x-ray illumination of an accretion disk. we relax thesimplifying assumption of constant gas density used in most previous studies;instead we determine the density from hydrostatic balance. it is found that thethermal ionization instability prevents the illuminated gas from attainingtemperatures at which the gas is unstable. in particular, the uppermost layersof the x-ray illuminated gas are found to be almost completely ionized and atthe local compton temperature ($\sim 10^7 - 10^8$ k); at larger depths, the gastemperature drops abruptly to form a thin layer with $t\sim 10^6$ k, while atyet larger depths it decreases sharply to the disk effective temperature. wefind that most of the fe k$\alpha$ line emission and absorption edge areproduced in the coolest, deepest layers, while the fe atoms in the hottest,uppermost layers are generally almost fully ionized, hence making a negligiblecontribution to reprocessing features in $\sim 6.4-10$ kev energy range. weprovide a summary of how x-ray reprocessing features depend on parameters ofthe problem. the results of our self-consistent calculations are bothquantitatively and qualitatively different from those obtained using theconstant density assumption. therefore, we conclude that x-ray reflectioncalculations should always utilize hydrostatic balance in order to provide areliable theoretical interpretation of observed x-ray spectra of agn and gbhcs.

0811.0868	55 cancri: a laboratory for testing numerous conjectures about planet  formation	five planets are presently believed to orbit the primary star of 55 cnc, butthere exists a large 5 au gap in their distribution between the two outermostplanets. this gap has attracted considerable interest because it may containone or more lower--mass planets whose existence is not contradicted bylong-term orbit stability analyses, in fact it is expected according to the"packed planetary systems" hypothesis and an empirical titius--bode relationrecently proposed for 55 cnc. furthermore, the second largest planet is justthe second farthest and it orbits very close to the star. its orbit, the mostcircular of all, appears to be nearly but not quite commensurable with theorbit of the third planet, casting doubt that any migration or resonant captureof the inner planets has ever occurred and lending support to the idea of"in--situ" giant planet formation by the process of core accretion. all of theabove ideas will be tested in the coming years in this natural laboratory asmore observations will become available. this opportunity presents itself inconjunction with a physical model that relates the orbits of the observedplanets to the structure of the original protoplanetary disk that harboredtheir formation at the early stages of protostellar collapse. using only the 5observed planets of 55 cnc, this model predicts that the surface densityprofile of its protoplanetary disk varied with distance $r$ precisely as$\sigma (r)\propto r^{-3/2}$, as was also found for the minimum--mass solarnebula. despite this similarity, the disk of 55 cnc was smaller, heavier, andless rotationally supported than the solar nebula, so this system represents adifferent mode of multi--planet formation compared to our own solar system.

gr-qc;0506111	a non-singular black hole model as a possible end-product of  gravitational collapse	in this paper we present a non-singular black hole model as a possibleend-product of gravitational collapse. the depicted spacetime which is type[ii,(ii)], by petrov classification, is an exact solution of the einsteinequations and contains two horizons. the equation of state in the radialdirection, is a well-behaved function of the density and smoothly reproducesvacuum-like behavior near r=0 while tending to a polytrope at larger r, lowdensity, values. the final equilibrium configuration comprises of a desitter-like inner core surrounded by a family of 2-surfaces of matter fieldswith variable equation of state. the fields are all concentrated in thevicinity of the radial center r=0. the solution depicts a spacetime that isasymptotically schwarzschild at large r, while it becomes de sitter-like forvanishing r. possible physical interpretations of the macro-state of the blackhole interior in the model are offered. we find that the possible state admitstwo equally viable interpretations, namely either a quintessential intermediaryregion or a phase transition in which a two-fluid system is in both dynamic andthermodynamic equilibrium. we estimate the ratio of pure matter present to thetotal energy and in both (interpretations) cases find it to be virtually thesame, being 0.83. finally, the well-behaved dependence of the density andpressure on the radial coordinate provides some insight on dealing with theinformation loss paradox.
