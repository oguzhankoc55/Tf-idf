hep-th;0207228	on the construction of nonsingular pre-big-bang and ekpyrotic  cosmologies and the resulting density perturbations	we consider the construction of nonsingular pre-big-bang and ekpyrotic typecosmological models realized by the addition to the action of specifichigher-order terms stemming from quantum corrections. we study models involvinggeneral relativity coupled to a single scalar field with a potential motivatedby the ekpyrotic scenario. we find that the inclusion of the string loop andquantum correction terms in the string frame makes it possible to obtainsolutions of the variational equations which are nonsingular and bouncing inthe einstein frame, even when a negative exponential potential is present, asis the case in the ekpyrotic scenario. we analyze the spectra of perturbationsproduced during the bouncing phase and find that the spectrum of curvaturefluctuations in the model proposed originally to implement the ekpyroticscenario has a large blue tilt ($n_r= 3$). except for instabilities introducedon small scales, the result agrees with what is obtained by imposing continuityof the induced metric and of the extrinsic curvature across a constant scalarfield (up to $k^2$ corrections equal to the constant energy density) matchingsurface between the contracting and the expanding einstein universes. we alsodiscuss nonsingular cosmological solutions obtained when a gauss-bonnet termwith a coefficient suitably dependent on the scalar matter field is added tothe action in the einstein frame with a potential for the scalar field present.

hep-th;0608178	string-inspired cosmology: late time transition from scaling matter era  to dark energy universe caused by a gauss-bonnet coupling	the gauss-bonnet (gb) curvature invariant coupled to a scalar field $\phi$can lead to an exit from a scaling matter-dominated epoch to a late-timeaccelerated expansion, which is attractive to alleviate the coincident problemof dark energy. we derive the condition for the existence of cosmologicalscaling solutions in the presence of the gb coupling for a general scalar-fieldlagrangian density $p(\phi, x)$, where $x=-(1/2)(\nabla \phi)^2$ is a kinematicterm of the scalar field. the gb coupling and the lagrangian density arerestricted to be in the form $f(\phi) \propto e^{\lambda \phi}$ and $p=xg(xe^{\lambda \phi})$, respectively, where $\lambda$ is a constant and $g$ is anarbitrary function. we also derive fixed points for such a scaling lagrangianwith a gb coupling $f(\phi) \propto e^{\mu \phi}$ and clarify the conditionsunder which the scaling matter era is followed by a de-sitter solution whichcan appear in the presence of the gb coupling. among scaling models proposed inthe current literature, we find that the models which allow such a cosmologicalevolution are an ordinary scalar field with an exponential potential and atachyon field with an inverse square potential, although the latter requires acoupling between dark energy and dark matter.

0901.3226	chameleon scalar fields in relativistic gravitational backgrounds	we study the field profile of a scalar field $\phi$ that couples to a matterfluid (dubbed a chameleon field) in the relativistic gravitational backgroundof a spherically symmetric spacetime. employing a linear expansion in terms ofthe gravitational potential $\phi_c$ at the surface of a compact object with aconstant density, we derive the thin-shell field profile both inside andoutside the object, as well as the resulting effective coupling with matter,analytically. we also carry out numerical simulations for the class of inversepower-law potentials $v(\phi)=m^{4+n} \phi^{-n}$ by employing the informationprovided by our analytical solutions to set the boundary conditions around thecentre of the object and show that thin-shell solutions in fact exist if thegravitational potential $\phi_c$ is smaller than 0.3, which marginally coversthe case of neutron stars. thus the chameleon mechanism is present in therelativistic gravitational backgrounds, capable of reducing the effectivecoupling. since thin-shell solutions are sensitive to the choice of boundaryconditions, our analytic field profile is very helpful to provide appropriateboundary conditions for $\phi_c \lesssim o(0.1)$.

1304.1961	quintessence: a review	quintessence is a canonical scalar field introduced to explain the late-timecosmic acceleration. the cosmological dynamics of quintessence is reviewed,paying particular attention to the evolution of the dark energy equation ofstate w. for the field potentials having tracking and thawing properties, theevolution of w can be known analytically in terms of a few model parameters.using the analytic expression of w, we constrain quintessence models from theobservations of supernovae type ia, cosmic microwave background, and baryonacoustic oscillations. the tracking freezing models are hardly distinguishablefrom the lcdm model, whereas in thawing models the today's field equation ofstate is constrained to be w_0&lt;-0.7 (95 % cl). we also derive an analyticformula for the growth rate of matter density perturbations in dynamical darkenergy models, which allows a possibility to put further bounds on w from themeasurement of redshift-space distortions in the galaxy power spectrum. finallywe review particle physics models of quintessence- such as those motivated bysupersymmetric theories. the field potentials of thawing models based on apseudo-nambu-goldstone boson or on extended supergravity theories have a niceproperty that a tiny mass of quintessence can be protected against radiativecorrections.

1402.0553	effective field theory of modified gravity with two scalar fields: dark  energy and dark matter	we present a framework for discussing the cosmology of dark energy and darkmatter based on two scalar degrees of freedom. an effective field theory ofcosmological perturbations is employed. a unitary gauge choice renders the darkenergy field into the gravitational sector, for which we adopt a genericlagrangian depending on three-dimensional geometrical scalar quantities arisingin the adm decomposition. we add to this dark-energy associated gravitationalsector a scalar field $\phi$ and its kinetic energy $x$ as dark mattervariables. compared to the single-field case, we find that there are additionalconditions to obey in order to keep the equations of motion for linearcosmological perturbations at second order. for such a second-order multi-fieldtheory we derive conditions under which ghosts and laplacian instabilities ofthe scalar and tensor perturbations are absent. we apply our general results tomodels with dark energy emerging in the framework of the horndeski theory anddark matter described by a k-essence lagrangian $p(\phi,x)$. we derive theeffective coupling between such an imperfect-fluid dark matter and thegravitational sector under the quasi-static approximation on sub-horizonscales. by considering the purely kinetic lagrangian $p(x)$ as a particularcase, the formalism is verified to reproduce the gravitational coupling of aperfect-fluid dark matter.

1402.4613	cosmological perturbations and observational constraints on nonlocal  massive gravity	nonlocal massive gravity can provide an interesting explanation for thelate-time cosmic acceleration, with a dark energy equation of state $w_{\rmde}$ smaller than $-1$ in the past. we derive the equations of linearcosmological perturbations to confront such models with the observations oflarge-scale structures. the effective gravitational coupling to nonrelativisticmatter associated with galaxy clusterings is close to newton's gravitationalconstant $g$ for a mass scale $m$ slightly smaller than today's hubbleparameter $h_0$. taking into account the background expansion history as wellas the evolution of matter perturbations $\delta_m$, we test for these modelswith type ia supernovae (snia) from union 2.1, the cosmic microwave background(cmb) measurements from planck, a collection of baryon acoustic oscillations(bao), and the growth rate data of $\delta_m$. using a higher value of $h_0$derived from its direct measurement ($h_0 \gtrsim 70$ km s$^{-1}$ mpc$^{-1}$)the data strongly support the nonlocal massive gravity model ($-1.1 \lesssimw_{\rm de} \lesssim -1.04$ in the past) over the $\lambda$cdm model ($w_{\rmde}=-1$), whereas for a lower prior (67 km s$^{-1}$ mpc$^{-1}$ $\lesssim$ $h_0\lesssim 70$ km s$^{-1}$ mpc$^{-1}$) the two models are statisticallycomparable.

1406.1369	implications of the b-mode polarization measurement for direct detection  of inflationary gravitational waves	the prospects for direct measurements of inflationary gravitational waves bynext generation interferometric detectors inferred from the possible detectionof b-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background are studied. wecompute the spectra of the gravitational wave background and thesignal-to-noise ratios by two interferometric detectors (decigo and bbo) forlarge-field inflationary models in which the tensor-to-scalar ratio is greaterthan the order of 0.01. if the reheating temperature $t_{\rm rh}$ of chaoticinflation with the quadratic potential is high ($t_{\rm rh}&gt;7.9\times10^6$ gevfor upgraded decigo and $t_{\rm rh}&gt; 1.8\times 10^{6}$ gev for bbo), it will bepossible to reach the sensitivity of the gravitational background in futureexperiments at $3\sigma$ confidence level. the direct detection is alsopossible for natural inflation with the potential $v(\phi)=\lambda^4[1-\cos(\phi/f)]$, provided that $f&gt;4.2 m_{\rm pl}$ (upgraded decigo) and$f&gt;3.6 m_{\rm pl}$ (bbo) with $t_{\rm rh}$ higher than $10^8$ gev. the quarticpotential $v(\phi)=\lambda \phi^4/4$ with a non-minimal coupling $\xi$ betweenthe inflaton field $\phi$ and the ricci scalar $r$ gives rise to a detectablelevel of gravitational waves for $|\xi|$ smaller than the order of 0.01,irrespective of the reheating temperature.

1503.06539	observational signatures of the theories beyond horndeski	in the approach of the effective field theory of modified gravity, we derivethe equations of motion for linear perturbations in the presence of abarotropic perfect fluid on the flat isotropic cosmological background. in asimple version of gleyzes-langlois-piazza-vernizzi (glpv) theories, which isthe minimum extension of horndeski theories, we show that a slight deviation ofthe tensor propagation speed squared $c_{\rm t}^2$ from 1 generally leads tothe large modification to the propagation speed squared $c_{\rm s}^2$ of ascalar degree of freedom $\phi$. this problem persists whenever the kineticenergy $\rho_x$ of the field $\phi$ is much smaller than the background energydensity $\rho_m$, which is the case for most of dark energy models in theasymptotic past. since the scaling solution characterized by the constant ratio$\rho_x/\rho_m$ is one way out for avoiding such a problem, we study theevolution of perturbations for a scaling dark energy model in the framework ofglpv theories in the jordan frame. provided the oscillating mode of scalarperturbations is fine-tuned so that it is initially suppressed, the anisotropicparameter $\eta=-\phi/\psi$ between the two gravitational potentials $\psi$ and$\phi$ significantly deviates from 1 for $c_{\rm t}^2$ away from 1. for othergeneral initial conditions, the deviation of $c_{\rm t}^2$ from 1 gives rise tothe large oscillation of $\psi$ with the frequency related to $c_{\rm s}^2$. inboth cases, the model can leave distinct imprints for the observations of cmband weak lensing.

astro-ph;0702015	probing the coupling between dark components of the universe	we place observational constraints on a coupling between dark energy and darkmatter by using 71 type ia supernovae (sne ia) from the first year of thefive-year supernova legacy survey (snls), the cosmic microwave background (cmb)shift parameter from the three-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe(wmap), and the baryon acoustic oscillation (bao) peak found in the sloandigital sky survey (sdss). the interactions we study are (i) constant couplingdelta and (ii) varying coupling delta(z) that depends on a redshift z, both ofwhich have simple parametrizations of the hubble parameter to confront withobservational data. we find that the combination of the three databasesmarginalized over a present dark energy density gives stringent constraints onthe coupling, -0.08 &lt; delta &lt; 0.03 (95% cl) in the constant coupling model and-0.4 &lt; delta_0 &lt; 0.1 (95% cl) in the varying coupling model, where delta_0 is apresent value. the uncoupled lambdacdm model (w_x = -1 and delta = 0) stillremains a good fit to the data, but the negative coupling (delta &lt; 0) with theequation of state of dark energy w_x &lt; -1 is slightly favoured over thelambdacdm model.

0810.5712	construction of cosmologically viable f(g) gravity models	we derive conditions under which f(g) gravity models, whose lagrangiandensities f are written in terms of a gauss-bonnet term g, are cosmologicallyviable. the most crucial condition to be satisfied is that f_gg, the secondderivative of f with respect to g, must be positive, which is required toensure the stability of a late-time de-sitter solution as well as the existenceof standard radiation/matter dominated epochs. we present a number of explicitf(g) models in which a cosmic acceleration is followed by the matter era. wefind that the equation of state of dark energy can cross the phantom dividebefore reaching the present universe. the viable models have asymptoticbehavior f_gg goes to +0 when |g| goes to infinity, in which case a rapidoscillation of perturbations occurs unless such an oscillating degree offreedom is suppressed relative to a homogeneous mode in the early universe. wealso introduce an iterative method to avoid numerical instabilities associatedwith a large mass of the oscillating mode.

gr-qc;0202067	nature of singularities in anisotropic string cosmology	we study nature of singularities in anisotropic string-inspired cosmologicalmodels in the presence of a gauss-bonnet term. we analyze two string gravitymodels-- dilaton-driven and modulus-driven cases-- in the bianchi type-ibackground without an axion field. in both scenarios singularities can beclassified in two ways- the determinant singularity where the main determinantof the system vanishes and the ordinary singularity where at least one of theanisotropic expansion rates of the universe diverges. in the dilaton case,either of these singularities inevitably appears during the evolution of thesystem. in the modulus case, nonsingular cosmological solutions exist both inasymptotic past and future with determinant $d=+\infty$ and d=2, respectively.in both scenarios nonsingular trajectories in either future or past typicallymeet the determinant singularity in past/future when the solutions aresingular, apart from the exceptional case where the sign of the time-derivativeof dilaton is negative. this implies that the determinant singularity may playa crucial role to lead to singular solutions in an anisotropic background.

gr-qc;0612180	conditions for the cosmological viability of f(r) dark energy models	we derive the conditions under which dark energy models whose lagrangiandensities f are written in terms of the ricci scalar r are cosmologicallyviable. we show that the cosmological behavior of f(r) models can be understoodby a geometrical approach consisting in studying the m(r) curve on the (r, m)plane, where m=rf_{,rr}/f_{,r} and r=-rf_{,r}/f with f_{,r}=df/dr. this allowsus to classify the f(r) models into four general classes, depending on theexistence of a standard matter epoch and on the final accelerated stage. theexistence of a viable matter dominated epoch prior to a late-time accelerationrequires that the variable m satisfies the conditions m(r) approx+0 anddm/dr&gt;-1 at r approx-1. for the existence of a viable late-time acceleration werequire instead either (i) m=-r-1, (sqrt{3}-1)/2&lt;m&lt;1 and dm/dr&lt;-1 or (ii) 0&lt;m&lt;1at r=-2. these conditions identify two regions in the (r, m) space, one for thematter era and the other for the acceleration. only models with a m(r) curvethat connects these regions and satisfy the requirements above lead to anacceptable cosmology. the models of the type f(r)=alpha r^{-n} and f=r+alphar^{-n} do not satisfy these conditions for any n&gt;0 and n&lt;-1 and are thuscosmologically unacceptable. similar conclusions can be reached for many otherexamples discussed in the text. in most cases the standard matter era isreplaced by a cosmic expansion with scale factor a propto t^{1/2}. we also findthat f(r) models can have a strongly phantom attractor but in this case thereis no acceptable matter era.
