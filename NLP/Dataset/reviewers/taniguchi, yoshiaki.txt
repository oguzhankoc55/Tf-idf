0903.2062	the chandra cosmos survey, i: overview and point source catalog	the chandra cosmos survey (c-cosmos) is a large, 1.8 ms, chandra} programthat has imaged the central 0.5 sq.deg of the cosmos field (centered at 10h,+02deg) with an effective exposure of ~160ksec, and an outer 0.4sq.deg. areawith an effective exposure of ~80ksec. the limiting source detection depths are1.9e-16 erg cm(-2) s(-1) in the soft (0.5-2 kev) band, 7.3e(-16) erg cm^-2 s^-1in the hard (2-10 kev) band, and 5.7e(-16) erg cm(-2) s(-1) in the full (0.5-10kev) band. here we describe the strategy, design and execution of the c-cosmossurvey, and present the catalog of 1761 point sources detected at a probabilityof being spurious of &lt;2e(-5) (1655 in the full, 1340 in the soft, and 1017 inthe hard bands). by using a grid of 36 heavily (~50%) overlapping pointingpositions with the acis-i imager, a remarkably uniform (to 12%) exposure acrossthe inner 0.5 sq.deg field was obtained, leading to a sharply defined lowerflux limit. the widely different psfs obtained in each exposure at each pointin the field required a novel source detection method, because of theoverlapping tiling strategy, which is described in a companion paper. (puccettiet al. paper ii). this method produced reliable sources down to a 7-12 counts,as verified by the resulting logn-logs curve, with sub-arcsecond positions,enabling optical and infrared identifications of virtually all sources, asreported in a second companion paper (civano et al. paper iii). the fullcatalog is described here in detail, and is available on-line.

0905.1581	chemical evolution of high-redshift radio galaxies	we present new deep optical spectra of 9 high-z radio galaxies (hzrgs) at z &gt;2.7 obtained with fors2 on vlt. these rest-frame ultraviolet spectra are usedto infer the metallicity of the narrow-line regions (nlrs) in order toinvestigate the chemical evolution of galaxies in high-z universe. we focusmainly on the civ/heii and ciii]/civ flux ratios that are sensitive to gasmetallicity and ionization parameter. although the nv emission has been widelyused to infer the gas metallicity, it is often too weak to be measuredaccurately for nlrs. by combining our new spectra with data from theliterature, we examine the possible redshift evolution of the nlr metallicityfor 57 hzrgs at 1 &lt; z &lt; 4. based on the comparison between the observedemission-line flux ratios and the results of our photoionization modelcalculations, we find no significant metallicity evolution in nlrs of hzrgs, upto z ~ 4. our results imply that massive galaxies had almost completed theirchemical evolution at much higher redshift (z &gt; 5). finally, although we detectstrong nv emission lines in 5 hzrgs at z &gt; 2.7, we point out that high nv/heiiratios are not indicative of high metallicities but correspond to highionization parameters of gas clouds in nlrs.

1011.5811	the mass-metallicity relation of sdss quasars	active galactic nuclei (agns) are characterized by a clear correlationbetween luminosity and metallicity (l_agn-z_agn relation). the origin of thiscorrelation is not clear. it may result from a relation between the black holemass (m_bh) and metallicity, or from a relation between the accretion rate(l/l_edd) and metallicity. to investigate the origin of the l_agn-z_agnrelation, we use optical spectra of 2383 quasars at 2.3 &lt; z &lt; 3.0 from thesloan digital sky survey. by using this data set, we have constructed compositespectra of 33 subsamples in intervals of both m_bh and l/l_edd. from thesecomposite spectra we measure emission-line flux ratios that are sensitive tothe metallicity of the broad line region (blr); specifically, nv/civ, nv/heii,(siiv+oiv])/civ, and aliii/civ. we find that there is a significant correlationbetween m_bh and z_blr as inferred from all four metallicity-sensitiveemission-line flux ratios. this result strongly suggests that the observedl_agn-z_agn relation is mostly a consequence of the m_bh-z_agn relation. therelation between m_bh and z_blr is likely a consequence of both the m_bh-m_bulrelation and of the mass-metallicity relation in the host galaxy. we also findthat l/l_edd correlates with the emission line flux ratios involving nv (morespecifically, nv/civ and nv/heii), while it does not correlate with the othertwo metallicity sensitive emission line flux ratios, i.e., (siiv+oiv])/civ andaliii/civ. these correlations indicate that the emission-line flux ratiosinvolving nv depend on both metallicity and relative abundance of nitrogen. wesuggest that the relation between l/l_edd and those line ratios involvingnitrogen, is caused by a delay of the black hole accretion rate relative to theonset of nuclear star formation of about 10^8 years, which is the timescalerequired for the nitrogen enrichment.

1012.1869	discovery of an excess of halpha emitters around 4c 23.56 at z=2.48	we report the discovery of a significant excess of candidate halpha emitters(haes) in the field of the radio galaxy 4c 23.56 at z=2.483. using the moircsnear-infrared imager on the subaru telescope we found 11 candidateemission-line galaxies to a flux limit of ~7.5 10^-17 erg s-1 cm-2, which isabout 5 times excess from the expected field counts with ~3-sigma significance.three of these are spectroscopically confirmed as redshifted halpha at z=2.49.the distribution of candidate emitters on the sky is tightly confined to a1.2-mpc-radius area at z=2.49, locating 4c 23.56 at the western edge of thedistribution. analysis of the deep spitzer mips 24 mu m imaging shows thatthere is also an excess of faint mips sources. all but two of the 11 haes arealso found in the mips data. the inferred star-formation rate (sfr) of the haesbased on the extinction-corrected halpha luminosity (median sfr &gt;~100 m_solaryr-1) is similar to those of haes in random fields at z~2. on the other hand,the mips-based sfr for the haes is on average 3.6 times larger, suggesting theexistence of the star-formation significanly obscured by dust. the comparisonof the halpha-based star-formation activities of the haes in the 4c 23.56 fieldto those in another proto-cluster around pks 1138-262 at z=2.16 reveals thatthe latter tend to have fainter halpha emission despite similar k-bandmagnitudes. this suggests that star-formation may be suppressed in the pks1138-262 protocluster relative to the 4c 23.56 protocluster. this differenceamong the haes in the two proto-clusters at z &gt; 2 may imply that some massivecluster galaxies are just forming at these epochs with some variation amongclusters.

1104.2330	completing the census of ly-alpha emitters at the reionization epoch	we carried out extended spectroscopic confirmations of ly-alpha emitters(laes) at z=6.5 and 5.7 in the subaru deep field. now, the total number ofspectroscopically confirmed laes is 45 and 54 at z=6.5 and 5.7, respectively,and at least 81% (70%) of our photometric candidates at z=6.5 (5.7) have beenspectroscopically identified as real laes. we made careful measurements of thely-alpha luminosity, both photometrically and spectroscopically, to accuratelydetermine the ly-alpha and rest-uv luminosity functions (lfs). thesubstantially improved evaluation of the ly-alpha lf at z=6.5 shows an apparentdeficit from z=5.7 at least at the bright end, and a possible decline even atthe faint end, though small uncertainties remain. the rest-uv lfs at z=6.5 and5.7 are in good agreement, at least at the bright end, in clear contrast to thedifferences seen in the ly-alpha lf. these results imply an increase in theneutral fraction of the intergalactic medium from z=5.7 to 6.5. the rest-frameequivalent width (ew_0) distribution at z=6.5 seems to be systematicallysmaller than z=5.7, and it shows an extended tail toward larger ew_0. thebright end of the rest-uv lf can be reproduced from the observed ly-alpha lfand a reasonable ew_0-uv luminosity relation. integrating this rest-uv lfprovides the first measurement of the contribution of laes to the photon budgetrequired for reionization. the derived uv lf suggests that the fractionalcontribution of laes to the photon budget among lyman break galaxiessignificantly increases towards faint magnitudes. low-luminosity laes coulddominate the ionizing photon budget, though this inference depends strongly onthe uncertain faint-end slope of the ly-alpha lf.

1112.2260	the role of galaxy interaction in environmental dependence of the star  formation activity at z~1.2	in order to understand environmental effects on star formation inhigh-redshift galaxies, we investigate the physical relationships between thestar formation activity, stellar mass, and environment for z ~1.2 galaxies inthe 2 deg^2 cosmos field. we estimate star formation using the [oii] emissionline and environment from the local galaxy density. our analysis shows that formassive galaxies m_*&gt;10^10 m_sun, the fraction of [oii] emitters inhigh-density environments is 1.7 times higher than in low-density environments,while the [oii] emitter fraction does not depend on environment for low-massm_* &lt; 10^10 m_sun galaxies. in order to understand what drives these trends, weinvestigate the role of companion galaxies in our sample. we find that thefraction of [oii] emitters in galaxies with companions is 2.4 times as high asthat in galaxies without companions at m_* &gt; 10^10 m_sun. in addition, massivegalaxies are more likely to have companions in high-density environments.however, although the "number" of star forming galaxies increases for massivegalaxies with close companions and in dense environments, the "average" starformation rate of star forming galaxies at a given mass is independent ofenvironment and the presence/absence of a close companion. these resultssuggest that interactions and/or mergers in high-density environment couldinduce star formation in massive galaxies at z~1.2, increasing the fraction ofstar-forming galaxies with m_* &gt; 10^10 m_sun.

1210.4933	a ly-alpha emitter with an extremely large rest-frame equivalent width  of ~900a at z=6.5: a candidate of population iii-dominated galaxy?	we have identified a very interesting ly-alpha emitter, whose ly-alphaemission line has an extremely large observed equivalent width ofew_0=436^{+422}_{-149}a, which corresponds to an extraordinarily largeintrinsic rest-frame equivalent width of ew_0^{int}=872^{+844}_{-298}a afterthe average intergalactic absorption correction. the object wasspectroscopically confirmed to be a real ly-alpha emitter by its apparentasymmetric ly-alpha line profile detected at z=6.538. the continuum emission ofthe object was definitely detected in our deep z'-band image; thus, its ew_0was reliably determined. follow-up deep near-infrared spectroscopy revealedemission lines of neither he ii lambda1640 as an apparent signature ofpopulation iii, nor c iv lambda1549 as a proof of active nucleus. no detectionof short-lived he ii lambda1640 line is not necessarily inconsistent with theinterpretation that the underlying stellar population of the object isdominated by population iii. we found that the observed extremely large ew_0 ofthe ly-alpha emission and the upper limit on the ew_0 of the he ii lambda1640emission can be explained by population synthesis models favoring a very youngage less than 2-4myr and massive metal-poor (z&lt;10^{-5}) or even metal-freestars. the observed large ew_0 of ly-alpha is hardly explained by populationi/ii synthesis models with z&gt;10^{-3}. however, we cannot conclusively rule outthe possibility that this object is composed of a normal stellar populationwith a clumpy dust distribution, which could enhance the ly-alpha ew_0, thoughits significance is still unclear.

1403.5924	the environments of ly$\alpha$ blobs i: wide-field ly$\alpha$ imaging of  tn j1338-1942, a powerful radio galaxy at $z\simeq 4.1$ associated with a  giant ly$\alpha$ nebula	we exploit wide-field ly$alpha$ imaging with subaru to probe the environmentaround tn j1338-1942, a powerful radio galaxy with a &gt;100 kpc ly$\alpha$ haloat z=4.11. we used a sample of ly$\alpha$ emitters (laes) down to $\log(l_{\rmly\alpha} [erg\, s^{-1}])\sim 42.8$ to measure the galaxy density aroundtnj1338, compared to a control sample from a blank field taken with the sameinstrument. we found that tnj1338 resides in a region with a peak overdensityof $\delta_{\rm lae}=2.8\pm 0.5$ on scales of $8\, h^{-1}\rm mpc$ (on the sky)and $112\, h^{-1}\rm mpc$ (line of sight) in comoving coordinates. adjacent tothis overdensity, we found a strong underdensity where virtually no laes aredetected. we used a semi-analytical model of laes derived from the millenniumsimulation to compare our results with theoretical predictions. while thetheoretical density distribution is consistent with the blank field, overdenseregions such as that around tnj1338 are very rare, with a number density of$6.4\times 10^{-8}\rm mpc^{-3}$ (comoving), corresponding to the densest &lt; 0.4percentile at $z\simeq 4.1$. we also found that the ly$\alpha$ luminosityfunction in the tnj1338 field differs from that in the blank field: the numberof bright laes ($\log(l_{\rm ly\alpha}[erg\,s^{-1}]) \gtrsim 43.3$) isenhanced, while the number of fainter laes is relatively suppressed. theseresults suggest that some powerful radio galaxies associated with ly$\alpha$nebulae reside in extreme overdensities on $\sim 3$--$6\, \rm mpc$ scales,where star-formation and agn activity may be enhanced via frequent galaxymergers or high rates of gas accretion from the surroundings.

0802.4123	a photometric survey for lyalpha-heii dual emitters: searching for  population iii stars in high-redshift galaxies	we present a new photometric search for high-z galaxies hosting populationiii (popiii) stars based on deep intermediate-band imaging observationsobtained in the subaru deep field (sdf), by using suprime-cam on the subarutelescope. by combining our new data with the existing broad-band andnarrow-band data, we searched for galaxies which emit strongly both in ly_alphaand in heii 1640 (``dual emitters'') that are promising candidates forpopiii-hosting galaxies, at 3.93&lt;z&lt;4.01 and 4.57&lt;z&lt;4.65. although we found 10``dual emitters'', most of them turn out to be [oii]-[oiii] dual emitters orh_beta-(h_alpha+[nii]) dual emitters at z&lt;1, as inferred from their broad-bandcolors and from the ratio of the equivalent widths. no convincing candidate ofly_alpha-heii dual emitter of sfr_popiii &gt; 2 msun/yr was found by ourphotometric search in 4.03 x 10^5 mpc^3 in the sdf. this result disfavors lowfeedback models for popiii star clusters, and implies an upper-limit of thepopiii sfr density of sfrd_popiii &lt; 5 x 10^-6 msun/yr/mpc^3. this new selectionmethod to search for popiii-hosting galaxies should be useful in futurenarrow-band surveys to achieve the first observational detection ofpopiii-hosting galaxies at high redshifts.

1409.5632	lyman-alpha forest tomography from background galaxies: the first  megaparsec-resolution large-scale structure map at z&gt;2	we present the first observations of foreground lyman-$\alpha$ forestabsorption from high-redshift galaxies, targeting 24 star-forming galaxies(sfgs) with $z\sim 2.3-2.8$ within a $5' \times 15'$ region of the cosmosfield. the transverse sightline separation is $\sim 2\,h^{-1}\mathrm{mpc}$comoving, allowing us to create a tomographic reconstruction of the 3dly$\alpha$ forest absorption field over the redshift range $2.20\leq z\leq2.45$. the resulting map covers $6\,h^{-1}\mathrm{mpc} \times14\,h^{-1}\mathrm{mpc}$ in the transverse plane and $230\,h^{-1}\mathrm{mpc}$along the line-of-sight with a spatial resolution of $\approx3.5\,h^{-1}\mathrm{mpc}$, and is the first high-fidelity map of large-scalestructure on $\sim\mathrm{mpc}$ scales at $z&gt;2$. our map reveals significantstructures with $\gtrsim 10\,h^{-1}\mathrm{mpc}$ extent, including severalspanning the entire transverse breadth, providing qualitative evidence for thefilamentary structures predicted to exist in the high-redshift cosmic web.simulated reconstructions with the same sightline sampling, spectralresolution, and signal-to-noise ratio recover the salient structures present inthe underlying 3d absorption fields. using data from other surveys, weidentified 18 galaxies with known redshifts coeval with our map volume enablinga direct comparison to our tomographic map. this shows that galaxiespreferentially occupy high-density regions, in qualitative agreement with thesame comparison applied to simulations. our results establishes the feasibilityof the clamato survey, which aims to obtain ly$\alpha$ forest spectra for $\sim1000$ sfgs over $\sim 1 \,\mathrm{deg}^2$ of the cosmos field, in order to mapout igm large-scale structure at $\langle z \rangle \sim 2.3$ over a largevolume $(100\,h^{-1}\mathrm{mpc})^3$.

1507.04439	discovery of massive, mostly star-formation quenched galaxies with  extremely large lyman-alpha equivalent widths at z ~ 3	we report a discovery of 6 massive galaxies with both extremely large lyaequivalent width and evolved stellar population at z ~ 3. these massiveextremely strong lya emitting objects (maestlos) have been discovered in ourlarge-volume systematic survey for strong lya emitters (laes) with twelveoptical intermediate-band data taken with subaru/suprime-cam in the cosmosfield. based on the sed fitting analysis for these laes, it is found that thesemaestlos have (1) large rest-frame equivalent width of ew_0(lya) ~ 100--300 a,(2) m_star ~ 10^10.5--10^11.1 m_sun, and (3) relatively low specific starformation rates of sfr/m_star ~ 0.03--1 gyr^-1. three of the 6 maestlos haveextended ly$\alpha$ emission with a radius of several kpc although they showvery compact morphology in the hst/acs images, which correspond to therest-frame uv continuum. since the maestlos do not show any evidence for agns,the observed extended lya emission is likely to be caused by star formationprocess including the superwind activity. we suggest that this new class oflaes, maestlos, provides a missing link from star-forming to passively evolvinggalaxies at the peak era of the cosmic star-formation history.

0807.0101	star-forming galaxies at z=0.24 in the subaru deep field and the sloan  digital sky survey	we make a search for halpha emitting galaxies at z=0.24 in the subaru deepfield (sdf) using the archival data set obtained with the subaru telescope. wecarefully select halpha emitters in the narrowband filter nb816, using b, v,rc, i', and z' broad-band colors. we obtain a sample of 258 emitting galaxieswith observed equivalent widths of (halpha+[nii]6548,6584) greater than 12angstrom. we also analyze a sample of halpha emitters taken from the sloandigital sky survey (sdss) to constrain the luminous end of halpha luminosityfunction. using the same selection criteria as for the sdf, and after excludingagns, we obtain 317 halpha emitting star-forming galaxies. combining these twosamples of halpha emitters found in both sdf and sdss, we derive a halphaluminosity function with best-fit schechter function parameters of alpha =-1.31^+0.17_-0.17, log phi^* = -2.46^+0.34_-0.40 mpc^-3, log l^* =41.99^+0.08_-0.07 ergs s^-1. an extinction-corrected halpha luminosity densityis 4.45^+2.96_-1.75 x 10^39 ergs s^-1 mpc^-3. using the kennicutt relationbetween the halpha luminosity and star formation rate, the star formation ratedensity in the survey volume is estimated as 0.035^+0.024_-0.014 m_sun yr^-1mpc^-3. the angular two-point correlation function of halpha emitters over 875arcmin^2 at z = 0.24 is well fitted by a power-law form with w(theta) =0.047^+0.017_-0.013 theta^-0.66 +- 0.08, corresponding to the correlationfunction of xi(r) = (r/2.6^+1.0_-0.8 mpc)^(-1.66 +- 0.08). the smallcorrelation length of halpha emitters may imply the weak clustering of activestar-forming galaxies.

astro-ph;0003055	the high-ionization nuclear emission-line region of seyfert galaxies	recently murayama &amp; taniguchi proposed that a significant part of thehigh-ionization nuclear emission-line region (hiner) in seyfert nuclei arisesfrom the inner wall of dusty tori because type 1 seyfert nuclei (s1s) show theexcess hiner emission with respect to type 2 seyfert ones (s2s). this meansthat the radiation from the hiner has the anisotropic property and thusstatistical properties of the hiner emission can be used to investigate theviewing angle toward dusty tori for various types of seyfert nuclei. in orderto investigate viewing angles toward various types of seyferys, we apply thishiner test to them.  our main results are as follows. (1) the nls1s are viewed from a more face-onview toward dusty tori than the s2s. however, the hiner properties of the nls1sare indistinguishable from those of the s1s. (2) the type 1.5 seyferts appearto comprise heterogeneous populations. (3) the type 1.8 and 1.9 seyferts andthe objects showing either a broad pa_beta line or polarized broad balmer linesare seen from a large inclination angle and the emission from the blrs of suchobjects reaches us through optically-thin parts of dusty tori. these threeresults support strongly the current unified model of seyfert nuclei. and, (4)the line ratios of [fe x]6374 to the low-ionization emission-lines have ratherisotropic property than those of [fe vii]6087. therefore it is suggested thatthe [fe x] emission is not useful investigating the viewing angle toward thedusty torus in seyfert nuclei. the most plausible reason seems that the [fe x]emission is spatially extended and thus its strength tends to show less viewingangle dependence.

astro-ph;0003056	the nuclear activity of the galaxies in the hickson compact groups	in order to investigate the nuclear activity of galaxies residing in compactgroups of galaxies, we present results of our optical spectroscopic programmade at okayama astrophysical observatory. we have performed opticalspectroscopy of 69 galaxies which belong to 31 hickson compact groups (hcgs) ofgalaxies. among them, three galaxies have discordant redshifts. further,spectral quality is too poor to classify other three galaxies. therefore, wedescribe our results for the remaining 63 galaxies.  our main results are summarized below. (1) we have found in our sample; 28agn, 16 hii nuclei, and 19 normal galaxies which show no emission line. we usedthis hcg sample for statistical analyses. (2) comparing the frequencydistributions of activity types between the hcgs and the field galaxies whosedata are taken from ho, filippenko, &amp; sargent (382 field galaxies), we findthat the frequency of hii nuclei in the hcgs is significantly less than that inthe field. however, this difference may be due to selection bias that our hcgsample contains more early-type galaxies than the field, because it is knownthat hii nuclei are rarer in early-type galaxies than in later ones. (3)applying correction this morphological bias to the hcg sample, we find thatthere is no statistically significant difference in the frequency of occurrenceof emission-line galaxies between the hcgs and the field. this implies that thedense galaxy environment in the hcgs does not affect triggering both the agnactivity and the nuclear starburst. we discuss some implications on the nuclearactivity in the hcg galaxies.

astro-ph;0005346	poststarburst models of liners	since the discovery of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions in manygalaxies (liners), it has been recognized that they constitute a class ofactive galactic nuclei (agns) which are thought to be powered by gas accretiononto a central, supermassive black hole. liners are observed in approximatelyone third of galaxies in the local universe and it has been often thought thatthey harbor an agn-like central engine with moderate activity. however, someliners show no direct evidence for agns such as broad emission lines, radiojets, hard x-ray emission, spectral energy distributions which are inconsistentwith starlight, and so on. for such liners (a subset of type 2 liners), wepresent new poststarburst models which explain some of their most importantoptical narrow emission-line ratios. in these models, the ionization sourcesare planetary nebula nuclei (pnns) with temperature of ~ 10^5 k which appear inthe late-phase evolution of intermediate-mass stars with mass between ~ 3m_solar and ~ 6 m_solar. such pnns left in a typical starburst nucleus canproduce an halpha luminosity of l(halpha) ~ 10^38 ergs s^-1 for typicalpoststarburst liners and ~ 10^39 ergs s^-1 only in exceptionally bright cases.the pnn phase lasts until the death of the lowest-mass stars formed in thestarburst, which is ~ 5 x 10^8 yr for an assumed lower limit of the initialmass function of 3 m_solar. this long duration appears consistent with theobserved higher frequency of occurrence of liners if every galaxy couldexperience the starburst activity several times in its life. we thereforepropose that some liners which show no direct evidence for agns may bepoststarburst nuclei powered by a cluster of pnns.

astro-ph;0006054	x-ray emission from seyfert 2 galaxies with optical polarized broad  lines	we analyze the 0.5-10 kev spectra of six seyfert 2 galaxies observed with thex-ray satellite asca: mrk 3, mrk 348, mrk 1210, mrk 477, ngc 7212, and was 49b.these galaxies were selected based on their possession of optical polarizedbroad lines. in the 2-10 kev band, their spectra are heavily absorbed, with2-10 kev absorption-corrected x-ray luminosities ranging from 10^{42} to10^{43} erg/s. the observed x-ray emission is generally only about one tenththat predicted based on their known infrared and h_beta luminosities. thisapparent x-ray weakness can be understood if a considerable fraction of thenuclear activity is completely blocked from view by thick matter along our lineof sight to the nucleus.  all of these galaxies possess significant soft x-ray emission whose originappears to be scattered light from their nuclear emission. based on thishypothesis, we estimate a typical scattering efficiency for x-rays to be about10%. this efficiency is larger than the few % found for ordinary seyfert 2galaxies with no report of optical polarized broad lines. a large scatteringefficiency is best explained by an apparent weakness of the hard x-rayluminosity rather than unusually strong scattered light in the soft band. thedifference of the apparent weakness is probably associated with viewing angle.

astro-ph;0008312	photometric properties of the arp 220 super star clusters	we investigate the photometric properties of six super stellar clusters(sscs) seen in both the optical and near-infrared hubble space telescope imagesof the local ultraluminous starburst galaxy arp 220. three of the sscs arelocated in the central 0.5 kpc region. the remaining three are in thecircumnuclear region between 0.5 kpc and 2.5 kpc from the centre. comparing theobserved spectral energy distributions (seds) of the sscs with the starburst99models of leitherer et al., we confirm that all the three nuclear sscs areheavily obscured ($a_v \sim 10$ mag). considering the results from thiscomparison in conjunction with measurements of the near-infrared co absorptionindex and of millimetre co line widths and luminosities, we estimate the agesof the nuclear sscs to be $10^7 - 10^8$ yrs. the bolometric luminosity of thethree nuclear sscs is at most one-fifth of the total bolometric luminosity ofarp 220. on the other hand, the circumnuclear sscs have little internalextinction ($a_v \leq$ 1 mag). these contribute negligibly to the totalbolometric luminosity.

astro-ph;0008379	a new interpretation of chain galaxies at high redshift	we propose a possible new model for the formation of chain galaxies at highredshift. our model is summarized as follows. step i: successive merging ofsubgalactic gas clumps results in the formation of a galaxy with a mass of$10^{11-12} m_\odot$ at redshift $z \sim 5$. step ii: subsequently, supernovaexplosions occur inside the galaxy and then blow out as a galactic wind (or asuperwind). this wind expands into the intergalactic space and then causes alarge-scale shell with a radius of several hundreds of kpc. since this radiusmay be smaller than the typical separation between galaxies, interactions ofshells may also occur, resulting in the formation of a large-scale gaseousslab. step iii: since the shell or the slab can be regarded as a gaseous sheet,filament-like gravitational instability is expected to occur. step iv: furthergravitational instability occurs in each filament, leading to intense starformation along the filament. this is the chain galaxy phase. step v: thefilament collapses gravitationally into one spheroidal system like anelliptical galaxy within one dynamical timescale of the filament ($\sim 10^8$yr). therefore, it seems quite difficult to find remnants of chain galaxies. wealso discuss that shocked shells driven by superwinds may be responsible forsome lyman limit systems and damped ly$\alpha$ systems because their h {\sc i}column densities are expected to be $n_{\rm hi} \gtrsim 10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$.

astro-ph;0010013	sio emission in the multi-lobe outflow associated with iras 16293-2422	we have mapped the thermal emission line of sio (v = 0; j = 2-1) associatedwith the quadrupolar molecular outflow driven by the very cold far-infraredsource iras 16293-2422. the sio emission is significantly enhanced in thenortheastern red lobe and at the position ~50" east of the iras source. strongsio emission observed at ~50" east of the iras source presents evidence for adynamical interaction between a part of the eastern blue lobe and the denseambient gas condensation, however, such an interaction is unlikely to beresponsible for producing the quadrupolar morphology. the sio emission in thenortheastern red lobe shows the spatial and velocity structure similar to thoseof the co outflow, suggesting that the sio emission comes from the molecularoutflow in the northeastern red lobe itself. the observed velocity structure isreproduced by a simple spatio-kinematic model of bow shock with a shockvelocity of 19-24 km/s inclined by 30-45 deg from the plane of the sky. thisimplies that the northeastern red lobe is independent of the eastern blue lobeand that the quadrupolar structure is due to two separate bipolar outflows.  the sio emission observed in the western red lobe has a broad pedestal shapewith low intensity. unlike the sio emission in the northeastern red lobe, thespatial extent of the sio emission in the western red lobe is restricted to itscentral region. the spatial and velocity structures and the line profilessuggest that three different types of the sio emission are observed in thisoutflow; the sio emission arises from the interface between the outflowing gasand the dense ambient gas clump, the sio emission coming from the outflow lobeitself, and the broad sio emission with low intensity observed at the centralregion of the outflow lobe.

astro-ph;0011105	where is the [o iii]4363 emitting region in active galactic nuclei?	the emission-line flux ratio of [o iii]4363/[o iii]5007 (r_oiii)is a usefuldiagnostic for the ionization mechanism and physical properties ofemission-line regions in active galactic nuclei (agns). however, it is knownthat simple photoionization models underpredict the [o iii]4363 intensity,being inconsistent with observations. in this paper, we report on severalpieces of evidence that a large fraction of the [o iii]4363 emission arisesfrom the dense gas obscured by putative tori: (1) the visibility of high-r_oiiiregions is correlated to that of broad-line regions, (2) higher-r_oiii objectsshow hotter mid-infrared colors, (3) higher-r_oiii objects show strongerhighly-ionized emission lines such as [fe vii]6087 and [fe x]6374, and (4)higher-r_oiii objects have broader line width of [o iii]4363 normalized by thatof [o iii]5007. to estimate how such a dense component contributes to the totalemission-line flux, dual-component photoionization model calculations areperformed. it is shown that the observed values of r_oiii of type 1 agns may beexplained by introducing a 5% - 20% contribution from the dense component whilethose of type 2 agns may be explained by introducing a 0% - 2% contribution. wealso discuss the [o iii]4363 emitting regions in liners in the framework of ourdual-component model.

0808.1337	clustering properties of low-luminosity star-forming galaxies at z =  0.24 and 0.40 in the subaru deep field	we present our analysis on the clustering properties of star-forming galaxiesselected by narrow-band excesses in the subaru deep field. specifically wefocus on halpha emitting galaxies at z = 0.24 and z = 0.40 in the same field,to investigate possible evolutionary signatures of clustering properties ofstar-forming galaxies. based on the analysis on 228 halpha emitting galaxieswith 39.8 &lt; log l(halpha) &lt; 40.8 at z = 0.40, we find that their two-pointcorrelation function is estimated as xi = (r/1.62^{+0.64}_{-0.50} mpc)^{-1.84+/- 0.08}. this is similar to that of halpha emitting galaxies in the samehalpha luminosity range at z = 0.24, xi = (r/1.88^{+0.60}_{-0.49} mpc)^{-1.89+/- 0.07}. these correlation lengths are smaller than those for the brightergalaxy sample studied by meneux et al. (2006) in the same redshift range. theevolution of correlation length between z = 0.24 and z = 0.40 is interpreted bythe gravitational growth of the dark matter halos.

astro-ph;0103036	submillimeter co emission from shock-heated gas in the l1157 outflow	we present the co j=6-5, 4-3, and 3-2 spectra from the blueshifted gas of theoutflow driven by the low-mass class 0 protostar in the l1157 dark cloud.strong submillimeter co emission lines with t_mb &gt; 30 k have been detected at63" (~0.13 pc) south from the protostar. it is remarkable that the blue wingsin the submillimeter lines are stronger by a factor of 3-4 than that of the coj=1-0 emission line. the co line ratios suggest that the blueshifted lobe ofthis outflow consists of moderately dense gas of n(h_2) = (1-3)x10^4 cm^-3heated to t_kin = 50-170 k.it is also suggested that the kinetic temperature ofthe outflowing gas increases from ~80 k near the protostar to ~170 k at theshocked region in the lobe center, toward which the largest velocity dispersionof the co emission is observed. a remarkable correlation between the kinetictemperature and velocity dispersion of the co emission along the lobe providesus with direct evidence that the molecular gas at the head of the jet-drivenbow shock is indeed heated kinematically. the lower temperature of ~80 kmeasured at the other shocked region near the end of the lobe is explained ifthis shock is in a later evolutionary stage, in which the gas has been cooledmainly through radiation of the co rotational lines.

astro-ph;0107025	seyfert-type dependences of narrow emission-line ratios and physical  properties of high-ionization nuclear emission-line regions in seyfert  galaxies	in order to examine how narrow emission-line flux ratios depend on theseyfert type, we compiled various narrow emission-line flux ratios of 355seyfert galaxies from the literature. we present in this paper that theintensity of the high-ionization emission lines, [fe vii]6087, [fe x]6374 and[ne v]3426, tend to be stronger in seyfert 1 galaxies than in seyfert 2galaxies. in addition to these lines, [o iii]4363 and [ne iii]3869, whoseionization potentials are not high (&lt; 100 ev), but whose critical densities aresignificantly high (&gt; 10^7 cm^-3), also exhibit the same tendency. on the otherhand, the emission-line flux ratios among low-ionization emission lines do notshow such a tendency. we point out that the most plausible interpretation ofthese results is that the high-ionization emission lines arise mainly fromhighly-ionized, dense gas clouds, which are located very close to nuclei, andthus can be hidden by dusty tori. to examine the physical properties of thesehighly-ionized dense gas clouds, photoionization model calculations wereperformed. as a result, we find that the hydrogen density and the ionizationparameter of these highly-ionized dense gas clouds are constrained to be n_h &gt;10^6 cm^-3 and u &gt; 10^-2, respectively. these lower limits are almostindependent both from the metallicity of gas clouds and from the spectralenergy distribution of the nuclear ionizing radiation.

astro-ph;0108126	a shock-induced pair of superbubbles in the high-redshift powerful radio  galaxy mrc 0406-244	we present new optical spectroscopy of the high-redshift powerful radiogalaxy mrc 0406$-$244 at redshift of 2.429. we find that the two extensionstoward nw and se probed in the rest-frame ultraviolet image are heated mainlyby the nonthermal continuum of the active galactic nucleus. however, eachextension shows a shell-like morphology, suggesting that they are a pair ofsuperbubbles induced by the superwind activity rather than by the interactionbetween the radio jet and the ambient gas clouds. if this is the case, theintense starburst responsible for the formation of superbubbles could occur$\sim 1 \times 10^9$ yr ago. on the other hand, the age of the radio jets maybe of the order of $\sim 10^6$ yr, being much shorter than the starburst age.therefore, the two events, i.e., the starburst and the radio-jet activities,are independent phenomena. however, their directions of the expanding motionscould be governed by the rotational motion of the gaseous component in the hostgalaxy. this idea appears to explain the alignment effect of mrc 0406$-$244.

astro-ph;0110498	is there an advection-dominated accretion flow in radio galaxies with  double-peaked balmer lines?	in order to examine the prediction that the broad-line radio galaxies (blrgs)with double-peaked balmer lines harbor an accretion disk characterized by anadvection-dominated accretion flow (adaf) in their nuclei, we investigatenarrow emission-line flux ratios of the narrow-line regions which arephotoionized by the nuclear continuum radiation. we compile data from theliterature and confirm the pioneering work of eracleous &amp; halpern that theblrgs with the double-peaked balmer emission exhibit larger flux ratios of both[o i]6300/[o iii]5007 and [o ii]3727/[o iii]5007 than the blrgs without thedouble-peaked balmer emission. to examine whether or not these properties areattributed to the difference in the spectral energy distribution (sed) of theionizing radiation between the blrgs with and without the double-peaked balmeremission, we perform photoionization model calculations using two types ofinput continuum radiation; one has the strong big blue bump which is expectedfor standard optically-thick accretion disks and another does not exhibit astrong big blue bump as expected for optically-thin adafs. we find that thedata of the blrgs with the double-peaked balmer lines are consistent with themodels adopting the sed without a strong big blue bump while the data of theblrgs without the double-peaked emission lines are well described by the modelsadopting the sed with a strong big blue bump. on the other hand, the observeddifferences in the nlr emission is hard to be explain by the difference in thecontribution of shocks. these results support the idea that the double-peakedbalmer lines arise at an outer region of an accretion disk which is illuminatedby an inner, geometrically-thick adaf.

astro-ph;0204171	gas metallicity of narrow-line regions in narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies  and broad-line seyfert 1 galaxies	we investigate gas metallicity of narrow-line regions in narrow-line seyfert1 galaxies (nls1s) and broad-line ones (bls1s) in order to examine whether ornot there is a difference in the gas metallicity between the two populations ofseyfert 1 galaxies. we apply two methods to study this issue. one is to use theemission-line flux ratio of [n ii]6583/h_alpha in combination with some otheroptical emission-line flux ratios. this method, which has been often applied toseyfert 2 galaxies, suggests that the gas metallicity of narrow-line regions isindistinguishable or possibly higher in bls1s than in nls1s. on the contrary,the other method in which only forbidden emission-line fluxes are used resultsin that nls1s tend to possess metal-richer gas in the narrow-line regions thanbls1s. we point out that this inconsistency may be owing to the contaminationof the broad component of permitted lines into the narrow component of ones inthe first method. since the results derived by using only forbiddenemission-line fluxes do not suffer from any uncertainty of the fitting functionfor the broad component of balmer lines, the results from this method are morereliable than those derived by using permitted lines. we thus conclude that thegas metallicity of narrow-line regions tends to be higher in nls1s than inbls1s.

astro-ph;0205153	effects of a burst of formation of first-generation stars on the  evolution of galaxies	first-generation (population iii) stars in the universe play an importantrole inearly enrichment of heavy elements in galaxies and intergalactic mediumand thus affect the history of galaxies. the physical and chemical propertiesof primordial gas clouds are significantly different from those of present-daygas clouds observed in the nearby universe because the primordial gas clouds donot contain any heavy elements which are important coolants in the gas.previous theoretical considerations have suggested that typical masses of thefirst-generation stars are between several $m_\odot$ and $\approx 10 m_\odot$although it has been argued that the formation of very massive stars (e.g., $&gt;100 m_\odot$) is also likely. if stars with several $m_\odot$ are most popularones at the epoch of galaxy formation, most stars will evolve to hot (e.g.,$\gtrsim 10^5$ k), luminous ($\sim 10^4 l_\odot$) stars with gaseous and dustyenvelope prior to going to die as white dwarf stars. although the duration ofthis phase is short (e.g., $\sim 10^5$ yr), such evolved stars could contributeboth to the ionization of gas in galaxies and to the production of a lot ofdust grains if the formation of intermediate-mass stars is highly enhanced. wecompare gaseous emission-line properties of such nebulae with some interestinghigh-redshift galaxies such asiras f10214+4724 and powerful radio galaxies.

astro-ph;0701668	the hi content of star-forming galaxies at z = 0.24	we use observations from the giant metrewave radio telescope (gmrt) tomeasure the atomic hydrogen gas content of star-forming galaxies at z = 0.24(i.e. a look-backtime of ~3 gyr). the sample of galaxies studied were selectedfrom halpha-emitting field galaxies detected in a narrow-band imaging surveywith the subaru telescope. the anglo-australian telescope was used to obtainprecise optical redshifts for these galaxies. we then coadded the hi 21 cmemission signal for all the galaxies within the gmrt spectral line data cube.  from the coadded signal of 121 galaxies, we measure an average atomichydrogen gas mass of (2.26 +- 0.90)*10^9 solar masses. we translate this hisignal into a cosmic density of neutral gas at z = 0.24 of omega_gas = (0.91 +-0.42)*10^-3. this is the current highest redshift at which omega_gas has beenconstrained from 21 cm emission and our value is consistent with that estimatedfrom damped lyman-alpha systems around this redshift. we also find that thecorrelations between the halpha luminosity and the radio continuum luminosityand between the star formation rate and the hi gas content in star-forminggalaxies at z = 0.24 are consistent with the correlations found at z = 0. thesetwo results suggest that the star formation mechanisms in field galaxies ~3 gyrago were not substantially different from the present, even though the starformation rate is 3 times higher.

astro-ph;0702377	high-redshift ly alpha emitters with a large equivalent width:  properties of i-dropout galaxies with an nb921-band depression in the subaru  deep field	we report new follow-up spectroscopy of i-dropout galaxies with an nb921-banddepression found in the subaru deep field. the nb921-depressed i-dropoutselection method is expected to select galaxies with large equivalent width lyalpha emission over a wide redshift range, 6.0&lt;z&lt;6.5. two of four observedtargets show a strong emission line with a clear asymmetric profile, identifiedas ly alpha emitters at z=6.11 and 6.00. their rest-frame equivalent widths are153a and 114a, which are lower limits on the intrinsic equivalent widths.through our spectroscopic observations (including previous ones) ofnb921-depressed i-dropout galaxies, we identified 5 galaxies in total with arest-frame equivalent width larger than 100a at 6.0&lt;z&lt;6.5 out of 8 photometriccandidates, which suggests that the nb921-depressed i-dropout selection methodis possibly an efficient way to search for ly alpha emitters with a large lyalpha equivalent width, in a wider redshift range than usual narrow-band excesstechniques. by combining these findings with our previous observationalresults, we infer that the fraction of broad-band selected galaxies having arest-frame equivalent width larger than 100a is significantly higher at z~6(the cosmic age of ~1 gyr) than that at z~3 (~2 gyr), being consistent with theidea that the typical stellar population of galaxies is significantly youngerat z~6 than that at z~3. the nb921-depressed i-dropout galaxies may beinteresting candidates for hosts of massive, zero-metallicity population iiistars.

astro-ph;9710192	why can we detect quasar br1202$-$0725 in co ?	we present co luminosity evolution of both elliptical and spiral galaxiesbased on a galactic wind model and a bulge-disk model, respectively. we havefound that the co luminosity peaks around the epoch of galactic wind caused bycollective supernovae $\sim$ 0.85 gyr after the birth of the elliptical with $m= 2 \cdot 10^{12} m_\odot$ while $\sim$ 0.36 gyr after the birth of the bulgewith $m = 2 \cdot 10^{11} m_\odot$. after these epochs, the co luminositydecreases abruptly because the majority of molecular gas was expelled from thegalaxy system as the wind. taking account of typical masses of ellipticalgalaxies and bulges of spiral galaxies, we suggest that co emission can behardly detected from galaxies with redshift $z \sim 1 - 4$ unless someamplification either by galaxy mergers and/or by gravitational lensing isworking. therefore, our study explains reasonably why co emission was detectedfrom the high-redshift quasar br 1202$-$0725 at $z =4.7$ while not detectedfrom the powerful radio galaxies with $1 &lt; z &lt; 4$.

astro-ph;9802152	where is the coronal line region in active galactic nuclei?	we report the new finding that type 1 seyfert nuclei (s1s) have excess[fevii]6087 emission with respect to type 2s (s2s). the s1s exhibit broademission lines which are attributed to ionized gas within 1 pc of the blackhole, whereas the s2s do not show such broad lines. the current unified modelof active galactic nuclei explains this difference as that the central 1 pcregion in the s2s is hidden from the line of sight by a dusty torus if weobserve it from a nearly edge-on view toward the torus. therefore, our findingimplies that the coronal line region (clr) traced by the [fevii]6087 emissionresides in the inner wall of such dusty tori. on the other hand, the frequencyof occurrence of the clr in the optical spectra is nearly the same between thes1s and the s2s. moreover, some seyfert nuclei exhibit a very extended (~ 1kpc) clr. all these observational results can be unified if we introduce athree-component model for the clr; 1) the inner wall of the dusty torus, 2) theclumpy ionized region associated with the narrow line region at distance from ~10 to ~ 100 pc, and 3) the extended ionized region at distance ~ 1 kpc.

astro-ph;9803102	near-infrared spectroscopy of the high redshift quasar s4 0636+68 at  z=3.2	we present near-infrared (observed frame) spectra of the high-redshift quasars4 0636+68 at z=3.2 which was previously thought to be one of a group of``strong'' fe ii emitters [i.e., f(fe ii 4434-4684)/f(hbeta) &gt; 1]. our k-bandspectrum clearly shows emission lines of hbeta and [o iii]4959, 5007 as well asoptical fe ii emission. our computed value of f(fe ii 4434-4684)/f(hbeta) ~ 0.8for s4 0636+68 is less than previously thought, and in fact is comparable tovalues found for radio-loud, flat-spectrum, low-z quasars. therefore s4 0636+68appears not to be a strong optical fe ii emitter. although more than half (5/8)of the high-z quasars observed to date are still classified as strong opticalfe ii emitters, their fe ii/hbeta ratios, for the most part, follow the sametrend as that of low-$z$ quasars, i.e., an anticorrelation in ew(feii)/ew(hbeta) versus ew([o iii])/ew(hbeta), with radio-loud quasars having amean value of ew(fe ii)/ew(hbeta) approximately half that of radio-quietquasars at comparable values of ew([o iii])/ew(hbeta).

astro-ph;9806287	a new dual-component photoionization model for the narrow emission-line  regions in active galactic nuclei	having found that type 1 seyfert nuclei have excess [fevii]6087 emission withrespect to type 2s, murayama &amp; taniguchi have proposed that the high-ionizationnuclear emission-line region (hiner) traced by the [fevii]6087 emission residesin the inner wall of dusty tori. the covering factor of the torus is usuallylarge (e.g., ~ 0.9). further, electron density in the tori (e.g., ~ 10^7-10^8cm-3) is considered to be higher significantly than that (e.g., ~ 10^3-10^4cm^-3) in the narrow-line region (nlr). therefore it is expected that the torusemission contributes to the majority of the higher-ionization emission lines.taking this hiner component into account, we have constructed newdual-component (i.e., a typical nlr with a hiner torus) photoionization models.comparison of our model with the observations show that that if the torusemission contributes ~ 10 % of the nlr emission, our dual-component model canexplain the observed high [fevii]6087/[oiii]5007 intensity ratios of theseyfert 1s without invoking any unusual assumptions (e.g., the overabundance ofiron).

astro-ph;9807149	starburst-driven starbursts in the heart of ultraluminous infrared  galaxies	there is increasing evidence for the presence of blue super star clusters inthe central regions of ultraluminous infrared galaxies like arp 220.ultraluminous galaxies are thought to be triggered by galaxy mergers, and ithas often been argued that these super star clusters may form during violentcollisions between gas clouds in the final phase of the mergers. we nowinvestigate another set of models which differ from previous ones in that theformation of the super star clusters is linked directly to the very intensestarburst occurring at the very center of the galaxy. firstly we show that ascenario in which the super star clusters form in material compressed by shockwaves originating from the central starburst is implausible because the objectsso produced are much smaller than the observed star clusters in arp 220. wethen investigate a scenario (based on the shlosman-noguchi model) in which theinfalling dense gas disk is unstable gravitationally and collapses to formmassive gaseous clumps. since these clumps are exposed to the external highpressure driven by the superwind (a blast wave driven by a collective effect ofa large number of supernovae in the very core of the galaxy), they can collapseand then massive star formation may be induced in them. the objects produced inthis kind of collapse have properties consistent with those of the observedsuper star clusters in the center of arp 220.

astro-ph;9809344	an origin of the huge far-infrared luminosity of starburst mergers	recently taniguchi and ohyama found that the higher $^{12}$co to $^{13}$cointegrated intensity ratios at a transition $j$=1--0, $r =i(^{12}$co)$/i(^{13}$co) $\gtrsim 20$, in a sample of starburst merginggalaxies such as arp 220 are mainly attributed to the depression of $^{13}$coemission with respect to $^{12}$co. investigating the same sample of galaxiesanalyzed by taniguchi &amp; ohyama, we find that there is a tight, almost linearcorrelation between the dust mass and $^{13}$co luminosity. this implies thatdust grains are also depressed in the high-$r$ starburst mergers, leading tothe higher dust temperature ($t_{\rm d}$) in them because of the relativeincrease in the radiation density. nevertheless, the average dust mass ($m_{\rmd}$) of the high-$r$ starburst mergers is higher significantly than that ofnon-high $r$ galaxies. this is naturally understood because the galaxy mergerscould accumulate a lot of dust grains from their progenitor galaxies togetherwith supply of dust grains formed newly in the star forming regions. since$l$(fir) $\propto m_{\rm d} t_{\rm d}^5$ given the dust emissivity law, $s_\nu\propto \lambda^{-1}$, the increases in both $m_{\rm d}$ and $t_{\rm d}$explain well why the starburst mergers are so bright in the fir. we discussthat the superwind activity plays an important role in destroying dust grainsas well as dense gas clouds in the central region of mergers.

astro-ph;9810249	optical versus mid-infrared spectroscopic classification of  ultraluminous infrared galaxies	the origin of huge infrared luminosities of ultraluminous infrared galaxies(uligs) is still in question. recently, genzel et al. made mid-infrared (mir)spectroscopy of a large number of uligs and found that the major energy sourcein them is massive stars formed in the recent starburst activity; i.e., $\sim$70% -- 80% of the sample are predominantly powered by the starburst. however,it is known that previous optical spectroscopic observations showed that themajority of uligs are classified as seyferts or liners (low-ionization nuclearemission-line regions). in order to reconcile this difference, we compare typesof emission-line activity for a sample of uligs which have been observed inboth optical and mir. we confirm the results of previous studies that themajority of uligs classified as liners based on the optical emission-linediagnostics turn to be starburst-dominated galaxies based on the mir ones.since the mir spectroscopy can probe more heavily-reddened, inner parts of theuligs, it is quite unlikely that the inner parts are powered by the starburstwhile the outer parts are powered by non-stellar ionization sources. the mostprobable resolution of this dilemma is that the optical emission-line nebulaewith the liner properties are powered predominantly by shock heating driven bythe superwind activity; i.e., a blast wave driven by a collective effect of alarge number of supernovae in the central region of galaxy mergers.

astro-ph;9901333	formation of quasar nuclei in the heart of ultraluminous infrared  galaxies	we investigate whether or not a supermassive black hole (smbh) with mass$\gtrsim 10^8 m_\odot$ can be made in the heart of ultraluminous infraredgalaxies (uligs) during the course of mergers between/among gas rich galaxies.(a) if one progenitor galaxy had a seed smbh with mass of $\sim 10^7 m_\odot$,this seed smbh can grow up to $\gtrsim 10^8 m_\odot$ due to efficientbondi-type gas accretion during the course of merger given a gas density in thecircumnuclear region of $n_h \sim 10^3 cm^{-3}$. (b) even if there was noprogenitor galaxy with a seed smbh, star clusters with compact remnants(neutron stars and/or black holes) produced in the circumnuclear starbursts canmerge into the merger center within a dynamical time scale of $\sim 10^9$ yearsto form a smbh with $\gtrsim 10^8 m_\odot$. note, however, that thecontribution of compact remnants supplied from hidden star clusters isnecessary to lead to the formation of a smbh. in conclusion, the ultraluminousinfrared galaxies observed in the local universe can make a smbh in theircenter during the course of merger either by gas accretion onto a seed smbh orby dynamical relaxation of compact remnants made in the violent circumnuclearstarbursts. therefore, it is quite likely that the uligs will finally evolve tooptically luminous quasars as suggested by sanders et al.

[1996, apj, 457, 616] on the basisof their associated soft x-ray emission.  we also report the serendipitous discovery of three additional galaxies atredshift $z \sim 0.5$, found along one of the slit positions. all threegalaxies exhibit an [o ii] \lambda 3727 emission line. the spectrum of thebrightest galaxy ($m_r \simeq 24.4$) shows other strong emission lines: mg ii\lambda 2798, h \beta, [o iii] \lambda 4959, and [o iii] \lambda 5007. theemission-line properties of these galaxies as well as their intrinsically lowluminosities ($m_r \geq -18.4$) indicate that they are star-forming dwarfgalaxies.

astro-ph;9904066	13co(j=1-0) depression in luminous starburst mergers, revisited	it is known that merging galaxies with luminous starbursts and highfar-infrared luminosities tend to have higher $r_{1-0}=^{12}co(j=1-0)/^{13}co(j=1-0)$ integrated line intensity ratios ($r_{1-0}\simeq 20-50$) than normal spiral galaxies ($r_{1-0} \simeq 5-15$). comparingfar-infrared luminosities [l(fir)] with those of ^{12}co(j=1-0) and^{13}co(j=1-0) for a sample of normal and starburst galaxies, taniguchi &amp;ohyama found that the observed high $r_{1-0}$ values for the luminous starburstmergers are attributed to their lower ^{13}co line intensities by a factor of 3on the average. they suggested the following two possibilities; in the luminousstarburst mergers, 1) ^{13}co is underabundant with respect to ^{12}co, or 2)exitation and/or optical depth effects are responsible for the change in$r_{1-0}$. in this paper, we investigate the second possibility using highertransition data of both ^{12}co and ^{13}co emission lines. applying the samemethod proposed by taniguchi &amp; ohyama to both ^{12}co(j=2-1) and^{13}co(j=2-1), we find that ^{13}co(j=2-1) is also depressed with respect to^{12}co(j=2-1). this suggests that the ^{13}co gas may be underabundant in thehigh-$r_{1-0}$ starburst mergers although we cannot rule out the possibilitythat excitation and optical depth effects are still affecting $r_{2-1}$, forexample due to the large velocity widths in the co emission lines. additionalobservations of both ^{12}co and ^{13}co lines at $j \geq 3$ are required tobetter constrain the conditions of the molecular gas in luminous starburstgalaxies.

astro-ph;9905353	the minor-merger driven nuclear activity in seyfert galaxies: a step  toward the simple unified formation mechanism of active galactic nuclei in  the local universe	seyfert nuclei are typical active galactic nuclei (agns) in the localuniverse, which are thought to be powered by gas accretion onto a supermassiveblack hole (smbh). the dynamical effect exerted either by non-axisymmetricgravitational potential (such as a stellar bar) or by interaction with othergalaxies has been often considered to cause the efficient gas fueling. however,recent systematic studies for large samples of seyfert nuclei have shown that;1) seyfert nuclei do not prefer barred galaxies as their hosts, and 2) only$\simeq$ 10% of seyfert galaxies have companion galaxies. these findings raiseagain a question; "what is important in the fueling of nuclear activity ?" herewe suggest that an alternative fueling mechanism, the minor-merger (i.e.,mergers between a gas-rich disk galaxy and a bound, less-massive satellitegalaxy) driven fueling appears consistent with almost all importantobservational properties of seyfert galaxies. nucleated (i.e., either a smbh ora dense nuclear star cluster) galaxies and satellites seem necessary to ensurethat the gas in the host disk is surely fueled into the very inner region(e.g., $\ll$ 1 pc). taking account that local quasars may be formed by majormergers between/among galaxies, we propose that all the agns in the localuniverse were made either by minor or by major mergers.

astro-ph;9908259	new mid-infrared diagnostic of the dusty torus model for seyfert nuclei	we propose a new diagnostic of the ``dusty torus'' model for seyfert nuclei.dust grains in the torus are heated by the nuclear continuum, and reradiatemostly in the mid-infrared wavelengths. from the torus geometry, it ispredicted that the emission at lambda &lt; 10 micron has strong dependence on theviewing angle. since the dependence is predicted to be insignificant at lambda&gt; 10 micron, we study the flux ratio between 3.5 micron (l band) and 25 micron;r(l,25) = log [(nu_3.5 um s_nu_3.5 um)/(nu_25 um s_nu_25 um)]. in threedifferent samples (optically selected, x-ray selected, and infrared selectedsamples) of seyfert galaxies, the observed values of r(l,25) between type 1seyferts (s1s) and type 2 seyferts (s2s) are found to be clearly separated;r(l,25) &gt; -0.6 for s1s while r(l,25) &lt; -0.6 for s2s. this implies universalityof their torus properties. with this result and the other observationalcharacteristics, we investigate the most plausible torus model among thosepresented in pier &amp; krolik (1992, 1993).

astro-ph;9910036	what are narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies ?: toward a  viewing-angle-dependent unified model for seyfert galaxies	recently growing evidence has been accumulated that the nls1s are viewed fromnearly pole-on viewing angles. however, there has been no theoretical modelwhich explains the following important correlations; 1) weaker optical fe iiemitters always have wider emission-line widths but stronger optical fe iiemitters have either wider or narrower line widths, and 2) s1s with wider linewidths always have flatter soft x-ray spectra but s1s with narrower line widthshave either steeper or flatter soft x-ray spectra.  photoionization models predict that the partly-ionized zone in the broad lineregion (blr) with a disk-like configuration, in which the optical fe iiemission is thought to arise, is very optically thick. if we observe thisdisk-like blr from an inclined viewing angle, the fe ii emitting region locatedin the far-side half disk cannot be seen entirely because of the large opticaldepth while almost all the hbeta emission can be seen because the ionizedhydrogen is located in the outer surfaces of blr clouds. this explains that thefe ii/hbeta ratio depends on viewing angle.  recent discovery of relativistic outflows in some nls1s suggests that thenuclear radio jet interacts with the dense ambient gas very close to thecentral engine. the kinetic doppler effect increases the soft x-rayluminosities if we observe s1s from a nearly pole-on view given the above rangeof beta. these explain why nls1s tend to have steeper soft x-ray spectratogether with higher soft x-ray luminosities. furthermore, the extinction ofsoft x-ray photons due to dust grain above the dusty tori are expected to moreserious for the bls1s than for the nls1s. we thus suggest that theseorientation effects are responsible for the second important correlation.
