0902.3658	a suzaku search for non-thermal emission at hard x-ray energies in the  coma cluster	the brightest cluster radio halo known resides in the coma cluster ofgalaxies. the relativistic electrons producing this diffuse synchrotronemission should also produce inverse compton emission that becomes competitivewith thermal emission from the icm at hard x-ray energies. thus far, claimeddetections of this emission in coma are controversial (fusco-femiano et al.2004; rossetti &amp; molendi 2004). we present a suzaku hxd-pin observation of thecoma cluster in order to nail down its non-thermal hard x-ray content. thecontribution of thermal emission to the hxd-pin spectrum is constrained bysimultaneously fitting thermal and non-thermal models to it and a spatiallyequivalent spectrum derived from an xmm-newton mosaic of the coma field(schuecker et al. 2004). we fail to find statistically significant evidence fornon-thermal emission in the spectra, which are better described by only asingle or multi-temperature model for the icm. including systematicuncertainties, we derive a 90% upper limit on the flux of non-thermal emissionof 6.0x10^-12 erg/s/cm^2 (20-80 kev, for photon index of 2.0), which implies alower limit on the cluster-averaged magnetic field of b&gt;0.15 microg. our fluxupper limit is 2.5x lower than the detected non-thermal flux from rxte(rephaeli &amp; gruber 2002) and bepposax (fusco-femiano et al. 2004). however, ifthe non-thermal hard x-ray emission in coma is more spatially extended than theobserved radio halo, the suzaku hxd-pin may miss some fraction of the emission.a detailed investigation indicates that ~50-67% of the emission might goundetected, which could make our limit consistent with these detections. thethermal interpretation of the hard coma spectrum is consistent with recentanalyses of integral (eckert et al. 2007) and swift (ajello et al. 2009) data.

0706.2519	chandra observation of the cluster environment of a wat radio source in  abell 1446	wide-angle tail (wat) radio sources are often found in the centers of galaxyclusters where intracluster medium (icm) ram pressure may bend the lobes intotheir characteristic c-shape. we examine the low redshift (z=0.1035) clusterabell 1446, host to the wat radio source 1159+583. the cluster exhibitspossible evidence for a small-scale cluster-subcluster merger as a cause of thewat radio source morphology. this evidence includes the presence of temperatureand pressure substructure along the line that bisects the wat as well as apossible wake of stripped interstellar material or a disrupted cool core to thesoutheast of the host galaxy. a filament to the north may represent cool,infalling gas that's contributing to the wat bending while spectroscopicallydetermined redshifts of member galaxies may indicate some component of a mergeroccurring along the line-of-sight. the wat model of high flow velocity and lowlobe density is examined as another scenario for the bending of 1159+583. ithas been argued that such a model would allow the ram pressure due to thegalaxy's slow motion through the icm to shape the wat source. a temperatureprofile shows that the cluster is isothermal (kt= 4.0 kev) in a series ofannuli reaching a radius of 400 kpc. there is no evidence of an ongoing coolingflow. temperature, abundance, pressure, density, and mass profiles, as well astwo-dimensional maps of temperature and pressure are presented.

0910.5227	effects of the non-equipartition of electrons and ions in the outskirts  of relaxed galaxy clusters	(abridged) we have studied the effects of electron-ion non-equipartition inthe outer regions of relaxed clusters for a wide range of masses in the\lambdacdm cosmology using one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. theeffects of the non-adiabatic electron heating efficiency, \beta, on the degreeof non-equipartition are also studied. using the gas fraction f_gas = 0.17(which is the upper limit for a cluster), we give a conservative lower limit ofthe non-equipartition effect on clusters. beyond the virial radius, thenon-equipartition effect depends rather strongly on \beta, and such a strongdependence at the shock radius can be used to distinguish shock heating modelsor constrain the shock heating efficiency of electrons. we have also studiedsystematically the signatures of non-equipartition on x-ray and sz observables.we have calculated the effect of non-equipartition on the projected temperatureand x-ray surface brightness profiles using the mekal emission model. thenon-equipartition effect can introduce a ~10% bias in the projected temperatureat r_vir for a wide range of \beta. we also found that the effect ofnon-equipartition on the projected temperature profiles can be enhanced byincreasing metallicity. we found that for our model in the \lambdacdm universe,the integrated sz bias, y_{non-eq}/y_{eq}, evolves slightly (at a percentagelevel) with redshift, which is in contrast to the self-similar model in theeinstein-de sitter universe. this may introduce biases in cosmological studiesusing the f_gas technique. we discussed briefly whether the equipartition andnon-equipartition models near the shock region can be distinguished by futureradio observations with, for example, alma.

1006.0262	the impact of non-equipartition on cosmological parameter estimation  from sunyaev-zel'dovich surveys	the collisionless accretion shock at the outer boundary of a galaxy clustershould primarily heat the ions instead of electrons since they carry most ofthe kinetic energy of the infalling gas. near the accretion shock, the densityof the intracluster medium is very low and the coulomb collisional timescale islonger than the accretion timescale. electrons and ions may not achieveequipartition in these regions. numerical simulations have shown that thesunyaev-zel'dovich observables (e.g., the integrated comptonization parametery) for relaxed clusters can be biased by a few percent. the y-mass relation canbe biased if non-equipartition effects are not properly taken into account.using a set of hydrodynamical simulations, we have calculated three potentialsystematic biases in the y-mass relations introduced by non-equipartitioneffects during the cross-calibration or self-calibration when using the galaxycluster abundance technique to constraint cosmological parameters. we then usea semi-analytic technique to estimate the non-equipartition effects on thedistribution functions of y (y functions) determined from the extendedpress-schechter theory. depending on the calibration method, we find thatnon-equipartition effects can induce systematic biases on the y functions, andthe values of the cosmological parameters omega_8, sigma_8, and the dark energyequation of state parameter w can be biased by a few percent. in particular,non-equipartition effects can introduce an apparent evolution in w of a fewpercent in all of the systematic cases we considered. techniques are suggestedto take into account the non-equipartition effect empirically when using thecluster abundance technique to study precision cosmology. we conclude thatsystematic uncertainties in the y-mass relation of even a few percent canintroduce a comparable level of biases in cosmological parameter measurements.

1010.3062	investigating accretion disk - radio jet coupling across the stellar  mass scale	relationships between the x-ray and radio behavior of black hole x-raybinaries during outbursts have established a fundamental coupling between theaccretion disks and radio jets in these systems. we begin by reviewing theprevailing paradigm for this disk-jet coupling, also highlighting what we knowabout similarities and differences with neutron star and white dwarf binaries.until recently, this paradigm had not been directly tested with dedicatedhigh-angular resolution radio imaging over entire outbursts. moreover, suchhigh-resolution monitoring campaigns had not previously targetted outbursts inwhich the compact object was either a neutron star or a white dwarf. to addressthis issue, we have embarked on the jet acceleration and collimation probe oftransient x-ray binaries (jacpot xrb) project, which aims to use high angularresolution observations to compare disk-jet coupling across the stellar massscale, with the goal of probing the importance of the depth of thegravitational potential well, the stellar surface and the stellar magneticfield, on jet formation. our team has recently concluded its first monitoringseries, including (e)vla, vlba, x-ray, optical, and near-infrared observationsof entire outbursts of the black hole candidate h1743-322, the neutron starsystem aquila x-1, and the white dwarf system ss cyg. here we presentpreliminary results from this work, largely confirming the current paradigm,but highlighting some intriguing new behavior, and suggesting a possibledifference in the jet formation process between neutron star and black holesystems.

1012.0003	the lack of diffuse, nonthermal hard x-ray emission in the coma cluster:  the swift bat's eye view	the coma cluster of galaxies hosts the brightest radio halo known and hastherefore been the target of numerous searches for associated inverse compton(ic) emission, particularly at hard x-ray energies where the ic signal musteventually dominate over thermal emission. the most recent search with thesuzaku hard x-ray detector (hxd) failed to confirm previous ic detections withrxte and bepposax, instead setting an upper limit 2.5 times below theirnonthermal flux. however, this discrepancy can be resolved if the ic emissionis very extended, beyond the scale of the cluster radio halo. usingreconstructed sky images from the 58-month swift bat all sky survey, thefeasibility of such a solution is investigated. building on renaud et al., wetest and implement a method for extracting the fluxes of extended sources,assuming specified spatial distributions. bat spectra are jointly fit with anxmm-newton epic-pn spectrum derived from mosaic observations. we find noevidence for large-scale ic emission at the level expected from the previouslydetected nonthermal fluxes. for all nonthermal spatial distributionsconsidered, which span the gamut of physically reasonable ic models, wedetermine upper limits for which the largest (most conservative) limit is&lt;4.2x10^{-12} erg/s/cm^2 (20-80 kev), which corresponds to a lower limit on themagnetic field b&gt;0.2ug. a nominal flux upper limit of &lt;2.7x10^{-12} erg/s/cm^2,with corresponding b&gt;0.25ug, is derived for the most probable ic distributiongiven the size of the radio halo and likely magnetic field radial profile.

1012.0039	x-ray signatures of non-equilibrium ionization effects in galaxy cluster  accretion shock regions	the densities in the outer regions of clusters of galaxies are very low, andthe collisional timescales are very long. as a result, heavy elements will beunder-ionized after they have passed through the accretion shock. we havestudied systematically the effects of non-equilibrium ionization for relaxedclusters in the lambdacdm cosmology using one-dimensional hydrodynamicsimulations. we found that non-equilibrium ionization effects do not depend oncluster mass but depend strongly on redshift which can be understood byself-similar scaling arguments. the effects are stronger for clusters at lowerredshifts. we present x-ray signatures such as surface brightness profiles andemission lines in detail for a massive cluster at low redshift. in general,soft emission (0.3-1.0 kev) is enhanced significantly by under-ionization, andthe enhancement can be nearly an order of magnitude near the shock radius. themost prominent non-equilibrium ionization signature we found is the o vii and oviii line ratio. the ratios for non-equilibrium ionization and collisionalionization equilibrium models are different by more than an order of magnitudeat radii beyond half of the shock radius. these non-equilibrium ionizationsignatures are equally strong for models with different non-adiabatic shockelectron heating efficiencies. we have also calculated the detectability of theo vii and o viii lines with the future international x-ray observatory (ixo).depending on the line ratio measured, we conclude that an exposure of ~130-380ksec on a moderate-redshift, massive regular cluster with the x-raymicrocalorimeter spectrometer (xms) on the ixo will be sufficient to provide astrong test for the non-equilibrium ionization model.

1109.0154	suzaku observations of iron k-lines from the intracluster medium of the  coma cluster	the coma cluster was observed with an x-ray imaging spectrometer (xis)onboard suzaku in six pointings, including the central x-ray peak region, the14'west offset region, 30'and 34'north-west offset regions, and 44'and60'south-west offset regions. owing to its lower background level, suzaku hasbetter sensitivity to fe k-alpha lines than other satellites. using precise feline measurements, we studied the temperature structure, possible bulk motions,and iron abundance distributions in the intracluster medium (icm). the observedspectra were well-represented by a single-temperature model, and two- or three-temperature model did not improve chi-square substantially. the temperature,derived from k-alpha line ratios of h-like and he-like fe, agree with thosederived from the single-temperature model. because the line ratio is a steepfunction of temperature, the consistency supports the accuracy of temperaturemeasurements conducted with suzaku. within the 34'region, the redshift derivedfrom the central energy of the he-like fe line is consistent with that fromoptical observations, within a calibration error of 18 ev or 818 km/s in theline of sight. this value is smaller than the sound velocity of icm, which is1500 km/s. the central energy of fe lines at the 44'offset region around thengc 4839 subcluster is also consistent with those within the 34'region. theseresults on the temperature and velocity structure suggest that the core of thecluster is in a relaxed state, and non-thermal electrons relevant to the radiohalo are accelerated by intracluster turbulence rather than large-scale shocks.fe abundance is almost constant at 0.4 solar within the 34'region, anddecreases with radius. this value is slightly lower than those of otherclusters, which means the gas have been mixed well during a past mergerassociated with the growth of the cluster.

1207.0506	the swift bat perspective on non-thermal emission in hiflugcs galaxy  clusters	the search for diffuse non-thermal, inverse compton (ic) emission from galaxyclusters at hard x-ray energies has been underway for many years, with mostdetections being either of low significance or controversial. in this work, weinvestigate 14-195 kev spectra from the swift burst alert telescope (bat)all-sky survey for evidence of non-thermal excess emission above theexponentially decreasing tail of thermal emission in the flux-limited hiflugcssample. to account for the thermal contribution at bat energies, xmm-newtonepic spectra are extracted from coincident spatial regions so that both thermaland non-thermal spectral components can be determined simultaneously. we findmarginally significant ic components in six clusters, though after closerinspection and consideration of systematic errors we are unable to claim aclear detection in any of them. the spectra of all clusters are also summed toenhance a cumulative non-thermal signal not quite detectable in individualclusters. after constructing a model based on single-temperature fits to thexmm-newton data alone, we see no significant excess emission above thatpredicted by the thermal model determined at soft energies. this result alsoholds for the summed spectra of various subgroups, except for the subsample ofclusters with diffuse radio emission. for clusters hosting a diffuse radiohalo, a relic, or a mini-halo, non-thermal emission is initially detected atthe \sim5-sigma confidence level - driven by clusters with mini-halos - butmodeling and systematic uncertainties ultimately degrade this significance. inindividual clusters, the non-thermal pressure of relativistic electrons islimited to \sim10% of the thermal electron pressure, with stricter limits forthe more massive clusters, indicating that these electrons are likely notdynamically important in the central regions of clusters.

1211.4823	merger shocks in abell 3667 and the cygnus~a cluster	we present new xmm-newton observations of the northwest (nw) radio relicregion in the cluster abell 3667. we detect a jump in the x-ray surfacebrightness and x-ray temperature at the sharp outer edge of the radio relicwhich indicate that this is the location of a merger shock with a mach numberof about 2. comparing the radio emission to the shock properties implies thatapproximately 0.2% of the dissipated shock kinetic energy goes intoaccelerating relativistic electrons. this is an order of magnitude smaller thanthe efficiency of shock acceleration in many galactic supernova remnants, whichmay be due to the lower mach numbers of cluster merger shocks. the x-ray andradio properties indicate that the magnetic field strength in the radio relicis &gt;= 3 mug, which is a very large field at a projected distance of ~2.2 mpcfrom the center of a cluster. the radio spectrum is relatively flat at theshock, and steepens dramatically with distance behind the shock. this isconsistent with radiative losses by the electrons and the post-shock speeddetermined from the x-ray properties. the cygnus a radio source is located in amerging cluster of galaxies. this appears to be an early-stage merger. ourrecent suzaku observation confirm the presence of a hot region between the twosubclusters which agrees with the predicted shocked region. the high spectralresolution of the ccds on suzaku allowed us to measure the radial component ofthe merger velocity, delta v_r \approx 2650 km/s.

1302.2907	suzaku x-ray observations of the accreting ngc 4839 group of galaxies  and the radio relic in the coma cluster	based on suzaku x-ray observations, we study the hot gas around the ngc4839group of galaxies and the radio relic in the outskirts of the coma cluster. wefind a gradual decline in the gas temperature from 5 kev around ngc4839 to 3.6kev at the radio relic, across which there is a further, steeper drop down to1.5 kev. this drop as well as the observed surface brightness profile areconsistent with a shock with mach number m = 2.2 pm 0.5 and velocity vs = (1410pm 110) km s^-1. a lower limit of b &gt; 0.33 mu g is derived on the magneticfield strength around the relic from upper limits to inverse compton x-rayemission. although this suggests that the non-thermal electrons responsible forthe relic are generated by diffusive shock acceleration (dsa), the relationbetween the measured mach number and the electron spectrum inferred from radioobservations are inconsistent with that expected from the simplest,test-particle theory of dsa. nevertheless, dsa is still viable if it isinitiated by the injection of a pre-existing population of non-thermalelectrons. combined with previous measurements, the temperature profile of comain the southwest direction is shallower outside ngc4839 and also slightlyshallower in the outermost region. the metal abundance around ngc4839 isconfirmed to be higher than in its vicinity, implying a significant peak in theabundance profile that decreases to 0.2 solar toward the outskirts. weinterpret these facts as due to ram pressure stripping of metal-enriched gasfrom ngc4839 as it falls into coma. the relic shock may result from thecombined interaction of pre-existing intracluster gas, gas associated with ngc4839, and cooler gas flowing in from the large-scale structure filament in thesouthwest.

0802.3695	the impact of galaxy cluster mergers on cosmological parameter  estimation from surveys of the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect	sensitive surveys of the cosmic microwave background will detect thousands ofgalaxy clusters via the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect. two sz observables, thecentral or maximum and integrated comptonization parameters y_max and y, relatein a simple way to the total cluster mass, which allow the construction of massfunctions (mfs) that can be used to estimate cosmological parameters such asomega_m, sigma_8, and the dark energy parameter w. however, clusters form fromthe mergers of smaller structures, events that can disrupt the equilibrium ofintracluster gas upon which sz-m relations rely. from a set ofn-body/hydrodynamical simulations of binary cluster mergers, we calculate theevolution of y and y_max over the course of merger events and find that bothparameters are transiently "boosted," primarily during the first core passage.we then use a semi-analytic technique developed by randall et al. (2002) toestimate the effect of merger boosts on the distribution functions yf and yf ofy and y_max, respectively, via cluster merger histories determined fromextended press-schechter (ps) merger trees. we find that boosts do not inducean overall systematic effect on yfs, and the values of omega_m, sigma_8, and wwere returned to within 2% of values expected from the nonboosted yfs. theboosted yfs are significantly biased, however, causing omega_m to beunderestimated by 15-45%, sigma_8 to be overestimated by 10-25%, and w to bepushed to more negative values by 25-45%. we confirm that the integrated szeffect, y, is far more robust to mergers than y_max, as previously reported bymotl et al.

0803.1680	xmm-newton and chandra observations of abell 2626: interacting radio  jets and cooling core with jet precession?	we present a detailed analysis of the xmm-newton and chandra observations ofabell 2626 focused on the x-ray and radio interactions. within the region ofthe radio mini-halo (~70 kpc), there are substructures which are probablyproduced by the central radio source and the cooling core. we find that thereis no obvious correlation between the radio bars and the x-ray image. themorphology of abell 2626 is more complex than that of the standard x-ray radiobubbles seen in other cool core clusters. thus, abell 2626 provides a challengeto models for the cooling flow -- radio source interaction. we identified twosoft x-ray (0.3--2 kev) peaks with the two central cd nuclei; one of them hasan associated hard x-ray (2--10 kev) point source. we suggest that the twosymmetric radio bars can be explained by two precessing jets ejected from anagn. beyond the central regions, we find two extended x-ray sources to thesouthwest and northeast of the cluster center which are apparently associatedwith merging subclusters. the main abell 2626 cluster and these two subclustersare extended along the direction of the perseus-pegasus supercluster, and wesuggest that abell 2626 is preferentially accreting subclusters and groups fromthis large-scale structure filament. we also find an extended x-ray sourceassociated with the cluster s0 galaxy ic 5337; the morphology of this sourcesuggests that it is infalling from the west, and is not associated with thesouthwest subcluster, as had been previously suggested.

0803.1772	an infrared survey of brightest cluster galaxies. ii: why are some  brightest cluster galaxies forming stars?	quillen et al.(2007) presented an imaging survey with the {\it spitzer spacetelescope} of 62 brightest cluster galaxies with optical line emission locatedin the cores of x-ray luminous clusters. they found that at least half of thesesources have signs of excess infrared emission. here we discuss the nature ofthe ir emission and its implications for cool core clusters. the strength ofthe mid-ir excess emission correlates with the luminosity of the opticalemission lines. excluding the four systems dominated by an agn, the excessmid-infrared emission in the remaining brightest cluster galaxies is likelyrelated to star formation. the mass of molecular gas (estimated from coobservations) is correlated with the ir luminosity as found for normal starforming galaxies. the gas depletion time scale is about 1 gyr. the physicalextent of the infrared excess is consistent with that of the optical emissionline nebulae. this supports the hypothesis that the star formation occurs inmolecular gas associated with the emission line nebulae and with evidence thatthe emission line nebulae are mainly powered by ongoing star formation. we finda correlation between mass deposition rates (${\dot m}_x$) estimated from thex-ray emission and the star formation rate estimated from the infraredluminosity. the star formation rates are 1/10 to 1/100 of the mass depositionrates suggesting that the re-heating of the icm is generally very effective inreducing the amount of mass cooling from the hot phase but not eliminating itcompletely.

0806.0626	deep chandra x-ray observations of low mass x-ray binary candidates in  the early-type galaxy ngc 4697	chandra x-ray observations routinely resolve tens to hundreds of low-massx-ray binaries (lmxbs) per galaxy in nearby massive early-type galaxies. thesestudies have raised important issues regarding the behavior of this populationof remnants of the once massive stars in early-type galaxies, namely theconnection between lmxbs and globular clusters (gcs) and the nature of the lmxbluminosity function (lf). in this paper, we combine five epochs of chandraobservations and one central field hubble space telescope advance camera forsurveys observation of ngc 4697, one of the nearest, optically luminouselliptical (e6) galaxies, to probe the gc-lmxb connection and lmxb-lf down to adetection/completeness limit of (0.6/1.4) x 10^{37} ergs/s. we detect 158sources, present their luminosities and hardness ratios, and associate 34 lmxbswith gcs. we confirm that gcs with higher encounter rates (\gamma_h) and reddercolors (higher metallicity z) are more likely to contain gcs, and find that theexpected number of lmxbs per gc is proportional to \gamma_h^{0.79+0.18/-0.15}z^{0.50+0.20/-0.18}, consistent with fainter x-ray sources in galactic gcs andlmxbs in virgo early-type galaxies. approximately 11+/-2% / 8 +/-2% of gcs inngc 4697 contain an lmxb at the detection/completeness limit. we propose thatthe larger proportion of metal-rich gcs in ngc 4697 compared to the milky wayexplains why these fractions are much higher than those of the milky way atsimilar luminosities. we confirm that a broken power-law is the best fit to thelmxb-lf, although we cannot rule out a cutoff power-law, and argue that thisraises the possibility that there is no universal form for the lmxb-lf inearly-type galaxies. we find marginal evidence for different lfs of lmxbs ingcs and the field and different spectra of gc-lmxbs and field-lmxbs.

0806.3747	suzaku observation of the ophiuchus galaxy cluster: one of the hottest  cool core clusters	we present the analysis of a suzaku observation of the ophiuchus galaxycluster. we confirmed that the cluster has a cool core. while the temperatureof the intracluster medium (icm) decreases toward the center, the metalabundance increases. except for the core (r&lt;~50 kpc), the cluster is hot (~9-10kev) and is almost isothermal for r&lt;~1 mpc; the latter contradicts a previousstudy. we do not detect the variation of the redshift of the icm in thecluster; the upper limit of the velocity difference is 3000 km s^-1. the ironline ratios in x-ray spectra indicate that the icm has reached the ionizationequilibrium state. from these results, we conclude that the ophiuchus clusteris not a major merger cluster but one of the hottest clusters with a cool core.we obtain the upper limit of non-thermal emission from the cluster, which isconsistent with both the recent claimed detection with integral and the recentupper limits with the swift/bat. if the cluster has bright non-thermal emissionas suggested by the integral measurement, it is probably not due to a recentmajor cluster merger.

astro-ph;0005258	time-dependence of the mass accretion rate in cluster cooling flows	we analyze two time-dependent cluster cooling flow models in sphericalsymmetry. the first assumes that the intracluster gas resides in a staticexternal potential, and includes the effects of optically thin radiativecooling and mass deposition. this corresponds to previous steady-state coolingflow models calculated by white &amp; sarazin (1987). detailed agreement is foundbetween steady-state models and time-dependent models at fixed times in thesimulations. the mass accretion rate is found either to increase or remainnearly constant once flows reach a steady state. the time rate of change of theaccretion rate is strongly sensitive to the value of the mass depositionparameter q, but only mildly sensitive to the ratio beta of gravitationalbinding energy to gas temperature. we show that previous scaling argumentspresented by bertschinger (1988) and white (1988) are valid only for maturecooling flows with weak mass deposition (q ~&lt; 1). the second set of modelsincludes the effects of a secularly deepening cluster potential and secondaryinfall of gas from the hubble flow. we find that such heating effects do notprevent the flows from reaching a steady state within an initial centralcooling time.

astro-ph;0009448	resolving the mystery of x-ray faint elliptical galaxies: chandra x-ray  observations of ngc 4697	chandra observations of the x-ray faint elliptical galaxy ngc 4697 resolvemuch of the x-ray emission (61% within one effective radius) into ~80 pointsources, of which most are low mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs). these lmxbs providethe bulk of the hard emission and much of the soft emission as well. of theremaining unresolved emission, it is likely that about half is from fainterlmxbs, while the other half (~23% of the total emission) is from interstellargas. three of the resolved sources are supersoft sources. in the outer regionsof ngc 4697, eight of the lmxbs (about 25%) are coincident with candidateglobular clusters, which indicates that globulars have a high probability ofcontaining x-ray binaries compared to the normal stellar population. the x-rayluminosities (0.3-10 kev) of the resolved lmxbs range from ~5e37 to ~2.5e39ergs/s. the luminosity function of the lmxbs has a "knee" at 3.2e38 ergs/s,which is roughly the eddington luminosity of a 1.4 m_sun neutron star (ns);this knee might be useful as a distance indicator. the highest luminositysource has the eddington luminosity of a ~20 m_sun black hole (bh). thepresence of this large population of ns and massive bh stellar remnants in thiselliptical galaxy shows that it (or its progenitors) once contained a largepopulation of massive main sequence stars.

astro-ph;0010070	the contribution of euv from clusters of galaxies to the cosmic ionizing  background	recent observations with the extreme ultraviolet explorer (euve) suggest thatat least some clusters of galaxies are luminous sources of extreme ultraviolet(euv) radiation. it is not clear yet whether euv emission is a general featureof clusters; for the purposes of limiting the contribution to the backgroundradiation, we assume that it is true of most clusters. assuming that the sourceof the euv emission is inverse compton (ic) scattering of the cosmic microwavebackground photons by relativistic electrons, we construct a simple model forthe expected average emission from clusters as a function of their mass and theredshift of interest. press-schechter theory is used to determine the abundanceof clusters of various masses as a function of redshift. we determine theamount of background radiation produced by clusters. the total mean intensity,spectrum, and the ionization rates for hi and heii are determined at presentand at a variety of redshifts. because clusters form by the merger of smallersubclusters, the amount of euv background radiation should be larger at presentthan in the past. we compare our results to the ionizing background expectedfrom quasars. we find that while clusters do contribute a significant euvbackground, it is less than a percent of that expected from quasars.

astro-ph;0104070	chandra x-ray observations of the x-ray faint elliptical galaxy ngc 4697	(abridged) a chandra acis s3 observation of the x-ray faint elliptical galaxyngc 4697 resolves much of the x-ray emission (61% of the counts from within oneeffective radius) into 90 point sources, of which ~80 are low mass x-raybinaries (lmxbs) associated with this galaxy. the dominance of lmxbs indicatesthat x-ray faint early-type galaxies have lost much of their interstellar gas.on the other hand, a modest portion of the x-ray emission from ngc 4697 is dueto hot gas. the x-ray emitting gas in ngc 4697 has a rather low temperature (kt= 0.29 kev). the emission from the gas is very extended, with a much flattersurface brightness profile than the optical light, and has an irregular,l-shaped morphology. x-ray spectra of the resolved sources and diffuse emissionshow that the soft x-ray spectral component, found in this and other x-rayfaint ellipticals with {\it rosat}, is due to interstellar gas. the cumulativelmxb spectrum is well-fit by thermal bremsstrahlung at kt = 8.1 kev, without asignificant soft component. three of the resolved sources in ngc 4697 aresupersoft sources. in the outer regions of ngc 4697, seven of the lmxbs (about20%) are coincident with candidate globular clusters, which indicates thatglobulars have a high probability of containing x-ray binaries compared to thenormal stellar population. the luminosity function of the lmxbs has a ``knee''at 3.2 x 10^38 ergs/s, which is approximately the eddington luminosity of a 1.4msun neutron star (ns). this knee appears to be a characteristic feature of thelmxb population of early-type galaxies, and we argue that it separates blackhole and ns binaries. this characteristic luminosity could be used as adistance estimator.

astro-ph;0105418	the physics of cluster mergers	clusters of galaxies generally form by the gravitational merger of smallerclusters and groups. major cluster mergers are the most energetic events in theuniverse since the big bang. some of the basic physical properties of mergerswill be discussed, with an emphasis on simple analytic arguments rather thannumerical simulations. semi-analytic estimates of merger rates are reviewed,and a simple treatment of the kinematics of binary mergers is given. mergersdrive shocks into the intracluster medium, and these shocks heat the gas andshould also accelerate nonthermal relativistic particles. x-ray observations ofshocks can be used to determine the geometry and kinematics of the merger. manyclusters contain cooling flow cores; the hydrodynamical interactions of thesecores with the hotter, less dense gas during mergers are discussed. as a resultof particle acceleration in shocks, clusters of galaxies should contain verylarge populations of relativistic electrons and ions. electrons with lorentzfactors gamma~300 (energies e = gamma m_e c^2 ~ 150 mev) are expected to beparticularly common. observations and models for the radio, extremeultraviolet, hard x-ray, and gamma-ray emission from nonthermal particlesaccelerated in these mergers are described.

astro-ph;0107210	off-axis cluster mergers: effects of a strongly peaked dark matter  profile	(abridged) we present a parameter study of offset mergers between clusters ofgalaxies. using the eulerian hydrodynamics/n-body code cosmos, we simulatemergers between nonisothermal, hydrostatic clusters with a steep central darkmatter density profile and a beta-model gas profile. we constrain globalproperties of the model clusters using observed cluster statisticalrelationships. we consider impact parameters between zero and five times thescale radius and mass ratios of 1:1 and 1:3. the morphological changes,relative velocities, and temperature jumps we observe agree with previousstudies using the king profile for the dark matter. we observe a larger jump inx-ray luminosity (~4-10x) than in previous work, and we argue that thisincrease is most likely a lower limit due to our spatial resolution. weemphasize that luminosity and temperature jumps due to mergers may have animportant bearing on constraints on omega derived from the observation of hotclusters at high redshift. shocks are relatively weak in the cluster cores;hence they do not significantly increase the entropy there. instead, shockscreate entropy in the outer regions, and this high-entropy gas is mixed withthe core gas during later stages of the merger. ram pressure initiates mixingby displacing the core gas from its potential center, causing it to becomeconvectively unstable. the resulting convective plumes produce large-scaleturbulent motions with eddy sizes up to several 100 kpc. this turbulence ispumped by dark matter-driven oscillations in the gravitational potential. evenafter nearly a hubble time these motions persist as subsonic turbulence in thecluster cores, providing 5-10% of the support against gravity.

astro-ph;0107493	untangling the x-ray emission from the sa galaxy ngc1291 with chandra	we present a chandra acis-s observation of the nearby bulge-dominated sagalaxy ngc1291. the x-ray emission from the bulge resembles the x-ray emissionfrom a sub-class of elliptical and s0 galaxies with low l_x/l_b luminosityratios. the x-ray emission is composed of a central point-like nucleus, ~50point sources that are most likely low mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs), and diffusegas detectable out to a radius of 120" (5.2 kpc). the diffuse gas has a globaltemperature of 0.32^{+0.04}_{-0.03} kev and metallicity of 0.06 +/- 0.02 solar,and both quantities marginally decrease with increasing radius. the hot gasfills the hole in the hi distribution, and the softening of the spectrum of thex-ray gas with radius might indicate a thermal coupling of the hot and coldphases of the interstellar medium as previously suggested. the integrated x-rayluminosity of the lmxbs, once normalized by the optical luminosity, is a factorof 1.4 less than in the elliptical galaxy ngc4697 or s0 galaxy ngc1553. thedifference in l_{x,stellar}/l_b between the galaxies appears to be because of alack of very bright sources in ngc1291. no sources above 3 x 10^38 ergs/s werefound in ngc1291 when ~7 were expected from scaling from ngc4697 and ngc1553.the cumulative l_{x,stellar}/l_b value including only sources below 1.0 x 10^38ergs/s is remarkably similar between ngc1291 and ngc4697, if a recent surfacebrightness fluctuation-determined distance is assumed for ngc4697. if this is acommon feature of the lmxb population in early-type systems, it might be usedas a distance indicator. finally, a bright, variable (1.6-3.1 x 10^39 ergs/s)source was detected at the optical center of the galaxy. its spectrum showsexcess soft emission superimposed on a highly absorbed power law component,similar to what has been found in several other low luminosity agn (abridged).

astro-ph;0108369	nonthermal emission from accreting and merging clusters of galaxies	we compare the nonthermal emission from clusters of galaxies undergoing minormergers (``accreting'' clusters) and major mergers (``merging'' clusters). foraccreting clusters, the radial distribution of the nonthermal emission in theclusters is also calculated. the relativistic electrons, which are the originof the nonthermal radiation through inverse compton (ic) and synchrotronmission, are assumed to be accelerated at shocks produced by accretion ormergers. we estimate the typical accretion rate and merger probabilityaccording to a hierarchical clustering model. we show that the total luminosityof ic emission from accreting and merging clusters are similar. on the otherhand, the luminosity of synchrotron radio emission of the former is muchsmaller than that of the latter. we show that about 10% of clusters at z~0should have hard x-ray and radio nonthermal emissions due to their last majormerger, which are comparable to or dominate those due to ongoing accretion.moreover, 20-40% of clusters should have significant euv emission due to theirlast merger. we also investigate the case where the criterion of mergers isrelaxed. if we extend the definition of a merger to an increase in the mass ofthe larger subcluster by at least 10% of its initial mass, about 20-30% ofclusters at z~0 should have hard x-ray and radio nonthermal emissions due tothe merger even in a low density universe. we compare the results withobservations. we find that the observed euv emission from clusters is notattributed to accretion. if the diffuse radio emission observed in clusters issynchrotron emission from electrons accelerated via accretion or merging, themagnetic fields of clusters are generally as small as ~0.1 mu g.

astro-ph;0201325	hot bubbles in cooling flow clusters	as more cooling flow clusters of galaxies with central radio sources areobserved with the chandra and xmm-newton x-ray observatories, more examples of"bubbles" (low-emission regions in the x-ray coincident with radio emission)are being found. these bubbles are surrounded by bright shells of x-rayemission, and no evidence of current strong shocks has yet been found. using ananalytic approach and some simplifying assumptions, we derive expressionsrelating the size and location of a bubble, as well as the density contrastbetween the bubble and the ambient medium, with the shock history of thebubble. these can be applied straightforwardly to new observations. we findthat existing observations are consistent with a mild shock occurring in thepast, and with the bulk of the cool material in the x-ray shells being cooledat the cluster center and then pushed outward by the radio source. strongshocks are ruled out unless they occurred more than 1 gyr ago. we also discussrayleigh-taylor instabilities as well as the case of a bubble expanding into anolder bubble produced from a previous cycle of radio activity.

astro-ph;0204172	x-ray binaries and globular clusters in elliptical galaxies	the x-ray emission from normal elliptical galaxies has two major components:soft emission from diffuse gas and harder emission from populations ofaccreting (low-mass) stellar x-ray binaries (lmxb). if lmxb populations aretied to the field stellar populations in galaxies, their total x-rayluminosities should be proportional to the optical luminosities of galaxies.however, recent asca and chandra x-ray observations show that the globalluminosities of lmxb components in ellipticals exhibit significant scatter at agiven optical luminosity. this scatter may reflect a range of evolutionarystages among lmxb populations in ellipticals of different ages. if so, theratio of the global lmxb x-ray luminosity to the galactic optical luminosity,l_lmxb/l_opt, may be used to determine when the bulk of stars were formed inindividual ellipticals. to test this, we compare variations in l_lmxb/l_opt forlmxb populations in ellipticals to optically-derived estimates of stellar agesin the same galaxies. we find no correlation, implying that l_lmxb/l_optvariations are not good age indicators for ellipticals. alternatively, lmxbsmay be formed primarily in globular clusters (through stellar tidalinteractions), rather than in the stellar fields of galaxies. since ellipticalgalaxies exhibit a wide range of globular cluster populations for a givengalaxian luminosity, this may induce a dispersion in the lmxb populations ofellipticals with similar optical luminosities. indeed, we find thatl_lmxb/l_opt ratios for lmxb populations are strongly correlated with thespecific globular cluster frequencies in elliptical galaxies. this suggeststhat most lmxbs were formed in globular clusters.

astro-ph;0204188	chandra observations of the disruption of the cool core in abell 133	we present the analysis of a chandra observation of the galaxy cluster abell133, which has a cooling flow core, a central radio source, and a diffuse,filamentary radio source which has been classified as a radio relic.  the x-ray image shows that the core has a complex structure. the mostprominent feature is a "tongue" of emission which extends from the central cdgalaxy to the northwest and partly overlaps the radio relic. one possibility isthat this tongue is produced by kelvin-helmholtz (kh) instabilities through theinteraction between the cold gas around the cd galaxy and hot intraclustermedium. we estimate the critical velocity and time scale for the kh instabilityto be effective for the cold core around the cd galaxy. we find that the khinstability can disrupt the cold core if the relative velocity is &gt;~400 kms^-1. we compare the results with those of clusters in which sharp, undisruptedcold fronts have been observed; in these clusters, the low temperature gas intheir central regions has a more regular distribution. in contrast to abell133, these cluster cores have longer timescales for the disruption of the coreby the kh instability when they are normalized to the timescale of the cdgalaxy motion. thus, the other cores are less vulnerable to kh instability.another possible origin of the tongue is that it is gas which has been upliftedby a buoyant bubble of nonthermal plasma that we identify with the observedradio relic. from the position of the bubble and the radio estimate of the ageof the relic source, we estimate avelocity of ~700 km s^-1 for the bubble. thestructure of the bubble and this velocity are consistent with numerical modelsfor such buoyant bubbles.

astro-ph;0206161	the effect of merger boosts on the luminosity, temperature, and inferred  mass functions of clusters of galaxies	in the standard cold dark matter model of structure formation, massiveclusters form via the merger of smaller clusters. n-body/hydrodynamicalsimulations of merging galaxy clusters have shown that mergers can temporarilyboost the x-ray luminosity and temperature of the merged cluster above theequilibrium values for the merged system. the cumulative effect of these"merger boosts" will affect the observed x-ray luminosity functions (xlfs) andtemperature functions (tfs) of clusters. merger boosts may bias the values ofsigma_8 and omega_0 inferred from cluster xlfs and tfs if virial equilibrium isassumed. we use a semi-analytic technique to estimate the effect of mergerboosts on the x-ray luminosity and temperature functions. the boosts fromindividual mergers are derived from n-body/hydrodynamical simulations ofmergers. the statistics of the merger histories of clusters are determined fromextended press-schechter (ps) merger trees. we find that merger boosts canincrease the apparent number of hot, luminous clusters. for example, in auniverse with omega_0 = 0.3 and omega_lambda = 0.7 at a redshift of z=1, thenumber of clusters with temperatures t &gt; 10 kev is increased by a factor of9.5, and the number of clusters with luminosities l_x &gt; 5x10^44 h^-2 erg/s isincreased by a factor of 8.9. we have used our merger-boosted tfs and xlfs toderive the cosmological structure parameters sigma_8 and omega_0 by fittingpress-schechter equilibrium relations to local (z=0) and distant (either z=0.5or z=1) cluster samples. merger boosts cause sigma_8 to be overestimated byabout 20%. the matter density parameter omega_0 may be underestimated by about20%, although this result is less clear.

astro-ph;0211027	chandra observation of the cooling flow cluster abell 2052	we present an analysis of the chandra x-ray observation of abell 2052,including large scale properties of the cluster as well as the central regionwhich includes the bright radio source, 3c 317. we present temperature andabundance profiles using both projected and deprojected spectral analyses. thecluster shows the cooling flow signatures of excess surface brightness above abeta- model at the cluster center, and a temperature decline into the center ofthe cluster. the heavy element abundances initially increase into the center,but decline within 30 arcsec. temperature and abundance maps show that thex-ray bright shells surrounding the radio source are the coolest and leastabundant regions in the cluster. the mass-deposition rate in the cooling flowis 26 &lt; mdot &lt; 42 msun/yr. this rate is ~ a factor of three lower than therates found with previous x-ray observatories. based on a stellar populationanalysis using imaging and spectra at wavelengths spanning the far uv to thenir, we find a star formation rate of 0.6 msun/yr within a 3 arcsec radius ofthe nucleus of the central cluster galaxy. total and gas mass profiles for thecluster are also determined. we investigate additional sources of pressure inthe x-ray holes formed by the radio source, and limit the temperature of anyhot, diffuse, thermal component which provides the bulk of the pressure in theholes to kt &gt; 20 kev. we calculate the magnetic field in the bright-shellregion and find b ~ 11 \mug. the current luminosity of the central agn is l_x =7.9 x 10^41 erg/s, and its spectrum is well-fitted by a power-law model with noexcess absorption above the galactic value. the energy output from severalradio outbursts, occurring episodically over the lifetime of the cluster, maybe sufficient to offset the cooling flow near the center.

astro-ph;0306157	chandra observations of the central region of abell 3112	we present the results of a {\it chandra} observation of the central regionof abell 3112. this cluster has a powerful radio source in the center and wasbelieved to have a strong cooling flow. the x-ray image shows that theintracluster medium (icm) is distributed smoothly on large scales, but hassignificant deviations from a simple concentric elliptical isophotal model nearthe center. regions of excess emission appear to surround two lobe-likeradio-emitting regions. this structure probably indicates that hot x-ray gasand radio lobes are interacting. from an analysis of the x-ray spectra inannuli, we found clear evidence for a temperature decrease and abundanceincrease toward the center. the x-ray spectrum of the central region isconsistent with a single-temperature thermal plasma model. the contribution ofx-ray emission from a multiphase cooling flow component with gas cooling tovery low temperatures locally is limited to less than 10% of the totalemission. however, the whole cluster spectrum indicates that the icm is coolingsignificantly as a whole, but in only a limited temperature range ($\geq 2$kev). inside the cooling radius, the conduction timescales based on the spitzerconductivity are shorter than the cooling timescales. we detect an x-ray pointsource in the cluster center which is coincident with the optical nucleus ofthe central cd galaxy and the core of the associated radio source. the x-rayspectrum of the central point source can be fit by a 1.3 kev thermal plasma anda power-law component whose photon index is 1.9. the thermal component isprobably plasma associated with the cd galaxy. we attribute the power-lawcomponent to the central agn.

astro-ph;0307125	low mass x-ray binaries and globular clusters in early-type galaxies	(abridged) a high fraction of the low mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs) inearly-type galaxies are associated with globular clusters (gcs). here, wediscuss the correlations between lmxbs and gcs in a sample of four early-typegalaxies. there is some evidence that the fraction of lmxbs associated with gcs(f_x-gc) increases along the hubble sequence from spiral bulges to s0s to es tocds. on the other hand, the fraction of globular clusters which contain x-raysources appears to be roughly constant at f_gc-x ~ 4%. there is a strongtendency for the x-ray sources to be associated with the optically moreluminous gcs. however, this correlation is consistent with a constantprobability of finding a lmxb per unit optical luminosity; it seems to resultprimarily from the larger number of stars in optically luminous gcs. theprobability of finding a bright lmxb per unit optical luminosity in the gcs isabout 1.5e-7 lmxbs per l_solar,i for l_x &gt;~ 1e38 erg/s, and rises to about2.0e-7 lmxbs per l_solar,i at lower x-ray luminosities, l_x &gt;~ 3e37 erg/s. thisfrequency appears to be roughly constant for different galaxies, including thebulges of the milky way and m31. there is a tendency for the x-ray sources tobe found preferentially in redder gcs. this seems to indicate that theevolution of x-ray binaries in a gc is affected either by the metallicity orage of the gc, with younger and/or more metal rich gcs having more lmxbs. thereis a weak tendency for the brightest lmxbs, whose luminosities exceed theeddington luminosity for a 1.4 m_solar neutron star, to avoid gcs. that mayindicate that black hole x-ray are somewhat less likely to be found in gcs, asseems to be true in our galaxy.

astro-ph;0309633	cooling of x-ray emitting gas by heat conduction in the center of  cooling flow clusters	we study the possibility that a large fraction of the gas at temperatures of\~10^7 k in cooling flow clusters cools by heat conduction to lowertemperatures, rather than by radiative cooling. we argue that this process,when incorporated into the so-called "moderate cooling flow model", where theeffective age of the intracluster medium is much lower than the age of thecluster, reduces substantially the expected x-ray luminosity from gas residingat temperatures of &lt;10^7 k. in this model, the radiative mass cooling rate ofgas at ~10^7 k inferred from x-ray observations, which is &lt;20 % of the masscooling rates cited in the past, is easily met. the heat conduction isregulated by reconnection between the magnetic field lines in cold (~10^4 k)clouds and the field lines in the intracluster medium. a narrow conductionfront is formed, which, despite the relatively low temperature, allowsefficient heat conduction from the hot icm to the cold clouds. the reconnectionbetween the field lines in cold clouds and those in the intracluster mediumoccurs only when the magnetic field in the icm is strong enough. this occursonly in the very inner regions of cooling flow clusters, at r~10-30 kpc. thelarge ratio of the number of h\alpha photons to the number of cooling hydrogenatoms is explained by this scenario.

astro-ph;0405425	chandra observation of the central region of the cooling flow cluster  abell 262: a radio source that is a shadow of its former self?	we present a chandra observation of the cooling flow cluster abell 262.spectral fits show that the intracluster medium (icm) in a262 cools by a factorof three from 2.7 kev to 0.9 kev at the cluster center. a mass deposition rateof mdot = 19 +6/-5 msun/yr is measured. complex structure is found in the veryinner regions of the cluster, including knots of emission and a clear deficitof emission to the east of the cluster center. the bright x-ray structures arelocated in the same regions as optical line emission, indicating that coolingto low temperatures has occurred in these regions. the x-ray deficit isspatially coincident with the eastern radio lobe associated with the activegalactic nucleus hosted by the central cd galaxy. the region surrounding thex-ray hole is cool, and shows no evidence that it has been strongly shocked.this joins the ranks of other cooling flow clusters with chandra-detectedbubbles blown by central radio sources. this source is different than the otherwell-known cases, in that the radio source is orders of magnitude less luminousand has produced a much smaller bubble. comparing the energy output of theradio source with the luminosity of the cooling gas shows that energytransferred to the icm from the radio source is insufficient to offset thecooling flow unless the radio source is currently experiencing a less powerfulthan average outburst, and was more powerful in the past.

astro-ph;0407596	xmm-newton observations of a133: a weak shock passing through the cool  core	we use xmm-newton observations of the cluster of galaxies a133 to study thex-ray spectrum of the intracluster medium (icm). we find a cold front to thesoutheast of the cluster core. from the pressure profile near the cold front,we derive an upper limit to the velocity of the core relative to the rest ofthe cluster of &lt;230 km s^-1. our previous chandra image of a133 showed acomplex, bird-like morphology in the cluster core. based on the xmm-newtonspectra and hardness ratio maps, we argue that the wings of this structure area weak shock front. the shock was probably formed outside the core of thecluster, and may be heating the cluster core. our chandra image also showed a``tongue'' of relatively cool gas extending from the center of the cd to thecenter of the radio relic. the xmm-newton results are consistent with the ideathat the tongue is the gas which has been uplifted by a buoyant radio bubbleincluding the radio relic to the northwest of the core. alternatively, thetongue might result from a cluster merger. the small velocity of the coresuggests that the bubble including the relic has moved by buoyancy, rather thanby motions of the core or the icm. we do not find clear evidence for nonthermalx-ray emission from the radio relic. based on the upper limit on the inversecompton emission, we derive a lower limit on the magnetic field in the relic ofb&gt;~1.5\mu g.

astro-ph;0408068	the complex cooling core of abell 2029: radio and x-ray interactions	we present an analysis of chandra observations of the central regions of thecooling flow cluster abell 2029. we find a number of x-ray filaments in thecentral 40 kpc, some of which appear to be associated with the currently activecentral radio galaxy. the outer southern lobe of the steep-spectrum radiosource appears to be surrounded by a region of cool gas and is at leastpartially surrounded by a bright x-ray rim similar to that seen around radiosources in the cores of other cooling flow clusters. spectroscopic fits showthat the overall cluster emission is best fitted by either a two temperaturegas (kt_high=7.47 kev, kt_low=0.11 kev), or a cooling flow model with gascooling over the same temperature range. this large range of temperatures (overa factor of 50) is relatively unique to abell 2029 and may suggest that thissystem is a very young cooling flow where the gas has only recently startedcooling to low temperatures. the cooling flow model gives a mass depositionrate of mdot=56 +16/-21 msun/yr. in general, the cluster emission is elongatedalong a position angle of 22 degrees with an ellipticity of 0.26. thedistribution of the x-ray emission in the central region of the cluster isasymmetric, however, with excess emission to the north-east and south-eastcompared to the south-west and north-west, respectively. fitting andsubtracting a smooth elliptical model from the x-ray data reveals a dipolarspiral excess extending in a clockwise direction from the cluster core to radiiof ~150 kpc. we estimate a total mass of m_spiral ~6 x 10^12 msun in the spiralexcess. the most likely origins of the excess are either stripping of gas froma galaxy group or bare dark matter potential which has fallen into the cluster,or sloshing motions in the cluster core induced by a past merger.

astro-ph;9612049	high resolution x-ray spectra of cluster cooling flows	the cooling cores of clusters of galaxies are among the brightest thermalx-ray line sources in the universe. high resolution x-ray spectra would allowindividual line fluxes to be measured. the fluxes of low ionization x-ray linesin cooling flows should be directly proportional to the cooling rate atrelatively cool temperatures, and could be used to determine whether largeamounts of gas are really cooling out of the x-ray band (below 10e6 k). bycomparing the fluxes of many x-ray lines, we could determine the amounts of gasat different temperatures and densities. this would allow one to test the ideathat cooling flows are highly inhomogeneous, as required to explain theirsurface brightness profiles. high resolution x-ray spectra can be used todetermine velocities in the hot gas in cooling flows. if the gas ishomogeneous, significant inflow velocities are expected. however, if the gas isas inhomogeneous as we currently believe, the inflow velocities are likely tobe rather low (v &lt; 30 km/s). most of the central galaxies in cooling flows hostradio sources, and it appears that the radio lobes are expanding against,displacing, and compressing the cooling x-ray gas. significant motionsassociated with the expansion of radio sources should be detectable in x-raylines. if the cooling x-ray gas rotates and viscosity is not important,rotational motions may also be detectable in x-ray line spectra.

astro-ph;9612052	cluster cooling flows: recent progress and outstanding questions	recent results on cluster cooling flows are reviewed. observations of excesssoft x-ray provides the only direct evidence for a major repository for thecooled gas. unfortunately, the frequency of occurrence of large excess columnsis uncertain. there is also great uncertainty about the physical state of thematerial producing the absorption. radio observations have ruled out most formsof cold gas. recent radio observations show that the plasma in cooling flows isstrong magnetized. models for cooling flows including the dynamical effects ofthe magnetic field are needed. we also need to understand what ultimatelyhappens to the advected magnetic flux. at present, it appears most likely thatthe field is by field line reconnection. the radio sources associated with thecentral galaxies in cluster cooling flows seem to come in two varieties. thereare ``lobe-dominated sources'' with strong radio jets and well-defined radiolobes, and ``amorphous'' sources without strong jets or lobes. in thelobe-dominated sources, the radio pressures agree approximately with thepressures of the x-ray emitting thermal gas, the x-ray and radio imagesanticorrelate, and the radio sources are highly polarized and have very largefaraday rotations. in the amorphous sources, the radio pressures are muchsmaller than the x-ray pressures, the x-ray and radio images correlate, and theradio sources are strongly depolarized. these results suggest that the lobes inthe lobe-dominated sources have displaced the x-ray emitting gas, while in theamorphous sources, the radio and thermal plasma are mixed.

astro-ph;9612054	x-ray emission from elliptical galaxies	elliptical galaxies are generally luminous sources of x-ray radiation, andcontain large amounts of hot, interstellar gas. in the brighter x-ray galaxies,the inferred masses of hot gas are consistent with those expected given thepresent rates of stellar mass loss. the required rates of heating of the gasare also roughly consistent with those expected from the motions of gas losingstars. x-ray observations, particularly x-ray spectra, require a low rate oftype ia supernova heating and chemical enrichment in the gas. in the brightestx-ray galaxies, the cooling times in the gas are short, which suggests that thegas forms steady-state cooling flows. steady cooling models explain most of theproperties of the brighter x-ray galaxies, including their luminosities, thex-ray--optical correlation, their temperatures, and their surface brightnessprofiles. although the optical and x-ray luminosities of early-type galaxiesare strongly correlated, there is a large dispersion in this correlation. theorigin of the emission in the x-ray faint ellipticals is less certain. allellipticals appear to have a hard x-ray spectral component due to accretingbinary systems. x-ray faint ellipticals also have a very soft x-ray component,which may be residual hot interstellar gas. the x-ray spectra of ellipticalsindicate that the abundance of iron is well below the solar value, whichimplies that the rate of type ia supernova contamination is small. theabundances and evidence for gradient gradients suggest that stellar abundancegradients and inflow of the gas affect the x-ray spectra.

astro-ph;9712049	extreme ultraviolet emission from clusters of galaxies: inverse compton  radiation from a relic population of cosmic ray electrons?	we suggest that the luminous extreme ultraviolet (euv) emission which hasbeen detected recently from clusters of galaxies is inverse compton (ic)scattering of cosmic microwave background (cmb) radiation by low energy cosmicray electrons in the intracluster medium. the cosmic ray electrons would havelorentz factors of gamma ~ 300, and would lose energy primarily by emitting euvradiation. these particles have lifetimes comparable to the hubble time; thus,the electrons might represent a relic population of cosmic rays produced bynonthermal activity over the history of the cluster. the ic model naturallyexplains the observed increase in the ratio of euv to x-ray emission withradius in clusters. the required energy in cosmic ray electrons is typically1--10% of the thermal energy content of the intracluster gas. we suggest thatthe cosmic ray electrons might have been produced by supernovae in galaxies, byradio galaxies, or by particle acceleration in intracluster shocks.

astro-ph;9712073	low mass x-ray binaries as the source of the very soft x-ray emission in  the x-ray faintest early-type galaxies	the x-ray emission from the faintest x-ray elliptical and s0 galaxies ischaracterized by a hard ~5 kev component, and a very soft ~0.2 kev component.the hard component has generally been regarded as the integrated emission fromlow mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs), but the origin of the soft component isunknown. we present evidence which suggests that lmxbs also exhibit a softcomponent, which is responsible for the very soft x-ray emission in thefaintest early-type galaxies. this soft component is present in two galacticlmxbs which lie in directions of low galactic hydrogen column densities, and inlmxbs in the bulge of m31, which comprise a majority of the x-ray emission inthe bulge of that galaxy. the x-ray spectral characteristics and x-ray-to-blueluminosity ratios of the bulges of m31 and the sa galaxy ngc 1291 are verysimilar to those of the x-ray faintest early-type galaxies, indicating thatlmxbs are responsible for both soft and hard components in the latter. inaddition, a low temperature interstellar medium might be present in some x-rayfaint galaxies.

astro-ph;9804210	rosat x-ray colors and emission mechanisms in early-type galaxies	the x-ray colors and x-ray-to-optical luminosity ratios (l_x/l_b) of 61early- type galaxies observed with the rosat pspc are determined. the colorsindicate that the x-ray spectral properties of galaxies vary as a function ofl_x/l_b. the brightest x-ray galaxies have colors consistent with thermalemission from hot gas with roughly the same metallicity of 50% solar. thespatial variation of the colors indicates that the gas temperature in thesegalaxies increases radially. galaxies with medium l_x/l_b also have spectralproperties consistent with emission from hot gas. if a simple one-componentthermal model is assumed to describe the 0.1-2.0 kev x-ray emission in thesegalaxies, then one possible explanation for the progressive decrease in l_x/l_bamong galaxies of this class could be the progressive decrease in metalabundance of the x-ray emitting contained by the galaxies. galaxies with thelowest l_x/l_b values appear to be lacking a hot interstellar component. theirx-ray colors are consistent with those derived from the bulges of the spiralgalaxies m31 and ngc1291. in m31 the x-ray emission is resolved into discretesources, and is apparently due primarily to low mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs). wetherefore suggest that the bulk of the x-ray emission in the faintestellipticals is also due to lmxbs. previously, the x-ray spectra of x-ray faintgalaxies had been found to be described by a hard component which wasattributed to lmxb emission, and a very soft component of unknown origin. weshow that the very soft component also likely results from lmxbs, as a verysoft component is seen in the x-ray spectra of the nearby lmxb her x-1 andlmxbs in the bulge of m31.

astro-ph;9810465	an alignment effect in fr i radio galaxies: u-band polarimetry of the  abell 2597 cluster central galaxy	we have obtained u-band polarimetry of the spatially extended, blue opticalcontinuum associated with the fr i radio source pks 2322-122. pks 2322-122 islocated in the abell 2597 cluster central galaxy. we find a three sigma upperlimit to the degree of polarization of the optical continuum of less than 6%.this limit is inconsistent with the blue continuum being primarily scatteredlight or synchrotron radiation. we can therefore exclude models which attributethe blue continuum to scattered light from an active nucleus that is hiddenfrom direct view. essentially all of the data pertaining to the blue continuumalong the radio source-the ``blue lobes''-indicate that they are regions ofrecent star formation that may have been induced by an interaction between theradio source and the cool ($&lt;10^4$ k), surrounding gas. we compare therestframe u-band polarized luminosities and 1.4 ghz radio powers of a2597 anda1795 to those for several high redshift radio galaxies exhibiting thealignment effect. we suggest that the fundamental property distinguishing somepowerful, high redshift radio galaxies exhibiting the alignment effect, and thelower-power, fr i radio galaxies in cooling flows that exhibit the blue lobephenomenon, is the strength of the agn.

astro-ph;9901061	the energy spectrum of primary cosmic ray electrons in clusters of  galaxies and inverse compton emission	models for the evolution of the integrated energy spectrum of primary cosmicray electrons in clusters of galaxies have been calculated, including theeffects of losses due to inverse compton (ic), synchrotron, and bremsstrahlungemission, and coulomb losses to the intracluster medium (icm). the combinedtime scale for these losses reaches a maximum of ~3e9 yr for electrons with alorentz factor ~300. only clusters in which there has been a substantialinjection of relativistic electrons since z &lt;~ 1 will have any significantpopulation of primary cosmic ray electrons at present. in typical models, thereis a broad peak in the electron energy distribution extending to gamma~300, anda steep drop in the electron population beyond this. in clusters with currentparticle injection, there is a power-law tail of higher energy electrons withan abundance determined by the current rate of injection. a significantpopulation of electrons with gamma~300, associated with the peak in theparticle loss time, is a generic feature of the models. the ic and synchrotronemission from these models was calculated. in the models, euv and soft x-rayemission are nearly ubiquitous. this emission is produced by electrons withgamma~300. the spectra are predicted to drop rapidly in going from the euv tothe x-ray band. the ic emission also extends down the uv, optical, and ir bandswith a fairly flat spectrum. hard x-ray (hxr) and diffuse radio emission due tohigh energy electrons (gamma~10e4) is present only in clusters which havecurrent particle acceleration. assuming that the electrons are accelerated inicm shocks, one would only expect diffuse hxr/radio emission in clusters whichare currently undergoing a large merger.

astro-ph;9902330	rosat hri x-ray observations of the open globular cluster ngc 288	a rosat hri x-ray image was obtained of the open globular cluster ngc 288,which is located near the south galactic pole. this is the first deep x-rayimage of this system. we detect a low luminosity globular cluster x-ray source(llgcx) rxj005245.0-263449 with an x-ray luminosity of (5.5+-1.4)x10^32 ergs/s(0.1-2.0 kev), which is located very close to the cluster center. there isevidence for x-ray variability on a time scale of &lt;~ 1 day. the presence ofthis llgcx in such an open cluster suggests that dense stellar systems withhigh interaction rates are not needed to form llgcxs. we also searched fordiffuse x-ray emission from ngc 288. upper limits on the x-ray luminosities arel_x^h &lt; 9.5x10^32 ergs/s (0.52-2.02 kev) and l_x^s &lt; 9.3x10^32 ergs/s(0.11-0.41 kev). these imply upper limits to the diffuse x-ray to optical lightratios in ngc 288 which are lower than the values observed for x-ray faintearly-type galaxies. this indicates that the soft x-ray emission in thesegalaxies is due either to a component which is not present in globular clusters(e.g., interstellar gas, or a stellar component which is not found in lowmetallicity population ii systems), or to a relatively small number of brightlow mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs).

astro-ph;9903119	x-ray absorption due to cold gas in cluster cooling cores	we have calculated the emergent x-ray properties for models of clustercooling flows including the effects of accumulated cooled material. the opacityof this cooled gas can reduce the overall x-ray luminosity of the cooling flow,and values of mdot based on these luminosities can underestimate the true valueby factors of ~2. we find that accumulated cooled material can produce emergentsurface brightness profiles much like those observed even for nearlyhomogeneous gas distributions. consequently, much more of the gas may becooling below x-ray emitting temperatures in the central regions of coolingflows (r &lt; 10 kpc) than one would infer from observed x-ray surface brightnessprofiles assuming the gas was optically thin. similarly, the central densitiesand pressures in cooling flows may have been underestimated. we show thatdistributed absorption in cooling flows produces a number of observable effectsin the spectrum which may allow it to be differentiated from absorption due togas in our galaxy. these include a characteristic suppression of the continuumbelow ~2 kev, absorption features such as a redshifted o k-edge, and diminishedintensity of resonance emission lines. spectra including the effects ofintrinsic absorption are not well fit by foreground absorbing models.attempting to fit such models to the spatially resolved spectra can lead tounderestimates of the true absorbing column by factors of 3-20. fits tointegrated spectra of the entire cooling flow region can either underestimateor overestimate the mass of the absorbing gas depending on the specifics of themodel. we discuss the potential detection of these effects with axaf, xmm, andastro-e.

astro-ph;9906272	models for the relativistic electron population and nonthermal emission  in clusters of galaxies	models for the integrated relativistic electron population in clusters ofgalaxies are presented. the results depend on the history of electronacceleration in the cluster. if there is no present particle acceleration orother sources, then no high energy electrons (gamma &gt;~ 300, e &gt;~ 150 mev)should be present due to inverse compton (ic) losses. high energy electrons arepresent if particle acceleration is occurring at present, perhaps as a resultof a cluster merger shock. the resulting ic, synchrotron, and gamma-rayemission from these models has been calculated. in the models, extremeultraviolet (euv) and very soft x-ray emission are a nearly ubiquitous feature,because this emission comes from ic by electrons with the longest lifetimes inclusters. diffuse uv and optical emission is also expected in most clusters,but at levels which will be difficult to observe. hard x-ray tails and diffuseradio synchrotron emission are only expected in clusters with recent or currentparticle acceleration; for example, this acceleration might be due tointracluster merger shocks. gamma-ray observations at energies of around 100mev should detect both the dominant population of relativistic electrons andthe corresponding ions. the predicted fluxes are easily detectable with glast.

astro-ph;9909308	limits on the diffuse radio and hard x-ray emission of abell 2199	the westerbork northern sky survey (wenss) and the nrao/vla sky survey (nvss)were used to determine an upper limit to the diffuse radio flux from the nearbycluster abell 2199. for the entire cluster, this limit is &lt;3.25 jy at 327 mhzfrom wenss; for the inner 15' radius, the limit is &lt;168 mjy at 1.4 ghz. theselimits are used to constrain the cluster magnetic field by requiring that theradio flux be consistent with the hard x-ray (hxr) flux observed by bepposax,assuming that the observed hxr excess is due to inverse compton (ic) scatteringof cosmic microwave background photons by relativistic electrons in theintracluster gas. we find that the magnetic field must be very weak (&lt;0.073 ug)in order to avoid producing an observable radio halo. we also consider thepossibility that the hxr excess is due to nonthermal bremsstrahlung (ntb) by apopulation of suprathermal electrons which are being accelerated to higherenergies. we find that a ntb model based on a power-law electron momentumdistribution with an exponent of mu~3.3 and containing about 5% of the numberof electrons in the thermal icm can reproduce the observed hxr flux.

astro-ph;9911335	nonthermal bremsstrahlung and hard x-ray emission from clusters of  galaxies	we have calculated nonthermal bremsstrahlung (ntb) models for the hard x-ray(hxr) tails recently observed by bepposax in clusters of galaxies. in thesemodels, the hxr emission is due to suprathermal electrons with energies ofabout 10-200 kev. under the assumption that the suprathermal electrons formpart of a continuous spectrum of electrons including highly relativisticparticles, we have calculated the inverse compton (ic) extreme ultraviolet(euv), hxr, and radio synchrotron emission by the extensions of the samepopulations. for accelerating electron models with power-law momentum spectra(n[p] propto p^{- mu}) with mu &lt;~ 2.7, which are those expected from strongshock acceleration, the ic hxr emission exceeds that due to ntb. thus, thesemodels are only of interest if the electron population is cut-off at some upperenergy &lt;~1 gev. similarly, flat spectrum accelerating electron models producemore radio synchrotron emission than is observed from clusters if the icmmagnetic field is b &gt;~ 1 mug. the cooling electron model produces vastly toomuch euv emission as compared to the observations of clusters. we have comparedthese ntb models to the observed hxr tails in coma and abell 2199. the ntbmodels require a nonthermal electron population which contains about 3% of thenumber of electrons in the thermal icm. if the suprathermal electron populationis cut-off at some energy above 100 kev, then the models can easily fit theobserved hxr fluxes and spectral indices in both clusters. for acceleratingelectron models without a cutoff, the electron spectrum must be rather steep &gt;~2.9.

0812.1438	hard x-ray properties of the merging cluster abell 3667 as observed with  suzaku	wide-band suzaku data on the merging cluster abell 3667 were examined forhard x-ray emission in excess to the known thermal component. suzaku detectedx-ray signals in the wide energy band from 0.5 to 40 kev. the hard x-ray (&gt; 10kev) flux observed by the hxd around the cluster center cannot be explained bya simple extension of the thermal emission with average temperature of ~7 kev.the emission is most likely an emission from a very hot (kt &gt; 13.2 kev) thermalcomponent around the cluster center, produced via a strong heating process inthe merger. in the north-west radio relic, no signature of non-thermal emissionwas observed. using the hxd, the overall upper-limit flux within a 34'x34'field-of-view around the relic is derived to be 5.3e-12 erg s-1 cm-2 in the10-40 kev band, after subtracting the icm contribution estimated using the xisor the xmm-newton spectra. directly on the relic region, the upper limit isfurther tightened by the xis data to be less than 7.3e-13 erg s-1 cm-2, whenconverted into the 10--40 kev band. the latter value suggest that the averagemagnetic field within the relic is higher than 1.6 ug. the non-thermal pressuredue to magnetic fields and relativistic electrons may be as large as ~20% ofthe thermal pressure in the region.
