0706.1944	on the nature of optical nuclei in fr i radio-galaxies from acs/hst  imaging polarimetry	we obtained optical imaging polarimetry with the acs/hrc aboard the hst ofthe 9 closest radio-galaxies in the 3c catalogue with an fr i morphology. thenuclear sources seen in direct hst images in these galaxies are found to behighly polarized with levels in the range ~2-11 % with a median value of 7 %.we discuss the different mechanisms that produce polarized emission andconclude that the only viable interpretation is a synchrotron origin for theoptical nuclei. this idea is strengthened by the analogy with the polarizationproperties of bl lac objects, providing also further support to the fri/bl lacunified model. this confirms previous suggestions that the dominant emissionmechanism in low luminosity radio-loud agn is related to non-thermal radiationproduced by the base of their jets. in addition to the nuclear polarization(and to the large scale optical jets), polarization is detected co-spatiallywith the dusty circumnuclear disks, likely due to dichroic transmission; thepolarization vectors are tangential to the disks as expected when the magneticfield responsible for the grains alignment is stretched by differentialrotation. we explored the possibility to detect the polarimetric signature of amisaligned radiation beam in fr i, expected in our sources in the frame of thefr i/ bl lac unification. we did not find this effect in any of the galaxies,but our the results are not conclusive on whether a misaligned beam is indeedpresent in fr i.

0902.2002	low-power radio galaxies in the distant universe: a search for fri at  1&lt;z&lt;2 in the cosmos field	we present a search for fri radio galaxies between 1 &lt; z &lt; 2 in the cosmosfield. in absence of spectroscopic redshift measurements, the selection methodis based on multiple steps which make use of both radio and opticalconstraints. the basic assumptions are that 1) the break in radio power betweenlow-power fris and the more powerful friis does not change with redshift, and2) that the photometric properties of the host galaxies of low power radiogalaxies in the distant universe are similar to those of friis in the sameredshift bin, as is the case for nearby radio galaxies. we describe the resultsof our search, which yields 37 low-power radio galaxy candidates that arepossibly fris. we show that a large fraction of these low-luminosity radiogalaxies display a compact radio morphology, that does not correspond to thefri morphological classification. furthermore, our objects are apparentlyassociated with galaxies that show clear signs of interactions, at odds withthe typical behavior observed in low-z fri hosts. the compact radio morphologymight imply that we are observing intrinsically small and possibly youngobjects, that will eventually evolve into the giant fris we observe in thelocal universe. one of the objects appears as point-like in hst images. thismight belong to a population of fri-qsos, which however would represent a tinyminority of the overall population of high-z fris. as for the local fris, alarge fraction of our objects are likely to be associated with groups orclusters, making them "beacons" for high redshift clusters of galaxies. oursearch for candidate high-z fris we present in this paper constitutes a pilotstudy for objects to be observed with future high-resolution andhigh-sensitivity instruments (shortened)

0906.4776	hst/acs emission line imaging of low redshift 3cr radio galaxies i: the  data	we present 19 nearby (z&lt;0.3) 3cr radio galaxies imaged at low- andhigh-excitation as part of a cycle 15 hubble space telescope snapshot surveywith the advanced camera for surveys. these images consist of exposures of theh-alpha (6563 \aa, plus [nii] contamination) and [oiii] 5007 \aa emission linesusing narrow-band linear ramp filters adjusted according to the redshift of thetarget. to facilitate continuum subtraction, a single-pointing 60 s line-freeexposure was taken with a medium-band filter appropriate for the target'sredshift. we discuss the steps taken to reduce these images independently ofthe automated recalibration pipeline so as to use more recent acs flat-fielddata as well as to better reject cosmic rays. we describe the method used toproduce continuum-free (pure line-emission) images, and present these imagesalong with qualitative descriptions of the narrow-line region morphologies weobserve. we present h-alpha+[nii] and [oiii] line fluxes from aperturephotometry, finding the values to fall expectedly on the redshift-luminositytrend from a past hst/wfpc2 emission line study of a larger, generally higherredshift subset of the 3cr. we also find expected trends between emission lineluminosity and total radio power, as well as a positive correlation between thesize of the emission line region and redshift. we discuss the associatedinterpretation of these results, and conclude with a summary of future workenabled by this dataset.

0910.4102	a vla radio-survey of early-type galaxies in the virgo cluster	we present the results of a 8.4 ghz very large array radio survey ofearly-type galaxies extracted from the acs virgo cluster survey. the aim ofthis survey is to investigate the origin of radio emission in early-typegalaxies and its link with the host properties in an unexplored territorytoward the lowest levels of both radio and optical luminosities. radio images,available for all 63 galaxies with bt &lt; 14.4, show the presence of a compactradio source in 12 objects, with fluxes spanning from 0.13 to 2700 mjy. theremaining 51 galaxies, undetected at a flux limit of ~0.1 mjy, have radioluminosities l &lt; 4 10e18 w/hz . the fraction of radio-detected galaxies are astrong function of stellar mass, in agreement with previous results: none ofthe 30 galaxies with stellar mass m(star) &lt; 1.7 10e10 m(sun) is detected, while8 of the 11 most massive galaxies have radio cores. there appears to be nosimple relation between the presence of a stellar nucleus and radio emission. amultiwavelength analysis of the active galactic nucleus (agn) emission,combining radio and x-ray data, confirms the link between optical surfacebrightness profile and radio loudness in the sense that the bright coregalaxies are associated with radio-loud agns, while non-core galaxies hostradio-quiet agns. not all radio-detected galaxies have a x-ray nuclear counterpart (and vice-versa). a complete census of agns (and supermassive black holes,smbhs) thus requires observations, at least, in both bands. nonetheless, thereare massive galaxies in the sample, expected to host a large smbh (m(bh) ~ 10e8m(sun)), whose nuclear emission eludes detection despite their proximity andthe depth and the spatial resolution of the available observations. most likelythis is due to an extremely low level of accretion onto the central smbh.

0910.4261	radio and spectroscopic properties of miniature radio galaxies:  revealing the bulk of the radio-loud agn population	we explore radio and spectroscopic properties of a sample of 14 miniatureradio galaxies, i.e. early-type core galaxies hosting radio-loud agn ofextremely low radio power, 10^(27-29) erg s^(-1) hz^(-1) at 1.4 ghz. miniatureradio galaxies smoothly extend the relationships found for the more powerfulfri radio galaxies between emission line, optical and radio nuclearluminosities to lower levels. however, they have a deficit of a factor of ~100in extended radio emission with respect to that of the classical example of3cr/fri. this is not due to their low luminosity, since we found radio galaxiesof higher radio core power, similar to those of 3cr/fri, showing the samebehavior, i.e. lacking significant extended radio emission. such sources formthe bulk of the population of radio-loud agn in the sloan digital sky survey.at a given level of nuclear emission, one can find radio sources with anextremely wide range, a factor of &gt;~100, of radio power. we argue that theprevalence of sources with luminous extended radio structures in flux limitedsamples is due to a selection bias, since the inclusion of such objects ishighly favored. the most studied catalogues of radio galaxies are thus composedby the minority of radio-loud agn that meet the physical conditions required toform extended radio sources, while the bulk of the population is virtuallyunexplored.

0911.0536	an optical spectroscopic survey of the 3cr sample of radio galaxies with  z&lt;0.3. ii. spectroscopic classes and accretion modes in radio-loud agn	we use the emission line measurements of 3cr radio sources with redshift &lt;0.3, to explore their spectroscopic properties. the 3cr sources show a bimodaldistribution of excitation index, a new spectroscopic indicator that measuresthe relative intensity of low and high excitation lines. this unveils thepresence of two main sub-populations of radio-loud agn, high and low excitationgalaxies (heg and leg, respectively). all broad-line objects are heg from thepoint of view of their narrow emission line ratios and all heg are friiradio-galaxies with log l(178) [erg/s] &gt; 32.8. conversely leg cover the wholerange of radio power encompassed by this 3cr subsample (30.7 &lt; log l(178) &lt;35.4) and they are of both fri and frii type. the brightest leg are all frii.heg and leg obey to two (quasi) linear correlations between the optical lineand extended radio luminosities, with heg being brighter than leg in the [oiii]line by a factor of ~10. heg and leg are offset also in a plane that comparesthe black hole mass and the ionizing nuclear luminosity. however, although hegare associated with higher nuclear luminosities, we find leg among thebrightest radio sources of the sample and with a clear frii morphology,indistinguishable from those seen in heg. this suggests that leg are not simplyobjects with a lower level of accretion. we speculate that the differencesbetween leg and heg are related to a different mode of accretion: leg arepowered by hot gas, while heg require the presence of cold accreting material.the high temperature of the accreting gas in leg accounts for the lack of"cold" structures (i.e. molecular torus and broad line region), for the reducedradiative output of the accretion disk, and for the lower gas excitation.[abridged]

1003.2467	hubble space telescope near infrared snapshot survey of 3cr radio source  counterparts iii: radio galaxies and quasars in context	we compare the near-infrared (nir) h band photometric and morphologicalproperties of low-redshift (z&lt;0.3) 3cr radio galaxies with samples of bl lacobject and quasar host galaxies, merger remnants, quiescent ellipticalgalaxies, and brightest cluster galaxies drawn from the literature. in generalthe 3cr host galaxies are consistent with luminous (~l*) elliptical galaxies.the vast majority of fr ii's (~80%) occupy the most massive ellipticals andform a homogeneous population that is comparable to the population ofradio-loud quasar (rlq) host galaxies in the literature. however, a significantminority (~20%) of the 3cr fr ii's appears under-luminous with respect toquasar host galaxies. all fr ii objects in this faint tail are either unusuallyred, or appear to be the brightest objects within a group. we discuss theapparent differences between the radio galaxy and rlq host galaxy populations.rlqs appear to require &gt;1e11 m_sun host galaxies (and ~1e9 m_sun black holes),whereas radio galaxies and rqqs can exist in galaxies down to 3e10 m_sun. thismay be due to biases in the measured quasar host galaxy luminosities orpopulations studied, or due to a genuine difference in host galaxy. if due to agenuine difference, it would support the idea that radio and optical activegalactic nucleii are two separate populations with a significant overlap.

1005.3223	on the spectro-photometric properties of the bulk of the radio-loud agn  population	in a previous paper we showed that the radio sources selected by combininglarge areas radio and optical surveys, present a strong deficit of radioemission with respect to 3cr radio-galaxies matched in line emissionluminosity. we argued that the prevalence of sources with luminous extendedradio structures in high flux limited samples is due to a selection bias.sources with low radio power form the bulk of the radio-loud agn population butare still virtually unexplored.  we here analyze their photometric and spectroscopic properties. from thepoint of view of their emission lines, the majority of the sample are lowexcitation galaxies (leg), similar to the 3cr objects at the same level of lineluminosity. the hosts of leg are red, massive early-type galaxies (etg) withlarge black holes masses , statistically indistinguishable from the hosts oflow redshift 3cr/leg sources. no genuine radio-loud leg could be foundassociated with black holes with a mass substantially lower than 10^8 m(sun) orwith a late type host. the fraction of galaxies with signs of star formation(5%) is similar to what is found in both the quiescent etg and 3cr/leg hosts.we conclude that the deficit in radio emission cannot be ascribed todifferences in the properties of their hosts. we argue that instead this couldbe due to a temporal evolution of the radio luminosity.  a minority (10%) of the sample show rather different properties, beingassociated with low black hole masses, with spiral galaxies, or showing a highexcitation spectrum. in general these outliers are the result of thecontamination from seyfert and from galaxies where the radio emission ispowered by star formation. for the objects with high excitation spectra thereis no a clear discontinuity in either the host or nuclear properties as theyspan from radio-quiet and radio-loud agn.

0704.2100	the host galaxy/agn connection. brightness profiles of early-type  galaxies hosting seyfert nuclei	[abridged] we recently presented evidence of a connection between thebrightness profiles of nearby early-type galaxies and the properties of the agnthey host. the radio loudness of the agn appears to be univocally related tothe host's brightness profile: radio-loud nuclei are only hosted by ``core''galaxies while radio-quiet agn are only found in ``power-law'' galaxies. weextend our analysis here to a sample of 42 nearby (v &lt; 7000 km/s) seyfertgalaxies hosted by early-type galaxies. we used the available hst images tostudy their brightness profiles. having excluded complex and highly nucleatedgalaxies, in the remaining 16 objects the brightness profiles can besuccessfully modeled with a nuker law with a steep nuclear cusp characteristicof ``power-law'' galaxies (with logarithmic slope 0.51 - 1.07). this result iswhat is expected for these radio-quiet agn based on our previous findings, thusextending the validity of the connection between brightness profile and radioloudness to agn of a far higher luminosity. we explored the robustness of thisresult against a different choice of the analytic form for the brightnessprofiles, using a sersic law. in no object could we find evidence of a centrallight deficit with respect to a pure sersic model, the defining feature of``core'' galaxies in this modeling framework. we conclude that, regardless ofthe modeling strategy, the dichotomy of agn radio loudness can be univocallyrelated to the host's brightness profile. our general results can be re-phrasedas ``radio-loud nuclei are hosted by core galaxies, while radio-quiet agn arefound in non-core galaxies''.

1103.3652	emission lines in early-type galaxies: active nuclei or stars?	we selected 27244 nearby, red, giant early-type galaxies (rges) from thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). in a large fraction (53%) of their spectra the[o iii] emission line is detected, with an equivalent width (ew) distributionstrongly clustered around ~0.75 a. the vast majority of those rges for which itis possible to derive emission line ratios (amounting to about half of thesample) show values characteristic of liners. the close connection betweenemission lines and stellar continuum points to stellar processes as the mostlikely source of the bulk of the ionizing photons in rges, rather than activenuclei. in particular, the observed ew and optical line ratios are consistentwith the predictions of models in which the photoionization comes from to hotevolved stars. shocks driven by supernovae or stellar ejecta might alsocontribute to the ionization budget. a minority, ~4%, of the galaxies showemission lines with an equivalent that is width a factor of ~2 greater than thesample median. only among them are seyfert-like spectra found. furthermore, 40%of this subgroup have a radio counterpart, compared to ~6% of the rest of thesample. these characteristics argue in favor of an agn origin for theiremission lines. emission lines diagnostic diagrams do not reveal a distinctionbetween the agn subset and the other members of the sample, and consequentlythey are not a useful tool for establishing the dominant source of the ionizingphotons, which is better predicted by the ew of the emission lines.

1105.1548	an h-alpha nuclear spiral structure in the e0 active galaxy arp102b	we report the discovery of a two-armed mini-spiral structure within the innerkiloparsec of the e0 liner/seyfert 1 galaxy arp102b. the arms are observed inh-alpha emission and located east and west of the nucleus, extending up toabout 1 kpc from it. we use narrow-band imaging from the hubble space telescopeadvanced camera for surveys, in combination with archival vla radio images at3.6 and 6 cm to investigate the origin of the nuclear spiral. from the h-alphaluminosity of the spiral, we obtain an ionized gas mass of the order of onemillion solar masses. one possibility is that the nuclear spiral represents agas inflow triggered by a recent accretion event which has replenished theaccretion disk, giving rise to the double-peaked emission-line profilescharacteristic of arp102b. however, the radio images show a one-sided curvedjet which correlates with the eastern spiral arm observed in the h-alpha image.a published milliarcsecond radio image also shows one-sided structure atposition angle about 40 degrees, approximately aligned with the inner part ofthe eastern spiral arm. the absence of a radio counter-part to the westernspiral arm is tentatively interpreted as indicating that the jet isrelativistic, with an estimated speed of 0.45c. estimates of the jet kineticenergy and the ionizing luminosity of the active nucleus indicate that both arecapable of ionizing the gas along the spiral arms. we conclude that, althoughthe gas in the nuclear region may have originated in an accretion event, themini-spiral is most likely the result of a jet-cloud interaction rather than aninflowing stream.

1109.6196	revisiting the census of low-luminosity agn	the aim of this paper is to revisit critically the current census of agn asderived from optical spectroscopy. we considered the spectra of nearby (z&lt;0.1)galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). the equivalent width (ew)distribution of the [o iii]5007 emission line is strongly clustered around ~0.6a, extending the validity of the results we obtained for red giant ellipticals.the close connection between emission lines and stellar continuum points tostellar processes as the most likely source of the bulk of the ionizing photonsin these galaxies although their emission line ratios are similar to those ofactive nuclei. genuine agn might be sought mainly among the minority (~5-10%)of outliers, i.e., galaxies with ew&gt;~2 a. the galaxies located in the agnregion of the spectroscopic diagnostic diagrams outnumber outliers by a factor5-10 which casts doubts on the accuracy of the current identification of activegalaxies, particularly those of liners of low line luminosity, &lt;~ 10^39-10^40erg/s. this conclusion can be tested by using spectra that covers smallerphysical regions such as those that are already available in the literature ofthe ~500 nearest bright galaxies, with a stellar continuum reduced by a factorof 20-100 with respect to sdss galaxies. if the emission lines were mainly ofagn origin, their contrast against the continuum should be enhanced. instead,their ew distribution is similar to that of the sdss sample, with just anincrease of the outlier fraction. we conclude that the number low-luminosityagn is currently largely overestimated with a sample purity as low as ~10%. asa consequence the properties of low-luminosity agn should be fundamentallyrevised.

1210.4540	spectral energy distributions of low-luminosity radio galaxies at z~1-3:  a high-z view of the host/agn connection	we study the spectral energy distributions, seds, (from fuv to mir bands) ofthe first sizeable sample of 34 low-luminosity radio galaxies at highredshifts, selected in the cosmos field. to model the seds we use two differenttemplate-fitting techniques: i) the hyperz code that only considers singlestellar templates and ii) our own developed technique 2spd that also includesthe contribution from a young stellar population and dust emission. theresulting photometric redshifts range from z ~0.7 to 3 and are in substantialagreement with measurements from earlier work, but significantly more accurate.the sed of most objects is consistent with a dominant contribution from an oldstellar population with an age ~1 - 3 10^{9} years. the inferred total stellarmass range is ~10^{10} - 10^{12} m(sun). dust emission is needed to account forthe 24micron emission in 15 objects. estimates of the dust luminosity yieldvalues in the range l_{dust} ~10^{43.5} -10^{45.5} erg s^{-1}. the global dusttemperature, crudely estimated for the sources with a mir excess, is ~ 300-850k. a uv excess is often observed with a luminosity in the range ~10^{42}-10^{44} erg s^{-1} at 2000 a rest frame.  our results show that the hosts of these high-z low-luminosity radio sourcesare old massive galaxies, similarly to the local fris. however, the uv and mirexcesses indicate the possible significant contribution from star formationand/or nuclear activity in such bands, not seen in low-z fris. our sourcesdisplay a wide variety of properties: from possible quasars at the highestluminosities, to low-luminosity old galaxies.

1301.5757	exploring the spectroscopic properties of relic radiogalaxies	from an optical spectroscopic survey of 3cr radiogalaxies (rgs) with z&lt;0.3,we discovered three objects characterized by an extremely low level of gasexcitation and a large deficit of line emission with respect to rgs of similarradio luminosity. we interpreted these objects as relic active galactic nuclei(agn), i.e., sources observed after a large drop in their nuclear activity. wehere present new spectroscopic observations for these three galaxies and for agroup of "candidate" relics. none of the candidates can be convincinglyconfirmed. from the new data for the three relics, we estimate the density ofthe line-emitting gas. this enables us to explore the temporal evolution of theline ratios after the agn "death". the characteristic timescale is thelight-crossing time of the emission line region, a few thousand years, tooshort to correspond to a substantial population of relic rgs. additionalmechanisms of gas ionization, such as "relic shocks" from their past high powerphase or stellar sources, should also be considered to account for thespectroscopic properties of the relic rgs. relic rgs appear to be a mixed bagof sources in different phases of evolution, including agn recently (~10,000years ago) quenched, galaxies that have been inactive for at least one millionyears, and objects caught during the transition from a powerful rg to a lowpower fri source.

1310.8218	an optical spectroscopic survey of the 3cr sample of radio galaxies with  z&lt;0.3. v. implications for the unified model for friis	we explore the implications of our optical spectroscopic survey of 3cr radiosources with z&lt;0.3 for the unified model (um) for radio-loud agn, focusing onobjects with a frii radio morphology. the sample contains 33 high ionizationgalaxies (higs) and 18 broad line objects (blos). according to the um, higs,the narrow line sources, are the nuclearly obscured counterparts of blos. thefraction of higs indicates a covering factor of the circumnuclear matter of 65%that corresponds, adopting a torus geometry, to an opening angle of 50+/-5degree. no dependence on redshift and luminosity on the torus opening angleemerges. we also consider the implications for a 'clumpy' torus. thedistributions of radio luminosity of higs and blos are not statisticallydistinguishable, as expected from the um. conversely, blos have a radio coredominance, r, more than ten times larger than higs, as expected in case of jetdoppler boosting. modeling the r distributions leads to an estimate of the jetbulk lorentz factor of gamma ~3-5. the test of the um based on the radio sourcesize is not conclusive due to the limited number of objects. studying theemission line ([oiii], [oii]and [oi]) properties of hegs and blos, we findevidences of a narrow line region (nlr) density stratification and its partialobscuration from the torus. in conclusion, the radio and nlr properties of higsand blos are consistent with the um predictions. we also explored the radioproperties of 21 3cr frii low-ionization galaxies (ligs) at z&lt;0.3. we find thatthey cannot be part of the model that unifies higs and blos, but they areinstead intrinsically different source, still reproduced by a randomly orientedpopulation.

(2009)and studied by baldi et al. (2013). the resulting photometric redshifts rangefrom z~0.7 to 3. the sample mostly includes compact radio sources, but also 21friis; the radio power distribution of the sample at 1.4 ghz covers~10^(31.5)-10^(34.3) \erg\s\hz. the stellar mass of the hosts ranges~10^(10)-10^(11.5) m_{sun}. the seds are dominated by the contribution from anold stellar population for most of the sources. uv and mid-ir (mir) excessesare observed for half of the sample. the dust luminosities are in the rangel_(dust) ~10^(43)-10^(45.5) erg/s (t ~350-1200 k). uv luminosities at 2000 aranges ~10^(41.5)-10^(45.5) erg/s. uv emission is significantly correlated withboth ir and radio luminosities, the former being the stronger link. however,the origin of uv and dust emission, whether it is produced by the agn of bystar formation, is still unclear. our results show that this rl agn populationat high redshifts displays a wide variety of properties from possible quasarsat the highest luminosities, to low-luminosity old galaxies, similarly to thelocal fri-frii dichotomy.

1412.0938	molecular gas and nuclear activity in early-type galaxies: any link with  radio-loudness?	aims. we want to study the amount of molecular gas in a sample of nearbyearly-type galaxies (etgs) which host low-luminosity active galactic nuclei(agn). we look for possible differences between the radio-loud (rl) andradio-quiet (rq) agn. methods. we observed the co(1-0) and co(2-1) spectrallines with the iram 30m and nro 45m telescopes for eight galaxies. they belongto a large sample of 37 local etgs which host both rq and rl agn. we gatherdata from the literature for the entire sample. results. we report the newdetection of co(1-0) emission in four galaxies (ugc0968, ugc5617, ugc6946, andugc8355) and co(2-1) emission in two of them (ugc0968 and ugc5617). theco(2-1)/co(1-0) ratio in these sources is $\sim0.7\pm0.2$. considering both thenew observations and the literature, the detection rate of co in our sample is55 $\pm$ 9%, with no statistically significant difference between the hosts ofrl and rq agns. for all the detected galaxies we converted the co luminositiesinto the molecular masses, $m_{h_2}$, that range from 10$^{6.5}$ to 10$^{8.5}$m$_{\odot}$, without any statistically significant differences between rl andrq galaxies. this suggests that the amount of molecular gas does not likely setthe radio-loudness of the agn. furthermore, despite the low statisticalsignificance, the presence of a weak trend between the h$_{2}$ mass withvarious tracers of nuclear activity (mainly [o iii] emission line nuclearpower) cannot be excluded.

1502.00427	a pilot study of the radio-emitting agn population: the emerging new  class of fr0 radio-galaxies	we present the results of a pilot jvla project aimed at studying the bulk ofthe radio-emitting agn population, unveiled by the nvss/first and sdsssurveys.we obtained a-array observations at the jvla at 1.4, 4.5, and 7.5 ghzfor 12 sources of the sdss/nvss sample. the radio maps reveal compactunresolved or slightly resolved radio structures on a scale of 1-3 kpc, withonly one exception of a fri/frii source extended over $\sim$40 kpc. we isolatethe radio core component in most of them. the sample splits into two groups.four sources have small black hole (bh) masses (mostly $\sim$10$^{7}$m$_{\odot}$) and are hosted by blue galaxies, often showing evidence of acontamination from star formation to their radio emission and associated withradio-quiet agn. the second group consists in seven radio-loud agn, which livein red massive ($\sim10^{11}$ m$_{\odot}$) early-type galaxies, with large bhmasses ($\gtrsim$10$^{8}$ m$_{\odot}$), and spectroscopically classified as lowexcitation galaxies, all characteristics typical of fri radio galaxies. theyalso lie on the correlation between radio core power and [o iii] lineluminosity defined by fris. however, they are more core dominated (by a factorof $\sim$30) than fris and show a deficit of extended radio emission. we dubthese sources 'fr0' to emphasize their lack of prominent extended radioemission, the single distinguishing feature with respect to fris. thedifferences in radio properties between fr0s and fris might be ascribed to anevolutionary effect, with the fr0 sources undergoing to rapid intermittencythat prevents the growth of large scale structures. in our preferred scenariothe lack of extended radio emission in fr0s is due to their smaller jet lorentz$\gamma$ factor with respect to fris, causing possible instabilities and theirpremature disruption.[abridged]

1502.01977	spitzer space telescope measurements of dust reverberation lags in the  seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 6418	we present results from a fifteen-month campaign of high-cadence (~ 3 days)mid-infrared spitzer and optical (b and v ) monitoring of the seyfert 1 galaxyngc 6418, with the objective of determining the characteristic size of thedusty torus in this active galactic nucleus (agn). we find that the 3.6 $\mu$mand 4.5 $\mu$m flux variations lag behind those of the optical continuum by$37.2^{+2.4}_{-2.2}$ days and $47.1^{+3.1}_{-3.1}$ days, respectively. wereport a cross-correlation time lag between the 4.5 $\mu$m and 3.6 $\mu$m fluxof $13.9^{+0.5}_{-0.1}$ days. the lags indicate that the dust emitting at 3.6$\mu$m and 4.5 $\mu$m is located at a distance of approximately 1 light-month(~ 0.03 pc) from the source of the agn uv-optical continuum. the reverberationradii are consistent with the inferred lower limit to the sublimation radiusfor pure graphite grains at 1800 k, but smaller by a factor of ~ 2 than thecorresponding lower limit for silicate grains; this is similar to what has beenfound for near-infrared (k-band) lags in other agn. the 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$mreverberation radii fall above the k-band $\tau \propto l^{0.5}$size-luminosity relationship by factors $\lesssim 2.7$ and $\lesssim 3.4$,respectively, while the 4.5 $\mu$m reverberation radius is only 27% larger thanthe 3.6 $\mu$m radius. this is broadly consistent with clumpy torus models, inwhich individual optically thick clouds emit strongly over a broad wavelengthrange.

1503.01259	looking below the floor: constraints on the agn radio luminosity  functions at low power	we constrain the behavior of the radio luminosity function (rlf) of twoclasses of active galactic nuclei (agn) namely agn of low radio power (lrp) andbl lac objects. the extrapolation of the observed steep rlfs to low powerpredicts a space density of such objects that exceeds that of the sources thatcan harbor them and this requires a break to a shallower slope. for lrp agn weobtain p_br,lrp &gt; 10^20.5 w/hz at 1.4 ghz to limit their density to be smallerthan that of elliptical galaxies with black hole masses m_bh &gt; 10^7.5 solarmasses. by combining this value with the limit derived by the observations thebreak must occur at p_br,lrp~10^20.5-10^21.5 w/hz. for bl lacs we findp_br,bllac &gt; 10^23.3 w/hz otherwise they would outnumber the density ofweak-lined and compact radio sources, while the observations indicatep_br,bllac &lt; 10^24.5 w/hz. in the framework of the agn unified model a lowluminosity break in the rlf of lrp agn must correspond to a break in the rlf ofbl lacs. the ratio between p_br,lrp and p_br,bllac is ~10^3, as expected for ajet doppler factor of ~10.

1506.08043	looking for the least luminous bl lac objects	among active galactic nuclei, bl lac objects show extreme properties thathave been interpreted as the effect of relativistic beaming on the emissionfrom a plasma jet oriented close to the line of sight. the doppleramplification of the jet emission makes them ideal targets for studying jetphysics. in particular, low-power bl lacs (lpbl) are very interesting becausethey probe the jet formation and emission processes at the lowest levels ofaccretion. however, they are difficult to identify since their emission isswamped by the radiation from the host galaxy in most observing bands. in thispaper we propose a new lpbl selection method based on the mid-infraredemission, in addition to the traditional optical indices. we considered theradio-selected sample of best &amp; heckman (2012, mnras, 421, 1569) andcross-matched it with the wise all-sky survey. in a new diagnostic planeincluding the w2-w3 color and the dn(4000) index, lpbl are located in a regionscarcely populated by other sources. by filtering objects with small emissionline equivalent width, we isolated 36 lpbl candidates up to redshift 0.15.their radio luminosity at 1.4 ghz spans the range log l_r = 39.2-41.5 [erg/s].considering the completeness of our sample, we analyzed the bl lac luminosityfunction (rlf), finding a dramatic paucity of lpbl with respect to theextrapolation of the rlf toward low power. this requires a break in the rlflocated at log l_r~40.6 [erg/s]. the consequent peak in the bl lacs numberdensity is possibly the manifestation of a minimum power required to launch arelativistic jet.

1507.00164	the naked nuclei of liners	we analyze hst spectra and chandra observations of a sample of 21 liners, atleast 18 of which genuine agn. we find a correlation between the x-rays andemission lines luminosities, extending over three orders of magnitude and witha dispersion of 0.36 dex; no differences emerge between liners with and withoutbroad lines, or between radio-loud and radio-quiet sources. the presence ofsuch a strong correlation is remarkable considering that for half of the samplethe x-ray luminosity can not be corrected for local absorption. this connectionis readily understood since the x-ray light is associated with the same sourceproducing the ionizing photons at the origin of the line emission. this impliesthat we have a direct view of the liners nuclei in the x-rays: thecircumnuclear, high column density structure (the torus) is absent in thesesources. such a conclusion is also supported by mid-infrared data. we suggestthat this is due to the general paucity of gas and dust in their nuclearregions that causes also their low rate of accretion and low bolometricluminosity.

0805.3920	the accretion mechanism in low-power radio galaxies	we study a sample of 44 low-luminosity radio-loud agn, which represent arange of nuclear radio-power spanning 5 orders of magnitude, to unveil theaccretion mechanism in these galaxies. we estimate the accretion rate of gasassociated with their hot coronae by analyzing archival chandra data, to derivethe deprojected density and temperature profiles in a spherical approximation.measuring the jet power from the nuclear radio-luminosity, we find that theaccretion power correlates linearly with the jet power, with an efficiency ofconversion from rest mass into jet power of ~0.012. these results strengthenand extend the validity of the results obtained by allen and collaborators for9 radio galaxies, indicating that hot gas accretion is the dominant process infr i radio galaxies across their full range of radio-luminosity.  we find that the different levels of nuclear activity are driven by globaldifferences in the structure of the galactic hot coronae. a linear relationlinks the jet power with the host x-ray surface brightness. this implies that asubstantial change in the jet power must be accompanied by a global change inits ism properties, driven for example by a major merger. this correlationprovides a simple widely applicable method to estimate the jet-power of a givenobject by observing the intensity of its host x-ray emission.  to maintain the mass flow in the jet, the fraction of gas that crosses thebondi radius reaching the accretion disk must be &gt; 0.002. this implies that theradiative efficiency of the disk must be &lt; 0.005, an indication that accretionin these objects occurs not only at a lower rate, but also at lower efficiencythan in standard accretion disks.

1510.04272	the new class of fr0 radio galaxies	are the fri and frii radio galaxies representative of the radio-loud (rl) agnpopulation in the local universe? recent studies on the local low-luminosityradio sources cast lights on an emerging population of compact radio galaxieswhich lack extended radio emission. in a pilot jvla project, we study thehigh-resolution images of a small but representative sample of this population.the radio maps reveal compact unresolved or slightly resolved radio structureson a scale of 1-3 kpc. we find that these rl agn live in red massive early-typegalaxies, with large black hole masses ($\gtrsim$10$^{8}$ m$_{\odot}$), andspectroscopically classified as low excitation galaxies, all characteristicstypical of fri radio galaxies which they also share the same nuclear luminositywith. however, they are more core dominated (by a factor of $\sim$30) than frisand show a clear deficit of extended radio emission. we call these sources'fr0' to emphasize their lack of prominent extended radio emission. aposteriori, other compact radio sources found in the literature fulfill therequirements for a fr0 classification. hence, the emerging fr0 populationappears to be the dominant radio class of the local universe. considering theirproperties we speculate on their possible origins and the possible cosmologicalscenarios they imply.

1512.05589	testing the blazar sequence with the least luminous bl lacs	in a previous paper, we proposed a new method to select low-power bl lacs(lpbls) based on mid-infrared emission and flux contrast through the ca iispectral break; that study led to the selection of a complete sample formed by34 lpbls with 0.05&lt;z&lt;=0.15 and radio luminosities spanning the range log(l_r) =39.2-41.5 [erg/s]. we now assemble the broadband spectral energy distributions(seds) of these sources to investigate their nature and compare them withbrighter bl lacs. we find that the ratios between the x-ray and radioluminosities range from ~20 to ~30000 and that the synchrotron peak frequenciesspan a wide energy interval, from log(nu_peak)~13.5 to ~20 [hz]. this indicatesa broad variety of sed shapes and a mixture of bl lac flavors. indeed, althoughthe majority of our lpbls are high-energy peaked bl lacs (hbls), we find that aquarter of them are low-energy peaked bl lacs (lbls), despite the fact that thesample is biased against the selection of lbls. the analysis of the median lpblsed confirms disagreement with the blazar sequence at low radio luminosities.furthermore, if we limit the sample to the lbls subsample, we find that theirmedian sed shape is essentially indistinguishable from that of the mostluminous bl lacs. we conclude that the observed radio power is not the maindriving parameter of the multiwavelength properties of bl lacs.

1512.06002	origin of x-shaped radio-sources: further insights from the properties  of their host galaxies	we analyze the properties of a sample of x-shaped radio-sources (xrss). theseobjects show, in addition to the main lobes, a pair of wings producing theirpeculiar radio morphology. we obtain our sample by selecting from the initiallist of cheung (2007, aj, 133, 2097) the 53 galaxies with the better definedwings and with available sdss images. we identified the host galaxies andmeasured their optical position angle, obtaining a positive result in 22 cases.the orientation of the secondary radio structures shows a strong connectionwith the optical axis, with all (but one) wing forming a angle larger than 40degrees with the host major axis. the probability that this is compatible witha uniform distribution is p = 0.9 10e-4. spectra are available from the sdssfor 28 xrss. we modeled them to extract information on their emission lines andstellar population properties. the sample is formed by approximately the samenumber of high and low excitation galaxies (heg and leg); this classificationis essential for a proper comparison with non-winged radio-galaxies. xrssfollow the same relations between radio and line luminosity defined byradio-galaxies in the 3c sample. while in hegs a young stellar population isoften present, this is not detected in the 13 legs, again in agreement with theproperties of non xrss. the lack of young stars in legs support the idea thatthey did not experiences a recent gas rich merger. the connection between theoptical axis and the wings orientation, as well as the stellar population andemission lines properties, provide further support for an hydro-dynamic originof the radio-wings (for example associated with the expansion of the radiococoon in an asymmetric external medium) rather than with a change oforientation of the jet axis.

0705.3642	isophotal structure and dust distribution in radio-loud elliptical  galaxies	we investigate isophotal properties and dust morphology in the nuclearregions of 84 radio galaxies, imaged in the optical and near-infrared as partof hubble space telescope snapshot surveys. we present a sample-wide trendbetween host galaxy isophotal structure and the inclination of dustycircumnuclear disks at the centers of 13 of these objects. we find thatgalaxies containing edge-on disks are invariably seen to possess boxyisophotes, while round, face-on disks are seen exclusively in objects withround or elliptical isophotes. dust-rich sources with disky isophotes areobserved only to possess dust in the form of extended filamentary lanes, andnot in settled distributions like disks. as we do not expect that edge-on andface-on disks reside in different populations of galaxies, we conclude thatperceived isophotal boxiness is dependent upon the angle at which the observerviews the host galaxy's axis of symmetry. we discuss our results in the contextof dissipative merger scenarios, and infer that dusty disks primarily reside inold, boxy remnants of gas-poor galaxy mergers, whereas filamentary dust lanesreside in younger disky remnants of gas-rich mergers.

astro-ph;0002018	the hst view of the fr i / fr ii dichotomy	in order to explore how the fr i / fr ii dichotomy is related to the nuclearproperties of radio galaxies, we studied a complete sample of 26 nearby fr iiradio galaxies using hubble space telescope (hst) images and compared them witha sample of fr i previously analyzed. fr i nuclei lie in the radio-opticalluminosity plane along a tight linear correlation, which argues for a commonsynchrotron origin. fr ii show a more complex behavior, which is howeverclearly related to their optical spectral classification.  broad line fr ii radio galaxies (blrg) are located overall well above the fri correlation, suggesting that a contribution from thermal (disc) emission ispresent. three narrow line (nlrg) and one weak line radio galaxy (wlrg), inwhich no nuclear source is seen, can be interpreted as the obscuredcounter-parts of blrg, in agreement with the current unification schemes.  conversely, in 5 sources of the sample, all of them nlrg or wlrg, opticalcores are located on the same correlation defined by fr i and with similarradio and optical luminosities. this suggests that, in analogy to fr i, theemission is dominated by synchrotron radiation and represents the opticalcounter-part of the non-thermal radio cores. interestingly, all these galaxiesare located in clusters, an environment typical of fr i.  these results imply that, at least at low redshifts, the fr ii population isnot homogeneous. furthermore, the traditional dichotomy between edge darkenedand brightened radio morphology is not univocally connected with the innermostnuclear structure, as we find fr~ii with fr i-like nuclei and this hasinteresting bearings from the point of view of the agn unified models.

astro-ph;0003197	does the unification of bl lac and fr i radio galaxies require jet  velocity structures?	we explore the viability of the unification of bl lacs and fr i radiogalaxies by comparing the core emission of radio galaxies with those of bl lacsof similar extended radio power, taking advantage of the newly measured opticalnuclear luminosity of fr i sources. the spectral properties of complete samplesare also studied in the radio-optical luminosity plane: starting from thespectral energy distribution (sed) of bl lacs, we calculate the predictedluminosity of fr i nuclei in the frame of a simple one--zone model, by properlytaking into account the relativistic transformations. we find that the bulklorentz factors required by the spread in the observed luminosities in allbands are significantly smaller than those implied by other, both observationaland theoretical, considerations. this discrepancy is also reflected in the factthat fr i nuclei are over-luminous by a factor of 10-10^4, with respect to thepredictions, both in the radio and in the optical band.  in order to reconcile these results with the unification scheme, velocitystructures in the jet are suggested, where a fast spine is surrounded by a slow(but still relativistic) layer so that the emission at different angles isdominated by different velocity components: the fast one dominates the emissionin bl lacs while the slow layer dominates the emission in misaligned objects.furthermore for the lowest luminosity bl lacs it has to be also postulated thattheir beaming factor in the radio band is lower than in the optical (andx-ray), as would result from deceleration of the jet.  the self-consistency of the unification model therefore requires that bothintrinsic differences in the sed and different beaming properties play asubstantial role in characterizing the phenomenology of these sources.

astro-ph;0011059	peering through the dust: evidence for a supermassive black hole at the  nucleus of centaurus a from vlt ir spectroscopy	we used the near infrared spectrometer isaac at the eso 'very largetelescope' to map the velocity field of centaurus a (ngc 5128) at severalposition angles and locations in the central 20" of the galaxy. the highspatial resolution (~0.5") velocity fields from both ionized and molecular gas(pabeta, [feii], brgamma, and h2) are not compromised by either excitationeffects or obscuration. we identify three distinct kinematical systems: (i) arotating 'nuclear disk' of ionized gas, confined to the inner 2", thecounterpart of the paalpha feature previously revealed by hst/nicmos imaging;(ii) a ring-like system with a ~6" inner radius detected only in h2, likely thecounterpart of the 100pc-scale structure detected in co by other authors; (iii)a normal extended component of gas rotating in the galactic potential. thenuclear disk is in keplerian rotation around a central mass concentration, dark(m/l&gt;20 msun/lsunk) and point-like at the spatial resolution of the data(r&lt;0.25" ~4pc). we interpret this mass concentration as a supermassive blackhole. its dynamical mass based on the line velocities and disk inclination(i&gt;15deg) is m=2(+3.0;-1.4) 10^8 msun. the ring-like system is probablycharacterized by non-circular motions; a 'figure-of-8' pattern observed in theh2 position-velocity diagram might provide kinematical evidence for thepresence of a nuclear bar.

"relic" radio-galaxies are characterized by extreme low excitationspectra that we interpret as nuclei whose activity has recently turned-off. thefull spectral catalog will be made available to the scientific community.

0808.1555	recent star formation in nearby 3cr radio-galaxies from uv hst  observations	we analyzed hst images of 31 nearby (z &lt;~ 0.1) 3cr radio-galaxies. wecompared their uv and optical images to detect evidence of recent starformation. six objects were excluded because they are highly nucleated or hadvery low uv count rates. after subtracting the emission from their nucleiand/or jets, 12 of the remaining 25 objects, presenting an uv/optical colorsnuv - r &lt; 5.4, are potential star-forming candidates. considering thecontamination from other agn-related processes (uv emission lines, nebularcontinuum, and scattered nuclear light), there are 6 remaining star-forming"blue" galaxies.  we then divide the radio galaxies, on the basis of the radio morphology,radio power, and diagnostic optical line ratios, into low and high excitationgalaxies, leg and heg. while there is no correlation between the fr type (orradio power) and color, the fr type is clearly related to the spectroscopictype. in fact, all heg (with one possible exception) show morphologicalevidence of recent star formation in uv compact knots, extended over 5-20 kpc.conversely, there is only 1 "blue" leg out of 19, including in this class alsofr i galaxies.  the picture that emerges, considering color, uv, optical, and dustmorphology, is that only in heg recent star formation is associated with theserelatively powerful agn, which are most likely triggered by a recent, major,wet merger. conversely, in leg galaxies the fraction of actively star-formingobjects is not enhanced with respect to quiescent galaxies. the agn activity inthese sources can be probably self-sustained by their hot interstellar medium.

astro-ph;0202035	the nuclei of radio galaxies in the uv: the signature of different  emission processes	we have studied the nuclei of 28 radio galaxies from the 3cr sample in the uvband. unresolved nuclei (central compact cores, ccc) are observed in 10 of the13 fr i, and in 5 of the 15 fr ii. all sources that do not have a ccc in theoptical, do not have a ccc in the uv. two fr i (3c 270 and 3c 296) have a cccin the optical but do not show the uv counterpart. both of them show largedusty disks observed almost edge-on, possibly implying that they play a role inobscuring the nuclear emission. we have measured optical-uv spectral indicesalpha_o,uv between ~0.6 and ~7.0. blrg have the flattest spectra and theirvalues of alpha_o,uv are also confined to a very narrow range. this isconsistent with radiation produced in a geometrically thin, optically thickaccretion disk. on the other hand, fr i nuclei, which are most plausiblyoriginated by synchrotron emission from the inner relativistic jet, show a widerange of alpha_o,uv. there is a clear trend with orientation in that sourcesobserved almost edge-on or with clear signs of dust absorption have thesteepest spectra. these observations imply that in fr i obscuration can bepresent, but the obscuring material is not in a ``standard'' geometricallythick torus. the most striking difference between these absorbing structuresand the classic agn ``tori'' resides in the lower optical depth of the fr iobscuring material.

astro-ph;0207654	understanding the nature of frii optical nuclei: a new diagnostic plane  for radio galaxies	we extend our study of the nuclei of 3cr fr ii radio galaxies through hstoptical images up to z=0.3. in the majority of them an unresolved nucleus(central compact core, ccc) is found. we analyze their position in the planeformed by the radio and optical nuclear luminosities in relation to theiroptical spectral properties. the broad-lined objects (blo) have the brightestnuclei: they are present only at optical luminosities nu l_nu &gt; 4 x 10^42 ergs^-1 which we suggest might represent a threshold in the radiative efficiencycombined to a small range of black hole masses. about 40 % of the high and lowexcitation galaxies (heg and leg) show ccc which resemble those previouslydetected in fr i galaxies, in apparent contrast to the unification model. theequivalent width of the [oiii] emission line (with respect to the nuclearluminosity) reveals the nature of these nuclei, indicating that the nuclei ofheg are obscured to our line of sight and only scattered radiation is observed.this implies that the population of fr ii is composed by objects with differentnuclear properties, and only a fraction of them can be unified with quasars.

astro-ph;0307120	the nuclear sed of ngc6251: a bl lac in the center of an fr i radio  galaxy	we determine the nuclear spectral energy distribution (sed) from the radio tothe gamma-ray band for the fr i radio galaxy ngc6251, by using both data fromthe literature and analyzing hst and x-ray archival data. in the log nu - lognu f(nu) representation, the sed has two broad peaks, and it is remarkablysimilar to those of blazars. we show that the low-energy peak can be explainedin terms of synchrotron radiation, while the high energy peak is most plausiblyproduced by inverse compton scattering. this brings direct support to the fri-bl lacs unification model. we model the overall emission in the frame of asynchrotron self-compton scenario, which well describes the sed of bl lacs. themodel parameters we obtain confirm also quantitatively the fr i-bl lacunification model and imply a rather small viewing angle to this source (theta&lt;~ 20deg). ngc6251 is the second radio galaxy, in addition to centaurus a, forwhich a similar analysis has been performed. a significant improvement withrespect to the case of cen a is the absence of obscuration in ngc6251, whichstrengthens the overall result.

astro-ph;0407307	the nuclear radio-optical properties of intermediate redshift frii radio  galaxies and quasars	we extend the study of the nuclei of 3cr objects as seen with the hst tohigher redshift fr ii radio sources (0.4&lt;z&lt;0.6). our results reflect what hasbeen found for fr ii of lower redshift. the position of the nuclei on the planeformed by optical and radio luminosities is related to their optical spectralclassification: the nuclei of both high and low excitation galaxies lie on thecorrelation found for fri sources, while broad-lined objects have a significantoptical excess. the nuclear properties of these sources are better understoodwhen considering the equivalent width of the [oiii] emission line with respectto their optical luminosities. even in the range of redshift considered here,low excitation galaxies show peculiar nuclear properties, more similar to thoseobserved in fr i. this confirms that not all frii are unified with quasars. ourfindings have important implications for the frii-quasar unification scheme: byreconsidering the classification of all 3cr radio galaxies with z&lt;1 in thelight of their nuclear properties, we derive the opening angle of the obscuringtorus for different redshift bins. we find that the covering factor of theobscuring structure decreases as redshift increases (theta ~ 44 deg for z&lt;0.3to theta ~ 56 deg for 0.5&lt;z&lt;1). we argue that this behavior may be interpretedin the framework of the receding torus model, in which the opening angle of thetorus increases as the luminosity of the accretion disk around the centralblack hole increases.

astro-ph;0411081	the supermassive black hole in the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 5252	we present results from hst/stis long-slit spectroscopy of the gas motions inthe nuclear region of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 5252. the observed velocityfield is consistent with gas in regular rotation with superposed localizedpatches of disturbed gas. the dynamics of the circumnuclear gas can beaccurately reproduced by adding to the stellar mass component a compact darkmass of mbh = 0.95 (-0.45;+1.45) 10e9 m(sun), very likely a supermassive blackhole. contrarily to results obtained in similar studies rotational broadeningis sufficient to reproduce also the behaviour of line widths. the mbh estimatedfor ngc 5252 is in good agreement with the correlation between mbh and bulgemass. the comparison with the mbh vs sigma relationship is less stringent(mostly due to the relatively large error in sigma); ngc 5252 is located abovethe best fit line by between 0.3 and 1.2 dex, i.e. 1 - 4 times the dispersionof the correlation. both the galaxy's and mbh of ngc 5252 are substantiallylarger than those usually estimated for seyfert galaxies but, on the otherhand, they are typical of radio-quiet quasars. combining the determined mbhwith the hard x-ray luminosity, we estimate that ngc 5252 is emitting at afraction ~ 0.005 of l(edd). in this sense, this active nucleus appears to be aquasar relic, now probably accreting at a low rate, rather than a low blackhole mass counterpart of a qso.

astro-ph;0412388	probing the nuclear obscuration in radio-galaxies with near infrared  imaging	we present the first near-infrared (k'-band) homogeneous observations of acomplete sub-sample of the 3cr radio catalogue comprising all high excitationgalaxies (hegs) at z&lt;0.3. after showing that the surface brightnessdecomposition technique to measure central point-like sources is affected bysignificant uncertainties for the objects in the studied sample, we present anew, more accurate method based on the r-k' color profile. via this method wefind a substantial nuclear k'-band excess in all but two hegs -- most likelydirectly associated to their nuclear emission -- and we measure thecorresponding 2.12 $\mu$m nuclear luminosities. within the frame of theunification scheme for radio-loud active galactic nuclei, it appears thatobscuration alone is not able to account for the different nuclear propertiesof the majority of the hegs and broad line radio galaxies (blrgs), and alsoscattering of the (optically) hidden nuclear light from a compact region mustbe invoked. more precisely, for ~70% of the hegs the observed point-likeoptical emission is dominated by the scattered component, while in the k'-bandboth scattered and direct light passing through the torus contribute to theobserved nuclear luminosity. the estimated fraction of scattered light rangesfrom a few tenths to a few percent, while the torus extinction is between15&lt;a_{v,torus}&lt;50 mag with only a few exceptions with lower obscuration.

astro-ph;0501461	the hst view of liners nuclei: evidence for a dual population?	we study a complete and distance-limited sample of 25 liners, 21 of whichhave been imaged with the hubble space telescope. in nine objects we detect anunresolved nucleus. in order to study their physical properties, we compare theradio and optical properties of the nuclei of liners with those of othersamples of local agns, namely seyfert galaxies and low-luminosity radiogalaxies (llrg). our results show that the liners population is nothomogeneous, as there are two subclasses: i) the first class is similar tollrg, as it extends the population of radio-loud nuclei to lower luminosities;ii) the second is similar to seyferts, and extends the properties ofradio-quiet nuclei towards the lowest luminosities. the objects are optimallydiscriminated in the plane formed by the black hole mass vs. nuclearradio-loudness: all radio-loud liners have m_bh/m_sun &gt; 10^8, while seyfertsand radio-quiet liners have m_bh/m_sun &lt; 10^8. the different nature of thevarious classes of local agn are best understood when the fraction of theeddington luminosity they irradiate l_o/l_edd is plotted against the nuclearradio-loudness parameter: seyferts are associated with relatively {\it high}radiative efficiencies l_o/l_edd &gt;~ 10^-4 (and high accretion rates onto lowmass black holes); llrg are associated with low radiative efficiencies (and lowaccretion rates onto high black hole masses); all liners have low radiativeefficiency (and accretion rates), and can be radio-loud or radio quietdepending on their black hole mass.

astro-ph;0504568	the hst view of the nuclear emission line region in low luminosity  radio-galaxies	we study the properties of the emission line regions in two samples of lowluminosity radio-galaxies (llrg), focusing on the compact emission line region(celr) revealed to be a characteristic feature of these objects by hstnarrow-band imaging. we find a strong correlation between line and opticalcontinuum nuclear emission, suggesting that the optical cores (most likely ofnon thermal origin) can be directly associated to the source of ionizingphotons, i.e. that we are seeing a jet-ionized narrow line region. a photonbudget argument indicates that the optical nuclear sources produce a sufficientphoton flux provided that the covering factor of the circum-nuclear gas israther large, on average ~ 0.3. analysis of hst images and spectra suggeststhat the celr may take the form of a pc-scale, high filling factor, structure,possibly an optically thin torus. estimates of the celr mass lead to values assmall as 10 - 1000 solar masses and photon counting sets a limit to the blrmass of 0.01 solar masses. when considered together with the low accretion rateand the tenuous torus structure, a general paucity of gas in the innermostregions of llrg emerges as the main characterizing difference from morepowerful agn.

astro-ph;0505034	the infrared-dominated jet of 3c401	we present a hubble space telescope image of the frii radio galaxy 3c 401,obtained at 1.6 microns with the nicmos camera in which we identify theinfrared counterpart of the brightest region of the radio jet. the jet has acomplex radio structure and brightens where bending occurs, most likely as aresult of relativistic beaming. we analyze archival data in the radio, opticaland x-ray bands and we derive its spectral energy distribution. differentlyfrom all of the previously known optical extragalactic jets, the jet in 3c401is not detected in the x-rays even in a long 48ksec x-ray chandra exposure andthe infrared emission dominates the overall sed. we propose that the dominantradiation mechanism of this jet is synchrotron. the low x-ray emission is thencaused by two different effects: i) the lack of any strong external photonfield and ii) the shape of the electron distribution. this affects the locationof the synchrotron peak in the sed, resulting in a sharp cut-off at energieslower than the x-rays. thus 3c401 shows a new type of jet which hasintermediate spectral properties between those of fri, which are dominated bysynchrotron emission up to x-ray energies, and frii/qso, which show a stronghigh-energy emission due to inverse-compton scattering of external photons.this might be a clue for the presence of a continuous ``sequence'' in theproperties of large scale jets, in analogy with the ``blazar sequence'' alreadyproposed for sub-pc scale jets.

astro-ph;0510650	the warped nuclear disk of radio galaxy 3c 449	among radio galaxies containing nuclear dust disks, the bipolar jet axis isgenerally observed to be perpendicular to the disk major axis. the fr i radiosource 3c 449 is an outlier to this statistical majority, as it possesses anearly parallel jet/disk orientation on the sky. we examine the 600 pc dustydisk in this galaxy with images from the hubble space telescope. we find that acolormap of the disk exhibits a twist in its isocolor contours (isochromes). wemodel the colormap by integrating galactic starlight through an absorptivedisk, and find that the anomalous twist in the isochromes can be reproduced inthe model with a vertically thin, warped disk. the model predicts that the diskis nearly perpendicular to the jet axis within 100 pc of the nucleus. wediscuss physical mechanisms capable of causing such a warp. we show thatprecessional models or a torque on the disk arising from a possible binaryblack hole in the agn causes precession on a timescale that is too long toaccount for the predicted disk morphology. however, we estimate that thepressure in the x-ray emitting interstellar medium is large enough to perturbthe disk, and argue that jet-driven anisotropy in the excited ism may be thecause of the warp. in this way, the warped disk in 3c 449 may be a newmanifestation of feedback from an active galactic nucleus.

astro-ph;0603345	the host galaxy/agn connection in nearby early-type galaxies. a new view  of the origin of the radio-quiet/radio-loud dichotomy?	[abridged] this is the third in a series of three papers exploring theconnection between the multiwavelength properties of agn in nearby early-typegalaxies and the characteristics of their hosts. we selected 116 agn candidatesrequiring a radio flux of 1 mjy. we classified the objects with hst images into``core'' and ``power-law'' galaxies, on the basis of the nuclear slope of theirbrightness profiles. we used hst and chandra data to isolate their nuclearemission to study the multiwavelength behaviour of their nuclei. the propertiesof the nuclei hosted by the 29 core galaxies were presented in paper ii. coregalaxies invariably host a radio-loud nucleus, with a median radio-loudness oflog r = 3.6 and an x-ray based radio loudness parameter of log r,x = -1.3. herewe discuss the properties of the nuclei of the 22 ``power-law'' galaxies. theyshow a substantial excess of optical and x-ray emission with respect to coregalaxies at the same level of radio luminosity. conversely, theirradio-loudness parameters, log r ~ 1.6 and log r,x ~ -3.3, are similar to thosemeasured in seyfert galaxies. thus the radio-loudness of agn hosted byearly-type galaxies appears to be univocally related to the host's brightnessprofile: radio-loud agn are only hosted by core galaxies, while radio-quiet agnare found only in power-law galaxies. the brightness profile is determined bythe galaxy's evolution, through its merger history; our results suggest thatthe same process sets the agn flavour.

astro-ph;0606119	optical polarimetry of the jets of nearby radio galaxies: i. the data	we present an overview of new hst imaging polarimetry of six nearby radiogalaxies with optical jets. these observations triple the number ofextragalactic jets with subarcsecond-resolution optical polarimetry. we discussthe polarization characteristics and optical morphology of each jet. we findevidence of high optical polarization, averaging 20%, but reaching upwards of$\sim 50%$ in some objects, confirming that the optical emission issynchrotron, and that the components of the magnetic fields perpendicular tothe line of sight are well ordered. we find a wide range of polarizationmorphologies, with each jet having a somewhat different relationship betweentotal intensity and polarized flux and the polarization position angle. we findtwo trends in all of these jets. first, jet ``edges'' are very often associatedwith high fractional optical polarizations, as also found in earlier radioobservations of these and other radio jets. in these regions, the magneticfield vectors appear to track the jet direction, even at bends, where we seeparticularly high fractional polarizations. this indicates a strong linkbetween the local magnetic field and jet dynamics. second, optical flux maximumregions are usually well separated from maxima in fractional polarization andoften are associated with polarization minima. this trend is not found in radiodata and was found in our optical polarimetry of m87 with hst. however, unlikein m87, we do not find a general trend for near-90$^\circ$ rotations in theoptical polarization vectors near flux maxima. we discuss possibilities forinterpreting these trends, as well as implications for jet dynamics, magneticfield structure and particle acceleration.

astro-ph;0609603	measuring supermassive black holes with gas kinematics: the active s0  galaxy ngc 3998	we present results from a kinematical study of the gas in the nucleus of theactive s0 galaxy ngc 3998 obtained from archival hst/stis long-slit spectra. weanalyzed the emission lines profiles and derived the map of the gas velocityfield. the observed velocity curves are consistent with gas in regular rotationaround the galaxy's center. by modeling the surface brightness distribution androtation curve of the h_alfa emission line we found that the observedkinematics of the circumnuclear gas can be accurately reproduced by adding tothe stellar mass component a compact dark mass (black hole) of m_bh =2.7(-2.0,+2.4) 10**8 m_sun (uncertainties at a 2 sigma level); the radius ofits sphere of influence (r_sph ~ 0".16) is well resolved at the hst resolution.the bh mass estimate in ngc 3998 is in good agreement with both the m_bh vs.m_bul (with an upward scatter by a factor of ~2) and m_bh vs. sigmacorrelations (with a downward scatter by a factor of ~3-7, depending on theform adopted for the dependence of m_bh on sigma). although ngc 3998 cannot beconsidered as an outlier, its location with respect to the m_bh-sigma relationconforms with the trend suggesting the presence of a connection between the``residuals'' from the m_bh-sigma correlation and the galaxy's effectiveradius. in fact, ngc 3998 has one of the smallest values of r_e among thegalaxies with measured m_bh (0.85 kpc) and it shows a negative residual. thissuggests that a combination of both sigma and r_e is necessary to drive thecorrelations between m_bh and other bulge properties, an indication for thepresence of a black holes ``fundamental plane''.

astro-ph;0612546	bulges and disks in the host galaxies of low redshift 3cr sources: a  near-ir view of their radial brightness profile	we analyze the near-infrared luminosity profiles and photometric parametersof the host galaxies of 3cr radio sources with z&lt;0.3, to investigate theirphysical nature. our sample includes 82 galaxies, of which 22 (27%) are fr isand 60 (73%) are fr iis. using near-infrared data taken both with nicmosonboard the hubble space telescope and from the ground with the telescopionazionale galileo, we find that luminosity profiles are very well described bya single sersic law in 52% of the cases and for the remaining objects (48%) itis necessary to include an exponential profile, which could indicate thepresence of a disk. the average bulge to disk luminosity ratio for the galaxiesis (b/d) ~ 1.1. the analysis of the photometric parameters of the sub samplesindicates that fr is and fr iis show rather similar bulges in terms ofeffective surface magnitude, effective radius, and sersic index. on the otherhand, disks in fr is and fr iis hosts show, on average, different properties.central surface magnitudes are dimmer and scale lengths are greater by a factorof 2 in fr is when compared to fr iis. we also estimate the black hole massassociated with each galaxy using two different methods that claim tightcorrelations between the black hole mass (m_bh) with the infrared bulgeluminosity (l_bulge) and with the sersic index (n). our data indicate thatmasses obtained through these two methods show a high dispersion and m_bhobtained through l_bulge are systematically higher (by a factor of ~3) thanthose obtained using n. this result may reflect the fact that for our samplegalaxies we do not find any correlation between l_bulge and n.

astro-ph;0703149	supermassive black holes in the sbc spiral galaxies ngc 3310, ngc 4303  and ngc 4258	we present new space telescope imaging spectrograph (stis) observations ofthree spiral galaxies, ngc 4303, ngc 3310 and ngc 4258. the bright opticalemission lines h$\alpha$ $\lambda$ $6564 \aa$, [nii] $\lambda$$\lambda$$6549,6585 \aa$ and [sii] $\lambda$$\lambda$ $ 6718,6732 \aa$ were used tostudy the kinematics of the ionized gas in the nuclear region of each galaxywith a $\sim 0.07\arcsec$ spatial resolution. in ngc 3310, the observed gaskinematics is well matched by a circularly rotating disk model but we are onlyable to set an upper limit to the bh mass which, taking into account theallowed disk inclinations, varies in the range $5.0 \times 10^{6} - 4.2 \times10^{7} m_{\odot}$ at the 95% confidence level. in ngc 4303 the kinematical datarequire the presence of a bh with mass $m_{bh}=(5.0)^{+0.87}_{-2.26}\times10^{6}m_{\odot}$ (for a disk inclination $i=70$ deg).in ngc 4258, the observedkinematics require the presence of a black hole with $m_{bh}=(7.9)^{+6.2}_{-3.5} \times 10^{7}m_{\odot}$ ($i=60$ deg). this result is ingood agreement with the published value $(3.9 \pm 0.1) \times 10^{7}m_{\odot}$, derived from $h_{2}o$-maser observations. our attempt at measuringbh masses in these 3 late type sbc spiral galaxies has shown that thesemeasurements are very challenging and at the limit of the highest spatialresolution currently available. nonetheless our estimates are in good agreementwith the scaling relations between black holes and their host spheroidssuggesting that (i) they are reliable and (ii) black holes in spiral galaxiesfollows the same scaling relations as those in more massive early-typegalaxies. a crucial test for the gas kinematical method, the correct recoveryof the known bh mass in ngc 4258, has been successful.

astro-ph;9804098	evidence for a 20pc disk at the nucleus of centaurus a	we report hst nicmos observations of the central region of ngc 5128 at 2.2micand in paschen alpha (pa). the continuum images show extended emission typicalof an elliptical galaxy and a strong unresolved central source we identify asthe nucleus of the galaxy. its position is consistent with ground-based ir andradio data, and with the peak of reddening found with wf/pc-1. in pa, we detecta prominent elongated structure, centered on the nucleus, extended by ~2" at aposition angle of 33deg, and with a major to minor axis ratio of ~2. weinterpret this as an inclined, ~40 parsec diameter, thin nuclear disk ofionized gas rather than a jet-gas cloud interaction. we do see several weakerpa features, some of which may be circumnuclear gas clouds shocked by thex-ray/radio jet. the disk is one of the smallest ever observed at the nucleusof an agn. it is not perpendicular to the jet, but consistent with beingoriented along the major axis of the bulge. if it represents the warped outerportion of an accretion disk around a black hole, we conclude that even on thescale of a few parsecs, the disk is dominated by the galaxy gravitationalpotential and not directly related to the symmetry axis of the agn.

astro-ph;9811407	testing the fr i/bl lac unifying model with hst observations	hubble space telescope (hst) observations provide a novel way of testingunified models for fr i radio sources and bl lac objects. the detection ofextended dust discs in some radio galaxies provides information on their jetorientation. given this, the strength of the compact nuclear sources of fr iand bl lacs can be compared with model predictions. as a pilot project, weselected five radio galaxies which show extended nuclear discs in the hstimages. the relative orientation of the projected radio-jets and of theextended nuclear discs indicates that they are not perpendicular, as thesimplest geometrical model would suggest, but that they form an angle of ~ 20 -40 degrees with the symmetry axis of the disc: a significant change oforientation occurs between the innermost agn structure and the kpc-scale.nevertheless, the discs appear to be useful indicators of the radio sourcesorientation since the angles formed by the disc axis and the jet with the lineof sight differ by only ~ 10 - 20 degrees. at the center of each disc anunresolved nuclear source is present. we compared its luminosity with theoptical core luminosity of bl lacs selected for having similar host galaxymagnitude and extended radio luminosity. the bl lac cores are between 2 e2 and3 e5 times brighter than the corresponding radio galaxies ones. the fr i/bl laccore luminosity ratio shows a suggestive correlation with the orientation ofthe radio galaxies with respect to the line of sight. the behavior of thisratio is quantitatively consistent with a scenario in which the emission in thefr i and bl lac is dominated by the beamed radiation from a relativistic jetwith doppler factor ~ 5 - 10, thus supporting the basic features of theproposed unification schemes.

astro-ph;9907064	the hst view of fr i radio galaxies: evidence for non-thermal nuclear  sources	unresolved nuclear sources are detected by the hubble space telescope in thegreat majority of a complete sample of 33 fr i radio galaxies belonging to the3cr catalogue.  the optical flux of these central compact cores (ccc) shows a striking linearcorrelation with the radio core one over four decades, arguing for anon--thermal synchrotron origin of the ccc radiation. we also find evidencethat this emission is anisotropic, which leads us to identify cccs with themisoriented relativistic jet component which dominates in bl lac objects. thisinterpretation is also supported by the similarity in the radio-to-optical andoptical spectral indices.  the high rate of ccc detection (85 %) suggests that a `standard' pc scale,geometrically thick torus is not present in low luminosity radio-galaxies. thusthe lack of broad lines in fr i cannot be attributed to obscuration.  ccc fluxes also represent upper limits to any thermal/disc emission. for a$10^9 m_{\sun}$ black hole, typical of fr i sources, these limits translateinto a fraction as small as less than $10^{-7}-10^{-5}$ of the eddingtonluminosity.

(1998) is detectedin the [feii] 1.64mic line and presents a morphology similar to that observedin pa alpha with a [feii]/pa alpha ratio typical of low ionization seyfertgalaxies and liners. nicmos 3 pa alpha observations in a 50"x50" circumnuclearregion suggest enhanced star formation (~0.3msun/yr) at the edges of theputative bar seen with iso, perhaps due to shocks driven into the gas.  the light profile, reconstructed from v, h and k observations, shows thatcentaurus a has a core profile with a resolved break at ~4" and suggests ablack--hole mass of ~10^9 msun. a linear blue structure aligned with theradio/x-ray jet may indicate a channel of relatively low reddening in whichdust has been swept away by the jet.
