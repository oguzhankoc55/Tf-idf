0905.2268	large-scale structure of the universe as a cosmic standard ruler	we propose to use the large-scale structure of the universe as a cosmicstandard ruler, based on the fact that the pattern of galaxy distributionshould be maintained in the course of time on large scales. by examining thescale-dependence of the pattern in different redshift intervals it is possibleto reconstruct the expansion history of the universe, and thus to measure thecosmological parameters governing the expansion of the universe. the featuresin the galaxy distribution that can be used as standard rulers include thetopology of large-scale structure and the overall shapes of galaxy powerspectrum and correlation function. the genus, being an intrinsic topologymeasure, is resistant against the non-linear gravitational evolution, galaxybiasing, and redshift-space distortion effects, and thus is ideal forquantifying the primordial topology of the large-scale structure. the expansionhistory of the universe can be constrained by comparing among the genusmeasured at different redshifts. in the case of initially gaussian fluctuationsthe genus accurately recovers the slope of the primordial power spectrum nearthe smoothing scale, and the expansion history can be constrained by comparingbetween the predicted and measured genus.

0905.2586	evidence for morphology and luminosity transformation of galaxies at  high redshifts	we study the galaxy morphology-luminosity-environmental relation and itsredshift evolution using a spectroscopic sample of galaxies in the greatobservatories origins deep survey (goods). in the redshift range of $0.4\leqz\leq1.0$ we detect conformity in morphology between neighboring galaxies. therealm of conformity is confined within the virialized region associated witheach galaxy plus dark matter halo system. when a galaxy is located within thevirial radius of its nearest neighbor galaxy, its morphology strongly dependson the neighbor's distance and morphology: the probability for a galaxy to bean early type ($f_e$) strongly increases as it approaches an early-typeneighbor, but tends to decrease as it approaches a late-type neighbor. we findthat $f_e$ evolves much faster in high density regions than in low densityregions, and that the morphology-density relation becomes significantly weakerat $z\approx 1$. this may be because the rate of galaxy-galaxy interactions ishigher in high density regions, and a series of interactions and mergers overthe course of galaxy life eventually transform late types into early types. wefind more isolated galaxies are more luminous, which supports luminositytransformation through mergers at these redshifts. our results are consistentwith those from nearby galaxies, and demonstrate that galaxy-galaxyinteractions have been strongly affecting the galaxy evolution over a longperiod of time.

0906.0424	reconstructing galaxy fundamental distributions and scaling relations  from photometric redshift surveys. applications to the sdss early-type sample	noisy distance estimates associated with photometric rather thanspectroscopic redshifts lead to a mis-estimate of the luminosities, and producea correlated mis-estimate of the sizes. we consider a sample of early-typegalaxies from the sdss dr6 for which both spectroscopic and photometricinformation is available, and apply the generalization of the v_max method tocorrect for these biases. we show that our technique recovers the trueredshift, magnitude and size distributions, as well as the true size-luminosityrelation. we find that using only 10% of the spectroscopic information randomlyspaced in our catalog is sufficient for the reconstructions to be accuratewithin about 3%, when the photometric redshift error is dz = 0.038. we thenaddress the problem of extending our method to deep redshift catalogs, whereonly photometric information is available. in addition to the specificapplications outlined here, our technique impacts a broader range of studies,when at least one distance-dependent quantity is involved. it is particularlyrelevant for the next generation of surveys, some of which will only havephotometric information.

0906.2190	non-gaussian distribution and clustering of hot and cold pixels in the  wmap five-year sky	we present measurements of the clustering of hot and cold patches in themicrowave background sky as measured from the wilkinson microwave anisotropyprobe (wmap) five-year data. these measurements are compared with theoreticalpredictions which assume that the cosmological signal obeys gaussianstatistics. we find significant differences from the simplest gaussian-basedprediction. however, the measurements are sensitive to the fact that the noiseis spatially inhomogeneous (e.g., because different parts of the sky wereobserved for different lengths of time). we show how to account for thisspatial inhomogeneity when making predictions. differences from thegaussian-based expectation remain even after this more careful accounting ofthe noise. in particular, we note that hot and cold pixels cluster differentlywithin the same temperature thresholds at few-degree scales. while thesefindings may indicate primordial non-gaussianity, we discuss other plausibleexplanations for these discrepancies. in addition, we find some deviations fromgaussianity at sub-degree scales, especially in the w band, whose origin may beassociated with extragalactic dust emission.

0908.1696	statistical nature of non-gaussianity from cubic order primordial  perturbations: cmb map simulations and genus statistic	we simulate cmb maps including non-gaussianity arising from cubic orderperturbations of the primordial gravitational potential, characterized by thenon-linearity parameter $g_{nl}$. the maps are used to study the characteristicnature of the resulting non-gaussian temperature fluctuations. we measure thegenus and investigate how it deviates from gaussian shape as a function of$g_{nl}$ and smoothing scale. we find that the deviation of the non-gaussiangenus curve from the gaussian one has an antisymmetric, sine function likeshape, implying more hot and more cold spots for $g_{nl}&gt;0$ and less of bothfor $g_{nl}&lt;0$. the deviation increases linearly with $g_{nl}$ and alsoexhibits mild increase as the smoothing scale increases. we further study otherstatistics derived from the genus, namely, the number of hot spots, the numberof cold spots, combined number of hot and cold spots and the slope of the genuscurve at mean temperature fluctuation. we find that these observables carrysignatures of $g_{nl}$ that are clearly distinct from the quadratic orderperturbations, encoded in the parameter $f_{nl}$. hence they can be very usefultools for distinguishing not only between non-gaussian temperature fluctuationsand gaussian ones but also between $g_{nl}$ and $f_{nl}$ typenon-gaussianities.

0909.3541	the nature of the sdss galaxies in various classes based on morphology,  colour and spectral features - ii. multi-wavelength properties	we present a multi-wavelength study of the nature of the sdss galaxiesdivided into fine classes based on their morphology, colour and spectralfeatures. the sdss galaxies are classified into early-type and late-type; redand blue; passive, hii, seyfert and liner, which returns a total of 16 fineclasses of galaxies. the properties of galaxies in each fine class areinvestigated from radio to x-ray, using 2mass, iras, first, nvss, galex androsat data. the uv - optical - nir colours of blue early-type galaxies (begs)seem to result from the combination of old stellar population and recent starformation (sf). non-passive red early-type galaxies (regs) have largermetallicity and younger age than passive regs, which implies that non-passiveregs have suffered recent sf adding young and metal-rich stars to them. theradio detection fraction of regs strongly depends on their optical absolutemagnitudes, while that of most late-type galaxies does not, implying thedifference in their radio sources: agn and sf. the uv - optical colours and theradio detection fraction of passive rlgs show that they have properties similarto regs rather than non-passive rlgs. dust extinction may not be a dominantfactor making rlgs red, because rlgs are detected in the mid- and far-infraredbands less efficiently than blue late-type galaxies (blgs). the passive blgshave very blue uv - optical - nir colours, implying either recent sf quenchingor current sf in their outskirts. including star formation rate, othermulti-wavelength properties in each fine class are investigated, and theirimplication on the identity of each fine class is discussed (abridged).

0911.4386	the nature of the sloan digital sky survey galaxies in various classes  based on morphology, colour and spectral features - iii. environments	we present a study on the environments of the sdss galaxies divided into fineclasses based on their morphology, colour and spectral features. the sdssgalaxies are classified into early-type and late-type; red and blue; passive,hii, seyfert and liner, which returns a total of 16 fine classes of galaxies.we estimate the local number density, target-excluded local luminosity density,local colour, close pair fraction and the luminosity and colour of thebrightest neighbour, which are compared between the fine classescomprehensively. the morphology-colour class of galaxies strongly depends onthe local density, with the approximate order of high-density preference: redearly-type galaxies (regs) -- red late-type galaxies (rlgs) -- blue early-typegalaxies (begs) -- blue late-type galaxies (blgs). we find that high-densityenvironments (like cluster environments) seem to suppress agn activity. thepair fraction of hii regs does not show statistically significant differencefrom that of passive regs, while the pair fraction of hii blgs is smaller thanthat of non-hii blgs. hii blgs show obvious double (red + blue) peaks in thedistribution of the brightest neighbour colour, while red galaxies show asingle red peak. the brightest neighbours of seyfert blgs tend to be blue,while those of liner blgs tend to be red, which implies that the differencebetween seyfert and liner may be related to the pair interaction. other variousenvironments of the fine classes are investigated, and their implication ongalaxy evolution is discussed.

1003.0272	statistics of the excursion sets in models with local primordial  non-gaussianity	we use the statistics of regions above or below a temperature threshold(excursion sets) to study the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropy inmodels with primordial non-gaussianity of the local type. by computing thefull-sky spatial distribution and clustering of pixels above/below thresholdfrom a large set of simulated maps with different levels of non-gaussianity, wefind that a positive value of the dimensionless non-linearity parameter f_nlenhances the number density of the cold cmb excursion sets along with theirclustering strength, and reduces that of the hot ones. we quantify therobustness of this effect, which may be important to discriminate between thesimpler gaussian hypothesis and non-gaussian scenarios, arising either fromnon-standard inflation or alternative early-universe models. the clustering ofhot and cold pixels exhibits distinct non-gaussian signatures, particularly atangular scales of about 75 arcmin (i.e. around the doppler peak), whichincrease linearly with f_nl. moreover, the clustering changes strongly as afunction of the smoothing angle. we propose several statistical tests tomaximize the detection of a local primordial non-gaussian signal, and providesome theoretical insights within this framework, including an optimal selectionof the threshold level. we also describe a procedure which aims at minimizingthe cosmic variance effect, the main limit within this statistical framework.

1004.0280	gravitational potential environment of galaxies: i. simulation	we extend the concept of galaxy environment from the local galaxy numberdensity to the gravitational potential and its functions like the shear tensor.for this purpose we examine whether or not one can make an accurate estimationof the gravitational potential from an observational sample which is finite involume, biased due to galaxy biasing, and subject to redshift space distortion.dark halos in a $\lambda$cdm simulation are used in this test. we find that oneneeds to stay away from the sample boundaries by more than 30$h^{-1}$mpc toreduce the error within 20% of the root mean square values of the potential orthe shear tensor. the error due to the galaxy biasing can be significantlyreduced by using the galaxy mass density field instead of the galaxy numberdensity field. the error caused by the redshift space distortion can beeffectively removed by correcting galaxy positions for the peculiar velocityeffects. we inspect the dependence of dark matter halo properties on fourenvironmental parameters; local density, gravitational potential, and theellipticity and prolateness of the shear tensor. we find the local density hasthe strongest correlation with halo properties. this is evidence that theinternal physical properties of dark halos are mainly controlled by small-scalephysics. in high density regions dark halos are on average more massive andspherical, and have higher spin parameter and velocity dispersion. in highdensity regions dark halos are on average more massive and spherical, and havehigher spin parameter and velocity dispersion. we also study the relationbetween the environmental parameters and the subtypes of dark halos. the spinparameter of satellite halos depends only weakly on the local density for allmass ranges studied while that of isloated or central halos depends moresensitively on the local density.

1005.0256	galaxy clustering topology in the sloan digital sky survey main galaxy  sample: a test for galaxy formation models	we measure the topology of the main galaxy distribution using the seventhdata release of the sloan digital sky survey, examining the dependence ofgalaxy clustering topology on galaxy properties. the observational results areused to test galaxy formation models. a volume-limited sample defined by$m_r&lt;-20.19$ enables us to measure the genus curve with amplitude of $g=378$ at$6h^{-1}$mpc smoothing scale, with 4.8\% uncertainty including all systematicsand cosmic variance. the clustering topology over the smoothing length intervalfrom 6 to $10 h^{-1}$mpc reveals a mild scale-dependence for the shift($\delta\nu$) and void abundance ($a_v$) parameters of the genus curve. we findsubstantial bias in the topology of galaxy clustering with respect to thepredicted topology of the matter distribution, which varies with luminosity,morphology, color, and the smoothing scale of the density field. thedistribution of relatively brighter galaxies shows a greater prevalence ofisolated clusters and more percolated voids. even though early (late)-typegalaxies show topology similar to that of red (blue) galaxies, the morphologydependence of topology is not identical to the color dependence. in particular,the void abundance parameter $a_v$ depends on morphology more strongly than oncolor. we test five galaxy assignment schemes applied to cosmological n-bodysimulations of a $\lambda$cdm universe to generate mock galaxies: thehalo-galaxy one-to-one correspondence model, the halo occupation distributionmodel, and three implementations of semi-analytic models (sams). none of themodels reproduces all aspects of the observed clustering topology; thedeviations vary from one model to another but include statistically significantdiscrepancies in the abundance of isolated voids or isolated clusters and theamplitude and overall shift of the genus curve.

1006.0775	distribution of satellite galaxies in high redshift groups	we use galaxy groups at redshifts between 0.4 and 1.0 selected from the greatobservatories origins deep survey (goods) to study the color-morphologicalproperties of satellite galaxies, and investigate possible alignment betweenthe distribution of the satellites and the orientation of their central galaxy.we confirm the bimodal color and morphological type distribution for satellitegalaxies at this redshift range: the red and blue classes corresponds to theearly and late morphological types respectively, and the early-type satellitesare on average brighter than the late-type ones. furthermore, there is a {\itmorphological conformity} between the central and satellite galaxies: thefraction of early-type satellites in groups with an early-type central ishigher than those with a late-type central galaxy. this effect is stronger atsmaller separations from the central galaxy. we find a marginally significantsignal of alignment between the major axis of the early-type central galaxy andits satellite system, while for the late-type centrals no significant alignmentsignal is found. we discuss the alignment signal in the context of shapeevolution of groups.

1006.2166	environmental dependence of local luminous infrared galaxies	we study the environmental dependence of local luminous infrared galaxies(lirgs) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) found in the sloan digitalsky survey (sdss) data. the lirg and ulirg samples are constructed bycross-correlating spectroscopic catalogs of galaxies of the sdss data release 7and the infrared astronomical satellite faint source catalog. we examine theeffects of the large-scale background density (sigma_5), galaxy clusters, andthe nearest neighbor galaxy on the properties of infrared galaxies (irgs). wefind that the fraction of lirgs plus ulirgs among irgs (f_(u)lirgs) and theinfrared luminosity (l_ir) of irgs strongly depend on the morphology of and thedistance to the nearest neighbor galaxy: the probability for an irg to be a(u)lirg (f_(u)lirgs) and its l_ir both increase as it approaches a late-typegalaxy, but decrease as it approaches an early-type galaxy (within half thevirial radius of its neighbor). we find no dependence of f_(u)lirgs on thebackground density (surface galaxy number density) at fixed stellar mass ofgalaxies. the dependence of f_(u)lirgs on the distance to galaxy clusters isalso found to be very weak, but in highest-density regions such as the centerof galaxy clusters, few (u)lirgs are found. these environmental dependence oflirgs and ulirgs and the evolution of star formation rate (sfr)-environmentrelation from high redshifts to low redshifts seem to support the idea thatgalaxy-galaxy interactions/merging play a critical role in triggering the starformation activity of lirgs and ulirgs.

1007.2051	orbital dependence of galaxy properties in satellite systems of galaxies	we study the dependence of satellite galaxy properties on the distance to thehost galaxy and the orbital motion using the sdss data. from sdss dr7 we find3515 isolated satellite systems of galaxies at z&lt;0.03 that contain 8904satellite galaxies. using this sample we construct a catalog of 635 satellitesassociated with 215 host galaxies whose spin directions are determined by ourinspection of the sdss color images and/or by spectroscopic observations in theliterature. we divide satellite galaxies into prograde and retrograde orbitsubsamples depending on their orbital motion respect to the spin direction ofthe host. we find that the number of galaxies in prograde orbit is nearly equalto that of retrograde orbit galaxies: the fraction of satellites in progradeorbit is 50+/-2%. the velocity distribution of satellites with respect to theirhosts is found almost symmetric: the median bulk rotation of satellites is-1+/- 8 km/s. it is found that the radial distribution of early-type satellitesin prograde orbit is strongly concentrated toward the host while that ofretrograde ones shows much less concentration. we also find the orbital speedof late-type satellites in prograde orbit increases as the projected distanceto the host (r) decreases while the speed decreases for those in retrogradeorbit. at r less than 0.1 times the host virial radius the orbital speeddecreases in both prograde and retrograde orbit cases. prograde satellites areon average fainter than retrograde satellites for both early and latemorphological types. the u-r color becomes redder as r decreases for bothprograde and retrograde orbit late-type satellites. the differences betweenprograde and retrograde orbit satellites may be attributed to their differentorigin or the different strength of physical processes that they haveexperienced through hydrodynamic interactions with their host galaxies.

1008.2832	quantifying galactic morphological transformations in the cluster  environment	we study the effects of the cluster environment on galactic morphology bydefining a dimensionless angular momentum parameter $\lambda_{d}$, to obtain aquantitative and objective measure of galaxy type. the use of this physicalparameter allows us to take the study of morphological transformations inclusters beyond the measurements of merely qualitative parameters, e.g. s/eratios, to a more physical footing. to this end, we employ an extensive sloandigital sky survey sample (data release 7), with galaxies associated with abellgalaxy clusters. the sample contains 121 relaxed abell clusters and over 51,000individual galaxies, which guarantees a thorough statistical coverage over awide range of physical parameters. we find that the median $\lambda_{d}$ valuetends to decrease as we approach the cluster center, with different dependencesaccording to the mass of the galaxies and the hosting cluster; low andintermediate mass galaxies showing a strong dependence, while massive galaxiesseems to show, at all radii, low $\lambda_{d}$ values. by analysing trends in$\lambda_{d}$ as functions of the nearest neighbour environment, clustercentricradius and velocity dispersion of clusters, we can identify clearly the leadingphysical processes at work. we find that in massive clusters ($\sigma&gt;700$km/s), the interaction with the cluster central region dominates, whilst insmaller clusters galaxy-galaxy interactions are chiefly responsible for drivinggalactic morphological transformations.

1008.3914	2d genus topology of 21-cm differential brightness temperature during  cosmic reionization	a novel method to characterize the topology of the early-universeintergalactic medium during the epoch of cosmic reionization is presented. the21-cm radiation background from high redshift is analyzed through thecalculation of the 2-dimensional (2d) genus. the radiative transfer ofhydrogen-ionizing photons and ionization-rate equations are calculated in asuite of numerical simulations under various input parameters. the 2d genus iscalculated from the mock 21-cm images of the high-redshift universe. weconstruct the 2d genus curve by varying the threshold differential brightnesstemperature, and compare this to the 2d genus curve of the underlying densityfield. we find that (1) the 2d genus curve reflects the evolutionary track ofcosmic reionization and (2) the 2d genus curve can discriminate between certainreionization scenarios and thus indirectly probe the properties ofradiation-sources. choosing the right beam shape of a radio antenna is crucialfor this analysis. to this end, the square kilometre array (ska) is found to bea suitable apparatus for this analysis in terms of sensitivity, even thoughsome deterioration of the data for this purpose is unavoidable under theplanned size of the antenna core.

0708.4118	transformation of morphology and luminosity classes of the sdss galaxies	we present a unified picture on the evolution of galaxy luminosity andmorphology. galaxy morphology is found to depend critically on the localenvironment set up by the nearest neighbor galaxy in addition to luminosity andthe large scale density. when a galaxy is located farther than the virialradius from its closest neighbor, the probability for the galaxy to have anearly morphological type is an increasing function only of luminosity and thelocal density due to the nearest neighbor ($\rho_n$). the tide produced by thenearest neighbor is thought to be responsible for the morphology transformationtoward the early type at these separations. when the separation is less thanthe virial radius, i.e. when $\rho_n &gt; \rho_{\rm virial}$, its morphologydepends also on the neighbor's morphology and the large-scale backgrounddensity over a few mpc scales ($\rho_{20}$) in addition to luminosity and$\rho_n$. the early type probability keeps increasing as $\rho_n$ increases ifits neighbor is an early type. but the probability decreases as $\rho_n$increases when the neighbor is a late type. the cold gas streaming from thelate type neighbor can be the reason for the morphology transformation towardlate type. the overall early-type fraction increases as $\rho_{20}$ increaseswhen $\rho_n &gt; \rho_{\rm virial}$. this can be attributed to the hot halo gasof the neighbor which is confined by the pressure of the ambient medium held bythe background mass. we have also found that galaxy luminosity depends on$\rho_n$, and that the isolated bright galaxies are more likely to be recentmerger products. we propose a scenario that a series of morphology andluminosity transformation occur through distant interactions and mergers, whichresults in the morphology--luminosity--local density relation.

1010.3035	topology of large scale structure as test of modified gravity	the genus of the iso-density contours is a robust measure of the topology oflarge scale structure, and it is relatively insensitive to nonlineargravitational evolution, galaxy bias and redshift-space distortion. we showthat the growth of density fluctuations is scale-dependent even in the linearregime in some modified gravity theories, which opens a new possibility oftesting the theories observationally. we propose to use the genus of theiso-density contours, an intrinsic measure of the topology of large scalestructure, as a statistic to be used in such tests. in einstein's generaltheory of relativity, density fluctuations are growing at the same rate on allscales in the linear regime, and the genus per comoving volume is almostconserved as structures are growing homologously, so we expect that thegenus-smoothing scale relation is basically time-independent. however, in somemodified gravity models where structures grow with different rates on differentscales, the genus-smoothing scale relation should change over time. this can beused to test the gravity models with large scale structure observations. westudied the case of the f(r) theory, dgp braneworld theory as well as theparameterized post-friedmann (ppf) models. we also forecast how the modifiedgravity models can be constrained with optical/ir or redshifted 21cm radiosurveys in the near future.

1103.3542	the galactic spin of agn galaxies	using an extensive sample of galaxies selected from the sloan digital skysurvey data release 5, we compare the angular momentum distribution of activegalactic nucleus (agn) with non-agn hosting late-type galaxies. to this end wecharacterize galactic spin through the dimensionless angular momentum parameter$\lambda$, which we estimate approximately through simple dynamicalconsiderations. using a volume limited sample, we find a considerabledifference when comparing the empirical distributions of $\lambda$ for agns andnon-agn galaxies, the agns showing typically low $\lambda$ values andassociated dispersions, while non-agns present higher $\lambda$ values and abroader distribution. a more striking difference is found when looking at$\lambda$ distributions in thin $m_{r}$ cuts, while the spin of non-agngalaxies presents an anti-correlation with $m_{r}$, with bright (massive)galaxies having low spins, agn host galaxies present uniform values of$\lambda$ at all magnitudes, a behavior probably imposed by the fact that mostlate-type agn galaxies present a narrow range in color, with a typical constant$\lambda$ value. we also find that the fraction of agn hosting galaxies in oursample strongly depends on galactic spin, increasing dramatically fordecreasing $\lambda$. for agn host galaxies we compute the mass of theirsupermassive black holes and find that this value tends to be higher for lowspin galaxies, even at fixed luminosity, a result that could account, to acertain extent, for the spread on the luminosity black-hole mass relation.

1109.6328	measures of galaxy environment - i. what is "environment"?	the influence of a galaxy's environment on its evolution has been studied andcompared extensively in the literature, although differing techniques are oftenused to define environment. most methods fall into two broad groups: those thatuse nearest neighbours to probe the underlying density field and those that usefixed apertures. the differences between the two inhibit a clean comparisonbetween analyses and leave open the possibility that, even with the same data,different properties are actually being measured. in this work we apply twentypublished environment definitions to a common mock galaxy catalogue constrainedto look like the local universe. we find that nearest neighbour-based measuresbest probe the internal densities of high-mass haloes, while at low masses theinter-halo separation dominates and acts to smooth out local densityvariations. the resulting correlation also shows that nearest neighbour galaxyenvironment is largely independent of dark matter halo mass. conversely,aperture-based methods that probe super-halo scales accurately identifyhigh-density regions corresponding to high mass haloes. both methods show howgalaxies in dense environments tend to be redder, with the exception of thelargest apertures, but these are the strongest at recovering the backgrounddark matter environment. we also warn against using photometric redshifts todefine environment in all but the densest regions. when considering environmentthere are two regimes: the 'local environment' internal to a halo best measuredwith nearest neighbour and 'large-scale environment' external to a halo bestmeasured with apertures. this leads to the conclusion that there is nouniversal environment measure and the most suitable method depends on the scalebeing probed.

1110.1933	dependence of barred galaxy fraction on galaxy properties and  environment	we investigate the dependence of occurrence of bars in galaxies on galaxyproperties and environment. we use a volume-limited sample of 33,391 galaxiesbrighter than $m_{r}=-19.5+5$log$h$ at $0.02\le z\le0.05489$, drawn from thesdss dr 7. we classify the galaxies into early and late types, and identifybars by visual inspection. among 10,674 late-type galaxies with axis ratio$b/a&gt;0.60$, we find 3,240 barred galaxies ($f_{bar}=30.4%$) which divide into2,542 strong bars ($f_{sb1}=23.8%$) and 698 weak bars ($f_{sb2}=6.5%$). we findthat $f_{sb1}$ increases as $u-r$ color becomes redder, and that it has amaximum value at intermediate velocity dispersion ($\sigma\simeq$150 kms$^{-1}$). this trend suggests that strong bars are dominantly hosted byintermediate-mass systems. weak bars prefer bluer galaxies with lower mass andlower concentration. in the case of strong bars, their dependence on theconcentration index appears only for massive galaxies with $\sigma&gt;150$ kms$^{-1}$. we also find that $f_{bar}$ does not directly depend on thelarge-scale background density when other physical parameters ($u-r$ color or$\sigma$) are fixed. we discover that $f_{sb1}$ decreases as the separation tothe nearest neighbor galaxy becomes smaller than 0.1 times the virial radius ofthe neighbor regardless of neighbor's morphology. these results imply thatstrong bars are likely to be destroyed during strong tidal interactions, andthat the mechanism for this phenomenon is gravitational and not hydrodynamical.the fraction of weak bars has no correlation with environmental parameters. wedo not find any direct evidence for environmental stimulation of bar formation.

1110.5528	probing dark energy with alpha shapes and betti numbers	we introduce a new descriptor of the weblike pattern in the distribution ofgalaxies and matter: the scale dependent betti numbers which formalize thetopological information content of the cosmic mass distribution. while thebetti numbers do not fully quantify topology, they extend the informationbeyond conventional cosmological studies of topology in terms of genus andeuler characteristic used in earlier analyses of cosmological models. thericher information content of betti numbers goes along with the availability offast algorithms to compute them. when measured as a function of scale theyprovide a "betti signature" for a point distribution that is a sensitive yetrobust discriminator of structure. the signature is highly effective inrevealing differences in structure arising in different cosmological models,and is exploited towards distinguishing between different dark energy modelsand may likewise be used to trace primordial non-gaussianities.  in this study we demonstrate the potential of betti numbers by studying theirbehaviour in simulations of cosmologies differing in the nature of their darkenergy.

1111.1973	activity in galactic nuclei of cluster and field galaxies in the local  universe	we study the environmental effects on the activity in galactic nuclei bycomparing galaxies in clusters and in the field. using a spectroscopic sampleof galaxies in abell clusters from the sdss dr7, we investigate the dependenceof nuclear activity on the physical parameters of clusters as well as thenearest neighbor galaxy. we also compare galaxy properties between agn hostsand non-agn galaxies. we find that the agn fraction of early-type galaxiesstarts to decrease around one virial radius of clusters (r_{200,cl}) asdecreasing clustercentric radius, while that of late types starts to decreaseclose to the cluster center (r~0.1-0.5r_{200,cl}). the agn fractions ofearly-type cluster galaxies on average are found to be lower than those ofearly-type field galaxies by a factor ~3. however, the mean agn fractions oflate-type cluster galaxies are similar to those of late-type field galaxies.the agn fraction of early-type bcgs lies between those of other early-type,cluster and field galaxies with similar luminosities. in the field, the agnfraction strongly depends on the morphology of and the distance to the nearestneighbor galaxy. we find an anti-correlation between the agn fraction and thevelocity dispersion of clusters for all subsamples divided by morphology andluminosity of host galaxies. the agn power indicated by l_[oiii]/m_bh is foundto depend strongly on the mass of host galaxies rather than the clustercentricradius. the difference in physical parameters such as luminosity, (u-r) colors,sfrs, and (g-i) color gradients between agn hosts and non-agn galaxies is seenfor both early and late types at all clustercentric radii, while the differencein structure parameters between the two is significant only for late types.these results support the idea that the nuclear activity is triggered throughgalaxy-galaxy interactions and mergers when gas supply for agn is available.

1204.4236	the spin of late-type galaxies at redshifts z &lt; 1.2	we study the evolution of the galactic spin using data of high redshiftgalaxies in the fields of the great observatories origins deep survey (goods).through simple dynamical considerations we estimate the spin for the discgalaxies in our sample and find that its distribution is consistent with thatfound for nearby galaxies. defining a dimensionless angular momentum parameterfor the disc component of the galaxies ($\lambda_{d}$), we do not find signs ofevolution in the redshift range $0.4 \leq z \leq 1.2$. we find that the massand environmental dependence of the spin of our high redshift galaxies aresimilar to that of low-$z$ galaxies; showing a strong dependence on mass, inthe sense that low-mass systems present higher $\lambda_{d}$ values thanhigh-mass galaxies, with no significant dependence on the environmentaldensity. these results lead us to conclude that, although individual discgalaxies might occasionally suffer from strong evolution, they evolve in such away that the overall spin distribution of the galactic population remainsconstant from $z\sim1$ to the present epoch.

1209.5659	the challenge of the largest structures in the universe to cosmology	large galaxy redshift surveys have long been used to constrain cosmologicalmodels and structure formation scenarios. in particular, the largest structuresdiscovered observationally are thought to carry critical information on theamplitude of large-scale density fluctuations or homogeneity of the universe,and have often challenged the standard cosmological framework. the sloan greatwall (sgw) recently found in the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) region castsdoubt on the concordance cosmological model with a cosmological constant (i.e.the flat lcdm model). here we show that the existence of the sgw is perfectlyconsistent with the lcdm model, a result that only our very large cosmologicaln-body simulation (the horizon run 2, hr2) could supply. in addition, we reporton the discovery of a void complex in the sdss much larger than the sgw, andshow that such size of the largest void is also predicted in the lcdm paradigm.our results demonstrate that an initially homogeneous isotropic universe withprimordial gaussian random phase density fluctuations growing in accordancewith the general relativity, can explain the richness and size of the observedlarge-scale structures in the sdss. using the hr2 simulation we predict that afuture galaxy redshift survey about four times deeper or with 3 magnitudefainter limit than the sdss should reveal a largest structure of brightgalaxies about twice as big as the sgw.

1210.2250	residual foreground contamination in the wmap data and bias in  non-gaussianity estimation	we analyze whether there is any residual foreground contamination in thecleaned wmap 7 years data for the differential assemblies, q, v and w. wecalculate the correlation between the foreground map, from which longwavelength correlations have been subtracted, and the foreground reduced mapfor each differential assembly after applying the galaxy and point sourcesmasks. we find positive correlations for all the differential assemblies, withhigh statistical significance. for q and v, we find that a large fraction ofthe contamination comes from pixels where the foreground maps have positivevalues larger than three times the rms values. these findings imply thepresence of residual contamination from galactic emissions and unresolved pointsources. we redo the analysis after masking the extended point sourcescataloque of scodeller et al. [7] and find a drop in the correlation andcorresponding significance values. to quantify the effect of the residualcontamination on the search for primordial non-gaussianity in the cmb we addestimated contaminant fraction to simulated gaussian cmb maps and calculate thecharacteristic non-gaussian deviation shapes of minkowski functionals thatarise due to the contamination. we find remarkable agreement of these deviationshapes with those measured from wmap data, which imply that a major fraction ofthe observed non-gaussian deviation comes from residual foregroundcontamination. we also compute non-gaussian deviations of minkowski functionalsafter applying the point sources mask of scodeller et al. and find a decreasein the overall amplitudes of the deviations which is consistent with a decreasein the level of contamination.

0712.0842	environment and mass dependencies of galactic $\lambda$ spin parameter:  cosmological simulations and observed galaxies compared	we use a sample of galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) tosearch for correlations between the $\lambda$ spin parameter and theenvironment and mass of galaxies. in order to calculate the total value of$\lambda$ for each observed galaxy, we employed a simple model of the dynamicalstructure of the galaxies, which allows a rough estimate of the value of$\lambda$ using only readily obtainable observables from the luminous galaxies.use of a large volume-limited sample (upwards of 11,000) allows reliableinferences of mean values and dispersions of $\lambda$ distributions. we find,in agreement with some n-body cosmological simulations, no significantdependence of $\lambda$ on the environmental density of the galaxies. for thecase of mass, our results show a marked correlation with $\lambda$, in thesense that low-mass galaxies present both higher mean values of $\lambda$ andassociated dispersions, than high-mass galaxies. these results provideinteresting constrain on the mechanisms of galaxy formation and acquisition ofangular momentum, a valuable test for cosmological models.

1303.3696	on the galactic spin of barred disk galaxies	we present a study of the connection between the galactic spin parameter$\lambda_{d}$ and the bar fraction in a volume-limited sample of 10,674 diskgalaxies drawn from the sloan digital sky survey data release 7. the galaxiesin our sample are visually classified into galaxies hosting long or short bars,and non-barred galaxies. we find that the spin distributions of these threeclasses are statistically different, with galaxies hosting long bars with thelowest $\lambda_{d}$ values, followed by non-barred galaxies, while galaxieswith short bars present typically high spin parameters. the bar fractionpresents its maximum at low to intermediate $\lambda_{d}$ values for the caseof long bars, while the maximum for short bars is at high $\lambda_{d}$. thisbi-modality is in good agreement with previous studies finding longer barshosted by luminous, massive, red galaxies with low content of cold gas, whileshort bars are found in low luminosity, low mass, blue galaxies, usually gasrich. in addition, the rise and fall of the bar fraction as a function of$\lambda_{d}$, within the long-bar sample, shown in our results, can beexplained as a result of two competing factors: the self-gravity of the diskthat enhances bar instabilities, and the support by random motions instead ofordered rotational motion, that prevents the formation/growth of bars.

1306.3640	alpha, betti and the megaparsec universe: on the topology of the cosmic  web	we study the topology of the megaparsec cosmic web in terms of thescale-dependent betti numbers, which formalize the topological informationcontent of the cosmic mass distribution. while the betti numbers do not fullyquantify topology, they extend the information beyond conventional cosmologicalstudies of topology in terms of genus and euler characteristic. the richerinformation content of betti numbers goes along the availability of fastalgorithms to compute them.  for continuous density fields, we determine the scale-dependence of bettinumbers by invoking the cosmologically familiar filtration of sublevel orsuperlevel sets defined by density thresholds. for the discrete galaxydistribution, however, the analysis is based on the alpha shapes of theparticles. these simplicial complexes constitute an ordered sequence of nestedsubsets of the delaunay tessellation, a filtration defined by the scaleparameter, $\alpha$. as they are homotopy equivalent to the sublevel sets ofthe distance field, they are an excellent tool for assessing the topologicalstructure of a discrete point distribution. in order to develop an intuitiveunderstanding for the behavior of betti numbers as a function of $\alpha$, andtheir relation to the morphological patterns in the cosmic web, we first studythem within the context of simple heuristic voronoi clustering models.  subsequently, we address the topology of structures emerging in the standardlcdm scenario and in cosmological scenarios with alternative dark energycontent. the evolution and scale-dependence of the betti numbers is shown toreflect the hierarchical evolution of the cosmic web and yields a promisingmeasure of cosmological parameters. we also discuss the expected betti numbersas a function of the density threshold for superlevel sets of a gaussian randomfield.

1307.2384	betti numbers of gaussian fields	we present the relation between the genus in cosmology and the betti numbersfor excursion sets of three- and two-dimensional smooth gaussian random fields,and numerically investigate the betti numbers as a function of threshold level.betti numbers are topological invariants of figures that can be used todistinguish topological spaces. in the case of the excursion sets of athree-dimensional field there are three possibly non-zero betti numbers;$\beta_0$ is the number of connected regions, $\beta_1$ is the number ofcircular holes, and $\beta_2$ is the number of three-dimensional voids. theirsum with alternating signs is the genus of the surface of excursion regions. itis found that each betti number has a dominant contribution to the genus in aspecific threshold range. $\beta_0$ dominates the high-threshold part of thegenus curve measuring the abundance of high density regions (clusters).$\beta_1$ dominates the genus near the median thresholds which measures thetopology of negatively curved iso-density surfaces, and $\beta_2$ correspondsto the low-threshold part measuring the void abundance. we average the bettinumber curves (the betti numbers as a function of the threshold level) overmany realizations of gaussian fields and find that both the amplitude and shapeof the betti number curves depend on the slope of the power spectrum $n$ insuch a way that their shape becomes broader and their amplitude drops lesssteeply than the genus as $n$ decreases. this behaviour contrasts with the factthat the shape of the genus curve is fixed for all gaussian fields regardlessof the power spectrum. even though the gaussian betti number curves should becalculated for each given power spectrum, we propose to use the betti numbersfor better specification of the topology of large scale structures in theuniverse.

0801.3169	a subhalo-galaxy correspondence model of galaxy formation	we propose a model of allocating galaxies in cosmological n-body simulations.we identify each subhalo with a galaxy, and assign luminosity and morphologicaltype assuming that the galaxy luminosity is a monotonic function of its hostsubhalo mass. the morphology assignment is made by using two simple relationsbetween subhalo mass and galaxy luminosity of different types. one is using aconstant ratio in luminosity of early (e/so) and late (s/irr) type galaxies ata fixed subhalo mass. and the other assumes that galaxies of differentmorphological types but having an equal luminosity have a constant ratio intheir subhalo masses. we made a series of comparisons of the properties ofthese simulated galaxies with those of the sdss galaxies. the resultingsimulated galaxy sample is found to successfully reproduce the observed localnumber density distribution except for in high density regions. the luminosityfunction is studied as a function of local density. it was found that theobserved luminosity functions in different local density environments areoverall well-reproduced by the simulated galaxies. discrepancy is found at thebright end of the luminosity function of early types in the underdense regionsand at the faint end of both morphological types in very high density regions.a significant fraction of the observed early type galaxies in voids seems tohave undergone a relatively recent star formation and became brighter. the lackof faint simulated galaxies in dense regions may be due to the strong tidalforce of the central halo which destroys less massive satellite subhalos aroundin the simulation. the mass-to-light ratio is found to depend on the localdensity in the way similar to that observed in the sdss sample.

1401.6180	effects of the initial conditions on cosmological $n$-body simulations	cosmology is entering an era of percent level precision due to current largeobservational surveys. this precision in observation is now demanding moreaccuracy from numerical methods and cosmological simulations. in this paper, westudy the accuracy of $n$-body numerical simulations and their dependence onchanges in the initial conditions and in the simulation algorithms. for thispurpose, we use a series of cosmological $n$-body simulations with varyinginitial conditions. we test the influence of the initial conditions, namely thepre-initial configuration (preic), the order of the lagrangian perturbationtheory (lpt), and the initial redshift, on the statistics associated with thelarge scale structures of the universe such as the halo mass function, thedensity power spectrum, and the maximal extent of the large scale structures.we find that glass or grid pre-initial conditions give similar results at$z\lesssim 2$. however, the initial excess of power in the glass initialconditions yields a subtle difference in the power spectra and the massfunction at high redshifts. the lpt order used to generate the ics of thesimulations is found to play a crucial role. first-order lpt (1lpt) simulationsunderestimate the number of massive haloes with respect to second-order (2lpt)ones, typically by 2% at $10^{14} h^{-1} m_\odot$ for an initial redshift of23, and the small-scale power with an underestimation of 6% near the nyquistfrequency for $z_\mathrm{ini} = 23$. moreover, at higher redshifts, thehigh-mass end of the mass function is significantly underestimated in 1lptsimulations. on the other hand, when the lpt order is fixed, the startingredshift has a systematic impact on the low-mass end of the halo mass function.

1412.3564	cosmological constraints from the redshift dependence of the  alcock-paczynski test: galaxy density gradient field	we propose a method based on the redshift dependence of the alcock-paczynski(ap) test to measure the expansion history of the universe. it uses theisotropy of the galaxy density gradient field to constrain cosmologicalparameters. if the density parameter $\omega_m$ or the dark energy equation ofstate $w$ are incorrectly chosen, the gradient field appears to be anisotropicwith the degree of anisotropy varying with redshift. we use this effect toconstrain the cosmological parameters governing the expansion history of theuniverse. although redshift-space distortions (rsd) induced by galaxy peculiarvelocities also produce anisotropies in the gradient field, these effects areclose to uniform in magnitude over a large range of redshift. this makes theredshift variation of the gradient field anisotropy relatively insensitive tothe rsd. by testing the method on mock surveys drawn from the horizon run 3cosmological n-body simulations, we demonstrate that the cosmologicalparameters can be estimated without bias. our method is complementary to thebaryon acoustic oscillation or topology methods as it depends on $d_ah$, theproduct of the angular diameter distance and the hubble parameter.

1504.00740	cosmological constraints from the redshift dependence of the  alcock-paczynski test and volume effect: galaxy two-point correlation  function	we propose a method using the redshift dependence of the alcock-paczynski(ap) test and volume effect to measure the cosmic expansion history. the galaxytwo-point correlation function as a function of angle, $\xi(\mu)$, is measuredat different redshifts. assuming an incorrect cosmological model to convertgalaxy redshifts to distances, the shape of $\xi(\mu)$ appears anisotropic dueto the ap effect, and the amplitude shifted by the change in comoving volume.due to the redshift dependence of the ap and volume effect, both the shape andamplitude of $\xi(\mu)$ exhibit redshift dependence. similar to li et.al(2014), we find the redshift-space distortions (rsd) caused by galaxy peculiarvelocities, although significantly distorts $\xi(\mu)$, exhibit much lessredshift evolution compared to the ap and volume effects. by focusing on theredshift dependence of $\xi(\mu)$, we can correctly recover the cosmologicalparameters despite the contamination of rsd. the method is tested by using thehorizon run 3 n-body simulation, from which we made a series of $1/8$-sky mocksurveys having 8 million physically self-bound halos and sampled to haveroughly a uniform number density in $z=0-1.5$. we find the ap effect results intight, unbiased constraints on the density parameter and dark energy equationof state, with 68.3% cl intervals $\delta \omega_m\sim0.03$ and $\deltaw\sim0.1$, and the volume effect leads to much tighter constraints of $\delta\omega_m\sim0.007$ and $\delta w\sim0.035$.

0805.0637	galactic satellite systems: radial distribution and environment  dependence of galaxy morphology	we have studied the radial distribution of the early (e/s0) and late (s/irr)types of satellites around bright host galaxies. we made a volume-limitedsample of 4,986 satellites brighter than m_r = -18.0 associated with 2,254hosts brighter than m_r =-19.0 from the sdss dr5 sample. the morphology ofsatellites is determined by an automated morphology classifier, but the hostgalaxies are visually classified. we found segregation of satellite morphologyas a function of the projected distance from the host galaxy. the amplitude andshape of the early-type satellite fraction profile are found to depend on thehost luminosity. this is the morphology-radius/density relation at the galacticscale. there is a strong tendency for morphology conformity between the hostgalaxy and its satellites. the early-type fraction of satellites hosted byearly-type galaxies is systematically larger than that of late-type hosts, andis a strong function of the distance from the host galaxies. fainter satellitesare more vulnerable to the morphology transformation effects of hosts.dependence of satellite morphology on the large-scale background density wasdetected. the fraction of early-type satellites increases in high densityregions for both early and late-type hosts. it is argued that the conformity inmorphology of galactic satellite system is mainly originated by thehydrodynamical and radiative effects of hosts on satellites.

1505.00788	the ecology of dark matter haloes i: the rates and types of halo  interactions	interactions such as mergers and flybys play a fundamental role in shapinggalaxy morphology. using the horizon run 4 cosmological n-body simulation, westudied the frequency and type of halo interactions, and their redshiftevolution as a function of the environment defined by the large-scale density,pair separation, mass ratio, and target halo mass. most interactions happen atlarge-scale density contrast $\delta \approx 20$, regardless of the redshift,corresponding to groups and relatively dense part of filaments. however, thefraction of interacting target is maximum at $\delta \approx 1000$. we providea new empirical fitting form for the interaction rate as a function of the halomass, large-scale density, and redshift. we also report the existence of twomodes of interactions from the distributions of mass ratio and relativedistance, implying two different physical origins of the interaction. satellitetargets lose their mass as they proceed deeper into the host halo. the relativeimportance of these two trends strongly depends on the large-scale density,target mass, and redshift.

1505.04429	effects of hot halo gas on the star formation and mass transfer during  distant galaxy-galaxy encounters	we use $n$-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of encountersbetween an early-type galaxy (etg) and a late-type galaxy (ltg) to study theeffects of hot halo gas on the evolution for a case with the mass ratio of theetg to ltg of 2:1 and the closest approach distance of $\sim$100 kpc. we findthat the dynamics of the cold disk gas in the tidal bridge and the amount ofthe newly formed stars depend strongly on the existence of a gas halo. in therun of interacting galaxies not having a hot gas halo, the gas and starsaccreted into the etg do not include newly formed stars. however, in the runusing the etg with a gas halo and the ltg without a gas halo, a shock formsalong the disk gas tidal bridge and induces star formation near the closestapproach. the shock front is parallel to a channel along which the cold gasflows toward the center of the etg. as a result, the etg can accretestar-forming cold gas and newly born stars at and near its center. when bothgalaxies have hot gas halos, a shock is formed between the two gas halossomewhat before the closest approach. the shock hinders the growth of the coldgas bridge to the etg and also ionizes it. only some of the disk stars transferthrough the stellar bridge. we conclude that the hot halo gas can givesignificant hydrodynamic effects during distant encounters.

1507.07954	the environment of barred galaxies revisited	we present a study of the environment of barred galaxies using galaxies drawnfrom the sdss. we use several different statistics to quantify the environment:the projected two-point cross-correlation function, the background-subtractednumber count of neighbor galaxies, the overdensity of the local environment,the membership of our galaxies to galaxy groups to segregate central andsatellite systems, and for central galaxies we estimate the stellar to halomass ratio (m$_{\mathrm{*}}/$m$_{\mathrm{h}}$) . when we split our sample intoearly- and late-type galaxies, we see a weak but significant trend forearly-type galaxies with a bar to be more strongly clustered on scales from afew 100 kpc to 1 mpc when compared to unbarred early-type galaxies. thisindicates that the presence of a bar in early-type galaxies depends on thelocation within their host dark matter halos. this is confirmed by the groupcatalog in the sense that for early-types, the fraction of central galaxies issmaller if they have a bar. for late-type galaxies, we find fewer neighborswithin $\sim50$ kpc around the barred galaxies when compared to unbarredgalaxies from the control sample, suggesting that tidal forces from closecompanions suppress the formation/growth of bars. for central late-typegalaxies, bars are more common on galaxies with highm$_{\mathrm{*}}/$m$_{\mathrm{h}}$ values, as expected from early theoreticalworks which showed that systems with massive dark matter halos are more stableagainst bar instabilities. finally, we find no obvious correlation betweenoverdensity and the bars in our sample, showing that galactic bars are notobviously linked to the large-scale structure of the universe.

0806.3643	environment and mass dependencies of galactic $\lambda$ spin parameter:  cosmological simulations and sdss galaxies compared	we use a sample of galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) tosearch for correlations between the $\lambda$ spin parameter and theenvironment and mass of galaxies. in order to calculate the total value of$\lambda$ for each observed galaxy, we employed a simple model of the dynamicalstructure of the galaxies which allows a rough estimate of the value of$\lambda$ using only readily obtainable observables from the luminous galaxies.use of a large volume limited sample (upwards of 11,000) allows reliableinferences of mean values and dispersions of $\lambda$ distributions. we find,in agreement with some n-body cosmological simulations, no significantdependence of $\lambda$ on the environmental density of the galaxies. for thecase of mass, our results show a marked correlation with $\lambda$, in thesense that low mass galaxies present both higher mean values of $\lambda$ andassociated dispersions, than high mass galaxies. this last direct empiricalresult, at odds with expectations from n-body cosmological simulations,provides interesting constrain on the mechanisms of galaxy formation andacquisition of angular momentum, a valuable test for cosmological models.

astro-ph;0012066	cosmic momentum field and mass fluctuation power spectrum	we introduce the cosmic momentum field as a new measure of the large-scalepeculiar velocity and matter fluctuation fields. the momentum field is definedas the peculiar velocity field traced and weighted by galaxies, and is equal tothe velocity field in the linear regime. we show that the radial component ofthe momentum field can be considered as a scalar field with the power spectrumwhich is practically 1/3 of that of the total momentum field. we present aformula for the power spectrum directly calculable from the observed radialpeculiar velocity data. the momentum power spectrum is measured for the matsample in the mark iii catalog of peculiar velocities of galaxies. using themomentum power spectrum we find the amplitude of the matter power spectrum is6400^{+2800}_{-1800} and 4500^{+2000}_{-1300} \omega^{-1.2} (h^{-1} mpc)^{-3}at the wavenumbers 0.049 and 0.074 h mpc^{-1}, respectively, where \omega isthe density parameter. the 68% confidence limits include the cosmic variance.the measured momentum and density power spectra together indicate that theparameter \beta_o = \omega^{0.6}/b_o = 0.51^{+0.13}_{-0.08} or \omega =0.33^{+0.15}_{-0.09} b_o^{5/3} where b_o is the bias factor for opticalgalaxies.

astro-ph;0102406	gaussianity of degree-scale cosmic microwave background anisotropy  observations	we present results from a first test of the gaussianity of degree-scalecosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropy. we investigate gaussianity of thecmb anisotropy by studying the topology of cmb anisotropy maps from the qmapand saskatoon experiments. we also study the qmask map, a combination map ofthe qmap and saskatoon data. we measure the genus from noise-suppressedwiener-filtered maps at an angular scale of about 1.5 degrees. to test thegaussianity of the observed anisotropy, we compare these results to thosederived from a collection of simulated maps for each experiment in a gaussianspatially-flat cosmological constant dominated cold dark matter model. thegenus-threshold level relations of the qmap and saskatoon maps are consistentwith gaussianity. while the combination qmask map has a mildly non-gaussiangenus curve which is not a consequence of known foreground contamination, thisresult is not statistically significant at the 2 sigma level. these resultsextend previous upper limits on the non-gaussianity of the large angular scale(&gt; 10 degrees) cmb anisotropy (measured by the cobe dmr experiment) down todegree angular scales.

astro-ph;0107004	effects of foreground contamination on the cosmic microwave background  anisotropy measured by map	we study the effects of diffuse galactic, far-infrared extragalactic source,and radio point source emission on the cosmic microwave background (cmb)anisotropy data anticipated from the map experiment. we focus on thecorrelation function and genus statistics measured from mock mapforeground-contaminated cmb anisotropy maps generated in a spatially-flatcosmological constant dominated cosmological model. analyses of the simulatedmap data at 90 ghz (0.3 deg fwhm resolution smoothed) show that foregroundeffects on the correlation function are small compared with cosmic variance.however, the galactic emission, even just from the region with |b| &gt; 20 deg,significantly affects the topology of cmb anisotropy, causing a negative genusshift non-gaussianity signal. given the expected level of cosmic variance, thiseffect can be effectively reduced by subtracting existing galactic foregroundemission models from the observed data. iras and dirbe far-infraredextragalactic sources have little effect on the cmb anisotropy. radio pointsources raise the amplitude of the correlation function considerably on scalesbelow 0.5 deg. removal of bright radio sources above a 5 \sigma detection limiteffectively eliminates this effect. radio sources also result in a positivegenus curve asymmetry (significant at 2 \sigma) on 0.5 deg scales. accurateradio point source data is essential for an unambiguous detection of cmbanisotropy non-gaussianity on these scales. non-gaussianity of cosmologicalorigin can be detected from the foreground-subtracted cmb anisotropy map at the2 \sigma level if the measured genus shift parameter |\delta\nu| &gt;= 0.02 (0.04)or if the measured genus asymmetry parameter |\delta g| &gt;= 0.03 (0.08) on a 0.3(1.0) deg fwhm scale.

astro-ph;0209491	observational strategies of cmb temperature and polarization  interferometry experiments	we have simulated the interferometric observation of the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) temperature and polarization fluctuations. we have constructeddata pipelines from the time-ordered raw visibility samples to the cmb powerspectra which utilize the methods of data compression, maximum likelihoodanalysis, and optimal subspace filtering. they are customized for threeobservational strategies, such as the single pointing, the mosaicking, and thedrift-scanning. for each strategy, derived are the optimal strategy parametersthat yield band power estimates with minimum uncertainty. the results aregeneral and can be applied to any close-packed array on a single platform suchas the cbi and the forthcoming amiba experiments. we have also studied theeffect of rotation of the array platform on the band power correlation bysimulating the cbi single pointing observation. it is found that the band poweranti-correlations can be reduced by rotating the platform and thus denselysampling the visibility plane. this enables us to increase the resolution ofthe power spectrum in the l-space down to the limit of the sampling theorem(delta l = 226 = pi / theta), which is narrower by a factor of about sqrt{2}than the resolution limit (delta l = 300) used in the recent cbi singlepointing observation. the validity of this idea is demonstrated for atwo-element interferometer that samples visibilities uniformly in theuv-annulus. from the fact that the visibilities are the fourier modes of thecmb field convolved with the beam, a fast unbiased estimator (fue) of the cmbpower spectra is developed and tested. it is shown that the fue gives resultsvery close to those from the quadratic estimator method without requiring largecomputer resources even though uncertainties in the results increase.

astro-ph;0401386	a new halo finding method for n-body simulations	we have developed a new halo finding method, physically self-bound (psb)group finding algorithm, which can efficiently identify halos located even atcrowded regions. this method combines two physical criteria such as the tidalradius of a halo and the total energy of each particle to find memberparticles. two hierarchical meshes are used to increase the speed and the powerof halo identification in the parallel computing environments. first, a coarsemesh with cell size equal to the mean particle separation $l_{\rm mean}$ isused to obtain the density field over the whole simulation box. mesh cellshaving density contrast higher than a local cutoff threshold $\delta_{\rm loc}$are extracted and linked together for those adjacent to each other. thisproduces local-cell groups. second, a finer mesh is used to obtain densityfield within each local-cell group and to identify halos. if a density shellcontains only one density peak, its particles are assigned to the density peak.but in the case of a density shell surrounding at least two density peaks, weuse both the tidal radii of halo candidates enclosed by the shell and the totalenergy criterion to find physically bound particles with respect to each halo.similar to denmax and hop, the \hfind method can efficiently identify smallhalos embedded in a large halo, while the fof and the so do not resolve suchsmall halos. we apply our new halo finding method to a 1-giga particlesimulation of the $\lambda$cdm model and compare the resulting mass functionwith those of previous studies. the abundance of physically self-bound halos islarger at the low mass scale and smaller at the high mass scale than proposedby the jenkins et al.

astro-ph;0503584	effects of gravitational evolution, biasing, and redshift space  distortion on topology	we have studied the dependence of topology of large scale structure ontracer, gravitational evolution, redshift space distortion, and cosmology. aseries of large n-body simulations of the $\lambda$cdm and scdm models thathave evolved 1.1 or 8.6 billion particles, are used in the study. evolution ofthe genus statistic, used as a topology measure, from redshift 8 to 0 isaccurately calculated over a wide range of smoothing scales using thesimulations. the tracers of large scale structure considered are the cdmmatter, biased peaks in the initial density field, dark halos, and `galaxies'populating the dark halos in accordance with a halo occupation distribution(hod) model.  we have found that the effects of biasing, gravitational evolution, andinitial conditions on topology of large scale structure are all comparable. theredshift space distortion effects are relatively small down to about 5$h^{-1}$mpc for all tracers except for the high threshold part of the genuscurve. the gravitational effects are found to be well-modeled by the analyticperturbation theory when the cdm matter distribution is considered. but thedirection of gravitational evolution of topology can be even reversed fordifferent tracers. for example, the shift parameter of the genus curve evolvesin opposite directions for matter and hod `galaxies' at large scales. at smallscales there are interesting deviations of the genus curve of dark halos and`galaxies' from that of matter in our initially gaussian simulations. thedeviations should be understood as due to combined effects of gravitationalevolution and biasing.

astro-ph;0506194	fourier phase analysis of sdss galaxies	we present a first analysis of the clustering of sdss galaxies using thedistribution function of the sum of fourier phases. this statistic was recentlyproposed by one of authors as a new method to probe phase correlations ofcosmological density fields. since the fourier phases are statisticallyindependent of fourier amplitudes, the phase statistic plays a complementaryrole to the conventional two-point statistics of galaxy clustering. inparticular, we focus on the distribution functions of phase sum over threeclosed wavevectors as a function of the configurations of triangle wavevectors.we find that the observed distribution functions of phase sum are in goodagreement with the lowest-order approximation from perturbation theory. fordirect comparison with observations, we construct mock catalogs from n-bodysimulations taking account of several observational effects such as the surveygeometry, the redshift distortion, and the discreteness due to the limitednumber of data. indeed the observed phase correlations for the galaxies in therange of absolute magnitude -22&lt;mr&lt;-18 agree well with those for lambda cdmpredictions with sigma8=0.9 evolved from gaussian initial condition. thisagreement implies that the galaxy biasing is approximately linear in redshiftspace. instead, assuming that the galaxy biasing is described by a quadraticdeterministic function at scale larger than 30mpc/h, we can constrain the ratioof the quadratic biasing parameter b2 to the linear biasing parameter b1. wefind that resulting b2/b1 is mainly dependent on sigma8 and that it is wellfitted by b2/b1=0.54(+-0.06)-0.62(+-0.08)sigma8 in cdm models. indeed, b2/b1 isnearly zero when sigma8=0.9.

astro-ph;0509740	power spectrum of cosmic momentum field measured from the sfi galaxy  sample	we have measured the cosmic momentum power spectrum from the peculiarvelocities of galaxies in the sfi sample. the sfi catalog contains field spiralgalaxies with radial peculiar velocities derived from the i-band tully-fisherrelation. as a natural measure of the large-scale peculiar velocity field, weuse the cosmic momentum field that is defined as the peculiar velocity fieldweighted by local number of galaxies. we have shown that the momentum powerspectrum can be derived from the density power spectrum for the constant linearbiasing of galaxy formation, which makes it possible to estimate \beta_s =\omega_m^{0.6} / b_s parameter precisely where \omega_m is the matter densityparameter and b_s is the bias factor for optical spiral galaxies. at eachwavenumber k we estimate \beta_s(k) as the ratio of the measured to the derivedmomentum power over a wide range of scales (0.026 h^{-1}mpc &lt;~ k &lt;~ 0.157h^{-1}mpc) that spans the linear to the quasi-linear regimes. the estimated\beta_s(k)'s have stable values around 0.5, which demonstrates the constancy of\beta_s parameter at scales down to 40 h^{-1}mpc. we have obtained\beta_s=0.49_{-0.05}^{+0.08} or \omega_m = 0.30_{-0.05}^{+0.09} b_s^{5/3}, andthe amplitude of mass fluctuation as\sigma_8\omega_m^{0.6}=0.56_{-0.21}^{+0.27}. the 68% confidence limits includethe cosmic variance. we have also estimated the mass density power spectrum.for example, at k=0.1047 h mpc^{-1} (\lambda=60 h^{-1}mpc) we measure\omega_m^{1.2} p_{\delta}(k)=(2.51_{-0.94}^{+0.91})\times 10^3 (h^{-1}mpc)^3,which is lower compared to the high-amplitude power spectra found from theprevious maximum likelihood analyses of peculiar velocity samples like markiii, sfi, and enear.

astro-ph;0610762	topology of structure in the sloan digital sky survey: model testing	we measure the three-dimensional topology of large-scale structure in thesloan digital sky survey (sdss). this allows the genus statistic to be measuredwith unprecedented statistical accuracy. the sample size is now sufficientlylarge to allow the topology to be an important tool for testing galaxyformation models. for comparison, we make mock sdss samples using severalstate-of-the-art n-body simulations: the millennium run of springel et al.(2005)(10 billion particles), kim &amp; park (2006) cdm models (1.1 billionparticles), and cen &amp; ostriker (2006) hydrodynamic code models (8.6 billioncell hydro mesh). each of these simulations uses a different method formodeling galaxy formation. the sdss data show a genus curve that is broadlycharacteristic of that produced by gaussian random phase initial conditions.thus the data strongly support the standard model of inflation where gaussianrandom phase initial conditions are produced by random quantum fluctuations inthe early universe. but on top of this general shape there are measurabledifferences produced by non-linear gravitational effects (cf. matsubara 1994),and biasing connected with galaxy formation. the n-body simulations have beentuned to reproduce the power spectrum and multiplicity function but nottopology, so topology is an acid test for these models. the data show a``meatball'' shift (only partly due to the sloan great wall of galaxies; thisshift also appears in a sub-sample not containing the wall) which differs atthe 2.5\sigma level from the results of the millennium run and the kim &amp; parkdark halo models, even including the effects of cosmic variance.

astro-ph;0611607	internal and collective properties of galaxies in the sloan digital sky  survey	we examine volume-limited samples from the sdss galaxies to look forrelations among internal and collective physical parameters of galaxies asfaint as m_r=- 17.5, which include morphology, luminosity, color, colorgradient, concentration, size, velocity dispersion, equivalent width (ew) ofh_alpha line,axis ratio, the luminosity and velocity dispersion functions. atfixed morphology and luminosity, we find that bright (m_r&lt;-20) early-types showvery small dispersions in color, color gradient, concentration, size, andvelocity dispersion. these dispersions increase at fainter magnitudes, wherethe fraction of blue early-types increases. late-types show wider dispersionsin all physical parameters compared to early types at the same luminosity.concentration indices of early-types are well-correlated with velocitydispersion, but are insensitive to luminosity and color for bright galaxies.the slope of the faber-jackson relation continuously changes from 4.6 +- 0.4 to2.7+- 0.2 when luminosity changes from m_r = -22 to -20. the size of early-types is well-correlated with stellar velocity dispersion (for &gt;100 km/s). wefind that passive spirals are well-separated from star-forming late-types at ew(h_alpha) of about 4. an interesting finding is that many physical parametersof galaxies manifest different behaviors across the absolute magnitude of aboutm_* +- 1. the morphology fraction as a function of luminosity depends lesssensitively on large scale structure than the luminosity function (lf) does,and thus seems to be more universal. the effects of internal extinction inlate-types on the completeness of volume limited samples and on the lf andmorphology fraction are found to be very important.

astro-ph;0611610	environmental dependence of properties of galaxies in the sloan digital  sky survey	we investigate the dependence of physical properties of galaxies brighterthan m_r=-18.0 in the sdss on environment, as measured by local density usingan adaptive smoothing kernel. we find that variations of galaxy properties withenvironment are almost entirely due to the dependence of morphology andluminosity on environment. because galaxy properties depend not only onluminosity but also on morphology, it is clear that galaxy properties cannot bedetermined solely by dark halo mass. when morphology and luminosity are fixed,other physical properties, such as color, color-gradient, concentration, size,velocity dispersion, and star formation rate, are nearly independent of localdensity. the only feature is the sharp decrease of late type fraction above thecritical luminosity of about m_r=-21.3 in the morphology versus luminosityrelation. weak residual dependences on environment include that of the color oflate-types (bluer at lower density) and of the l-sigma relation of early-types(larger dispersion at higher density for bright galaxies). the early-typefraction is a monotonically increasing function of local density andluminosity. the morphology-density- luminosity relation should be a keyconstraint on galaxy formation models. we demonstrate that the dependence onenvironment of the morphology of galaxie originates from variations in densityon effective gaussian smoothing scales much smaller than 12 h^{-1}mpc. we findthat galaxy morphology varies both with density measured on an effectivegaussian smoothing scale of 4.7 h^{-1} mpc and on distance to the nearestbright galaxy (particularly, for about 0.2 h^{-1}mpc). we propose a mechanismthat the morphology of galaxies in galaxy systems is transformed by the tidalforce.

0809.2156	combined effects of galaxy interactions and large-scale environment on  galaxy properties	we inspect the coupled dependence of physical parameters of the sdss galaxieson the small-scale (distance to and morphology of the nearest neighbor galaxy)and the large-scale (background density smoothed over 20 nearby galaxies)environments. the impacts of interaction on galaxy properties are detected atleast out to the neighbor separation corresponding to the virial radius ofgalaxies, which is typically between 200 and 400 h^{-1}kpc for the galaxies inour sample. to detect these long-range interaction effects it is crucial todivide galaxy interactions into four cases dividing the morphology of targetand neighbor galaxies into early and late types. we show that there are twocharacteristic neighbor-separation scales where the galaxy interactions causeabrupt changes in the properties of galaxies. the first scale is the virialradius of the nearest neighbor galaxy r_{vir,nei}. many physical parametersstart to deviate from those of extremely isolated galaxies at the projectedneighbor separation r_p of about r_{vir,nei}. the second scale is at r_p\approx 0.05 r_{vir,nei} = 10--20 h^{-1} kpc, and is the scale at which thegalaxies in pairs start to merge. we find that late-type neighbors enhance thestar formation activity of galaxies while early-type neighbors reduce it, andthat these effects occur within r_{vir,nei}. the hot halo gas and cold disk gasmust be participating in the interactions at separations less than the virialradius of the galaxy plus dark halo system. our results also show that the roleof the large-scale density in determining galaxy properties is minimal onceluminosity and morphology are fixed. we propose that the weak residualdependence of galaxy properties on the large-scale density is due to thedependence of the halo gas property on the large-scale density.

astro-ph;9711057	cmb anisotropy correlation function and topology from simulated maps for  map	we have simulated cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropy maps forseveral cobe-dmr-normalized cold dark matter (cdm) cosmogonies, to makepredictions for the upcoming map experiment. we have studied the sensitivity ofthe simulated map data to cosmology, sky coverage, and instrumental noise. withaccurate knowledge of instrumental noise, map data will discriminate among thecosmogonies considered, and determine the topology of the initial fluctuations.  a correlation function analysis of the simulated map data results in a veryaccurate measurement of the acoustic hubble radius at decoupling. a low-densityopen cdm model with omega_0=0.4 can be distinguished from the omega_0=1fiducial cdm model or a lambda cdm model with &gt; 99% confidence from thelocation of the acoustic "valley" in the correlation function.  a genus analysis of the simulated map data indicates that in cosmogonies withgaussian random-phase initial conditions, a shift of the zero-crossing point ofthe genus curve near the mean temperature threshold level nu=0 should notexceed |delta nu| = 0.01 (0.04) when the total effective fwhm smoothing is 0.3deg (1.0 deg). the asymmetry of the genus curve at the positive and negativethreshold levels should not exceed |delta g/g(nu=1,-1)| = 0.8% (4%) at 0.3 deg(1.0 deg) fwhm smoothing. deviations of the observed map data in excess ofthese small values will be evidence for non-gaussian behavior.  the amplitude of the genus curve is a measure of the shape of the powerspectrum at the smoothing scale. even with the expected amount of instrumentalnoise and partial sky coverage (due to the galaxy), the map data should allowdiscrimination amongst the cosmogonies considered at more than 99% confidencesolely from a genus amplitude analysis.

astro-ph;9712039	diffuse dark and bright objects in the hubble deep field	in the hubble deep field (hdf) we have identified candidate regions whereprimordial galaxies might be forming. these regions are identified fromnegative or positive peaks in the difference maps obtained from the hdf mapssmoothed over 0.8'' and 4''. they have apparent v magnitudes typically between29 and 31 (missing flux below the local average level for the dark objects).the identified objects are shown to be real by two ways. first, thecross-correlations of these peaks detected in different filters are strong.second, their auto-correlation functions indicate that these faint diffuseobjects are self-clustered. the subset of objects dark in the f450w and f606wbandpasses, but bright in f814w, also shows stronger correlation compared tothe whole dark sample. this further supports that our samples are indeedphysical objects. the amplitude and slope of the angular correlation functionof the bright objects indicates that these objects are ancestors of the presentnearby bright galaxies. we have inspected individual bright objects and notedthat they have several tiny spots embedded in extended backgrounds. they arelikely to be the primordial galaxies at high redshifts in the process of activestar formation and merging. our subset of dark objects is thought to be the`intergalactic dark clouds' he blocking the background far uv light (at therest frame) at high redshifts instead of empty spaces between the firstgalaxies at the edge of the universe of galaxies.

astro-ph;9902332	topology from the simulated sloan digital sky survey	we measure the topology (genus curve) of the galaxy distribution in a mockredshift catalog designed to resemble the upcoming sloan digital sky survey(sdss). the catalog, drawn from a large n-body simulation of a lambda-cdm cos-mological model, mimics the anticipated spectroscopic selection procedures ofthe sdss in some detail. sky maps, redshift slices, and 3-d contour maps of themock survey reveal a rich and complex structure, including networks of voidsand superclusters that resemble the patterns seen in the cfa redshift surveyand the las campanas redshift survey (lcrs). the 3-d genus curve can bemeasured from the simulated catalog with superb precision; this curve has thegeneral shape predicted for gaussian, random phase initial conditions, but theerror bars are small enough to demonstrate with high significance the subtledepartures from this shape caused by non-linear gravitational evolution. thesedistortions have the form predicted by matsubara's (1994) perturbative anal-ysis, but they are much smaller in amplitude. we also measure the 3-d genuscurve of the radial peculiar velocity field measured by applying distance-indicator relations (with realistic errors) to the mock catalog. this genuscurve is consistent with the gaussian random phase prediction, though it is ofrelatively low precision because of the large smoothing length required toovercome noise in the measured velocity field. finally, we measure the 2-dtopology in redshift slices, similar to early slices from the sdss and toslices already observed in the lcrs. the genus curves of these slices areconsistent with the observed genus curves of the lcrs, providing furtherevidence in favor of the inflationary cdm model with omega_m~0.4. the catalogis publicly available at http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~dhw/sdss.html.

astro-ph;9909008	correlation functions of the abell, apm, and x-ray clusters of galaxies	we have measured the correlation functions of the optically selected clustersof galaxies in the abell and the apm catalogs, and of the x-ray clusters in thex-ray-brightest abell-type clusters of galaxies (xbacs) catalog and thebrightest clusters sample (bcs). the same analysis method and the same methodof characterizing the resulting correlation functions are applied to allobservational samples. we have found that the amplitude of the correlationfunction of the apm clusters is much higher than what has been previouslyclaimed, in particular for richer subsamples. the correlation length of the apmclusters with the richness r &gt;= 70 (as defined by the apm team) is found to ber_0 = 25.4(+3.1,-3.0) h^(-1)mpc. the amplitude of correlation function is about2.4 times higher than that of croft et al. (1997). the correlation lengths ofthe abell clusters with the richness class rc &gt;= 0 and 1 are measured to be r_0= 17.4(+1.2,-1.1) and 21.0(+2.8,-2.8) h^(-1)mpc, respectively, which isconsistent with our results for the apm sample at the similar level ofrichness. the richness dependence of cluster correlations is found to be r_0 =0.40*d_c + 3.2 where d_c is the mean intercluster separation. this is identicalin slope with the bahcall &amp; west (1992)'s estimate, but is inconsistent withthe weak dependence of croft et al. (1997). the x-ray bright abell clusters inthe xbacs catalog and the x-ray selected clusters in the bcs catalog showstrong clustering. the correlation length of the xbacs clusters with l_x &gt;=0.65*10^44 h^(-2)erg/s is 30.3(+8.2,-6.5) h^(-1)mpc, and that of the bcsclusters with l_x &gt;= 0.70*10^44 h^(-2)erg/s is 30.2(+9.8,-8.9) h^(-1)mpc. theclustering strength of the x-ray clusters is much weaker than what is expectedfrom the optical clusters.

0810.3359	alignments of group galaxies with neighboring groups	using a sample of galaxy groups found in the sloan digital  sky survey data release 4, we measure the following four types of alignmentsignals: (1) the alignment between the distributions of the satellites of eachgroup relative to the direction of the nearest neighbor group (nng); (2) thealignment between the major axis direction of the central galaxy of the hostgroup (hg) and the direction of the nng; (3) the alignment between the majoraxes of the central galaxies of the hg and the nng; and (4) the alignmentbetween the major axes of the satellites of the hg and the direction of thenng. we find strong signal of alignment between the satellite distribution andthe orientation of central galaxy relative to the direction of the nng, evenwhen the nng is located beyond $3r_{\rm vir}$ of the host group. the major axisof the central galaxy of the hg is aligned with the direction of the nng. thealignment signals are more prominent for groups that are more massive and withearly type central galaxies. we also find that there is a preference for thetwo major axis of the central galaxies of the hg and nng to be parallel for thesystem with both early central galaxies, however not for the systems with bothlate type central galaxies. for the orientation of satellite galaxies, we donot find any significant alignment signals relative to the direction of thenng. from these four types of alignment measurements, we conclude that thelarge scale environment traced by the nearby group affects primarily the shapeof the host dark matter halo, and hence also affects the distribution ofsatellite galaxies and the orientation of central galaxies.

0812.1392	the horizon run n-body simulation: baryon acoustic oscillations and  topology of large scale structure of the universe	in support of the new sloan iii survey, which will measure the baryonoscillation scale using the luminous red galaxies (lrgs), we have run thelargest n-body simulation to date using $4120^3 = 69.9$ billion particles, andcovering a volume of $(6.592 h^{-1} {\rm gpc})^3$. this is over 2000 times thevolume of the millennium run, and corner-to-corner stretches all the way to thehorizon of the visible universe. lrg galaxies are selected by finding the mostmassive gravitationally bound, cold dark matter subhalos, not subject to tidaldisruption, a technique that correctly reproduces the 3d topology of the lrggalaxies in the sloan survey.we have measured the covariance function, powerspectrum, and the 3d topology of the lrg galaxy distribution in our simulationand made 32 mock surveys along the past lightcone to simulate the sloan iiisurvey. our large n-body simulation is used to accurately measure thenon-linear systematic effects such as gravitational evolution, redshift spacedistortion, past light cone space gradient, and galaxy biasing, and tocalibrate the baryon oscillation scale and the genus topology. for example, wepredict from our mock surveys that the baryon acoustic oscillation peak scalecan be measured with the cosmic variance-dominated uncertainty of about 5% whenthe sdss-iii sample is divided into three equal volume shells, or about 2.6%when a thicker shell with $0.4&lt;z&lt;0.6$ is used. we find that one needs tocorrect the scale for the systematic effects amounting up to 5.2% to use it toconstrain the linear theories. and the uncertainty in the amplitude of thegenus curve is expected to be about 1% at 15 $h^{-1}$mpc scale. we are makingthe simulation and mock surveys publicly available.

0812.2088	interactions of galaxies in the galaxy cluster environment	we study the dependence of galaxy properties on the clustercentric radius andthe environment attributed to the nearest neighbor galaxy using the sdssgalaxies associated with the abell galaxy clusters. we find that there exists acharacteristic scale where the properties of galaxies suddenly start to dependon the clustercentric radius at fixed neighbor environment. the characteristicscale is $1\sim 3$ times the cluster virial radius depending on galaxyluminosity. existence of the characteristic scale means that the local galaxynumber density is not directly responsible for the morphology-density relationin clusters because the local density varies smoothly with the clustercentricradius and has no discontinuity in general. what is really working in clustersis the morphology-clustercentric radius-neighbor environment relation, wherethe neighbor environment means both neighbor morphology and the local massdensity attributed to the neighbor. the morphology-density relation appearsworking only because of the statistical correlation between the nearestneighbor distance and the local galaxy number density. we find strong evidencethat the hydrodynamic interactions with nearby early-type galaxies is the maindrive to quenching star formation activity of late-type galaxies in clusters.the hot cluster gas seems to play at most a minor role down to one tenth of thecluster virial radius. we also find that the viable mechanisms which canaccount for the clustercentric radius dependence of the structural and internalkinematics parameters are harassment and interaction of galaxies with thecluster potential. the morphology transformation of the late-type galaxies inclusters seems to have taken place through both galaxy-galaxy hydrodynamicinteractions and galaxy-cluster/galaxy-galaxy gravitational interactions.
