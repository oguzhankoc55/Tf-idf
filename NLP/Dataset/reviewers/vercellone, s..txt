0902.1985	disentangling the system geometry of the supergiant fast x-ray transient  igr j11215-5952 with swift	igr j11215-5952 is a hard x-ray transient discovered in 2005 april byintegral and a member of the new class of hmxb, the supergiant fast x-raytransients (sfxts). while integral and rxte observations have shown that theoutbursts occur with a periodicity of ~330 days, swift data have recentlydemonstrated that the true outburst period is ~165 days. igr j11215-5952 is thefirst discovered sfxt displaying periodic outbursts, which are possibly relatedto the orbital period. we performed a guest investigator observation with swiftthat lasted 20ks and several follow-up target of opportunity (too)observations, for a total of ~32ks, during the expected "apastron" passage(defined assuming an orbital period of ~330 days), between 2008 june 16 andjuly 4. the characteristics of this "apastron'' outburst are quite similar tothose previously observed during the "periastron'' outburst of 2007 february 9.the mean spectrum of the bright peaks can be fit with an absorbed power lawmodel with a photon index of 1 and an absorbing column of 1e22 cm^-2. thisoutburst reached luminosities of ~1e36 erg/s (1-10kev), comparable with theones measured in 2007. the light curve can be modelled with the parametersobtained by sidoli et al. (2007) for the 2007 february 9 outburst, althoughsome differences can be observed in its shape. the properties of the rise tothis new outburst and the comparison with the previous outbursts allow us tosuggest that the true orbital period of igr j11215-5952 is very likely 164.6days, and that the orbit is eccentric, with the different outbursts produced atthe periastron passage, when the neutron star crosses the inclined equatorialwind from the supergiant companion. based on a too observation performed on2008 march 25-27, we can exclude that the period is 165/2 days.

0902.1988	swift and supergiant fast x-ray transients: a novel monitoring approach	we describe our monitoring strategy which best exploits the sensitivity andflexibility of swift to study the long-term behaviour of supergiant fast x-raytransients (sfxts). we present observations of the recent outbursts from twoobjects of this class. igr j16479-4514, underwent an outburst on 2008 march 19,reaching a peak luminosity of about 6e37 erg/s (0.5-100kev; at a distance of4.9 kpc). we obtained a simultaneous broad-band spectrum (0.3-100 kev), thefirst for the sfxt class, which is fit with a heavily absorbed (column density5e22 cm^-2) hard power-law with a high energy cut-off at about 7kev. thisspectrum shows properties similar to the ones of accreting pulsars, although nox-ray pulsations were found. igr j11215-5952, one of the only two periodic sfxtknown to date, was observed with swift several times, first with an intense23-day long monitoring campaign around the 2007 february 9 outburst; then witha 26-day long monitoring around the unexpected july 24 outburst; finally with adeep exposure during the 2008 june 16 outburst. we present the whole dataset,which also includes observations which allowed us to firmly establish theoutburst period at p~165 days. thanks to our combined observations commoncharacteristics to this class of objects are emerging, i.e., outburst lengthswell in excess of hours, often with a multiple peaked structure, dynamic range~3 orders of magnitude, and periodicities are starting to be found.

0902.2959	first agile catalog of high confidence gamma-ray sources	we present the first catalog of high-confidence gamma-ray sources detected bythe agile satellite during observations performed from july 9, 2007 to june 30,2008. catalogued sources are detected by merging all the available data overthe entire time period. agile, launched in april 2007, is an asi missiondevoted to gamma-ray observations in the 30 mev - 50 gev energy range, withsimultaneous x-ray imaging capability in the 18-60 kev band. this catalog isbased on gamma-ray imaging detector (grid) data for energies greater than 100mev. for the first agile catalog we adopted a conservative analysis, with ahigh-quality event filter optimized to select gamma-ray events within thecentral zone of the instrument field of view (radius of 40 degrees). this is asignificance-limited (4 sigma) catalog, and it is not a complete flux-limitedsample due to the non-uniform first year agile sky coverage. the catalogincludes 47 sources, 21 of which are associated with confirmed or candidatepulsars, 13 with blazars (7 fsrq, 4 bl lacs, 2 unknown type), 2 with hmxrbs, 2with snrs, 1 with a colliding-wind binary system, 8 with unidentified sources.

0905.2815	supergiant fast x-ray transients in outburst: new swift observations of  xtej1739-302, igrj17544-2619, and igrj08408-4503	we report on new x-ray outbursts observed with swift from three supergiantfast x-ray transients (sfxts): xtej1739-302, igrj17544-2619 and igrj08408-4503.the former two outbursts were caught during the monitoring campaign we havebeen performing with the swift satellite since october 2007: xtej1739-302underwent a new outburst on 2008, august 13, igrj17544-2619 on 2008, september4, while igrj08408-4503 on 2008, september 21. while xtej1739-302 andigrj08408-4503 bright emission triggered the swift/burst alert telescope,igrj17544-2619 did not, thus we could perform a spectral investigation only ofthe spectrum below 10 kev. the broad band spectra from xtej1739-302 andigrj08408-4503 were compatible with the x-ray spectral shape displayed duringthe previous flares. a variable absorbing column density during the flare wasobserved in xtej1739-302 for the first time. the broad band spectrum ofigrj08408-4503 requires the presence of two distinct photon populations, a coldone (0.3 kev) most likely from a thermal halo around the neutron star and ahotter one (1.4-1.8 kev) from the accreting column. the outburst fromxtej1739-302 could be monitored with a very good sampling, thus revealing ashape which can be explained with a second wind component in this sfxt, inanalogy to what we have suggested in the periodic sfxt igrj11215-5952. theoutburst recurrence timescale in igrj17544-2619 during our monitoring campaignwith swift suggests a long orbital period of ~150 days (in an highly eccentricorbit), compatible with what previously observed with integral.

0906.1446	observation of grbs with agile	since its early phases of operation, the agile satellite is observing gammaray bursts (grbs) over an energy range potentially spanning six orders ofmagnitude. in the hard x-ray band the superagile imager provides localizationof about one grb/month plus the detection of 1-2 grbs per month out of itsfield of view. the mini-calorimeter detects about one grb/week in the 350kev -100mev energy range, plus several other transients at very short time scales.in fact, the on-board mcal trigger logic, implemented for the first time ontime windows as short as 300 microseconds, is particularly suitable for veryshort bursts detection. the gamma-ray imaging detector (grid), sensitive in the30mev - 30gev range, firmly detected three grbs (grb080514b, grb090401b andgrb090510) plus some other candidates at a lower significance level. moreover,all grbs localized by other spacecrafts inside the grid field of view arecurrently searched for possible detection, and upper limits are provided. inthis paper we review the status of the observation of grbs with agile, withparticular emphasis on high energy and short time scales detections.

0909.3484	agile detection of a rapid gamma-ray flare from the blazar pks 1510-089  during the gasp-webt monitoring	we report the detection by the agile satellite of a rapid gamma-ray flarefrom the powerful gamma-ray quasar pks 1510-089, during a pointing centered onthe galactic center region from 1 march to 30 march 2008. this source has beencontinuosly monitored in the radio-to-optical bands by the glast-agile supportprogram (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope (webt). moreover, thegamma-ray flaring episode triggered three too observations by the swiftsatellite in three consecutive days, starting from 20 march 2008. in the period1-16 march 2008, agile detected gamma-ray emission from pks 1510-089 at asignificance level of 6.2-sigma with an average flux over the entire period of(84 +/- 17) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} for photon energies above 100 mev.after a predefined satellite re-pointing, between 17 and 21 march 2008, agiledetected the source at a significance level of 7.3-sigma, with an average flux(e &gt; 100 mev) of (134 +/- 29) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} and a peak levelof (281 +/- 68) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} with daily integration. duringthe observing period january-april 2008, the source also showed an intense andvariable optical activity, with several flaring episodes and a significantincrease of the flux was observed at millimetric frequencies. moreover, in thex-ray band the swift/xrt observations seem to show an harder-when-brighterbehaviour of the source spectrum. the spectral energy distribution of mid-march2008 is modelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self compton emissionplus contributions from inverse compton scattering of external photons fromboth the accretion disc and the broad line region. indeed, some features in theoptical-uv spectrum seem to indicate the presence of seyfert-like components,such as the little blue bump and the big blue bump.

0910.4883	multiwavelength observations of 3c 454.3 ii. the agile 2007 december  campaign	we report on the second agile multiwavelength campaign of the blazar 3c 454.3during the first half of december 2007. this campaign involved agile, spitzer,swift,suzaku,the webt consortium,the rem and mitsume telescopes,offering abroad band coverage that allowed for a simultaneous sampling of the synchrotronand inverse compton (ic) emissions.the 2-week agile monitoring was accompaniedby radio to optical monitoring by webt and rem and by sparse observations inmid-infrared and soft/hard x-ray energy bands performed by means of target ofopportunity observations by spitzer, swift and suzaku, respectively.the sourcewas detected with an average flux of~250x10^{-8}ph cm^-2s^-1 above 100mev,typical of its flaring states.the simultaneous optical and gamma-raymonitoring allowed us to study the time-lag associated with the variability inthe two energy bands, resulting in a possible ~1-day delay of the gamma-rayemission with respect to the optical one. from the simultaneous optical andgamma-ray fast flare detected on december 12, we can constrain the delaybetween the gamma-ray and optical emissions within 12 hours. moreover, weobtain three spectral energy distributions (seds) with simultaneous data for2007 december 5, 13, 15, characterized by the widest multifrequency coverage.we found that a model with an external compton on seed photons by a standarddisk and reprocessed by the broad line regions does not describe in asatisfactory way the seds of 2007 december 5, 13 and 15. an additionalcontribution, possibly from the hot corona with t=10^6 k surrounding the jet,is required to account simultaneously for the softness of the synchrotron andthe hardness of the inverse compton emissions during those epochs.

0910.5344	discovery of extreme particle acceleration in the microquasar cygnus x-3	the study of relativistic particle acceleration is a major topic ofhigh-energy astrophysics. it is well known that massive black holes in activegalaxies can release a substantial fraction of their accretion power intoenergetic particles, producing gamma-rays and relativistic jets. galacticmicroquasars (hosting a compact star of 1-10 solar masses which accretes matterfrom a binary companion) also produce relativistic jets. however, no directevidence of particle acceleration above gev energies has ever been obtained inmicroquasar ejections, leaving open the issue of the occurrence and timing ofextreme matter energization during jet formation. here we report the detectionof transient gamma-ray emission above 100 mev from the microquasar cygnus x-3,an exceptional x-ray binary which sporadically produces powerful radio jets.four gamma-ray flares (each lasting 1-2 days) were detected by the agilesatellite simultaneously with special spectral states of cygnus x-3 during theperiod mid-2007/mid-2009. our observations show that very efficient particleacceleration and gamma-ray propagation out of the inner disk of a microquasarusually occur a few days before major relativistic jet ejections. flaringparticle energies can be thousands of times larger than previously detectedmaximum values (with lorentz factors of 105 and 102 for electrons and protons,respectively). we show that the transitional nature of gamma-ray flares andparticle acceleration above gev energies in cygnus x-3 is clearly linked tospecial radio/x-ray states preceding strong radio flares. thus gamma-raysprovide unique insight into the nature of physical processes in microquasars.

1001.5150	direct evidence for hadronic cosmic-ray acceleration in the supernova  renmant ic 443	the supernova remnant (snr) ic 443 is an intermediate-age remnant well knownfor its radio, optical, x-ray and gamma-ray energy emissions. in this letter westudy the gamma-ray emission above 100 mev from ic 443 as obtained by the agilesatellite. a distinct pattern of diffuse emission in the energy range 100 mev-3gev is detected across the snr with its prominent maximum (source "a")localized in the northeastern shell with a flux f = (47 \pm 10) 10^{-8} photonscm^{-2} s^{-1} above 100 mev. this location is the site of the strongest shockinteraction between the snr blast wave and the dense circumstellar medium.source "a" is not coincident with the tev source located 0.4 degree away andassociated with a dense molecular cloud complex in the snr central region. fromour observations, and from the lack of detectable diffuse tev emission from itsnortheastern rim, we demonstrate that electrons cannot be the main emitters ofgamma-rays in the range 0.1-10 gev at the site of the strongest snr shock. theintensity, spectral characteristics, and location of the most prominentgamma-ray emission together with the absence of co-spatial detectable tevemission are consistent only with a hadronic model of cosmic-ray accelerationin the snr. a high-density molecular cloud (cloud "e") provides a remarkable"target" for nucleonic interactions of accelerated hadrons: our results showenhanced gamma-ray production near the molecular cloud/shocked shellinteraction site. ic 443 provides the first unambiguous evidence of cosmic-rayacceleration by snrs.

1005.0784	agile detection of gev gamma-ray emission from the snr w28	supernova remnants (snrs) are believed to be the main sources of galacticcosmic rays. molecular clouds associated with snrs can produce gamma-rayemission through the interaction of accelerated particles with the concentratedgas. the middle aged snr w28, for its associated system of dense molecularclouds, provides an excellent opportunity to test this hypothesis. we presentthe agile/grid observations of snr w28, and compare them with observations atother wavelengths (tev and 12co j=1--&gt;0 molecular line emission). the gamma-rayflux detected by agile from the dominant source associated with w28 is (14 +-5) 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for e &gt; 400 mev. this source is positionally wellcorrelated with the tev emission observed by the hess telescope. the localvariations of the gev to tev flux ratio suggest a difference between the crspectra of the north-west and south molecular cloud complexes. a model based ona hadronic-induced interaction and diffusion with two molecular clouds atdifferent distances from the w28 shell can explain both the morphological andspectral features observed by agile in the mev-gev energy range and by the hesstelescope in the tev energy range. the combined set of agile and h.e.s.s. datastrongly support a hadronic model for the gamma-ray production in w28.

1005.4891	the extraordinary gamma-ray flare of the blazar 3c 454.3	we present the gamma-ray data of the extraordinary flaring activity above 100mev from the flat spectrum radio quasar 3c 454.3 detected by agile during themonth of december 2009. 3c 454.3, that has been among the most active blazarsof the fsrq type since 2007, was detected in the gamma-ray range with aprogressively rising flux since november 10, 2009. the gamma-ray flux reached avalue comparable with that of the vela pulsar on december 2, 2009. remarkably,between december 2 and 3, 2009 the source more than doubled its gamma-rayemission and became the brightest gamma-ray source in the sky with a peak fluxof f_{\gamma,p} = (2000 \pm 400) x 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 for a 1-day integrationabove 100 mev. the gamma-ray intensity decreased in the following days with thesource flux remaining at large values near f \simeq (1000 \pm 200) x 10^-8 phcm^-2 s^-1 for more than a week. this exceptional gamma-ray flare dissipatedamong the largest ever detected intrinsic radiated power in gamma-rays above100 mev (l_{\gamma, source, peak} \simeq 3 x 10^46 erg s^-1, for a relativisticdoppler factor of {\delta} \simeq 30). the total isotropic irradiated energy ofthe month-long episode in the range 100 mev - 3 gev is e_{\gamma,iso} \simeq10^56 erg. we report the intensity and spectral evolution of the gamma-rayemission across the flaring episode. we briefly discuss the importanttheoretical implications of our detection.

1009.0021	agile observations of the "soft" gamma-ray pulsar psr b1509-58	we present the results of new agile observations of psr b1509-58 performedover a period of 2.5 years following the detection obtained with a subset ofthe present data. the modulation significance of the lightcurve above 30 mev isat a 5$\sigma$ confidence level and the lightcurve is similar to those foundearlier by comptel up to 30 mev: a broad asymmetric first peak reaching itsmaximum 0.39 +/- 0.02 cycles after the radio peak plus a second peak at 0.94+/- 0.03. the gamma-ray spectral energy distribution of the pulsed fluxdetected by comptel and agile is well described by a power-law (photon indexalpha=1.87+/-0.09) with a remarkable cutoff at e_c=81 +/- 20 mev, representingthe softest spectrum observed among gamma-ray pulsars so far. the pulsarluminosity at e &gt; 1 mev is $l_{\gamma}=4.2^{+0.5}_{-0.2} \times10^{35}$ erg/s,assuming a distance of 5.2 kpc, which implies a spin-down conversion efficiencyto gamma-rays of $\sim 0.03$. the unusual soft break in the spectrum of psrb1509-58 has been interpreted in the framework of polar cap models as asignature of the exotic photon splitting process in the strong magnetic fieldof this pulsar. in this interpretation our spectrum constrains the magneticaltitude of the emission point(s) at 3 km above the neutron star surface,implying that the attenuation may not be as strong as formerly suggestedbecause pair production can substitute photon splitting in regions of themagnetosphere where the magnetic field becomes too low to sustain photonsplitting. in the case of an outer-gap scenario, or the two pole caustic model,better constraints on the geometry of the emission would be needed from theradio band in order to establish whether the conditions required by the modelsto reproduce agile lightcurves and spectra match the polarization measurements.

1009.1146	two years of monitoring supergiant fast x-ray transients with swift	we present two years of intense swift monitoring of three sfxts, igrj16479-4514, xte j1739-302, and igr j17544-2619 (since october 2007).out-of-outburst intensity-based x-ray (0.3-10kev) spectroscopy yields absorbedpower laws with by hard photon indices (g~1-2). their outburst broad-band(0.3-150 kev) spectra can be fit well with models typically used to describethe x-ray emission from accreting nss in hmxbs. we assess how long each sourcespends in each state using a systematic monitoring with a sensitive instrument.these sources spend 3-5% of the total in bright outbursts. the most probableflux is 1-2e-11 erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} (2-10 kev, unabsorbed), corresponding toluminosities in the order of a few 10^{33} to 10^{34} erg s^{-1} (two orders ofmagnitude lower than the bright outbursts). the duty-cycle of inactivity is 19,39, 55%, for igr j16479-4514, xte j1739-302, and igr j17544-2619, respectively.we present a complete list of bat on-board detections further confirming thecontinued activity of these sources. this demonstrates that true quiescence isa rare state, and that these transients accrete matter throughout their life atdifferent rates. x-ray variability is observed at all timescales andintensities we can probe. superimposed on the day-to-day variability isintra-day flaring which involves variations up to one order of magnitude thatcan occur down to timescales as short as ~1ks, and whichcan be explained by theaccretion of single clumps composing the donor wind with massesm_cl~0.3-2x10^{19} g.

1009.2604	another look at the bl lacertae flux and spectral variability	the glast-agile support program (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope(webt) monitored bl lacertae in 2008-2009 at radio, near-ir, and opticalfrequencies. during this period, high-energy observations were performed byxmm-newton, swift, and fermi. we analyse these data with particular attentionto the calibration of swift uv data, and apply a helical jet model to interpretthe source broad-band variability. the gasp-webt observations show an opticalflare in 2008 february-march, and oscillations of several tenths of mag on afew-day time scale afterwards. the radio flux is only mildly variable. the uvdata from both xmm-newton and swift seem to confirm a uv excess that is likelycaused by thermal emission from the accretion disc. the x-ray data fromxmm-newton indicate a strongly concave spectrum, as well as moderate fluxvariability on an hour time scale. the swift x-ray data reveal fast (interday)flux changes, not correlated with those observed at lower energies. we comparethe spectral energy distribution (sed) corresponding to the 2008 low-brightnessstate, which was characterised by a synchrotron dominance, to the 1997 outburststate, where the inverse-compton emission was prevailing. a fit with aninhomogeneous helical jet model suggests that two synchrotron components are atwork with their self inverse-compton emission. most likely, they represent theradiation from two distinct emitting regions in the jet. we show that thedifference between the source seds in 2008 and 1997 can be explained in termsof pure geometrical variations. the outburst state occurred when thejet-emitting regions were better aligned with the line of sight, producing anincrease of the doppler beaming factor. our analysis demonstrates that the jetgeometry can play an extremely important role in the bl lacertae flux andspectral variability.

1009.5539	study of the gamma-ray source 1agl j2022+4032 in the cygnus region	identification of gamma-ray-emitting galactic sources is a long-standingproblem in astrophysics. one such source, 1agl j2022+4032, coincident with theinterior of the radio shell of the supernova remnant gamma cygni (snrg78.2+2.1) in the cygnus region, has recently been identified by fermi as agamma-ray pulsar, lat psr j2021+4026. we present long-term observations of 1aglj2022+4032 with the agile gamma-ray telescope, measuring its flux and lightcurve. we compare the light curve of 1agl j2022+4032 with that of 1aglj2021+3652 (psr j2021+3651), showing that the flux variability of 1aglj2022+4032 appears to be greater than the level predicted from statistical andsystematic effects and producing detailed simulations to estimate theprobability of the apparent observed variability. we evaluate the possibilitythat the gamma-ray emission may be due to the superposition of two or morepoint sources, some of which may be variable, considering a number of possiblecounterparts. we consider the possibility of a nearby x-ray quiet microquasarcontributing to the flux of 1agl j2022+4032 to be more likely than thehypotheses of a background blazar or intrinsic gamma-ray variabilty of lat psrj2021+4026.

1102.4546	the swift-bat survey reveals the orbital period of three high-mass x-ray  binaries	a growing number of previously hidden galactic x-ray sources are now detectedwith recent surveys performed by the integral and swift satellites. most ofthese new sources eluded past surveys due to their large local x-ray extinctionand consequent low soft x-ray flux. the swift-bat performs daily monitoring ofthe sky in an energy band (15-150 kev) which is only marginally affected byx-ray extinction, thus allowing for the search of long periodicities in thelight curve and identification of the nature of the x-ray sources. we performeda period search using the folding technique in the swift-bat light curves ofthree integral sources: igr j05007-7047, igr j13186-6257 and igr j17354-3255.their periodograms show significant peaks at 30.77$\pm$0.01 d, 19.994$\pm$0.01d and 8.448$\pm$0.002 d, respectively. we estimate the significance of thesefeatures from the chi squared distribution of all the trials, finding aprobability less than 1.5$\times10^{-4}$ that the detections occurred due tochance. we complement our analysis with the study of their broadband x-rayemission. we identify the periodicities with the orbital periods of thesources. the periods are typical for the wind accretors x-ray binaries and wesupport this identification showing that also their energy spectra arecompatible with an x-ray spectral emission characteristic of high-mass x-raybinaries. the spectrum of igr j05007-704 that resides in the large magellaniccloud, does not show any intrinsic local absorption, whereas the spectra of thegalactic sources igr j17354-3255 and igr j13186-6257 may be affected by a localabsorber. the folded light curve for igr j13186-6257 suggests a possible becompanion star.

1103.3647	agile detection of extreme gamma-ray activity from the blazar pks  1510-089 during march 2009. multifrequency analysis	we report on the extreme gamma-ray activity from the fsrq pks 1510-089observed by agile in march 2009. in the same period a radio-to-opticalmonitoring of the source was provided by the gasp-webt and rem. moreover,several swift too observations were triggered, adding important information onthe source behaviour from optical/uv to hard x-rays. we paid particularattention to the calibration of the swift/uvot data to make it suitable to theblazars spectra. simultaneous observations from radio to gamma rays allowed usto study in detail the correlation among the emission variability at differentfrequencies and to investigate the mechanisms at work. in the period 9-30 march2009, agile detected an average gamma-ray flux of (311+/-21)x10^-8 ph cm^-2s^-1 for e&gt;100 mev, and a peak level of (702+/-131)x10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 ondaily integration. the gamma-ray activity occurred during a period ofincreasing activity from near-ir to uv, with a flaring episode detected on26-27 march 2009, suggesting that a single mechanism is responsible for theflux enhancement observed from near-ir to uv. by contrast, swift/xrtobservations seem to show no clear correlation of the x-ray fluxes with theoptical and gamma-ray ones. however, the x-ray observations show a harderphoton index (1.3-1.6) with respect to most fsrqs and a hint ofharder-when-brighter behaviour, indicating the possible presence of a secondemission component at soft x-ray energies. moreover, the broad band spectrumfrom radio-to-uv confirmed the evidence of thermal features in the optical/uvspectrum of pks 1510-089 also during high gamma-ray state. on the other hand,during 25-26 march 2009 a flat spectrum in the optical/uv energy band wasobserved, suggesting an important contribution of the synchrotron emission inthis part of the spectrum during the brightest gamma-ray flare, therefore asignificant shift of the synchrotron peak.

1205.7059	swift observations of two supergiant fast x-ray transient prototypes in  outburst	we report on the results from observations of the most recent outbursts ofxte j1739-302 and igr j17544-2619, which are considered to be the prototypes ofthe supergiant fast x-ray transient (sfxt) class. they triggered the swift/baton 2011 february 22 and march 24, respectively, and each time a prompt swiftslew allowed us to obtain the rich broad-band data we present. the xrt lightcurves show the descending portion of very bright flares that reachedluminosities of ~2x10^{36} and ~5x10^{36} erg/s, respectively. the broad-bandspectra, when fit with the usual phenomenological models adopted for accretingneutron stars, yield values of both high energy cut-off and e-folding energyconsistent with those obtained from previously reported outbursts from thesesources. in the context of more physical models, the spectra of both sourcescan be well fitted either with a two-blackbody model, or with a singleunsaturated comptonization model. in the latter case, the model can be either aclassical static comptonization model, such as comptt, or the recentlydeveloped compmag model, which includes thermal and bulk comptonization forcylindrical accretion onto a magnetized neutron star. we discuss the possibleaccretion scenarios derived by the different models, and we also emphasize thefact that the electron density derived from the comptonization models, in theregions where the x-ray spectrum presumably forms, is lower than that estimatedusing the continuity equation at the magnetospheric radius and the source x-rayluminosity, and we give some possible explanations.

1206.4454	the characterization of the distant blazar gb6 j1239+0443 from flaring  and low activity periods	in 2008 agile and fermi detected gamma-ray flaring activity from theunidentified egret source 3eg j1236+0457, recently associated with a flatspectrum radio quasar gb6 j1239+0443 at z=1.762. the optical counterpart of thegamma-ray source underwent a flux enhancement of a factor 15-30 in 6 years, andof ~10 in six months. we interpret this flare-up in terms of a transition froman accretion-disk dominated emission to a synchrotron-jet dominated one. weanalysed a sloan digital sky survey (sdss) archival optical spectrum takenduring a period of low radio and optical activity of the source. we estimatedthe mass of the central black hole using the width of the civ emission line. inour work, we have also investigated sdss archival optical photometric data anduv galex observations to estimate the thermal-disk emission contribution of gb6j1239+0443. our analysis of the gamma-ray data taken during the flaringepisodes indicates a flat gamma-ray spectrum, with an extension of up to 15gev, with no statistically-relevant sign of absorption from the broad lineregion, suggesting that the blazar-zone is located beyond the broad lineregion. this result is confirmed by the modeling of the broad-band spectralenergy distribution (well constrained by the available multiwavelength data) ofthe flaring activity periods and by the accretion disk luminosity and blackhole mass estimated by us using archival data.

1207.6288	the agile monitoring of cygnus x-3: transient gamma-ray emission and  spectral constraints	we present the agile-grid monitoring of cygnus x-3, during the period betweennovember 2007 and july 2009. we report here the whole agile-grid monitoring ofcygnus x-3 in the agile "pointing" mode data-taking, to confirm that thegamma-ray activity coincides with the same repetitive pattern ofmultiwavelength emission and to analyze in depth the overall gamma-ray spectrumby assuming both leptonic and hadronic scenarios. seven intense gamma-rayevents were detected in this period, with a typical event lasting one or twodays. these durations are longer than the likely cooling times of the gamma-rayemitting particles, implying we see continuous acceleration rather than theresult of an impulsive event such as the ejection of a single plasmoid whichthen cools as it propagates outwards. cross-correlating the agile-grid lightcurve with x-ray and radio monitoring data, we find that the main events ofgamma-ray activity have been detected while the system was in soft spectralx-ray states (rxte/asm count rate &gt; 3 counts/s), that coincide with local andoften sharp minima of the hard x-ray flux (swift/bat count rate &lt; 0.02counts/cm^2/s), a few days before intense radio outbursts. [...] thesegamma-ray events may thus reflect a sharp transition in the structure of theaccretion disk and its corona, which leads to a rebirth of the microquasar jetand subsequent enhanced radio activity. [...] finally, we examine leptonic andhadronic emission models for the gamma-ray events and find that both scenariosare valid. in the leptonic model - based on inverse compton scatterings ofmildly relativistic electrons on soft photons from the wolf-rayet companionstar and from the accretion disk - the emitting particles may also contributeto the overall hard x-ray spectrum, possibly explaining the hard non-thermalpower-law tail sometimes seen during special soft x-ray states in cygnus x-3.

1302.4342	variable gamma-ray emission from the crab nebula: short flares and long  "waves"	gamma-ray emission from the crab nebula has been recently shown to beunsteady. in this paper, we study the flux and spectral variability of the crababove 100 mev on different timescales ranging from days to weeks. in additionto the four main intense and day-long flares detected by agile and fermi-latbetween sept. 2007 and sept. 2012, we find evidence for week-long and lessintense episodes of enhanced gamma-ray emission that we call "waves".statistically significant "waves" show timescales of 1-2 weeks, and can occurby themselves or in association with shorter flares. we present a refined fluxand spectral analysis of the sept. - oct. 2007 gamma-ray enhancement episodedetected by agile that shows both "wave" and flaring behavior. we extend ouranalysis to the publicly available fermi-lat dataset and show that severaladditional "wave" episodes can be identified. we discuss the spectralproperties of the september 2007 "wave"/flare event and show that the physicalproperties of the "waves" are intermediate between steady and flaring states.plasma instabilities inducing "waves" appear to involve spatial distances l\sim 10^{16} cm and enhanced magnetic fields b \sim (0.5 - 1) mg. day-longflares are characterized by smaller distances and larger local magnetic fields.typically, the deduced total energy associated with the "wave" phenomenon (e_w\sim 10^{42} erg, where e_w is the kinetic energy of the emitting particles) iscomparable with that associated to the flares, and can reach a few percent ofthe total available pulsar spindown energy. most likely, flares and waves arethe product of the same class of plasma instabilities that we show acting ondifferent timescales and radiation intensities.

1302.5439	long-term monitoring of pks 0537-441 with fermi-lat and multiwavelength  observations	we report on multiwavelength observations of the blazar pks 0537-441 (z =0.896) obtained from microwaves through gamma rays by sma, rem, atom, swift andfermi during 2008 august-2010 april. strong variability has been observed ingamma rays, with two major flaring episodes (2009 july and 2010 march) and aharder-when-brighter behaviour, quite common for fsrqs andlow-synchrotron-peaked bl lacs, in 2010 march. in the same way the sed of thesource cannot be modelled by a simple synchrotron self-compton model, asopposed to many bl lacs, but the addition of an external compton component ofseed photons from a dust torus is needed. the 230 ghz light curve showed anincrease simultaneous with the gamma-ray one, indicating co-spatiality of themm and gamma-ray emission region likely at large distance from the centralengine. the low, average, and high activity sed of the source could be fitchanging only the electron distribution parameters, but two breaks in theelectron distribution are necessary. the ensuing extra spectral break, locatedat nir-optical frequencies, together with that in gamma rays seem to indicate acommon origin, most likely due to an intrinsic feature in the underlyingelectron distribution. an overall correlation between the gamma-ray band withthe r-band and k-band has been observed with no significant time lag. on theother hand, when inspecting the light curves on short time scales somedifferences are evident. in particular, flaring activity has been detected innir and optical bands with no evident gamma-ray counterparts in 2009 septemberand november. moderate variability has been observed in x-rays with nocorrelation between flux and photon index. an increase of the detected x-rayflux with no counter part at the other wavelengths has been observed in 2008october, suggesting once more a complex correlation between the emission atdifferent energy bands.

1307.0558	an active state of the bl lac object markarian 421 detected by integral  in april 2013	multiwavelength variability of blazars offers indirect insight into theirpowerful engines and on the mechanisms through which energy is propagated fromthe centre down the jet. the bl lac object mkn 421 is a tev emitter, a brightblazar at all wavelengths, and therefore an excellent target for variabilitystudies. mkn 421 was observed by integral and fermi-lat in an active state on16-21 april 2013. well sampled optical, soft, and hard x-ray light curves showthe presence of two flares. the average flux in the 20-100 kev range is 9.1e-11erg/s/cm2 (~4.5 mcrab) and the nuclear average apparent magnitude, correctedfor galactic extinction, is v ~12.2. in the time-resolved x-ray spectra (3.5-60kev), which are described by broken power laws and, marginally better, bylog-parabolic laws, we see a hardening that correlates with flux increase, asexpected in refreshed energy injections in a population of electrons that latercool via synchrotron radiation. the hardness ratios between the jem-x fluxes intwo different bands and between the jem-x and ibis/isgri fluxes confirm thistrend. during the observation, the variability level increases monotonicallyfrom the optical to the hard x-rays, while the large lat errors do not allow asignificant assessment of the mev-gev variability. the cross-correlationanalysis during the onset of the most prominent flare suggests a monotonicallyincreasing delay of the lower frequency emission with respect to that at higherfrequency, with a maximum time-lag of about 70 minutes, that is however notwell constrained. the spectral energy distributions from the optical to the tevdomain are satisfactorily described by homogeneous models of blazar emissionbased on synchrotron radiation and synchrotron self-compton scattering, exceptin the state corresponding to the lat softest spectrum and highest flux.

1401.2151	two active states of the narrow-line gamma-ray-loud agn gb 1310+487	previously unremarkable, the extragalactic radio source gb 1310+487 showed agamma-ray flare on 2009 november 18, reaching a daily flux of ~10^-6photons/cm^2/s at energies e&gt;100 mev and becoming one of the brightest gevsources for about two weeks. its optical spectrum is not typical for a blazar,instead, it resembles those of narrow emission-line galaxies. we investigatechanges of the object's radio-to-gev spectral energy distribution (sed) duringand after the prominent gev flare with the aim to determine the nature of theobject and constrain the origin of the variable high-energy emission. the datacollected by the fermi and agile satellites at gamma-ray energies, swift atx-ray and ultraviolet, kanata, not, and keck telescopes at optical, oagh andwise at infrared, and iram 30m, ovro 40m, effelsberg 100m, ratan-600, and vlbaat radio, are analysed together to trace the sed evolution on timescales ofmonths. the gamma-ray/radio-loud narrow-line active galactic nucleus (agn) islocated at redshift z=0.638. it is shining through an unrelated foregroundgalaxy at z=0.500. the agn light is likely amplified by a factor of a fewbecause of gravitational lensing. the agn sed shows a two-humped structuretypical of blazars and gamma-ray-loud nlsy1 galaxies, with the high-energy(inverse-compton) emission dominating by more than an order of magnitude overthe low-energy (synchrotron) emission during gamma-ray flares. the differencebetween the two sed humps is smaller during the low-activity state. fermiobservations reveal a strong correlation between the gamma-ray flux andspectral index, with the hardest spectrum observed during the brightestgamma-ray state. if the gamma-ray flux is a mixture of synchrotron self-compton(ssc) and external compton (ec) emission, the observed gev spectral variabilitymay result from varying relative contributions of these two emissioncomponents.

1401.3573	the agile alert system for gamma-ray transients	in recent years, a new generation of space missions offered greatopportunities of discovery in high-energy astrophysics. in this article wefocus on the scientific operations of the gamma-ray imaging detector (grid)onboard the agile space mission. the agile-grid, sensitive in the energy rangeof 30 mev-30 gev, has detected many gamma-ray transients of galactic andextragalactic origins. this work presents the agile innovative approach to fastgamma-ray transient detection, which is a challenging task and a crucial partof the agile scientific program. the goals are to describe: (1) the agilegamma-ray alert system, (2) a new algorithm for blind search identification oftransients within a short processing time, (3) the agile procedure forgamma-ray transient alert management, and (4) the likelihood of ratio teststhat are necessary to evaluate the post-trial statistical significance of theresults. special algorithms and an optimized sequence of tasks are necessary toreach our goal. data are automatically analyzed at every orbital downlink by analert pipeline operating on different timescales. as proper flux thresholds areexceeded, alerts are automatically generated and sent as sms messages tocellular telephones, e-mails, and push notifications of an application forsmartphones and tablets. these alerts are crosschecked with the results of twopipelines, and a manual analysis is performed. being a small scientific-classmission, agile is characterized by optimization of both scientific analysis andground-segment resources. the system is capable of generating alerts within twoto three hours of a data downlink, an unprecedented reaction time in gamma-rayastrophysics.

1401.5646	magic gamma-ray and multifrequency observations of flat spectrum radio  quasar pks 1510-089 in early 2012	among more than fifty blazars detected in very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev)gamma-rays, only three belong to the subclass of flat spectrum radio quasars(fsrqs). magic observed fsrq pks 1510-089 in february-april 2012 during a highactivity state in the high energy (he, e&gt;100 mev) gamma-ray band observed byagile and fermi. magic observations result in the detection of a source withsignificance of 6.0 sigma. in agreement with the previous vhe observations ofthe source, we find no statistically significant variability during the magicobservations in daily, weekly or monthly time scales. the other two known vhefsrqs have shown daily scale to sub-hour variability.  we study the multifrequency behaviour of the source at the epoch of magicobservation, collecting quasi-simultaneous data at radio and optical (gasp-webtand f-gamma collaborations, rem, steward, perkins, liverpool, ovro and vlbatelescopes), x-ray (swift satellite) and he gamma-ray frequencies. thegamma-ray sed combining agile, fermi and magic data joins smoothly and shows nohint of a break. the multifrequency light curves suggest a common origin forthe millimeter radio and he gamma-ray emission and the he gamma-ray flaringstarts when the new component is ejected from the 43ghz vlba core. thequasi-simultaneous multifrequency sed is modelled with a one-zone inversecompton model. we study two different origins of the seed photons for theinverse compton scattering, namely the infra-red torus and a slow sheathsurrounding the jet around the vlba core. both models fit the data well.however, the fast he gamma-ray variability requires that within the modelledlarge emitting region, there must exist more compact regions. we suggest thatthese observed signatures would be most naturally explained by a turbulentplasma flowing at a relativistic speed down the jet and crossing a standingconical shock.

1406.6068	soft x-ray characterisation of the long term properties of supergiant  fast x-ray transients	we perform the first high-sensitivity soft x-ray long-term monitoring withswift/xrt of three relatively unexplored supergiant fast x-ray transients(sfxts), igr j08408-4503, igr j16328-4726, and igr j16465-4507, whose hardx-ray duty cycles are the lowest measured among the sfxt sample, and comparetheir properties with those of the prototypical sfxts. the behaviour of j08408and j16328 resembles that of other sfxts, and it is characterized by arelatively high inactivity duty cycle (idc) and pronounced dynamic range (dr)in the x-ray luminosity. like the sfxt prototypes, j08408 shows two distinctpopulations of flares, the first one associated with the brightest outbursts($l_{\rm x}\gtrsim 10^{35-36}$ erg s$^{-1}$), the second one comprising lessbright events with $l_{\rm x}\lesssim$10$^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$. thisdouble-peaked distribution seems to be a ubiquitous feature of the extremesfxts. the lower dr of j16328 suggests it is an intermediate sfxt. we findj16465 is characterized by idc$\sim$5% and dr$\sim$40, reminiscent of classicalsupergiant hmxbs. the duty cycles measured with xrt are found to be comparablewith those reported previously by bat and integral, when the higher limitingsensitivities of these instruments are taken into account and sufficiently longobservational campaigns are available. we prove that no clear correlationexists between the duty cycles of the sfxts and their orbital periods, whichmakes it difficult to interpret the sfxt peculiar variability by only usingarguments related to the properties of supergiant star winds. our findingsfavour the idea that a correct interpretation of the sfxt phenomenologyrequires a mechanism to strongly reduce the mass accretion rate onto thecompact object during most of its orbit around the companion, as proposed in anumber of theoretical works.

1408.1516	the blob crashes into the mirror: modelling the exceptional gamma-ray  flaring activity of 3c 454.3 in november 2010	we focus on the exceptional flaring activity of 3c 454.3 in november 2010 andwe discuss a theoretical framework addressing all data in their overallevolution.  for two weeks the source has shown a plateau of enhanced gev emissionpreceding a sudden major flare lasting about 3 days before decaying. thegamma-ray flare onset is abrupt (about 6 hours), and is characterized by aprominent "compton dominance" with the gev flux exceeding the pre-flare valuesby a factor of 4-5, whereas the optical and x-ray fluxes increased only by afactor 2.  we explore two alternatives. case 1, with high-energy emission originatingwithin the blr; and case 2, with most of it produced outside. we show that case1 has considerable problems in explaining the whole set of multifrequency data.case 2, instead, leads to a consistent and interesting interpretation based onthe enhanced inverse compton radiation that is produced as the jet crashes ontoa mirror cloud positioned at few parsec from the bh. this model explains thegamma-ray vs. optical/x-ray behavior of 3c 454.3, including the otherwisepuzzling phenomena such as the prominent "orphan" optical flare, and theenhanced line emission with no appreciable gamma-ray counterpart that precededthe gev flare. it also accounts for the delayed onset of the latter on top ofthe long plateau. our modelling of the exceptional 3c 454.3 gamma-ray flareshows that, while emission inside the canonical blr is problematic, major andrapid variations can be produced at parsec scales with moderate bulk lorentzfactors $\gamma\approx 15$.

1409.3716	properties of flat-spectrum radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies	we have conducted a multiwavelength survey of 42 radio loud narrow-1ineseyfert 1 galaxies (rlnls1s), selected by searching among all the known sourcesof this type and omitting those with steep radio spectra. we analyse data fromradio frequencies to x-rays, and supplement these with information availablefrom online catalogs and the literature in order to cover the fullelectromagnetic spectrum. this is the largest known multiwavelength survey forthis type of source. we detected 90% of the sources in x-rays and found 17% atgamma rays. extreme variability at high energies was also found, down totimescales as short as hours. in some sources, dramatic spectral and fluxchanges suggest interplay between a relativistic jet and the accretion disk.the estimated masses of the central black holes are in the range $\sim10^{6-8}m_{\odot}$, smaller than those of blazars, while the accretionluminosities span a range from $\sim 0.01$ to $\sim 0.49$ times the eddingtonlimit, with an outlier at $0.003$. the distribution of the calculated jet powerspans a range from $\sim 10^{42.6}$ to $\sim 10^{45.6}$ erg s$^{-1}$, generallylower than quasars and bl lac objects, but partially overlapping with thelatter. once normalised by the mass of the central black holes, the jet powerof the three types of active galactic nuclei are consistent with each other,indicating the scalability of the jet. despite the observational differences,the central engine of rlnls1s is apparently quite similar to that of blazars.the historical difficulties in finding radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1galaxies might be due to their low power and to intermittent jet activity.

1410.7399	constraining duty cycles through a bayesian technique	the duty cycle (dc) of astrophysical sources is generally defined as thefraction of time during which the sources are active. however, dcs aregenerally not provided with statistical uncertainties, since the standardapproach is to perform monte carlo bootstrap simulations to evaluate them,which can be quite time consuming for a large sample of sources. as analternative, considerably less time-consuming approach, we derived thetheoretical expectation value for the dc and its error for sources whose stateis one of two possible, mutually exclusive states, inactive (off) or flaring(on), as based on a finite set of independent observational data points.following a bayesian approach, we derived the analytical expression for theposterior, the conjugated distribution adopted as prior, and the expectationvalue and variance. we applied our method to the specific case of theinactivity duty cycle (idc) for supergiant fast x-ray transients. we alsostudied idc as a function of the number of observations in the sample. finally,we compare the results with the theoretical expectations. we found excellentagreement with our findings based on the standard bootstrap method. ourbayesian treatment can be applied to all sets of independent observations oftwo-state sources, such as active galactic nuclei, x-ray binaries, etc. inaddition to being far less time consuming than bootstrap methods, theadditional strength of this approach becomes obvious when considering awell-populated class of sources ($n_{\rm src} \geq 50$) for which the prior canbe fully characterized by fitting the distribution of the observed dcs for allsources in the class, so that, through the prior, one can further constrain thedc of a new source by exploiting the information acquired on the dcdistribution derived from the other sources.

0805.1808	monitoring supergiant fast x-ray transients with swift. i. behavior  outside outbursts	supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxts) are a new class of hmxbs discoveredthanks to the monitoring of the galactic plane performed with the integralsatellite in the last 5 years. these sources display short outbursts(significantly shorter than typical be/x-ray binaries) with a peak luminosityof a few 1e36 erg/s. the quiescent level, measured only in a few sources, isaround 1e32 erg/s. we are performing a monitoring campaign with swift of foursfxts (igrj16479-4514, xtej1739-302, igrj17544-2619 andaxj1841.0-0536/igrj18410-0535). we report on the first four months of swiftobservations, started on 2007 october 26. we detect a low level x-ray activityin all four sfxts which demonstrates that these transient sources accretematter even outside their outbursts. this fainter x-ray activity is composed ofmany flares with a large flux variability, on timescales of thousands ofseconds. the lightcurve variability is also evident on larger timescales ofdays, weeks and months, with a dynamic range of more than one order ofmagnitude in all four sfxts. the x-ray spectra are typically hard, with anaverage 2-10 kev luminosity during this monitoring of about 1e33-1e34 erg/s. wedetected pulsations from the pulsar axj1841.0-0536, with a period of4.7008+/-0.0004 s. this monitoring demonstrates that these transients spendmost of the time accreting matter, although at a much lower level (~100-1000times lower than during the bright outbusts), and that the true quiescence,characterized by a soft spectrum and a luminosity of a few 1e32 erg/s, observedin the past only in a couple of members of this class, is probably a very rarestate.

0806.1855	agile and swift simultaneous observations of the blazar s50716+714  during the bright flare of october 2007	we present the results of a series of optical, uv, x-ray and gamma-rayobservations of the bl lac object s50716+714 carried out by the swift and agilesatellites in late 2007 when this blazar was flaring close to its historicalmaximum at optical frequencies. we have found that the optical through softx-ray emission, likely due to synchrotron radiation, was highly variable anddisplayed a different behavior in the optical uv and soft x-ray bands. the 4-10kev flux, most probably dominated by the inverse compton component, remainedinstead constant. the counting statistics in the relatively short agile gridobservation was low and consistent with a constant gamma-ray flux at a levelsimilar to the maximum observed by egret. an estimate of the gamma-ray spectralslope gives a value of the photon index that is close to 2 suggesting that thepeak of the inverse compton component in the spectral energy distribution (sed)is within the agile energy band. the different variability behavior observed indifferent parts of the sed exclude interpretations predicting highly correlatedflux variability like changes of the beaming factor or of the magnetic field insimple ssc scenarios. the observed sed changes may instead be interpreted asdue to the sum of two ssc components, one of which is constant while the otheris variable and with a systematically higher synchrotron peak energy.

astro-ph;0010490	xmm-newton observation of an unusual iron line in the quasar markarian  205	xmm-newton observations of the low luminosity, radio-quiet quasar markarian205 have revealed a unique iron k emission line profile. in marked contrast tothe broad and redshifted iron k line commonly seen in asca observations ofseyfert 1 galaxies, we find that a substantial amount of the line flux in mrk205 occurs above the neutral line energy of 6.4 kev. furthermore, we find thatthe iron line emission has two distinct components, a narrow, unresolvedneutral line at 6.4 kev and a broadened line centred at 6.7 kev. we suggestthat the most likely origin of the 6.7 kev line is from x-ray reflection offthe surface of a highly ionised accretion disk, whilst the 6.4 kev componentmay arise from neutral matter distant from the black hole, quite possibly inthe putative molecular torus. overall this observation underlines the potentialof xmm-newton for using the iron k line as a diagnostic of matter in theinnermost regions of agn.

0809.1737	multiwavelength observations of 3c 454.3. i. the agile 2007 november  campaign on the "crazy diamond"	[abridged] we report on a multiwavelength observation of the blazar 3c 454.3(which we dubbed "crazy diamond") carried out on november 2007 by means of theastrophysical satellites agile, integral, swift, the webt consortium, and theoptical-nir telescope rem. 3c 454.3 is detected at a $\sim 19-\sigma$ levelduring the 3-week observing period, with an average flux above 100 mev of$f_{\rm e&gt;100mev} = (170 \pm 13) \times 10^{-8}$ \phcmsec. the gamma-rayspectrum can be fit with a single power-law with photon index $\gamma_{\rmgrid} = 1.73 \pm 0.16$ between 100 mev and 1 gev. we detect significantday-by-day variability of the gamma-ray emission during our observations, andwe can exclude that the fluxes are constant at the 99.6% ($\sim 2.9 \sigma$)level. the source was detected typically around 40 degrees off-axis, and it wassubstantially off--axis in the field of view of the agile hard x-ray imager.however, a 5-day long too observation by integral detected 3c 454.3 at anaverage flux of about $f_{\rm 20-200 kev} = 1.49 \times 10^{-3}$ \phcmsec withan average photon index of $\gamma_{\rm ibis} = 1.75 \pm 0.24$ between 20--200kev. swift also detected 3c 454.3 with a flux in the 0.3--10 kev energy band inthe range $(1.23-1.40) \times 10^{-2}$ \phcmsec{} and a photon index in therange $\gamma_{\rm xrt} = 1.56-1.73$. in the optical band, both webt and remshow an extremely variable behavior in the $r$ band. a correlation analysisbased on the entire data set is consistent with no time-lags between thegamma-ray and the optical flux variations. our simultaneous multifrequencyobservations strongly indicate that the dominant emission mechanism between 30mev and 30 gev is dominated by inverse compton scattering of relativisticelectrons in the jet on the external photons from the broad line region.

astro-ph;9801129	supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies: relationship with radio  emission and constraints on the black hole mass function	using recently published estimates - based on high spatial resolutionspectroscopy - of the mass m_{bh} of nuclear black holes for a sample of nearbygalaxies, we explore the dependence of galaxy nucleus emissivity at variouswavelengths on m_{bh}. we confirm an almost linear scaling of the black holemass with the baryonic mass of the host spheroidal galaxy. a remarkably tightrelationship is also found with both nuclear and total radio centimetric flux,with a very steep dependence of the radio flux on m_{bh} (p\proptom_{bh}^{2.5}). the high-frequency radio power is thus a very good tracer of asuper-massive black hole, and a good estimator of its mass. this, together withthe lack of significant correlations with the low-energy x-ray and far-ir flux,supports the view that advection-dominated accretion is ruling the energyoutput in the low-accretion rate regime. using the tight dependence of totalradio power on m_{bh} and the rich statistics of radio emission of galaxies, wederive an estimate of the mass function of remnants in the nearby universe.this is compared with current models of quasar and agn activity and of theorigin of the hard x-ray background (hxrb). as for the former, continuouslong-lived agn activity is excluded by the present data with high significance,whereas the assumption of a short-lived, possibly recurrent, activity patterngives remarkable agreement. the presently estimated black hole mass functionalso implies that the hxrb has been produced by a numerous population (\sim10^{-2} mpc^{-3}) of moderately massive (m_{bh}\sim 10^7 m_\odot) black holes.

0809.3917	gamma-ray burst detection with the agile mini-calorimeter	the mini-calorimeter (mcal) instrument on-board the agile satellite is anon-imaging gamma-ray scintillation detector sensitive in the 300kev-100mevenergy range with a total on-axis geometrical area of 1400cm^2. gamma-raybursts (grbs) are one of the main scientific targets of the agile mission andthe mcal design as an independent self-triggering detector makes it a valuableall-sky monitor for grbs. furthermore mcal is one of the very few operativeinstruments with microsecond timing capabilities in the mev range. in thispaper the results of grb detections with mcal after one year of operation inspace are presented and discussed. a flexible trigger logic implemented in theagile payload data-handling unit allows the on-board detection of grbs. fortriggered events, energy and timing information are sent to telemetry on aphoton-by-photon basis, so that energy and time binning are limited by countingstatistics only. when the trigger logic is not active, grbs can be detectedoffline in ratemeter data, although with worse energy and time resolution.between the end of june 2007 and june 2008 mcal detected 51 grbs, with adetection rate of about 1 grb/week, plus several other events at a fewmilliseconds timescales. since february 2008 the on-board trigger logic hasbeen fully active. comparison of mcal detected events and data provided byother space instruments confirms the sensitivity and effective areaestimations. mcal also joined the 3rd inter-planetary network, to contribute togrb localization by means of triangulation.

0810.1180	multiple flaring activity in the supergiant fast x-ray transient igr  j08408-4503 observed with swift	igr j08408-4503 is a supergiant fast x-ray transient discovered in 2006 witha confirmed association with a o8.5ib(f) supergiant star, hd 74194. we reporton the analysis of two outbursts caught by swift/bat on 2006 october 4 and 2008july 5, and followed up at softer energies with swift/xrt. the 2008 xrt lightcurve shows a multiple-peaked structure with an initial bright flare thatreached a flux of ~1e-9 erg/cm2/s (2-10 kev), followed by two equally brightflares within 75 ks. the spectral characteristics of the flares differdramatically, with most of the difference, as derived via time-resolvedspectroscopy, being due to absorbing column variations. we observe a gradualdecrease of the nh, derived with a fit using absorbed power law model, as timepasses. we interpret these nh variations as due to an ionization effectproduced by the first flare, resulting in a significant decrease in themeasured column density towards the source. the durations of the flares, aswell as the times of the outbursts suggest that the orbital period is ~35 days,if the flaring activity is interpreted within the framework of the sidoli et al2007 model with the outbursts triggered by the neutron star passage inside anequatorial wind inclined with respect to the orbital plane.

0810.1516	high-resolution timing observations of spin-powered pulsars with the  agile gamma-ray telescope	agile is a small gamma-ray astronomy satellite mission of the italian spaceagency dedicated to high-energy astrophysics launched in 2007 april. its 1microsecond absolute time tagging capability coupled with a good sensitivity inthe 30 mev-30 gev range, with simultaneous x-ray monitoring in the 18-60 kevband, makes it perfectly suited for the study of gamma-ray pulsars following upon the cgro/egret heritage. in this paper we present the first agile timingresults on the known gamma-ray pulsars vela, crab, geminga and b 1706-44. thedata were collected from 2007 july to 2008 april, exploiting the missionscience verification phase, the instrument timing calibration and the earlyobserving pointing program. thanks to its large field of view, agile collecteda large number of gamma-ray photons from these pulsars (about 10,000 pulsedcounts for vela) in only few months of observations. the coupling of agiletiming capabilities, simultaneous radio/x-ray monitoring and new tools aimed atprecise photon phasing, exploiting also timing noise correction, unveiled newinteresting features at sub-millisecond level in the pulsars' high-energylight-curves.

0810.1676	agile detection of intense gamma-ray emission from the blazar pks  1510-089	we report the detection by the agile (astro-rivelatore gamma a immaginileggero) satellite of an intense gamma-ray flare from the source aglj1511-0909, associated with the powerful quasar pks 1510-089, during ten daysof observations from 23 august to 1 september 2007. during the observationperiod, the source was in optical decrease following a flaring event monitoredby the glast-agile support program (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope(webt). the simultaneous gamma-ray, optical, and radio coverage allows us tostudy the spectral energy distribution and the theoretical models based on thesynchrotron and inverse compton (ic) emission mechanisms. agile observed thesource with its two co-aligned imagers, the gamma-ray imaging detector and thehard x-ray imager super-agile sensitive in the 30 mev - 50 gev and 18 - 60 kevbands, respectively. between 23 and 27 august 2007, agile detected gamma-rayemission from pks 1510-089 when this source was located about 50 degreesoff-axis, with an average flux of (270 +/- 65) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}for photon energy above 100 mev. in the following period, 28 august - 1september, after a satellite re-pointing, agile detected the source at about 35degrees off-axis, with an average flux (e &gt; 100 mev) of (195 +/- 30) x 10^{-8}photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}. no emission was detected by super-agile, with a 3-sigmaupper limit of 45 mcrab in 200 ksec. the spectral energy distribution ismodelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self compton (ssc) emissionplus contributions by external photons: the ssc emission contributes primarilyto the x-ray band, whereas the contribution of the ic from the external discand the broad line region match the hard gamma-ray spectrum observed.

0810.5446	swift monitoring of supergiant fast x-ray transients: the  out-of-outburst behaviour and the flares from igrj17544-2916 and xtej1739-302	supergiant fast x-ray transients (sfxts) are a sub-class of high mass x-raybinaries (hmxbs) associated with ob supergiant companions and displayingtransient x-ray activity. this behaviour is quite surprising since hmxbshosting supergiants were known to be persistent sources, until the integraldiscoveries obtained by means of the monitoring of the galactic plane. we havebeen performing a monitoring campaign with swift of four sfxts with the mainaim of characterizing both the long-term behaviour of these transients and theproperties during bright outbursts. here we discuss the properties of the x-rayemission observed outside the outbursts as well as the flares observed from twosfxts: igrj17544-2916 and xtej1739-302. contrarily to what previously thought,swift allowed us to discover that sfxts spend most of the time in accretion ata low level, even outside the bright outbursts, with an accretion luminosity of1e33-1e34 erg/s, and that the quiescent level at ~1e32 erg/s is a much rarerstate.

0811.0593	high energy variability of 3c 273 during the agile multiwavelength  campaign of december 2007 - january 2008	we report the results of a 3-weeks multi-wavelength campaign on the flatspectrum radio quasar 3c 273 carried out with the agile gamma-ray mission,covering the 30 mev -50 gev and 18-60 kev, the rem observatory (covering thenear-ir and optical), swift (near-uv/optical, 0.2-10 kev and 15-50 kev),integral (3 - 200 kev) and rossi xte (2-12 kev). this is the firstobservational campaign including gamma-ray data, after the last egretobservations, more than 8 years ago. our study was carried out usingsimultaneous light curves of the source flux from all the involved instruments,in the different energy ranges, in search for correlated variability. then atime-resolved sed was used for a detailed physical modelling of the emissionmechanisms. the source was detected in gamma-rays only in the second week ofour campaign. we found indication of a possible anti-correlation between theemission at gamma-rays and at soft and hard x-rays, supported by the completeset of instruments. instead, optical data do not show short term variability.only in two egret observations (in 1993 and 1997) 3c 273 showedintra-observation variability in gamma-rays. the sed with almost simultaneousdata, partially covers the regions of the synchrotron emission, the big bluebump, and the inverse-compton. the soft x-ray emission is consistent withcombined ssc and ec mechanisms, while hard x and gamma-ray emissions arecompatible with ec from thermal photons of the disk. the time evolution of thesed is well interpreted and modelled in terms of an acceleration episode of theelectrons population, leading to a shift in the ic peak towards higherenergies.

0811.1680	magic upper limits to the vhe gamma-ray flux of 3c454.3 in high emission  state	we report upper limits to the very high energy flux (e&gt;100 gev) of the flatspectrum radio quasar 3c454.3 (z=0.859) derived by the cherenkov telescopemagic during the high states of july/august and november/december 2007. wecompare the upper limits derived in both time slots with the availablequasi-simultaneous mev-gev data from the agile gamma-ray satellite andinterpret the observational results in the context of leptonic emission models.the source was observed with the magic telescope during the active phases ofjuly-august 2007 and november-december 2007 and the data were analyzed with themagic standard analysis tools. for the periods around the ends of july andnovember, characterized by the most complete multifrequency coverage, weconstructed the spectral energy distributions using our data together withnearly simultaneous multifrequency (optical, uv, x-ray and gev) data. onlyupper limits can be derived from the magic data. the upper limits, oncecorrected for the expected absorption by the extragalactic background light,together with nearly simultaneous multifrequency data, allow us to constrainthe spectral energy distribution of 3c454.3. the data are consistent with themodel expectations based on the inverse compton scattering of the ambientphotons from the broad line region by relativistic electrons, which robustlypredicts a sharp cut-off above 20-30 gev.
