0904.2513	significant foreground unrelated non-acoustic anisotropy on the one  degree scale in wmap 5-year observations	the spectral variation of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) as observedby wmap was tested using foreground reduced wmap5 data, by producingsubtraction maps at the 1$^\circ$ angular resolution between the twocosmological bands of v and w, for masked sky areas that avoid the galacticdisk. the resulting $v-w$ map revealed a non-acoustic signal over and above thewmap5 pixel noise, with two main properties. firstly, it possesses quadrupolepower at the $\approx$ 1 $\mu k$ level which may be attributed to foregroundresiduals. second, it fluctuates also at all values of $\ell &gt;$ 2, especiallyon the $1^\circ$ scale ($200 \lesssim \ell \lesssim 300$). the behavior is {\itrandom and symmetrical} about zero temperature with a r.m.s. amplitude of$\approx$ 7 $\mu k$, or 10 % of the maximum cmb anisotropy, which would requirea `cosmic conspiracy' among the foreground components if it is a consequence oftheir existences. both anomalies must be properly diagnosed and corrected if`precision cosmology' is the claim. the second anomaly is, however, moreinteresting because it opens the question on whether the cmb anisotropygenuinely represents primordial density seeds.

0912.2636	calibrating the correlation between black hole mass and x-ray  variability amplitude: x-ray only black hole mass estimates for active  galactic nuclei and ultra-luminous x-ray sources	a calibration is made for the correlation between the x-ray variabilityamplitude (xva) and black hole (bh) mass. the correlation for 21reverberation-mapped active galactic nuclei (agn) appears very tight, with anintrinsic dispersion of 0.20 dex. the intrinsic dispersion of 0.27 dex can beobtained if bh masses are estimated from the stellar velocity dispersions. wefurther test the uncertainties of mass estimates from xvas for objects whichhave been observed multiple times with good enough data quality. the resultsshow that the xvas derived from multiple observations change by a factor of 3.this means that bh mass uncertainty from a single observation is slightly worsethan either reverberation-mapping or stellar velocity dispersion measurements;however bh mass estimates with x-ray data only can be more accurate if the meanxva value from more observations is used. applying this relation, the bh massof re j1034+396 is found to be $4^{+3}_{-2} \times 10^6$ $m_{\odot}$. the highend of the mass range follows the relationship between the 2$f_0$ frequenciesof high-frequency qpo and the bh masses derived from the galactic x-raybinaries. we also calculate the high-frequency constant $c= 2.37 m_\odot$hz$^{-1}$ from 21 reverberation-mapped agn. as suggested by gierli\'nski etal., $m_{\rm bh}=c/c_{\rm m}$, where $c_{\rm m}$ is the high-frequencyvariability derived from xva. given the similar shape of power-law dominatedx-ray spectra in ulxs and agn, this can be applied to bh mass estimates ofulxs. we discuss the observed qpo frequencies and bh mass estimates in theultra-luminous x-ray source m82 x-1 and ngc 5408 x-1 and favor ulxs asintermediate mass bh systems (abridged).

0912.5382	simulations on high-z long gamma-ray burst rate	since the launch of swift satellite, the detections of high-z (z&gt;4) longgamma-ray bursts (lgrbs) have been rapidly growing, even approaching the veryearly universe (the record holder currently is z=8.3). the observed high-z lgrbrate shows significant excess over that estimated from the star formationhistory. we investigate what may be responsible for this high productivity ofgrbs at high-z through monte carlo simulations, with effective swif/bat triggerand redshift detection probabilities based on current swift/bat sample andcgro/batse lgrb sample. we compare our simulations to the swift observationsvia log n-log p, peak luminosity (l) and redshift distributions. in the casethat lgrb rate is purely proportional to the star formation rate (sfr), oursimulations poorly reproduce the lgrb rate at z&gt;4, although the simulated logn-log p distribution is in good agreement with the observed one. assuming thatthe excess of high-z grb rate is due to the cosmic metallicity evolution orunknown lgrb rate increase parameterized as (1+z)^delta, we find that althoughthe two scenarios alone can improve the consistency between our simulations andobservations, incorporation of them gives much better consistency. we get0.2&lt;epsilon&lt;0.6 and delta&lt;0.6, where epsilon is the metallicity threshold forthe production of lgrbs. the best consistency is obtained with a parameter set(epsilon, delta)=(~0.4, ~0.4), and bat might trigger a few lgrbs at z~14. withincreasing detections of grbs at z&gt;4 (~15% of grbs in current swift lgrb samplebased on our simulations), a window for very early universe is opening by swiftand up-coming svom missions.

1003.0291	astrophysical black holes in the physical universe	in this chapter i focus on asking and answering the following questions: (1)what is a black hole? answer: there are three types of black holes, namelymathematical black holes, physical black holes and astrophysical black holes.an astrophysical black hole, with mass distributed within its event horizon butnot concentrated at the singularity point, is not a mathematical black hole.(2) can astrophysical black holes be formed in the physical universe? answer:yes, at least this can be done with gravitational collapse. (3) how can weprove that what we call astrophysical black holes are really black holes?answer: finding direct evidence of event horizon is not the way to go. insteadi propose five criteria which meet the highest standard for recognizing newdiscoveries in experimental physics and observational astronomy. (4) do we havesufficient evidence to claim the existence of astrophysical black holes in thephysical universe? answer: yes, astrophysical black holes have been found atleast in some galactic binary systems, at the center of almost every galaxy,and as the central engines of at least some long gamma-ray bursts. (5) will allmatter in the universe eventually fall into black holes? answer: probably "no",because "naked" compact objects, if they do exist with radii smaller than theradii of event horizons for their masses but are not enclosed by eventhorizons, can rescue the universe from an eternal death by re-cycling out thematter previously accreted into astrophysical black holes. finally i alsodiscuss briefly if we need a quantum theory of gravity in order to furtherunderstand astrophysical black holes, and what further astronomicalobservations and telescopes are needed to make further progress on ourunderstanding of astrophysical black holes.

1003.1359	on the solution to the "frozen star" paradox, nature of astrophysical  black holes, non-existence of gravitational singularity in the physical  universe and applicability of the birkhoff's theorem	oppenheimer and snyder found in 1939 that gravitational collapse in vacuumproduces a "frozen star", i.e., the collapsing matter only asymptoticallyapproaches the gravitational radius (event horizon) of the mass, but nevercrosses it within a finite time for an external observer. based upon our recentpublication on the problem of gravitational collapse in the physical universefor an external observer, the following results are reported here: (1) mattercan indeed fall across the event horizon within a finite time and thus bhs,rather than "frozen stars", are formed in gravitational collapse in thephysical universe. (2) matter fallen into an astrophysical black hole can neverarrive at the exact center; the exact interior distribution of matter dependsupon the history of the collapse process. therefore gravitational singularitydoes not exist in the physical universe. (3) the metric at any radius isdetermined by the global distribution of matter, i.e., not only by the matterinside the given radius, even in a spherically symmetric and pressurelessgravitational system. this is qualitatively different from the newtoniangravity and the common (mis)understanding of the birkhoff's theorem. thisresult does not contract the "lemaitre-tolman-bondi" solution for an externalobserver.

1101.3363	xmm-newton observations of ngc 247: x-ray population and a supersoft  ultraluminous x-ray source	we report on a new xmm-newton observation of ngc 247 from december 2009. thegalaxy contains a supersoft, ultraluminous x-ray source (ulx) whose spectrumconsists of a thermal component with a temperature about 0.1 kev and apower-law tail with a photon index around 2.5. the thermal emission isabsolutely the dominant component, contributing 96% of the total luminosity inthe 0.3-10 kev band. variability is detected at timescales of 10^2 s and longerwith a \nu^-1 power spectrum. these properties are consistent with black holebinaries in the thermal state and suggest the presence of an intermediate massblack hole of at least 600 solar masses. however, the integrated rms power ismuch higher than typically found in the thermal state. an alternativeexplanation of the emission could be a photosphere with a radius about 10^9 cm.a possible absorption feature around 1 kev is detected, which may be due toabsorption of highly ionized winds. x-ray sources within the disk of ngc 247have a luminosity function consistent with that found in low mass x-raybinaries. we confirm previous results that x-rays from the quasar phl 6625 maybe absorbed by gas in ngc 247, mainly at energies below 0.3 kev.

1107.5171	comparing the accretion disk evolution of black hole and neutron star  x-ray binaries from low to super-eddington luminosity	low-mass x-ray binaries (lmxbs) are systems in which a low-mass companiontransfers mass via roche-lobe overflow onto a black hole (bh) or a weaklymagnetized neutron star (ns). it is believed that both the solid surface andthe magnetic field of an ns can affect the accretion flow and show someobservable effects. using the disk emission dominant data, we compare the diskevolution of the two types of systems from low luminosity to super-eddingtonluminosity. as the luminosity decreases the disk in the ns lmxb 4u1608--522begins to leave the innermost stable circular orbit (isco) at much higherluminosity ($\sim$ 0.1 $l_{\mathrm{edd}}$), compared with bh lmxbs at muchlower luminosity ($\sim$ 0.03 $l_{\mathrm{edd}}$), due to the interactionbetween the ns magnetosphere and accretion flow. however, as the luminosityincreases above a critical luminosity, the disks in bh and ns lmxbs trace thesame evolutionary pattern, because the magnetosphere is restricted inside isco,and then both the ns surface emission and (dipole) magnetic field do notsignificantly affect the secular evolution of the accretion disk, that isdriven by the increased radiation pressure in the inner region. we furthersuggest that the ns surface emission provides additional information ofaccretion disk, not available in bh systems. through the observed ns surfaceemission, we argue that the disk thickness $h/r$ is less than $0.3-0.4$, andthat the significant outflow from inner disk edge exists at luminosity close toeddington luminosity.

1110.3154	magnetic field decay makes neutron stars look older than they are	it is commonly accepted that a neutron star is produced, when a massive starexhausts its nuclear fuel and ends its life in a core-collapse supernovaexplosion. this scenario is confirmed by the detection of pulsars, which arebelieved to be rapidly spinning neutron stars, in the central regions of manysupernova remnants. neutron stars and their associated supernova remnantsshould therefore have the same ages. as expected, the age of the crab pulsar,the first to be connected with a supernova remnant (the crab nebula), can beinferred from its current spin period and its derivative and indeed has aboutthe same age of the supernova remnant, that was produced from a historicallyrecorded supernova explosion in 1054. however most neutron stars appear to bemuch older than the ages of their associated supernova remnants, a puzzle notyet understood. another puzzle is that so far no convincing evidence has beenfound in favor of magnetic field decay in neutron stars, that is predicted inmost models of neutron stars. here we show convincing evidence of magneticfield decay in some young neutron stars, and that the magnetic field decay canalter their spinning behaviors significantly such that these neutron starsappear much older than they really are.

1110.3869	power-law magnetic field decay and constant core temperatures of  magnetars, normal and millisecond pulsars	the observed correlations, between the characteristic ages and dipole surfacemagnetic field strengths of all pulsars, can be well explained by magneticfield decay with core temperatures of $~2\times10^{8}$ k, $\sim2\times10^{7}$k, and $\sim10^{5}$ k, for magnetars, normal radio pulsars, and millisecondpulsars, respectively; assuming that their characteristic ages are about twoorders of magnitude larger than their true ages, the required core temperaturesmay be reduced by about a factor of 10. the magnetic decay follows a power-lawand is dominated by the solenoidal component of the ambipolar diffusion mode.in this model, all nss are assumed to have the same initial magnetic fieldstrength, but different core temperature which do not change as the magneticfield decays. this suggests that the key distinguishing property betweenmagnetars and normal pulsars is that magnetars were born much hotter thannormal pulsars, and thus have much longer magnetic field decay time scales,resulting in higher surface magnetic field strength even with the same ages ofnormal pulsars. the above conclusion agrees well with the observed correlationsbetween the surface temperatures of magnetars and other young nss, which do notagree with the cooling dominated evolution of neutron stars. this suggests apossible scenario that heating, perhaps due to magnetic field decay, balancesneutron star cooling for observed pulsars.

1201.3451	measuring the black hole masses in accreting x-ray binaries by detecting  the doppler orbital motion of their accretion disk wind absorption lines	so far essentially all black hole masses in x-ray binaries have been obtainedby observing the companion star's velocity and light curves as functions of theorbital phase. however a major uncertainty is the estimate of the orbitalinclination angle of an x-ray binary. here we suggest to measure the black holemass in an x-ray binary by measuring directly the black hole's orbital motion,thus obtaining the companion to black hole mass ratio. in this method we assumethat accretion disk wind moves with the black hole and thus the black hole'sorbital motion can be obtained from the doppler velocity of the absorptionlines produced in the accretion disk wind. we validate this method by analyzingthe chandra/hetg observations of gro j1655-40, in which the black hole orbitalmotion with line of sight velocity of 90.8 (+-11.3) km/s, inferred from thedoppler velocity of disk-wind absorption lines, is consistent with theprediction from its previously measured system parameters. we obtain the blackhole mass of 5.41 (+0.98, -0.57) solar masses and system inclination of 72.0(+7.8, -7.5) degrees in gro j1655-40. additional observations of this sourcecovering more orbital phases can improve estimates on its system parameterssubstantially. we then apply the method to the black hole x-ray binary lmc x-3observed with hst/cos near orbital phase 0.75. we find that the disk-windabsorption lines of civ doublet were shifted to about 50 km/s, which yields acompanion-to-black-hole mass ratio of 0.6 for an assumed disk wind velocity of-400 km/s. additional observations covering other orbital phases (0.25 inparticular) are crucial to ease this assumption and then to directly constrainthe mass ratio. this method in principle can also be applied to any accretingcompact objects with detectable accretion disk wind absorption line features.

1203.4428	on a common misunderstanding of the birkhoff theorem and light  deflection calculation: generalized shapiro delay and its possible laboratory  test	in newtonian gravity (ng) it is known that the gravitational field anywhereinside a spherically symmetric distribution of mass is determined only by theenclosed mass. this is also widely believed to be true in general relativity(gr), and the birkhoff theorem is often invoked to support this analogy betweenng and gr. here we show that such an understanding of the birkhoff theorem isincorrect and leads to erroneous calculations of light deflection and delaytime through matter. the correct metric, matching continuously to the locationof an external observer, is determined both by the enclosed mass and massdistribution outside. the effect of the outside mass is to make the interiorclock run slower, i.e., a slower speed of light for external observer. we alsodiscuss the relations and differences between ng and gr, in light of theresults we obtained in this lettework. finally we discuss the generalizedshapiro delay, caused by the outside mass, and its possible laboratory test.

1206.2569	quasars' optical polarization and balmer edge feature revealed by  ultra-violet, and polarized visible to near infrared emissions	polarized emission from a quasar is produced by wavelength-independentelectron scattering surrounding its accretion disc, and thus avoid thecontamination from its host galaxy and reveal the intrinsic emission spectrumof the accretion disc. ultra-violet (uv) emission from a quasar is normallyfree from the contamination from its host galaxy. polarization fraction of thequasar's disc emission can therefore be determined by comparing total uvemission with polarized visible to near-infrared (nir) emission; and theresulting continuum spectrum from uv to infrared can reveal the theoreticallyexpected balmer edge absorption feature. we fit the polarized spectra invisible and nir bands together with the total uv spectra of two type-1 quasars(3c 95, 4c 09.72), to an extended geometrically thin and optically thickaccretion disc model. in addition to the standard model, we include the balmeredge absorption due to co-rotational neutral gas on a narrow annulus of theaccretion disc. we find that the extended thin accretion disc model providesadequate description on the continuum spectra of the two quasars from uv to nirwavelengths. a monte-carlo-markov-chain fitting to the continuum spectra isable to well constrain the true polarization fraction of the disk emission,which allows the balmer edge feature to be completely revealed from polarizedvisible to uv continua. the balmer edge feature is prominent in both quasars'spectra, and is significantly broadened due to the orbital motion of gas in theaccretion disc. the broadening of the balmer edge feature is therefore relatedto the quasar's inclination. this work proves the concept of determiningquasar's inclination from the balmer edge feature in their continuum spectra.

1207.1485	testing models of magnetic field evolution of neutron stars with the  statistical properties of their spin evolutions	we test models for the evolution of neutron star (ns) magnetic fields (b).our model for the evolution of the ns spin is taken from an analysis of pulsartiming noise presented by hobbs et al. (2010). we first test the standard modelof a pulsar's magnetosphere in which b does not change with time and magneticdipole radiation is assumed to dominate the pulsar's spin-down. we find thismodel fails to predict both the magnitudes and signs of the second derivativesof the spin frequencies ($\ddot{\nu}$). we then construct a phenomenologicalmodel of the evolution of $b$, which contains a long term decay (ltd) modulatedby short term oscillations (sto); a pulsar's spin is thus modified by itsb-evolution. we find that an exponential ltd is not favored by the observedstatistical properties of $\ddot{\nu}$ for young pulsars and fails to explainthe fact that $\ddot{\nu}$ is negative for roughly half of the old pulsars. asimple power-law ltd can explain all the observed statistical properties of$\ddot{\nu}$. finally we discuss some physical implications of our results tomodels of the b-decay of nss and suggest reliable determination of the trueages of many young nss is needed, in order to constrain further the physicalmechanisms of their b-decay. our model can be further tested with the measuredevolutions of $\dot{\nu}$ and $\ddot{\nu}$ for an individual pulsar; the decayindex, oscillation amplitude and period can also be determined this way for thepulsar.

1209.2478	why do the braking indices of pulsars span a range of more than 100  millions?	here we report that the observed braking indices of the 366 pulsars in thesample of hobbs et al. range from about $-10^8$ to about $+10^8$ and aresignificantly correlated with their characteristic ages. using the model ofmagnetic field evolution we developed previously based on the same data, wederived an analytical expression for the braking index, which agrees with allthe observed statistical properties of the braking indices of the pulsars inthe sample of hobbs et al. our model is, however, incompatible with theprevious interpretation that magnetic field growth is responsible for the smallvalues of braking indices ($&lt;3$) observed for "baby" pulsars withcharacteristic ages of less than $2\times 10^3$ yr. we find that the"instantaneous" braking index of a pulsar may be different from the "averaged"braking index obtained from fitting the data over a certain time span. theclose match between our model-predicted "instantaneous" braking indices and theobserved "averaged" braking indices suggests that the time spans usedpreviously are usually smaller than or comparable to their magnetic fieldoscillation periods. our model can be tested with the existing data, bycalculating the braking index as a function of the time span for each pulsar.in doing so, one can obtain for each pulsar all the parameters in our magneticfield evolution model, and may be able to improve the sensitivity of usingpulsars to detect gravitational waves.

1209.4522	radial angular momentum transfer and magnetic barrier for short-type  gamma-ray burst central engine activity	soft extended emission (ee) following initial hard spikes up to 100 secondswas observed with {\em swift}/bat for about half of short-type gamma-ray bursts(sgrbs). this challenges the conversional central engine models of sgrbs, i.e.,compact star merger models. in the framework of the black hole-neutron starmerger models, we study the roles of the radial angular momentum transfer inthe disk and the magnetic barrier around the black hole for the activity ofsgrb central engines. we show that the radial angular momentum transfer maysignificantly prolong the lifetime of the accretion process and multipleepisodes may be switched by the magnetic barrier. our numerical calculationsbased on the models of the neutrino-dominated accretion flows suggest that thedisk mass is critical for producing the observed ee. in case of the mass being$\sim 0.8m_{\odot}$, our model can reproduce the observed timescale andluminosity of both the main and ee episodes in a reasonable parameter set. thepredicted luminosity of the ee component is lower than the observed ee withabout one order of magnitude and the timescale is shorter than 20 seconds ifthe disk mass being $\sim 0.2m_{\odot}$. {\em swift}/bat-like instruments maybe not sensitive enough to detect the ee component in this case. we argue thatthe ee component would be a probe for merger process and disk formation forcompact star mergers.

1301.2641	state-dependent orbital modulation of x-rays in cyg x-3	we analyze all of the available {\it rxte} observations of cyg x-3 in orderto investigate the connection between the central x-ray source and itssurrounding environment. the hardness--intensity diagram of cyg x-3 displays a"shoe" shape rather than the q-type shape commonly seen in other black holex-ray binary, and exhibits no apparent hysteresis effect. during the$\gamma$-ray outbursts, no existing data are located in the hard andintermediate states, which suggest the absence of a significant population ofnon-thermal electrons when the source is in these states. for the first time,we present the orbital modulation of the x-ray light curve (lc) of all fivestates. the different energy band lcs are in phase with each other in all fivestates, and the modulation amplitude of both soft and hard x-ray lcsmonotonously increases with decreasing hardness from hard to soft non-thermalstates. we confirm that the modulation depth decreases with increasing energyin the hard, intermediate, and very high states, as originally reported byzdziarski et al. however, in the soft non-thermal state, the hard x-raymodulation strength significantly increases and is even larger than the softx-ray one. our results rule out both wind absorption and jet origins of thehard x-ray lc modulation in the soft non-thermal state, and challenge ourunderstanding of the states of cyg x-3.

1302.3804	blazar anti-sequence of spectral variation within individual blazars:  cases for mrk 501 and 3c 279	the jet properties of mrk 501 and 3c 279 are derived by fitting the broadbandspectral energy distributions with the lepton models. the derived gamma_b (thebreak lorenz factor of the electron distribution) are 10^4-10^6 for mrk 501 and200~600 for 3c 279 and the magnetic field strength (b) of mrk 501 is usuallyone order of magnitude lower than that of 3c 279, but their doppler factors(delta) are comparable. a spectral variation feature that the peak luminosityis correlated with the peak frequency, which is opposite to the blazarsequence, is observed in the two sources. we find that (1) the peakluminosities of the two bumps in seds for mrk 501 depend on gamma_b in both theobserver and co-moving frames, but they are not correlated with b and delta;(2)the luminosity variation of 3c 279 is dominated by the external compton (ec)peak and its peak luminosity is correlated with gamma_b and delta, butanti-correlated with b. these results suggest that gamma_b may govern thespectral variation of mrk 501 and delta and b would be responsible for thespectral variation of 3c 279. the narrow distribution of gamma_b and thecorrelation of gamma_b and b in 3c 279 would be due to the cooling by the ecprocess and the strong magnetic field. based on our brief discussion, wepropose that this spectral variation feature may be originated from theinstability of the corona but not from the variation of the accretion rate asthat for the blazar sequence.

1307.2952	wavelength measurements of k transitions of oxygen, neon, and magnesium  with x-ray absorption lines	accurate atomic transition data are important in many astronomical researchareas especially in line spectroscopy study. whereas transition data of he-likeand h-like ions (i.e., ions at high-charge states) are accurately calculated,that of k transitions of neutral or low-ionized metal elements are still veryuncertain. spectroscopy of absorption lines produced in the interstellar medium(ism) has been proven to be an effective way to measure the central wavelengthsof these atomic transitions. in this work we analyze 36 chandra high energytransmission grating observations and search for and measure the ism absorptionlines along sight lines of 11 low-mass x-ray binaries. we correct the galacticrotation velocity to the rest frame for every observation and then use twodifferent methods to merge all the corrected spectra to a co-added spectrum.however the co-added spectra obtained by these methods exhibit biases, eitherto the observations of high counts or high signal-to-noise ratios of the lines.we make bayesian analysis to several significantly detected lines to obtain thesystematic uncertainty and the bias correction of other lines. compared toprevious studies (e.g., yao et al. 2009), our results improve the accuracy ofwavelengths by a factor from two to five and significantly reduce thesystematic uncertainties and biases. several weak transitions (e.g., 1s--2p ofmg iv and mg v; 1s--3p of mg iii and mg v) are also detected for the firsttime, albeit with low significance; future observations with improved accuracyare required to confirm these detections.

1307.5978	radiation mechanism and jet composition of gamma-ray bursts and gev-tev  selected radio loud active galactic nuclei	gamma-ray bursts (grbs) and gev-tev selected radio loud active galacticnuclei (agns) are compared based on our systematic modeling of the observedspectral energy distributions of a sample of agns with a single-zone leptonicmodel. we show that the correlation between the jet power (p_{jet}) and theprompt gamma-ray luminosity (l_{jet}) of grbs is consistent, within theuncertainties, with the correlation between jet power and the synchrotron peakluminosity (l_{s, jet}) of flat spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs). their radiationefficiencies (\varepsilon) are also comparable (&gt;10% for most sources), whichincrease with the bolometric jet luminosity (l_{bol,jet}) for fsrqs and withthe l_{jet} for grbs with similar power-law indices. bl lacs do not follow thep_{jet}-l_{s, jet} relation of fsrqs. they have lower \varepsilon and l_{bol,jet} values than fsrqs, and a tentative l_{bol, jet}-\varepsilon relation isalso found, with a power-law index being different from that of the fsrqs. themagnetization parameters (\sigma) of fsrqs are averagely larger than that of bllacs. they are anti-correlated with $\varepsilon$ for the fsrqs, but positivecorrelated with \varepsilon for the bl lacs. gev narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxiespotentially share similar properties with fsrqs. based on the analogy betweengrbs and fsrqs, we suggest that the prompt gamma-ray emission of grbs is likelyproduced by synchrotron process in a magnetized jet with high radiationefficiency, similar to fsrqs. the jets of bl lacs, on the other hand, are lessefficient and are likely more matter dominated.

1307.6413	modeling the evolution and distribution of the frequency's second  derivative and braking index of pulsar spin with simulations	we model the evolution of spin frequency's second derivative $\ddot\nu$ andbraking index $n$ of radio pulsars with simulations within the phenomenologicalmodel of their surface magnetic field evolution, which contains a long-termdecay modulated by short-term oscillations. for the pulsar psr b0329+54, themodel can reproduce the main characteristics of its $\ddot\nu$ variation withoscillation periods, predicts another $\sim 50$ yr oscillation component andanother recent swing of the sign of $\ddot\nu$. we show that the "averaged" $n$is different from the instantaneous $n$, and its oscillation magnitudedecreases abruptly as the time span increases, due to the "averaging" effect.the simulation predicted timing residuals agree with the main features of thereported data. we further perform monte carlo simulations for the distributionof the reported data in $|\ddot\nu|$ versus characteristic age $\tau_{\rm c}$diagram. the model with a power law index $\alpha=0.5$ can reproduce the slopeof the linear fit to pulsars' distributions in the diagrams of$\log|\ddot\nu|-\log\tau_{\rm c}$ and $\log|n|-\log\tau_{\rm c}$, but theoscillations are responsible for the almost equal number of positive andnegative values of $\ddot\nu$, in agreement with our previous analyticalstudies; an oscillation period of about several decades is also preferred.however the range of the oscillation amplitudes is $-11.4\lesssim\logf\lesssim-10.2$, slightly lager than the analytical prediction, $\logf\simeq-11.85$, because the "averaging" effect was not included previously.

1307.6911	relativistic jet properties of gev-tev blazars and possible implications  for the jet formation, composition, and cavity kinematics	we fit the spectral energy distributions (seds) of a gev-tev fsrq sample withthe leptonic model. their gamma_min of the relativistic electron distributions,which significantly affect the estimates of the jet properties, areconstrained, with a typical value of 48. their jet power, magnetized parameter,radiation efficiency, and jet production/radiation rates per central black hole(bh) mass are derived and compared to that of bl lacs. we show that he fsrqjets may be dominated by the poynting flux and have a high radiationefficiency, whereas the bl lac jets are likely dominated by particles and havea lower radiation efficiency than fsrqs. being different from bl lacs, the jetpowers of fsrqs are proportional to their central bh masses. the jet productionand radiation rates of the fsrqs distribute in narrow ranges and are correlatedwith each other, whereas no similar feature is found for the bl lacs. we alsoshow that the jet power is correlated with the cavity kinetic power, and themagnetic field energy in the jets may provide the cavity kinetic energy offsrqs and the kinetic energy of cold protons in the jets may be crucial forcavity kinetic energy of bl lacs. we suggest that the dominating formationmechanism of fsrq jets may be the bz process, but bl lac jets may be producedvia the bp and/or bz processes, depending on the structures and accretion ratesof accretion disks.

1308.6656	evolution of oxygen and nitrogen abundances and nitrogen production  mechanism in massive star-forming galaxies	utilizing the observational data of 55,318 star-forming galaxies (sfgs)selected from the catalog of mpa-jhu emission-line measurements for the sdssdr8, we investigate the galaxy downsizing effect of their o and n enrichments,and the nitrogen production mechanism in them. we show the redshift evolutionof o and n abundances and specific star formation rates for different galaxymass ranges, demonstrating the galaxy downsizing effect caused by less massiveprogenitors of less massive galaxies. the o and n abundances do not remainconstant for different galaxy mass ranges, and the enrichment (and hence starformation) decreases with increasing galaxy stellar mass. we find evidence ofthe o enrichment for galaxies with stellar masses $m_{*}&gt;10^{11.0} $ (in unitsof $m_{\odot}$), i.e. $\delta({\log}({\rm o/h})) \sim 0.10$ and$\delta({\log}({\rm n/h})) \sim 0.28$ from redshift 0.023 to 0.30. based on theevolutionary schematic model of n/o ratios in coziol et al., who proposed thescheme that the production of nitrogen is the consequence of a sequence ofbursts in sfgs, we conclude that the nitrogen production is dominated by theintermediate-mass stars, which dominate the secondary synthesis in sfgs.however, for galaxies with $m_{*}&gt;10^{10.35} $ we find evidence of enhanced n/oabundance ratios, which are significantly above the secondary synthesis line.this suggests that outflows of massive stars, which deplete oxygen efficiently,are more important in massive galaxies. finally we find an excellent linearrelation between $m_{*}$ and log(n/o), indicating that the n/o abundance ratiois a good indicator of the stellar mass in a sfg and may be used as a standardcandle for studying cosmology, if confirmed with further studies.

1309.2537	on the relaxation behaviors of slow and classical glitches:  observational biases and their opposite recovery trends	we study the pulsar timing properties and the data analysis methods duringglitch recoveries. in some cases one first fits the time-of-arrivals (toas) toobtain the "time-averaged" frequency $\nu$ and its first derivative $\dot\nu$,and then fits models to them. however, our simulations show that $\nu$ and$\dot\nu$ obtained this way are systematically biased, unless the timeintervals between the nearby data points of toas are smaller than about $10^4$s, which is much shorter than typical observation intervals. alternatively,glitch parameters can be obtained by fitting the phases directly withrelatively smaller biases; but the initial recovery timescale is usually chosenby eyes, which may introduce a strong bias. we also construct aphenomenological model by assuming a pulsar's spin-down law of $\dot\nu\nu^{-3}=-h_0 g(t)$ with $g(t)=1+\kappa e^{-t/\tau}$ for a glitch recovery, where $h_0$is a constant and $\kappa$ and $\tau$ are the glitch parameters to be found.this model can reproduce the observed data of slow glitches from b1822--09 anda giant classical glitch of b2334+61, with $\kappa&lt;0$ or $\kappa&gt;0$,respectively. we then use this model to simulate toa data and test severalfitting procedures for a glitch recovery. the best procedure is: 1) use a veryhigh order polynomial (e.g. to 50th order) to precisely describe the phase; 2)then obtain $\nu(t)$ and $\dot\nu(t)$ from the polynomial; and 3) the glitchparameters are obtained from $\nu(t)$ or $\dot\nu(t)$. finally, the uncertaintyin the starting time $t_0$ of a classical glitch causes uncertainties to someglitch parameters, but less so to a slow glitch and $t_0$ of which can bedetermined from data.

1312.3049	interpreting the spin-down evolutions of isolated neutron stars with  hall effects	the observed long-term spin-down evolution of isolated radio pulsars cannotbe explained by the standard magnetic dipole radiation with a constant brakingtorque. however, how and why the torque varies still remains controversial,which is a major issue in understanding neutron stars. many pulsars have beenobserved with significant long-term changes of their spin-down rates modulatedby quasi-periodic oscillations. applying the phenomenological model of pulsartiming noise we developed recently to the observed precise pulsar timing dataof isolated neutron stars, here we show that the observed long-term evolutionsof their spin-down rates and quasi-periodic modulations can be explained byhall effects in their crusts. therefore the evolution of their crustal magneticfields, rather than that in their cores, dominates the observed long termspin-down evolution of these young pulsars. understanding of the nature ofpulsar timing noise not only reveals the interior physics of neutron stars, butalso allows physical modeling of pulsar spin-down and thus improves thesensitivity of gravitational wave detections with pulsars.

1506.01800	radial alignment of elliptical galaxies by the tidal force of a cluster  of galaxies	unlike the random radial orientation distribution of field ellipticalgalaxies, galaxies in a cluster are expected to point preferentially towardsthe center of the cluster, as a result of the cluster's tidal force on itsmember galaxies. in this work an analytic model is formulated to simulate thiseffect. the deformation time scale of a galaxy in a cluster is usually muchshorter than the time scale of change of the tidal force; the dynamical processof the tidal interaction within the galaxy can thus be ignored. an equilibriumshape of a galaxy is then assumed to be the surface of equipotential, which isthe sum of the self-gravitational potential of the galaxy and the tidalpotential of the cluster at this location. we use a monte-carlo method tocalculate the radial orientation distribution of these galaxies, by assumingthe nfw mass profile of the cluster and the initial ellipticity of fieldgalaxies. the radial angles show a single peak distribution centered at zero.the monte-carlo simulations also show that a shift of the reference center fromthe real cluster center weakens the anisotropy of the radial angledistribution. therefore, the expected radial alignment cannot be revealed ifthe distribution of spatial position angle is used instead of that of radialangle. the observed radial orientations of elliptical galaxies in clusterabell~2744 are consistent with the simulated distribution.

1506.02104	modeling the evolution and distribution of the frequency's second  derivative and the braking index of pulsar spin	we model the evolution of the spin frequency's second derivative $\ddot\nu$and the braking index $n$ of radio pulsars with simulations within thephenomenological model of their surface magnetic field evolution, whichcontains a long-term power-law decay modulated by short-term oscillations. forthe pulsar psr b0329+54, a model with three oscillation components canreproduce its $\ddot\nu$ variation. we show that the "averaged" $n$ isdifferent from the instantaneous $n$, and its oscillation magnitude decreasesabruptly as the time span increases, due to the "averaging" effect. thesimulated timing residuals agree with the main features of the reported data.our model predicts that the averaged $\ddot\nu$ of psr b0329+54 will start todecrease rapidly with newer data beyond those used in hobbs et al.. we furtherperform monte carlo simulations for the distribution of the reported data in$|\ddot\nu|$ and $|n|$ versus characteristic age $\tau_{\rm c}$ diagrams. it isfound that the magnetic field oscillation model with decay index $\alpha=0$ canreproduce the distributions quite well. compared with magnetic field decay dueto the ambipolar diffusion ($\alpha=0.5$) and the hall cascade ($\alpha=1.0$),the model with no long term decay ($\alpha=0$) is clearly preferred for oldpulsars by the p-values of the two-dimensional kolmogorov-smirnov test.

1506.06208	correlation analysis between tibet as-$\gamma$ tev cosmic ray and wmap  nine-year data	the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) team subtractedtemplate-based foreground models to produce foreground-reduced maps, and maskedpoint sources and uncertain sky regions directly; however, whether foregroundresiduals exist in the wmap foreground-reduced maps is still an open question.here, we use pearson correlation coefficient (pcc) analysis with as-$\gamma$tev cosmic ray (cr) data to probe possible foreground residuals in the wmapnine-year data. the correlation results between the cr and foreground-containedmaps (wmap foreground-unreduced maps, wmap template-based and mem foregroundmodels) suggest that: (1) crs can trace foregrounds in the wmap data; (2) atleast some tev crs originate from the milky way; (3) foregrounds may be relatedto the existence of cr anisotropy (loss-cone and tail-in structures); (4) thereexist differences among different types of foregrounds in the declination rangeof $&lt; 15^{\circ}$. then, we generate 10,000 mock cmb sky maps to describe thecosmic variance, which is used to measure the effect of the fluctuations of allpossible cmb maps to the correlations between cr and cmb maps. finally, we docorrelation analysis between the cr and wmap foreground-reduced maps, and findthat: (1) there are significant anticorrelations; and (2) the wmapforeground-reduced maps are credible. however, the significant anticorrelationsmay be accidental, and the higher signal-to-noise ratio (snr) planck smica mapcannot reject the hypothesis of accidental correlations. we therefore can onlyconclude that the foreground residuals exist with $\sim$ 95\% probability.

1509.06126	super-strong magnetic fields of neutron stars in be x-ray binaries  estimated with new torque and magnetosphere models	we re-estimate the surface magnetic fields of neutron stars (nss) in be x-raybinaries (bexbs) with different models of torque, improved beyond klus et al.(2014). in particular, a new torque model (dai \&amp; li 2006) is applied to threemodels of magnetosphere radius. unlike the previous models, the new torquemodel does not lead to divergent results for any fastness parameter. theinferred surface magnetic fields of these nss for the two compressedmagnetosphere models are much higher than that for the uncompressedmagnetosphere model. the new torque model using the compressed-magnetosphereradius (shi, zhang \&amp; li 2014) leads to unique solutions near spin equilibriumin all cases, unlike other models that usually give two branches of solutions.although our conclusions are still affected by the simplistic assumptions aboutthe magnetosphere radius calculations, we show several groups of possiblesurface magnetic field values with our new models when the interaction betweenthe magnetosphere and the infalling accretion plasma is considered. theestimated surface magnetic fields for nss bexbs in the large magellanic cloud,the small magellanic cloud and the milk way are between the quantum criticalfield and the maximum "virial" value by the spin equilibrium condition.

1509.08312	the evolution of the magnetic inclination angle as an explanation of the  long term red timing-noise of pulsars	we study the possibility that the long term red timing-noise in pulsarsoriginates from the evolution of the magnetic inclination angle $\chi$. thebraking torque under consideration is a combination of the dipole radiation andthe current loss. we find that the evolution of $\chi$ can give rise to extracubic and fourth-order polynomial terms in the timing residuals. these twoterms are determined by the efficiency of the dipole radiation, the relativeelectric-current density in the pulsar tube and $\chi$. the followingobservation facts can be explained with this model: a) young pulsars havepositive $\ddot{\nu}$; b) old pulsars can have both positive and negative$\ddot{\nu}$; c) the absolute values of $\ddot{\nu}$ are proportional to$-\dot{\nu}$; d) the absolute values of the braking indices are proportional tothe characteristic ages of pulsars. if the evolution of $\chi$ is purely due torotation kinematics, then it can not explain the pulsars with braking indexless than 3, and thus the intrinsic change of the magnetic field is needed inthis case. comparing the model with observations, we conclude that the driftdirection of $\chi$ might oscillate many times during the lifetime of a pulsar.the evolution of $\chi$ is not sufficient to explain the rotation behavior ofthe crab pulsar, because the observed $\chi$ and $\dot{\chi}$ are inconsistentwith the values indicated from the timing residuals using this model.

1510.02597	galaxy alignment as a probe of large-scale filaments	the orientations of the red galaxies in a filament are aligned with theorientation of the filament. we thus develop a location-alignment-method (lam)of detecting filaments around clusters of galaxies, which uses both thealignments of red galaxies and their distributions in two-dimensional images.for the first time, the orientations of red galaxies are used as probes offilaments. we apply lam to the environment of coma cluster, and find fourfilaments (two filaments are located in sheets) in two selected regions, whichare compared with the filaments detected with the method of \cite{falco14}. wefind that lam can effectively detect the filaments around a cluster, even with$3\sigma$ confidence level, and clearly reveal the number and overallorientations of the detected filaments. lam is independent of the redshifts ofgalaxies, and thus can be applied at relatively high redshifts and to thesamples of red galaxies without the information of redshifts. we also find thatthe images of background galaxies (interlopers) which are lensed by the gravityof foreground filaments are amplifiers to probe the filaments.

1510.03118	dynamic changes of emitting electron distribution in the jet of 3c 279:  signatures of acceleration and cooling	we study the dynamic changes of electron energy distribution (eed) throughsystematically analysing the quasi-simultaneous spectral energy distributions(seds) of the flat spectrum radio quasar 3c 279 in different states. withmarkov chain monte carlo (mcmc) technique we model fourteen seds of 3c 279using a leptonic model with a three-parameter log-parabola electron energydistribution (eed). the 14 seds can be satisfactorily fitted with the one-zoneleptonic model. the observed $\gamma$ rays in 13 states are attributed tocompton scattering of external infrared photons from a surrounding dusty torus.the curved $\gamma$-ray spectrum observed during 2-8 april 2014 is wellexplained by the external compton of dust radiation. it is found that there isa clear positive correlation between the curvature parameter $b$ of the eed andthe electron peak energy $\gamma'_{\rm pk}$. no clear correlation between $b$and the synchrotron peak frequency $\nu_{\rm s}$ is found, due to the variedproduct of doppler factor and fluid magnetic field from state to state. weinterpret the correlation of $b-\gamma'_{\rm pk}$ in a stochastic accelerationscenario. this positive correlation is in agreement with the prediction in thestage when the balance between acceleration and radiative cooling of theelectrons is nearly established in the case of the turbulence spectral index$q=2$.

1511.07096	clumpy tori illuminated by the anisotropic radiation of accretion discs  in active galactic nuclei	in this paper, we try to explain the observed correlation between thecovering factor (cf) of hot dust and the properties of active galactic nuclei(agns), e.g., the bolometric luminosity ($l_{\rm{bol}}$) and black hole mass($m_{\rm{bh}}$). combining the possible dust distribution in the torus, theangular dependence of the radiation of the accretion disc, and the relationbetween the critical angle of torus and the eddington ratio, there are eightpossible models investigated in our work. we fit the observed cf with thesemodels to determine the parameters of them. as a result, clumpy torus modelscan generally explain the observed correlations of tori, while the smoothmodels fail to produce the required cfs. however, there is still significantscatter even for the best-fitting model, which is the combination of a clumpytorus illuminated by the anisotropic radiation of accretion disc in an agn.although some of the observed scatter is due to the uncertainties in measuring$l_{\rm{bol}}$ and $m_{\rm{bh}}$, other factors are required in more realisticmodel. the models examined in this paper are not necessary to be the physicalmodel of tori. however, the reasonable assumptions selected during this processshould be helpful in constructing physical models of tori.

1511.07667	multi-wavelength light curve evolution of swift j1357.2-0933 during its  2011 outburst	swift j1357.2-0933 underwent an episodic accretion in 2011 and provided veryregular temporal and spectral evolution, making it an ideal source forexploring the nature of very faint x-ray transients (vfxts). in this work, wepresent a detailed analysis on both x-ray and near-ultraviolet (nuv) lightcurves. the fluxes at all wavelengths display a near-exponential decays in theearly phase and transits to a faster-decay at late times. the e-folding decaytime-scales monotonically decrease with photon energies, and the derivedviscous time-scale is $\tau_{\rm \dot{m}} \sim 60$ days. the time-scale in thelate faster-decay stage is about a few days. the high ratio of nuv luminosityto x-ray luminosity indicates that the irradiation is unimportant in thisoutburst, while the near-exponential decay profile and the long decaytime-scales conflict with the disc thermal-viscous instability model. we thussuggest that the disc is thermally stable during the observations. adopting thetruncated disc model, we obtain a lower limit of peak accretion rate of $0.03\dot{m}_{\rm edd}$ and the x-ray radiative efficiency $\eta &lt; 5\times10^{-4}$,which decreases as the luminosity declines. the low x-ray radiative efficiencyis caused by the combined action of advection and outflows, and naturallyexplains that the x-ray reprocessing is overwhelmed by the viscous radiation ofthe outer standard disc in the nuv regime. we also propose a possibility thatthe outer standard disc recedes from the central black hole, resulting in thefaster-decay at late times.

0806.3185	jets and environment of microquasars	two relativistic x-ray jets have been detected with the chandra x-rayobservatory from the black hole x-ray transient xte j1550-564. we report a fullanalysis of the evolution of the two jets with a gamma-ray burst external shockmodel. a plausible scenario suggests a cavity outside the central source andthe jets first travelled with constant velocity and then are slowed down by theinteractions between the jets and the interstellar medium (ism). the bestfitted radius of the cavity is $\sim$0.36 pc on the eastern side and $\sim$0.46pc on the western side, and the densities also show asymmetry, of $\sim$0.015cm$^{-3}$ on the east to $\sim$0.21 cm$^{-3}$ on the west. a large scale lowdensity region is also found in another microquasar system, h 1743-322. theseresults are consistent with previous suggestions that the environment ofmicroquasars should be rather vacuous, compared to the normal galacticenvironment. a generic scenario for microquasar jets is proposed, classifyingthe observed jets into three main categories, with different jet morphologies(and sizes) corresponding to different scales of vacuous environmentssurrounding them.

astro-ph;0510160	the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect in a sample of 31 clusters - a comparison  between the x-ray predicted and wmap observed cmb temperature decrement	the wmap q, v, and w band radial profiles of temperature deviation of thecosmic microwave background (cmb) were constructed for a sample of 31 randomlyselected nearby clusters of galaxies in directions of galactic latitude $|b| &gt;$30$^o$. the profiles were compared in detail with the expected cmbsunyaev-zel'dovich effect (sze) caused by these clusters, with the hot gasproperties of each cluster inferred observationally by applying gastemperatures as measured by asca to isothermal $\beta$ models of the rosatx-ray surface brightness profiles, and with the wmap point spread functionfully taken into consideration. after co-adding the 31 cluster field, itappears that wmap detected the sze in all three bands. quantitatively, however,the observed sze only accounts for about 1/4 of the expected decrement. thediscrepancy represents too much unexplained extra flux: in the w band, thedetected sze corresponds on average to 5.6 times less x-ray gas mass within a10 arcmin radius than the mass value given by the rosat $\beta$ model. weexamined critically how the x-ray prediction of the sze may depend on ouruncertainties in the density and temperature of the hot intracluster plasma,and emission by cluster radio sources. although our comparison between thedetected and expected sze levels is subject to a margin of error, the factremains that the average observed sze depth and profile are consistent withthose of the primary cmb anisotropy, i.e. in principle the average wmaptemperature decrement among the 31 rich clusters is too shallow to accomodateany extra effect like the sze. a unique aspect of this sze investigation isthat because all the data being analyzed are in the public domain, our work isreadily open to the scrutiny of others.
