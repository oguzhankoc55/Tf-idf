0909.3583	searches for gravitational waves from known pulsars with s5 ligo data	we present a search for gravitational waves from 116 known millisecond andyoung pulsars using data from the fifth science run of the ligo detectors. forthis search ephemerides overlapping the run period were obtained for allpulsars using radio and x-ray observations. we demonstrate an updated searchmethod that allows for small uncertainties in the pulsar phase parameters to beincluded in the search. we report no signal detection from any of the targetsand therefore interpret our results as upper limits on the gravitational wavesignal strength. the most interesting limits are those for young pulsars. wepresent updated limits on gravitational radiation from the crab pulsar, wherethe measured limit is now a factor of seven below the spin-down limit. thislimits the power radiated via gravitational waves to be less than ~2% of theavailable spin-down power. for the x-ray pulsar j0537-6910 we reach thespin-down limit under the assumption that any gravitational wave signal from itstays phase locked to the x-ray pulses over timing glitches, and for pulsarsj1913+1011 and j1952+3252 we are only a factor of a few above the spin-downlimit. of the recycled millisecond pulsars several of the measured upper limitsare only about an order of magnitude above their spin-down limits. for theseour best (lowest) upper limit on gravitational wave amplitude is 2.3x10^-26 forj1603-7202 and our best (lowest) limit on the inferred pulsar ellipticity is7.0x10^-8 for j2124-3358.

1005.3029	discovery of a new soft gamma repeater, sgr j1833-0832	on 2010 march 19, the swift/burst alert telescope triggered on a short burstwith temporal and spectral characteristics similar to those of soft gammarepeater (sgr) bursts. the source location, however, did not coincide with anyknown sgr. subsequent observations of the source error box with the swift/x-raytelescope and the rossi x-ray timing explorer (rxte) led to the discovery of anew x-ray source, with a spin period of 7.56 s, confirming sgr j1833-0832 as anew magnetar. based on our detailed temporal and spectral analyses, we showthat the new sgr is rapidly spinning down (4 x 10^{-12} s/s) and find aninferred dipole magnetic field of 1.8 x 10^{14} g. we also show that the x-rayflux of sgr j1833-0832 remained constant for approximately 20 days followingthe burst and then started to decline. we derived an accurate location of thesource with the chandra x-ray observatory and we searched for a counterpart indeep optical and infrared observations of sgr j1833-0832, and for radio pulsedemission with the westerbork radio synthesis telescope. finally, we compare thespectral and temporal properties of the source to the other magnetarcandidates.

1011.5809	on the nature and evolution of the unique binary pulsar j1903+0327	(abridged) psr j1903+0327, a millisecond pulsar in an eccentric (e = 0.44)95-day orbit with a (~ 1msun) companion poses a challenge to our understandingof stellar evolution in binary and multiple-star systems. here we describeoptical and radio observations which rule out most of the scenarios proposed toexplain formation of this system. radio timing measurements of threepost-keplerian effects yield the most precise measurement of the mass of amillisecond pulsar to date: 1.667 +/- 0.021 solar masses (99.7% confidencelimit) (...). optical spectroscopy of a proposed main sequence counterpart showthat its orbital motion mirrors the pulsar's 95-day orbit; being therefore itsbinary companion (...) the optical detection also provides a measurement of thesystemic radial velocity of the binary; this and the proper motion measuredfrom pulsar timing allow the determination of the systemic 3-d velocity in thegalaxy. we find that the system is always within 270 pc of the plane of thegalaxy, but always more than 3 kpc away from the galactic centre. thus anexchange interaction in a dense stellar environment (like a globular cluster orthe galactic centre) is not likely to be the origin of this system. we suggestthat after the supernova that formed it, the neutron star was in a tight orbitwith a main-sequence star, the present companion was a tertiary farther out.the neutron star then accreted matter from its evolving inner ms companion,forming a millisecond pulsar. the former donor star then disappears, either dueto a chaotic 3-body interaction with the outer star (caused by the expansion ofthe inner orbit that necessarily results from mass transfer), or in the case ofa very compact inner system, due to ablation/accretion by the newly formedmillisecond pulsar.

1103.0576	placing limits on the stochastic gravitational-wave background using  european pulsar timing array data	direct detection of low-frequency gravitational waves ($10^{-9} - 10^{-8}$hz) is the main goal of pulsar timing array (pta) projects. one of the maintargets for the ptas is to measure the stochastic background of gravitationalwaves (gwb) whose characteristic strain is expected to approximately follow apower-law of the form $h_c(f)=a (f/\hbox{yr}^{-1})^{\alpha}$, where $f$ is thegravitational-wave frequency. in this paper we use the current data from theeuropean pta to determine an upper limit on the gwb amplitude $a$ as a functionof the unknown spectral slope $\alpha$ with a bayesian algorithm, by modellingthe gwb as a random gaussian process. for the case $\alpha=-2/3$, which isexpected if the gwb is produced by supermassive black-hole binaries, we obtaina 95% confidence upper limit on $a$ of $6\times 10^{-15}$, which is 1.8 timeslower than the 95% confidence gwb limit obtained by the parkes pta in 2006. ourapproach to the data analysis incorporates the multi-telescope nature of theeuropean pta and thus can serve as a useful template for futureintercontinental pta collaborations.

1104.1577	observing pulsars and fast transients with lofar	low frequency radio waves, while challenging to observe, are a rich source ofinformation about pulsars. the low frequency array (lofar) is a new radiointerferometer operating in the lowest 4 octaves of the ionospheric "radiowindow": 10-240mhz, that will greatly facilitate observing pulsars at low radiofrequencies. through the huge collecting area, long baselines, and flexibledigital hardware, it is expected that lofar will revolutionize radio astronomyat the lowest frequencies visible from earth. lofar is a next-generation radiotelescope and a pathfinder to the square kilometre array (ska), in that itincorporates advanced multi-beaming techniques between thousands of individualelements. we discuss the motivation for low-frequency pulsar observations ingeneral and the potential of lofar in addressing these science goals. wepresent lofar as it is designed to perform high-time-resolution observations ofpulsars and other fast transients, and outline the various relevant observingmodes and data reduction pipelines that are already or will soon be implementedto facilitate these observations. a number of results obtained fromcommissioning observations are presented to demonstrate the exciting potentialof the telescope. this paper outlines the case for low frequency pulsarobservations and is also intended to serve as a reference for upcomingpulsar/fast transient science papers with lofar.

1302.1790	discovery of the optical counterparts to four energetic fermi  millisecond pulsars	in the last few years, over 43 millisecond radio pulsars have been discoveredby targeted searches of unidentified gamma-ray sources found by the fermigamma-ray space telescope. a large fraction of these millisecond pulsars are incompact binaries with low-mass companions. these systems often show eclipses ofthe pulsar signal and are commonly known as black widows and redbacks becausethe pulsar is gradually destroying its companion. in this paper, we report onthe optical discovery of four strongly irradiated millisecond pulsarcompanions. all four sources show modulations of their color and luminosity atthe known orbital periods from radio timing. light curve modelling of ourexploratory data shows that the equilibrium temperature reached on thecompanion's dayside with respect to their nightside is consistent with about10-30% of the available spin-down energy from the pulsar being reprocessed toincrease the companion's dayside temperature. this value compares well with therange observed in other irradiated pulsar binaries and offers insights aboutthe energetics of the pulsar wind and the production of gamma-ray emission. inaddition, this provides a simple way of estimating the brightness of irradiatedpulsar companions given the pulsar spin-down luminosity. our analysis alsosuggests that two of the four new irradiated pulsar companions are onlypartially filling their roche lobe. some of these sources are relatively brightand represent good targets for spectroscopic follow-up. these measurementscould enable, among other things, mass determination of the neutron stars inthese systems.

1305.0447	peace: pulsar evaluation algorithm for candidate extraction -- a  software package for post-analysis processing of pulsar survey candidates	modern radio pulsar surveys produce a large volume of prospective candidates,the majority of which are polluted by human-created radio frequencyinterference or other forms of noise. typically, large numbers of candidatesneed to be visually inspected in order to determine if they are real pulsars.this process can be labor intensive. in this paper, we introduce an algorithmcalled peace (pulsar evaluation algorithm for candidate extraction) whichimproves the efficiency of identifying pulsar signals. the algorithm ranks thecandidates based on a score function. unlike popular machine-learning basedalgorithms, no prior training data sets are required. this algorithm has beenapplied to data from several large-scale radio pulsar surveys. using thehuman-based ranking results generated by students in the arecibo remote commandenter programme, the statistical performance of peace was evaluated. it wasfound that peace ranked 68% of the student-identified pulsars within the top0.17% of sorted candidates, 95% within the top 0.34%, and 100% within the top3.7%. this clearly demonstrates that peace significantly increases the pulsaridentification rate by a factor of about 50 to 1000. to date, peace has beendirectly responsible for the discovery of 47 new pulsars, 5 of which aremillisecond pulsars that may be useful for pulsar timing basedgravitational-wave detection projects.

1305.3884	swings between rotation and accretion power in a millisecond binary  pulsar	it is thought that neutron stars in low-mass binary systems can accretematter and angular momentum from the companion star and be spun-up tomillisecond rotational periods. during the accretion stage, the system iscalled a low-mass x-ray binary, and bright x-ray emission is observed. when therate of mass transfer decreases in the later evolutionary stages, thesebinaries host a radio millisecond pulsar whose emission is powered by theneutron star's rotating magnetic field. this evolutionary model is supported bythe detection of millisecond x-ray pulsations from several accreting neutronstars and also by the evidence for a past accretion disc in a rotation-poweredmillisecond pulsar. it has been proposed that a rotation-powered pulsar maytemporarily switch on during periods of low mass inflow in some such systems.only indirect evidence for this transition has hitherto been observed. here wereport observations of accretion-powered, millisecond x-ray pulsations from aneutron star previously seen as a rotation-powered radio pulsar. within a fewdays after a month-long x-ray outburst, radio pulses were again detected. thisnot only shows the evolutionary link between accretion and rotation-poweredmillisecond pulsars, but also that some systems can swing between the twostates on very short timescales.

1309.0776	searching for pulsars using image pattern recognition	in this paper, we present a novel artificial intelligence (ai) program thatidentifies pulsars from recent surveys using image pattern recognition withdeep neural nets---the pics (pulsar image-based classification system) ai. theai mimics human experts and distinguishes pulsars from noise and interferencesby looking for patterns from candidate. the information from each pulsarcandidate is synthesized in four diagnostic plots, which consist of up tothousands pixel of image data. the ai takes these data from each candidate asits input and uses thousands of such candidates to train its ~9000 neurons.different from other pulsar selection programs which use pre-designed patterns,the pics ai teaches itself the salient features of different pulsars from a setof human-labeled candidates through machine learning. the deep neural networksin this ai system grant it superior ability in recognizing various types ofpulsars as well as their harmonic signals. the trained ai's performance hasbeen validated with a large set of candidates different from the training set.in this completely independent test, pics ranked 264 out of 277 pulsar-relatedcandidates, including all 56 previously known pulsars, to the top 961 (1%) of90008 test candidates, missing only 13 harmonics. the first non-pulsarcandidate appears at rank 187, following 45 pulsars and 141 harmonics. in otherwords, 100% of the pulsars were ranked in the top 1% of all candidates, while80% were ranked higher than any noise or interference. the performance of thissystem can be improved over time as more training data are accumulated. this aisystem has been integrated into the palfa survey pipeline and has discoveredsix new pulsars to date.

1401.0535	a millisecond pulsar in a stellar triple system	gravitationally bound three-body systems have been studied for hundreds ofyears and are common in our galaxy. they show complex orbital interactions,which can constrain the compositions, masses, and interior structures of thebodies and test theories of gravity, if sufficiently precise measurements areavailable. a triple system containing a radio pulsar could provide suchmeasurements, but the only previously known such system, b1620-26 (with amillisecond pulsar, a white dwarf, and a planetary-mass object in an orbit ofseveral decades), shows only weak interactions. here we report precision timingand multi-wavelength observations of psr j0337+1715, a millisecond pulsar in ahierarchical triple system with two other stars. strong gravitationalinteractions are apparent and provide the masses of the pulsar (1.4378(13)msun, where msun is the solar mass and the parentheses contain the uncertaintyin the final decimal places) and the two white dwarf companions (0.19751(15)msun and 0.4101(3) msun), as well as the inclinations of the orbits (bothapproximately 39.2 degrees). the unexpectedly coplanar and nearly circularorbits indicate a complex and exotic evolutionary past that differs from thoseof known stellar systems. the gravitational field of the outer white dwarfstrongly accelerates the inner binary containing the neutron star, and thesystem will thus provide an ideal laboratory in which to test the strongequivalence principle of general relativity.

1401.2876	discovery of carbon radio recombination lines in absorption towards  cygnus~a	we present the first detection of carbon radio recombination line absorptionalong the line of sight to cygnus a. the observations were carried out with thelow frequency array in the 33 to 57 mhz range. these low frequency radioobservations provide us with a new line of sight to study the diffuse, neutralgas in our galaxy. to our knowledge this is the first time that foregroundmilky way recombination line absorption has been observed against a brightextragalactic background source.  by stacking 48 carbon $\alpha$ lines in the observed frequency range wedetect carbon absorption with a signal-to-noise ratio of about 5. the averagecarbon absorption has a peak optical depth of 2$\times$10$^{-4}$, a line widthof 10 km s$^{-1}$ and a velocity of +4 km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the localstandard of rest. the associated gas is found to have an electron temperature$t_{e}\sim$ 110 k and density $n_{e}\sim$ 0.06 cm$^{-3}$. these propertiesimply that the observed carbon $\alpha$ absorption likely arises in the coldneutral medium of the orion arm of the milky way. hydrogen and helium lineswere not detected to a 3$\sigma$ peak optical depth limit of1.5$\times$10$^{-4}$ for a 4 km s$^{-1}$ channel width.  radio recombination lines associated with cygnus a itself were also searchedfor, but are not detected. we set a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of1.5$\times$10$^{-4}$ for the peak optical depth of these lines for a 4 kms$^{-1}$ channel width.

1402.0765	a state change in the low-mass x-ray binary xss j12270-4859	millisecond radio pulsars acquire their rapid rotation rates through mass andangular momentum transfer in a low-mass x-ray binary system. recent studies ofpsr j1824-2452i and psr j1023+0038 have observationally demonstrated this link,and they have also shown that such systems can repeatedly transitionback-and-forth between the radio millisecond pulsar and low-mass x-ray binarystates. this also suggests that a fraction of such systems are not newly bornradio millisecond pulsars but are rather suspended in a back-and-forth stateswitching phase, perhaps for giga-years. xss j12270-4859 has been previouslysuggested to be a low-mass x-ray binary, and until recently the only suchsystem to be seen at mev-gev energies. we present radio, optical and x-rayobservations that offer compelling evidence that xss j12270-4859 is a low-massx-ray binary which transitioned to a radio millisecond pulsar state between2012 november 14 and 2012 december 21. though radio pulsations remain to bedetected, we use optical and x-ray photometry/spectroscopy to show that thesystem has undergone a sudden dimming and no longer shows evidence for anaccretion disk. the optical observations constrain the orbital period to6.913+-0.002 hr.

1404.2934	fast radio burst discovered in the arecibo pulsar alfa survey	recent work has exploited pulsar survey data to identify temporally isolated,millisecond-duration radio bursts with large dispersion measures (dms). thesebursts have been interpreted as arising from a population of extragalacticsources, in which case they would provide unprecedented opportunities forprobing the intergalactic medium; they may also be linked to new sourceclasses. until now, however, all so-called fast radio bursts (frbs) have beendetected with the parkes radio telescope and its 13-beam receiver, casting someconcern about the astrophysical nature of these signals. here we present frb121102, the first frb discovery from a geographic location other than parkes.frb 121102 was found in the galactic anti-center region in the 1.4-ghz pulsaralfa survey with the arecibo observatory with a dm = 557.4 $\pm$ 3 pccm$^{-3}$, pulse width of $3\; \pm 0.5$ ms, and no evidence of interstellarscattering. the observed delay of the signal arrival time with frequency agreesprecisely with the expectation of dispersion through an ionized medium. despiteits low galactic latitude ($b = -0.2^{\circ}$), the burst has three times themaximum galactic dm expected along this particular line-of-sight, suggesting anextragalactic origin. a peculiar aspect of the signal is an inverted spectrum;we interpret this as a consequence of being detected in a sidelobe of the alfareceiver. frb 121102's brightness, duration, and the inferred event rate areall consistent with the properties of the previously detected parkes bursts.

(2009), for a different sample of southern pulsars. in thispaper we present a possible explanation for the difference in magnitude of thiseffect between the two frequencies, based on scattering. finally, we haveestimated the magnetospheric emission heights of low-frequency radiation fromfour pulsars, based on the phase lags between the flux-density and the paprofiles, and the theoretical framework of blaskiewicz, cordes &amp; wasserman(1991). these estimates yielded heights of a few hundred km; at least for psrb1133+16, this is consistent with emission heights derived based onradius-to-frequency mapping, but is up to a few times larger than the recentupper limit based on pulsar timing.

1503.05170	discovery and follow-up of rotating radio transients with the green bank  and lofar telescopes	we have discovered 21 rotating radio transients (rrats) in data from thegreen bank telescope (gbt) 350-mhz drift-scan and the green bank northcelestial cap pulsar surveys using a new candidate sifting algorithm. rrats arepulsars with sporadic emission that are detected through their bright singlepulses rather than fourier domain searches. we have developed {\tt rrattrap}, asingle-pulse sifting algorithm that can be integrated into pulsar survey dataanalysis pipelines in order to find rrats and fast radio bursts. we haveconducted follow-up observations of our newly discovered sources at severalradio frequencies using the gbt and low frequency array (lofar), yieldingimproved positions and measurements of their periods, dispersion measures, andburst rates, as well as phase-coherent timing solutions for four of them. thenew rrats have dispersion measures (dms) ranging from 15 to 97 pc cm$^{-3}$,periods of 240 ms to 3.4 s, and estimated burst rates of 20 to 400 pulseshr$^{-1}$ at 350 mhz. we use this new sample of rrats to perform statisticalcomparisons between rrats and canonical pulsars in order to shed light on therelationship between the two populations. we find that the dm and spatialdistributions of the rrats agree with those of the pulsars found in the samesurvey. we find evidence that slower pulsars (i.e. $p&gt;200$ ms) arepreferentially more likely to emit bright single pulses than are faster pulsars($p&lt;200$ ms), although this conclusion is tentative. our results are consistentwith the proposed link between rrats, transient pulsars, and canonical pulsarsas sources in various parts of the pulse activity spectrum.

1504.03684	einstein@home discovery of a palfa millisecond pulsar in an eccentric  binary orbit	we report the discovery of the millisecond pulsar (msp) psr j1950+2414($p=4.3$ ms) in a binary system with an eccentric ($e=0.08$) 22-day orbit inpulsar alfa survey observations with the arecibo telescope. its companion starhas a median mass of 0.3 $m_\odot$ and is most likely a white dwarf. fullyrecycled msps like this one are thought to be old neutron stars spun-up by masstransfer from a companion star. this process should circularize the orbit, asis observed for the vast majority of binary msps, which predominantly haveorbital eccentricities $e &lt; 0.001$. however, four recently discovered binarymsps have orbits with $0.027 &lt; e &lt; 0.44$; psr j1950+2414 is the fifth suchsystem to be discovered. the upper limits for its intrinsic spin periodderivative and inferred surface magnetic field strength are comparable to thoseof the general msp population. the large eccentricities are incompatible withthe predictions of the standard recycling scenario: something unusual happenedduring their evolution. proposed scenarios are a) initial evolution of thepulsar in a triple system which became dynamically unstable, b) origin in anexchange encounter in an environment with high stellar density, c) rotationallydelayed accretion-induced collapse of a super-chandrasekhar white dwarf, and d)dynamical interaction of the binary with a circumbinary disk. we compare theproperties of all five known eccentric msps with the predictions of theseformation channels. future measurements of the masses and proper motion mightallow us to firmly exclude some of the proposed formation scenarios.

1505.03064	lofar discovery of a quiet emission mode in psr b0823+26	psr b0823+26, a 0.53-s radio pulsar, displays a host of emission phenomenaover timescales of seconds to (at least) hours, including nulling, subpulsedrifting, and mode-changing. studying pulsars like psr b0823+26 providesfurther insight into the relationship between these various emission phenomenaand what they might teach us about pulsar magnetospheres. here we report on thelofar discovery that psr b0823+26 has a weak and sporadically emitting 'quiet'(q) emission mode that is over 100 times weaker (on average) and has a nullingfraction forty-times greater than that of the more regularly-emitting 'bright'(b) mode. previously, the pulsar has been undetected in the q-mode, and wasassumed to be nulling continuously. psr b0823+26 shows a further decrease inaverage flux just before the transition into the b-mode, and perhaps trulyturns off completely at these times. furthermore, simultaneous observationstaken with the lofar, westerbork, lovell, and effelsberg telescopes between 110mhz and 2.7 ghz demonstrate that the transition between the q-mode and b-modeoccurs within one single rotation of the neutron star, and that it isconcurrent across the range of frequencies observed.

1506.03370	limits on fast radio bursts at 145 mhz with artemis, a real-time  software backend	fast radio bursts (frbs), are millisecond radio signals that exhibitdispersion larger than what the galactic electron density can account for. wehave conducted a 1446 hour survey for fast radio bursts (frbs) at 145~mhz,covering a total of 4193 sq. deg on the sky. we used the uk station of thelofar radio telescope -- the rawlings array -- , accompanied for a majority ofthe time by the lofar station at nan\c{c}ay, observing the same fields at thesame frequency. our real-time search backend, artemis, utilizes graphicsprocessing units to search for pulses with dispersion measures up to 320cm$^{-3}$ pc. previous derived frb rates from surveys around 1.4~ghz, andfavoured frb interpretations, motivated this survey, despite all previousdetections occurring at higher dispersion measures. we detected no new frbsabove a signal-to-noise threshold of 10, leading to the most stringent upperlimit yet on the frb event rate at these frequencies: 29 sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$for 5~ms-duration pulses above 62~jy. the non-detection could be due toscatter-broadening, limitations on the volume and time searched, or the shapeof frb flux density spectra. assuming the latter and that frbs are standardcandles, the non-detection is compatible with the published frb sky rate, iftheir spectra follow a power law with frequency ($\propto \nu^{\alpha}$), with$\alpha\gtrsim+0.1$, demonstrating a marked difference from pulsar spectra. ourresults suggest that surveys at higher frequencies, including the low frequencycomponent of the square kilometre array, will have better chances to detect,estimate rates and understand the origin and properties of frbs.

1507.07496	lofar tied-array imaging and spectroscopy of solar s bursts	context. the sun is an active source of radio emission that is oftenassociated with energetic phenomena ranging from nanoflares to coronal massejections (cmes). at low radio frequencies (&lt;100 mhz), numerous millisecondduration radio bursts have been reported, such as radio spikes or solar sbursts (where s stands for short). to date, these have neither been studiedextensively nor imaged because of the instrumental limitations of previousradio telescopes. aims. here, low frequency array (lofar) observations wereused to study the spectral and spatial characteristics of a multitude of sbursts, as well as their origin and possible emission mechanisms. methods. weused 170 simultaneous tied-array beams for spectroscopy and imaging of sbursts. since s bursts have short timescales and fine frequency structures,high cadence (~50 ms) tied-array images were used instead of standardinterferometric imaging, that is currently limited to one image per second.results. on 9 july 2013, over 3000 s bursts were observed over a time period of~8 hours. s bursts were found to appear as groups of short-lived (&lt;1 s) andnarrow-bandwidth (~2.5 mhz) features, the majority drifting at ~3.5 mhz/s and awide range of circular polarisation degrees (2-8 times more polarised than theaccompanying type iii bursts). extrapolation of the photospheric magnetic fieldusing the potential field source surface (pfss) model suggests that s burstsare associated with a trans-equatorial loop system that connects an activeregion in the southern hemisphere to a bipolar region of plage in the northernhemisphere. conclusions. we have identified polarised, short-lived solar radiobursts that have never been imaged before. they are observed at a height andfrequency range where plasma emission is the dominant emission mechanism,however they possess some of the characteristics of electron-cyclotron maseremission.

1508.02948	a lofar census of millisecond pulsars	we report the detection of 48 millisecond pulsars (msps) out of 75 observedthus far using the lofar in the frequency range 110-188 mhz. we have alsodetected three msps out of nine observed in the frequency range 38-77 mhz. thisis the largest sample of msps ever observed at these low frequencies, and halfof the detected msps were observed for the first time at frequencies below 200mhz. we present the average pulse profiles of the detected msps, theireffective pulse widths, and flux densities and compare these with higherobserving frequencies. the flux-calibrated, multifrequency lofar pulse profilesare publicly available via the epn database of pulsar profiles. we also presentaverage values of dispersion measures (dm) and discuss dm and profilevariations. about 35% of the msps show strong narrow profiles, another 25%exhibit scattered profiles, and the rest are only weakly detected. aqualitative comparison of lofar profiles with those at higher radio frequenciesshows constant separation between profile components. similarly, the profilewidths are consistent with those observed at higher frequencies, unlessscattering dominates at the lowest frequencies. this is very different fromwhat is observed for normal pulsars and suggests a compact emission region inthe msp magnetosphere. the amplitude ratio of the profile components, on theother hand, can dramatically change towards low frequencies, often with thetrailing component becoming dominant. as previously demonstrated this can becaused by aberration and retardation. this data set enables high-precisionstudies of pulse profile evolution with frequency, dispersion, faradayrotation, and scattering in the interstellar medium. characterising andcorrecting these systematic effects may improve pulsar-timing precision athigher observing frequencies, where pulsar timing array projects aim todirectly detect gravitational waves.

1509.06396	wide-band, low-frequency pulse profiles of 100 radio pulsars with lofar	lofar offers the unique capability of observing pulsars across the 10-240 mhzfrequency range with a fractional bandwidth of roughly 50%. this spectral rangeis well-suited for studying the frequency evolution of pulse profile morphologycaused by both intrinsic and extrinsic effects: such as changing emissionaltitude in the pulsar magnetosphere or scatter broadening by the interstellarmedium, respectively. the magnitude of most of these effects increases rapidlytowards low frequencies. lofar can thus address a number of open questionsabout the nature of radio pulsar emission and its propagation through theinterstellar medium. we present the average pulse profiles of 100 pulsarsobserved in the two lofar frequency bands: high band (120-167 mhz, 100profiles) and low band (15-62 mhz, 26 profiles). we compare them withwesterbork synthesis radio telescope (wsrt) and lovell telescope observationsat higher frequencies (350 and1400 mhz) in order to study the profileevolution. the profiles are aligned in absolute phase by folding with a new setof timing solutions from the lovell telescope, which we present along withprecise dispersion measures obtained with lofar. we find that the profileevolution with decreasing radio frequency does not follow a specific trend but,depending on the geometry of the pulsar, new components can enter into, or behidden from, view. nonetheless, in general our observations confirm thewidening of pulsar profiles at low frequencies, as expected fromradius-to-frequency mapping or birefringence theories. we offer this catalog oflow-frequency pulsar profiles in a user friendly way via the epn database ofpulsar profiles (http://www.epta.eu.org/epndb/).
