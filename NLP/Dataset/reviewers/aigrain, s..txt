0901.4618	photospheric activity and rotation of the planet-hosting star  corot-exo-4a	the space experiment corot has recently detected a transiting hot jupiter inorbit around a moderately active f-type main-sequence star (corot-exo-4a). thisplanetary system is of particular interest because it has an orbital period of9.202 days, the second longest one among the transiting planets known to date.we study the surface rotation and the activity of the host star during anuninterrupted sequence of optical observations of 58 days. our approach isbased on a maximum entropy spot modelling technique extensively tested bymodelling the variation of the total solar irradiance. it assumes that stellaractive regions consist of cool spots and bright faculae, analogous to sunspotsand solar photospheric faculae, whose visibility is modulated by stellarrotation. the modelling of the light curve of corot-exo-4a reveals three mainactive longitudes with lifetimes between about 30 and 60 days that rotatequasi-synchronously with the orbital motion of the planet. the differentrotation rates of the active longitudes are interpreted in terms of surfacedifferential rotation and a lower limit of 0.057 \pm 0.015 is derived for itsrelative amplitude. the enhancement of activity observed close to thesubplanetary longitude suggests a magnetic star-planet interaction, althoughthe short duration of the time series prevents us from drawing definiteconclusions.

0903.1829	noise properties of the corot data: a planet-finding perspective	in this short paper, we study the photometric precision of stellar lightcurves obtained by the corot satellite in its planet finding channel, with aparticular emphasis on the timescales characteristic of planetary transits.together with other articles in the same issue of this journal, it forms anattempt to provide the building blocks for a statistical interpretation of thecorot planet and eclipsing binary catch to date.  after pre-processing the light curves so as to minimise long-term variationsand outliers, we measure the scatter of the light curves in the first threecorot runs lasting more than 1 month, using an iterative non-linear filter toisolate signal on the timescales of interest. the bevhaiour of the noise on 2htimescales is well-described a power-law with index 0.25 in r-magnitude,ranging from 0.1mmag at r=11.5 to 1mmag at r=16, which is close to thepre-launch specification, though still a factor 2-3 above the photon noise dueto residual jitter noise and hot pixel events. there is evidence for a slightdegradation of the performance over time. we find clear evidence for enhancedvariability on hours timescales (at the level of 0.5 mmag) in stars identifiedas likely giants from their r-magnitude and b-v colour, which representapproximately 60 and 20% of the observed population in the direction of aquilaand monoceros respectively. on the other hand, median correlated noise levelsover 2h for dwarf stars are extremely low, reaching 0.05mmag at the bright end.

0905.3062	an iterative filter to reconstruct planetary transit signals in the  presence of stellar variability	the detrending algorithms which are widely used to reduce the impact ofstellar variability on space-based transit surveys are ill-suited forestimating the parameters of confirmed planets, as they unavoidably alter thetransit signal. we present a post-detection detrending algorithm, which filtersout signal on other timescales than the period of the transit while preservingthe transit signal.  we compare the performance of this new filter to a well-establishedpre-detection detrending algorithm, by applying both to a set of 20 simulatedlight curves containing planetary transits, stellar variability, andinstrumental noise as expected for the corot space mission, and performinganalytic fits to the transits. compared to the pre-detection benchmark, the newpost-detection filter systematically yields significantly reduced errors(median reduction in relative error over our sample of about 40%) on theplanet-to-star radius ratio, system scale and impact parameter. this isparticularly important for active stars, where errors induced by variabilitycan otherwise dominate the final error budget on the planet parameters.  aside from improving planet parameter estimates, the new filter preserves allsignal at the orbital period of the planet, and thus could also be used tosearch for light reflected by the planet.

0906.5605	spin-orbit misalignment in the hd80606 planetary system	we recently reported the photometric and spectroscopic detection of theprimary transit of the 111-day-period, eccentric extra-solar planet hd80606 b,at observatoire de haute-provence, france (moutou et al. 2009). the wholeegress of the primary transit and a section of its central part were observed,allowing the measurement of the planetary radius, and evidence for a spin-orbitmisalignment through the observation of the rossiter-mclaughlin anomaly. theingress having not been observed for this long-duration transit, uncertaintiesremained in the parameters of the system. we present here a refined, combinedanalysis of our photometric and spectroscopic data, together with furtherpublished radial velocities, ground-based photometry, and spitzer photometryaround the secondary eclipse, as well as new photometric measurements of hd80606 acquired at mount hopkins, arizona, just before the beginning of theprimary transit. although the transit is not detected in those new data, theyprovide an upper limit for the transit duration, which narrows down thepossible behaviour of the rossiter-mclaughlin anomaly in the unobserved part ofthe transit. we analyse the whole data with a bayesian approach using amarkov-chain monte carlo integration on all available information. we find r_p= 0.98 +- 0.03 r_jup for the planetary radius, and a total primary transitduration of 11.9 +- 1.3 hours from first to fourth contact. our analysisreinforces the hypothesis of spin-orbit misalignment in this system (alignmentexcluded at &gt;95 % level), with a positive projected angle between the planetaryorbital axis and the stellar rotation (median solution lambda ~ 50 degrees). ashd80606 is a component of a binary system, the peculiar orbit of its planetcould result from a kozai mechanism.

0907.1653	the secondary eclipse of corot-1b	the transiting planet corot-1b is thought to belong to the pm-class ofplanets, in which the thermal emission dominates in the optical wavelengths. wepresent a detection of its secondary eclipse in the corot white channel data,whose response function goes from ~400 to ~1000 nm. we used two differentfiltering approaches, and several methods to evaluate the significance of adetection of the secondary eclipse. we detect a secondary eclipse centeredwithin 20 min at the expected times for a circular orbit, with a depth of0.016+/-0.006%. the center of the eclipse is translated in a 1-sigma upperlimit to the planet's eccentricity of ecosomega&lt;0.014. under the assumption ofa zero bond albedo and blackbody emission from the planet, it corresponds to at_{corot}=2330 +120-140 k. we provide the equilibrium temperatures of theplanet as a function of the amount of reflected light. if the planet is inthermal equilibrium with the incident flux from the star, our results imply aninefficient transport mechanism of the flux from the day to the night sides.

0707.0417	efficient identification of exoplanetary transit candidates from  superwasp light curves	transiting extrasolar planets constitute only a small fraction of the rangeof stellar systems found to display periodic, shallow dimmings in wide-fieldsurveys employing small-aperture camera arrays. here we present an efficientselection strategy for follow-up observations, derived from analysis of thelight curves of a sample of 67 superwasp targets that passed the selectiontests we used in earlier papers, but which have subsequently been identifiedeither as planet hosts or as astrophysical false positives. we determine thesystem parameters using markov-chain monte carlo analysis of the superwasplight curves. we use a constrained optimisation of chi-squared combined with abayesian prior based on the main-sequence mass and radius expected from the2mass j-h colour. the bayesian nature of the analysis allows us to quantifyboth the departure of the host star from the main-sequence mass-radius relationand the probability that the companion radius is less than 1.5 jupiter radii.when augmented by direct light curve analyses that detect binaries with unequalprimary and secondary eclipses, and objects with aperture blends that areresolved by superwasp, we find that only 13 of the original 67 stars, includingthe three known planets in the sample, would qualify for follow-up. thissuggests that planet discovery "hit rates" better than one-in-five should beachievable. in addition, the stellar binaries that qualify are likely to haveastrophysically interesting stellar or sub-stellar secondaries.

1011.2690	possible detection of phase changes from the non-transiting planet hd  46375b by corot	the present work deals with the detection of phase changes in an exoplanetarysystem. hd 46375 is a solar analog known to host a non-transiting saturn-massexoplanet with a 3.0236 day period. it was observed by the corot satellite for34 days during the fall of 2008. we attempt to identify at optical wavelengths,the changing phases of the planet as it orbits its star. we then try to improvethe star model by means of a seismic analysis of the same light curve and theuse of ground-based spectropolarimetric observations. the data analysis relieson the fourier spectrum and the folding of the time series. we find evidence ofa sinusoidal signal compatible in terms of both amplitude and phase with lightreflected by the planet. its relative amplitude is delta fp/f* = [13.0, 26.8]ppm, implying an albedo a=[0.16, 0.33] or a dayside visible brightnesstemperature tb ~ [1880,2030] k by assuming a radius r=1.1 r_jup and aninclination i=45 deg. its orbital phase differs from that of theradial-velocity signal by at most 2 sigma_rv. however, the tiny planetarysignal is strongly blended by another signal, which we attribute to a telluricsignal with a 1 day period. we show that this signal is suppressed, but noteliminated, when using the time series for hd 46179 from the same corot run asa reference. this detection of reflected light from a non-transiting planetshould be confirmable with a longer corot observation of the same field. in anycase, it demonstrates that non-transiting planets can be characterized usingultra-precise photometric lightcurves with present-day observations by corotand kepler. the combined detection of solar-type oscillations on the sametargets (gaulme et al. 2010a) highlights the overlap between exoplanetaryscience and asteroseismology and shows the high potential of a mission such asplato.

1109.3251	a gaussian process framework for modelling instrumental systematics:  application to transmission spectroscopy	transmission spectroscopy, which consists of measuring thewavelength-dependent absorption of starlight by a planet's atmosphere during atransit, is a powerful probe of atmospheric composition. however, the expectedsignal is typically orders of magnitude smaller than instrumental systematics,and the results are crucially dependent on the treatment of the latter. in thispaper, we propose a new method to infer transit parameters in the presence ofsystematic noise using gaussian processes, a technique widely used in themachine learning community for bayesian regression and classification problems.our method makes use of auxiliary information about the state of theinstrument, but does so in a non-parametric manner, without imposing a specificdependence of the systematics on the instrumental parameters, and naturallyallows for the correlated nature of the noise. we give an example applicationof the method to archival nicmos transmission spectroscopy of the hot jupiterhd 189733, which goes some way towards reconciling the controversy surroundingthis dataset in the literature. finally, we provide an appendix giving ageneral introduction to gaussian processes for regression, in order toencourage their application to a wider range of problems.

1112.1035	transiting exoplanets from the corot space mission xxi. corot-19b: a low  density planet orbiting an old inactive f9v-star	observations of transiting extrasolar planets are of key importance to ourunderstanding of planets because their mass, radius, and mass density can bedetermined. the corot space mission allows us to achieve a very highphotometric accuracy. by combining corot data with high-precision radialvelocity measurements, we derive precise planetary radii and masses. we reportthe discovery of corot-19b, a gas-giant planet transiting an old, inactivef9v-type star with a period of four days. after excluding alternative physicalconfigurations mimicking a planetary transit signal, we determine the radiusand mass of the planet by combining corot photometry with high-resolutionspectroscopy obtained with the echelle spectrographs sophie, harps, fies, andsandiford. to improve the precision of its ephemeris and the epoch, we observedadditional transits with the trappist and euler telescopes. using harps spectraobtained during the transit, we then determine the projected angle between thespin of the star and the orbit of the planet. we find that the host star ofcorot-19b is an inactive f9v-type star close to the end of its main-sequencelife. the host star has a mass m*=1.21+/-0.05 msun and radius r*=1.65+/-0.04rsun. the planet has a mass of mp=1.11+/-0.06 mjup and radius of rp=1.29+/-0.03rjup. the resulting bulk density is only rho=0.71+/-0.06 gcm-3, which is muchlower than that for jupiter. the exoplanet corot-19b is an example of a giantplanet of almost the same mass as jupiter but a 30% larger radius.

1201.6573	probing the haze in the atmosphere of hd 189733b with hst/wfc3  transmission spectroscopy	we present hubble space telescope near-infrared transmission spectroscopy ofthe transiting exoplanet hd 189733b, using wide field camera 3. this consistsof time-series spectra of two transits, used to measure the wavelengthdependence of the planetary radius. these observations aim to test whether therayleigh scattering haze detected at optical wavelengths extends into thenear-infrared, or if it becomes transparent leaving molecular features todominate the transmission spectrum. due to saturation and non-linearityaffecting the brightest (central) pixels of the spectrum, light curves wereextracted from the blue and red ends of the spectra only, corresponding towavelength ranges of 1.099-1.168 um and 1.521-1.693 um, respectively, for thefirst visit, and 1.082-1.128 um and 1.514-1.671 um for the second. the lightcurves were fitted using a gaussian process model to account for instrumentalsystematics whilst simultaneously fitting for the transit parameters. thisgives values of the planet-to-star radius ratio for the blue and red lightcurves of 0.15650\pm0.00048 and 0.15634\pm0.00032, respectively, for visit oneand 0.15716\pm0.00078 and 0.15630\pm0.00037 for visit 2 (using a quadratic limbdarkening law). the planet-to-star radius ratios measured in both visits areconsistent, and we see no evidence for the drop in absorption expected if thehaze that is observed in the optical becomes transparent in the infrared. thistentatively suggests that the haze dominates the transmission spectrum of hd189733b into near-infrared wavelengths, although more robust observations arerequired to provide conclusive evidence.

1210.4163	the prevalence of dust on the exoplanet hd 189733b from hubble and  spitzer observations	the hot jupiter hd189733b is the most extensively observed exoplanet. itsatmosphere has been detected and characterised in transmission and eclipsespectroscopy, and its phase curve measured at several wavelengths. this paperbrings together results of our campaign to obtain the complete transmissionspectrum of the atmosphere of this planet from uv to ir with hst, using stis,acs and wfc3. we provide a new tabulation of the transmission spectrum acrossthe entire visible and ir range. the radius ratio in each wavelength band wasrederived to ensure a consistent treatment of the bulk transit parameters andstellar limb-darkening. special care was taken to correct for, and deriverealistic estimates of the uncertainties due to, both occulted and unoccultedstar spots. the combined spectrum is very different from the predictions ofcloud-free models: it is dominated by rayleigh scattering over the wholevisible and near infrared range, the only detected features being narrow na andk lines. we interpret this as the signature of a haze of condensate grainsextending over at least 5 scale heights. we show that a dust-dominatedatmosphere could also explain several puzzling features of the emissionspectrum and phase curves, including the large amplitude of the phase curve at3.6um, the small hot-spot longitude shift and the hot mid-infrared emissionspectrum. we discuss possible compositions and derive some first-orderestimates for the properties of the putative condensate haze/clouds. we finishby speculating that the dichotomy between the two observationally definedclasses of hot jupiter atmospheres, of which hd189733b and hd209458b are theprototypes, might not be whether they possess a temperature inversion, butwhether they are clear or dusty. we also consider the possibility of acontinuum of cloud properties between hot jupiters, young jupiters and l-typebrown dwarfs.

1307.2083	an hst optical to near-ir transmission spectrum of the hot jupiter  wasp-19b: detection of atmospheric water and likely absence of tio	we measure the transmission spectrum of wasp-19b from 3 transits usinglow-resolution optical spectroscopy from the hst space telescope imagingspectrograph (stis). the stis spectra cover a wavelength range of 0.29-1.03microns with resolving power r=500. the optical data are combined with archivalnear-ir data from the hst wide field camera 3 (wfc3) g141 grism, covering thewavelength range 1.087-1.687 micron, with resolving power r=130. we obtain thetransmission spectrum from 0.53-1.687 microns with s/n levels between 3000 and11,000 in 0.1 micron bins. wasp-19 is a very active star, with optical stellarflux varying by a few per cent over time. we correct the transit light curvesfor the effects of stellar activity using ground-based activity monitoring withthe cerro tololo inter-american observatory (ctio). while we were not able toconstruct a transmission spectrum using the blue optical data due to thepresence of large occulted star spots, we were able to use the spot crossingsto help constrain the mean stellar spot temperature. to search for predictedfeatures in the hot-jupiter atmosphere, we also define spectral indices fordifferential radius measurements to specifically search for the presence of tioand alkali line features. our measurements rule out tio features predicted fora planet of wasp-19b's equilibrium temperature (2050 k) in the transmissionspectrum at the 2.7-2.9 sigma confidence level, depending on atmospheric modelformalism. the wfc3 transmission spectrum shows strong absorption features dueto the presence of h2o, which is detected at the 4 sigma confidence levelbetween 1.1 and 1.4 microns. the results indicate that wasp-19b is a planetwith no or low levels of tio and without a high c/o ratio. the lack ofobservable tio features are possibly due to rainout, breakdown from stellaractivity or the presence of other absorbers in the optical.

1308.3644	astrophysically robust systematics removal using variational inference:  application to the first month of kepler data	space-based transit search missions such as kepler are collecting largenumbers of stellar light curves of unprecedented photometric precision and timecoverage. however, before this scientific goldmine can be exploited fully, thedata must be cleaned of instrumental artefacts. we present a new method tocorrect common-mode systematics in large ensembles of very high precision lightcurves. it is based on a bayesian linear basis model and uses shrinkage priorsfor robustness, variational inference for speed, and a de-noising step based onempirical mode decomposition to prevent the introduction of spurious noise intothe corrected light curves. after demonstrating the performance of our methodon a synthetic dataset, we apply it to the first month of kepler data. wecompare the results, which are publicly available, to the output of the keplerpipeline's pre-search data conditioning, and show that the two generally givesimilar results, but the light curves corrected using our approach have lowerscatter, on average, on both long and short timescales. we finish by discussingsome limitations of our method and outlining some avenues for furtherdevelopment. the trend-corrected data produced by our approach are publiclyavailable.

1309.5261	hst hot jupiter transmission spectral survey: evidence for aerosols and  lack of tio in the atmosphere of wasp-12b	we present hst optical transmission spectra of the transiting hot jupiterwasp-12b, taken with the stis instrument. from the transmission spectra, we areable to decisively rule out prominent absorption by tio in the exoplanet'satmosphere. strong pressure-broadened na and k absorption signatures are alsoexcluded, as are significant metal-hydride features. we compare our combinedbroadband spectrum to a wide variety of existing aerosol-free atmosphericmodels, though none are satisfactory fits. however, we do find that the fulltransmission spectrum can be described by models which include significantopacity from aerosols: including rayleigh scattering, mie scattering, tholinhaze, and settling dust profiles. the transmission spectrum follows aneffective extinction cross section with a power-law of index alpha, with theslope of the transmission spectrum constraining the quantity alphat =-3528+/-660 k, where t is the atmospheric temperature. rayleigh scattering(alpha=-4) is among the best fitting models, though requires low terminatortemperatures near 900 k. sub-micron size aerosol particles can provide equallygood fits to the entire transmission spectrum for a wide range of temperatures,and we explore corundum as a plausible dust aerosol. the presence ofatmospheric aerosols also helps to explain the modestly bright albedo impliedby spitzer observations, as well as the near black body nature of the emissionspectrum. ti-bearing condensates on the cooler night-side is the most naturalexplanation for the overall lack of tio signatures in wasp-12b, indicating theday/night cold-trap is an important effect for very hot jupiters. these findingindicate that aerosols can play a significant atmospheric role for the entirewide range of hot-jupiter atmospheres, potentially affecting their overallspectrum and energy balance.(abridged)

'white' light curves and 29 'spectral' lightcurves were extracted for each transit and analysed to refine the systemparameters and produce transmission spectra from 520-930nm in ~14nm bins. thelight curves contain time-varying white noise as well as time-correlated noise,and we used a gaussian process model to fit this complex noise model. commonmode corrections derived from the white light curve fits were applied to thespectral light curves which significantly improved our precision, reachingtypical uncertainties in the transit depth of ~2x10^-4, corresponding to abouthalf a pressure scale height. the low resolution transmission spectra areconsistent with a featureless model, and we can confidently rule out broadfeatures larger than about one scale height. the absence of na/k wings orprominent tio/vo features is most easily explained by grey absorption fromclouds in the upper atmosphere, masking the spectral features. however, wecannot confidently rule out clear atmosphere models with low abundances (~10^-3solar) of tio, vo or even metal hydrides masking the na and k wings. a smallerscale height or ionisation could also contribute to muted spectral features,but alone are unable to to account for the absence of features reported here.

1410.7611	hst hot-jupiter transmission spectral survey: detection of potassium in  wasp-31b along with a cloud deck and rayleigh scattering	we present hubble space telescope optical and near-ir transmission spectra ofthe transiting hot-jupiter wasp-31b. the spectrum covers 0.3-1.7 $\mu$m at aresolution $r\sim$70, which we combine with spitzer photometry to cover thefull-optical to ir. the spectrum is dominated by a cloud-deck with a flattransmission spectrum which is apparent at wavelengths $&gt;0.52\mu$m. the clouddeck is present at high altitudes and low pressures, as it covers the majorityof the expected optical na line and near-ir h$_2$o features. while na iabsorption is not clearly identified, the resulting spectrum does show a verystrong potassium feature detected at the 4.2-$\sigma$ confidence level.broadened alkali wings are not detected, indicating pressures below $\sim$10mbar. the lack of na and strong k is the first indication of a sub-solar na/kabundance ratio in a planetary atmosphere (ln[na/k]$=-3.3\pm2.8$), which couldpotentially be explained by na condensation on the planet's night side, orprimordial abundance variations. a strong rayleigh scattering signature isdetected at short wavelengths, with a 4-$\sigma$ significant slope. twodistinct aerosol size populations can explain the spectra, with a smallersub-micron size grain population reaching high altitudes producing a bluerayleigh scattering signature on top of a larger, lower-lying populationresponsible for the flat cloud deck at longer wavelengths. we estimate that theatmospheric circulation is sufficiently strong to mix micron size particlesupward to the required 1-10 mbar pressures, necessary to explain the clouddeck. these results further confirm the importance of clouds in hot-jupiters,which can potentially dominate the overall spectra and may alter the abundancesof key gaseous species.

1504.04029	testing the recovery of stellar rotation signals from kepler light  curves using a blind hare-and-hounds exercise	we present the results of a blind exercise to test the recoverability ofstellar rotation and differential rotation in kepler light curves. thesimulated light curves lasted 1000 days and included activity cycles, sun-likebutterfly patterns, differential rotation and spot evolution. the range ofrotation periods, activity levels and spot lifetime were chosen to berepresentative of the kepler data of solar like stars. of the 1000 simulatedlight curves, 770 were injected into actual quiescent kepler light curves tosimulate kepler noise. the test also included five 1000-day segments of thesun's total irradiance variations at different points in the sun's activitycycle.  five teams took part in the blind exercise, plus two teams who participatedafter the content of the light curves had been released. the methods usedincluded lomb-scargle periodograms and variants thereof, auto-correlationfunction, and wavelet-based analyses, plus spot modelling to search fordifferential rotation. the results show that the `overall' period is wellrecovered for stars exhibiting low and moderate activity levels. most teamsreported values within 10% of the true value in 70% of the cases. there was,however, little correlation between the reported and simulated values of thedifferential rotation shear, suggesting that differential rotation studiesbased on full-disk light curves alone need to be treated with caution, at leastfor solar-type stars.  the simulated light curves and associated parameters are available online forthe community to test their own methods.

1504.07065	the doubly eclipsing quintuple low-mass star system 1swasp  j093010.78+533859.5	our discovery of 1swasp j093010.78+533859.5 as a probable doubly eclipsingquadruple system containing a contact binary with p~0.23 d and a detachedbinary with p~1.31 d was announced in 2013. subsequently koo et al. confirmedthe detached binary spectroscopically and identified a fifth set of staticspectral lines at its location, corresponding to a further non-eclipsingcomponent of the system. here we present new spectroscopic and photometricobservations, allowing confirmation of the contact binary and improvedmodelling of all four eclipsing components. the detached binary is found tocontain components of masses 0.837(8) and 0.674(7) m_sol, with radii of0.832(18) and 0.669(18) r_sol and effective temperatures of 5185(-20,+25) and4325(-15,+20) k respectively, the contact system has masses 0.86(2) and0.341(11) m_sol, radii of 0.79(4) and 0.52(5) r_sol respectively, and a commont_eff of 4700(50) k. the fifth star is of similar temperature and spectral typeto the primaries in the two binaries. long-term photometric observationsindicate the presence of a spot on one component of the detached binary, movingat an apparent rate of approximately one rotation every two years. bothbinaries have consistent system velocities around -11 to -12 km/s, which matchthe average radial velocity of the fifth star, consistent distance estimatesfor both subsystems of d=78(3) and d=73(4) pc are also found, and (with somefurther assumptions) of d=83(9) pc for the fifth star. these findings stronglysupport the claim that both binaries (and very probably all five stars) aregravitationally bound in a single system. the consistent angles of inclinationfound for the two binaries (88.2(3) and 86(4) degrees) may also indicate thatthey originally formed by fragmentation (~9-10 gyr ago) from a singleprotostellar disk and subsequently remained in the same orbital plane.

astro-ph;0209179	a modified version of the gregory-loredo method for bayesian periodic  signal detection	the detection of planetary transits in stellar photometric light-curves ispoised to become the main method for finding substantial numbers of terrestrialplanets. the french-european mission corot (foreseen for launch in 2005) willperform the first search on a limited number of stars, and larger missionseddington (from esa) and kepler (from nasa) are planned for launch in 2007.transit signals from terrestrial planets are small (delta_f/f approx 10^{-4}),short (delta_t approx 10 hours) dips, which repeat with periodicity of a fewmonths, in time series lasting up to a few years. the reliable and automateddetection of such signals in large numbers of light curves affected bydifferent sources of noise is a statistical and computational challenge. wepresent a novel algorithm based on a bayesian approach. the algorithm is basedon the gregory-loredo method originally developed for the detection of pulsarsin x-ray data. in the present paper the algorithm is presented, and itsperformance on simulated data sets dominated by photon noise is explored. in anupcoming paper the influence of additional noise sources (such as stellaractivity) will be discussed.

astro-ph;0310381	characterising stellar micro-variability for planetary transit searches	(abridged) a method for simulating light curves containing stellarmicro-variability for a range of spectral types and ages, based onparameter-by-parameter scaling of a multi-component fit to the solar irradiancepower spectrum (from virgo/pmo6 data), and scaling laws derived from groundbased observations of various stellar samples, is presented.  we observe a correlation in the sun between the amplitude of the powerspectrum on weeks timescales and the bbso ca ii k-line index of chromosphericactivity. on the basis of this evidence, the chromospheric activity level,predicted from rotation period and b-v colour estimates according to therelationship first introduced by noyes(1983) and noyes et al. (1984), is usedto predict the variability power on weeks time scale. the rotation period isestimated on the basis of a fit to the distribution of rotation period versus$b-v$ observed in the hyades and the skumanich (1972) spin-down law. thecharacteristic timescale of the variability is also scaled according to therotation period.  we use this model to estimate the impact of the target star type and age onthe detection capability of missions such as eddington and kepler. k stars arefound to be the most promising targets, while the performance dropssignificantly for stars earlier than g and younger than 2.0 gyr. simulationsalso show that \emph{eddington} should detect terrestrial planets orbitingsolar-age stars in most of the habitable zone for g2 types and all of it for k0and k5 types.

astro-ph;0401393	practical planet prospecting	(abridged) space missions to search for exo-planets via the transit method,such as corot, eddington and kepler, will need to address problems associatedwith the automated and efficient detection of planetary transits in lightcurves affected by a variety of noise sources, including stellar variabilility.starting from a general purpose maximum likelihood approach we discuss thelinks between a variety of period and transit finding methods. the naturalendpoint of this hierarchy of methods is shown to be a fast, robust andstatistically efficient least-squares algorithm based on box-shaped transits.  this approach is predicated on the assumption of periodic transits hidden inrandom noise, usually assumed to be superposed on a flat continuum with regularcontinuous sampling. we next show how to generalise the transit finding methodto the more realistic scenario where complex stellar (micro) variability,irregular sampling and long gaps in the data are all present. tests of thismethodology on simulated eddington light curves including realistic stellarmicro-variability, irregular sampling and data gaps, are used to quantify theperformance. in the case where transit durations are short compared to thedominant timescales for stellar variability and data record segments, it ispossible to decouple the transit signal from the remainder.  we conclude that even with realistic contamination from stellar variability,irregular sampling, and gaps in the data record, it is still possible to detecttransiting planets with an efficiency close to the idealised theoretical bound.in particular, space missions have the potential to approach the regime ofdetecting earth-like planets around g2v-type stars.

astro-ph;0609688	wasp-1b and wasp-2b: two new transiting exoplanets detected with  superwasp and sophie	we have detected low-amplitude radial-velocity variations in two stars,usno-b1.0 1219-0005465 (gsc 02265-00107 = wasp-1) and usno-b1.0 0964-0543604(gsc 00522-01199 = wasp-2). both stars were identified as being likely hoststars of transiting exoplanets in the 2004 superwasp wide-field transit survey.using the newly-commissioned radial-velocity spectrograph sophie at theobservatoire de haute-provence, we found that both objects exhibit reflexorbital radial-velocity variations with amplitudes characteristic ofplanetary-mass companions and in-phase with the photometric orbits.line-bisector studies rule out faint blended binaries as the cause of eitherthe radial-velocity variations or the transits. we perform preliminary spectralanalyses of the host stars, which together with their radial-velocityvariations and fits to the transit light curves, yield estimates of theplanetary masses and radii. wasp-1b and wasp-2b have orbital periods of 2.52and 2.15 days respectively. given mass estimates for their f7v and k1vprimaries we derive planet masses 0.80 to 0.98 and 0.81 to 0.95 times that ofjupiter respectively. wasp-1b appears to have an inflated radius of at least1.33 r_jup, whereas wasp-2b has a radius in the range 0.65 to 1.26 r_jup.

0811.0461	magnetic activity in the photosphere of corot-exo-2a. active longitudes  and short-term spot cycle in a young sun-like star	the space experiment corot has recently detected transits by a hot jupiteracross the disc of an active g7v star (corot-exo-2a) that can be considered asa good proxy for the sun at an age of approximately 0.5 gyr. we present a spotmodelling of the optical variability of the star during 142 days ofuninterrupted observations performed by corot with unprecedented photometricprecision. we apply spot modelling approaches previously tested in the case ofthe sun by modelling total solar irradiance variations. to model the lightcurve of corot-exo-2a, we take into account both the photometric effects ofcool spots as well as those of solar-like faculae, adopting solar analogy. twoactive longitudes initially on opposite hemispheres are found on thephotosphere of corot-exo-2a with a rotation period of 4.522 $\pm$ 0.024 days.their separation changes by approximately 80 degrees during the time span ofthe observations. from this variation, a relative amplitude of the surfacedifferential rotation lower than about 1 percent is estimated. individual spotsform within the active longitudes and show an angular velocity about 1 percentsmaller than that of the longitude pattern. the total spotted area shows acyclic oscillation with a period of 28.9 $\pm$ 4.3 days, which is close to 10times the synodic period of the planet as seen by the rotating activelongitudes. the implications of such results for the internal rotation ofcorot-exo-2a are discussed on the basis of solar analogy. a possible magneticstar-planet interaction is suggested by the cyclic variation of the spottedarea. alternatively, the 28.9-d cycle may be related to rossby-type wavespropagating in the subphotospheric layers of the star.

0812.1667	modelling solar-like variability for the detection of earth-like  planetary transits. ii) performance of the three-spot modelling, harmonic  function fitting, iterative non-linear filtering and sliding boxcar filtering	we present a comparison of four methods of filtering solar-like variabilityto increase the efficiency of detection of earth-like planetary transits bymeans of box-shaped transit finder algorithms. two of these filtering methodsare the harmonic fitting method and the iterative non-linear filter that,coupled respectively with the box least-square (bls) and box maximum-likelihoodalgorithms, demonstrated the best performance during the first detection blindtest organized inside the corot consortium. the third method, the 3-spot model,is a simplified physical model of sun-like variability and the fourth is asimple sliding boxcar filter. we apply a monte carlo approach by simulating alarge number of 150-day light curves (as for corot long runs) for differentplanetary radii, orbital periods, epochs of the first transit and standarddeviations of the photon shot noise. stellar variability is given by the totalsolar irradiance variations as observed close to the maximum of solar cycle 23.after filtering solar variability, transits are searched for by means of thebls algorithm. we find that the iterative non-linear filter is the best methodto filter light curves of solar-like stars when a suitable window can bechosen. as the performance of this filter depends critically on the length ofits window, we point out that the window must be as long as possible, accordingto the magnetic activity level of the star. we show an automatic method tochoose the extension of the filter window from the power spectrum of the lightcurves. the iterative non-linear filter, when used with a suitable choice ofits window, has a better performance than more complicated and computationallyintensive methods of fitting solar-like variability, like the 200-harmonicfitting or the 3-spot model.
