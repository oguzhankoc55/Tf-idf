0901.4093	the physical properties of four ~600k t dwarfs	we present spitzer 7.6-14.5um spectra of ulas j003402.77-005206.7 and ulasj133553.45+113005.2, two t9 dwarfs with the latest spectral types currentlyknown. we fit synthetic spectra and photometry to the near- throughmid-infrared energy distributions of these dwarfs and that of the t8 dwarf2mass j09393548-2448279. we also analyse near-infrared data for another t9,cfbd j005910.82-011401.3. we find that the ratio of the mid- to near-infraredfluxes is very sensitive to effective temperature at these low temperatures,and that the 2.2 and 4.5um fluxes are sensitive to metallicity and gravity;there is a degeneracy between these parameters. the 4.5 and 10um fluxes arealso sensitive to vertical transport of gas through the atmosphere, which wefind to be significant for these dwarfs. the full near- through mid-infraredspectral energy distribution allows us to constrain the effective temperature(k)/gravity (m/s2)/metallicity ([m/h] dex) of ulas j0034-00 and ulas j1335+11to 550-600/ 100-300/ 0.0-0.3 and 500-550/ 100-300/ 0.0-0.3, respectively. thesefits imply low masses and young ages for the dwarfs of 5-20 m(jup) and 0.1-2gyr. the fits to 2mass j0939-24 are in good agreement with the measureddistance, the observational data, and the earlier t8 near-infrared spectraltype if it is a slightly metal-poor 4-10 gyr old system consisting of a 500 and700k, ~25 and ~40 m(jup), pair, although it is also possible that it is anidentical pair of 600k, 30 m(jup), dwarfs. as no mid-infrared data areavailable for cfbd j0059-01 its properties are less well constrained;nevertheless it appears to be a 550-600k dwarf with g= 300-2000 m/s2 and [m/h]=0-0.3 dex. these properties correspond to mass and age ranges of 10-50 m(jup)and 0.5-10 gyr for this dwarf.

0903.1045	metal-rich carbon stars in the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we present spectroscopic observations from the {\it spitzer space telescope}of six carbon-rich agb stars in the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (sgrdsph) and two foreground galactic carbon stars. the band strengths of theobserved c$_2$h$_2$ and sic features are very similar to those observed ingalactic agb stars. the metallicities are estimated from an empirical relationbetween the acetylene optical depth and the strength of the sic feature. themetallicities are higher than those of the lmc, and close to galactic values.while the high metallicity could imply an age of around 1 gyr, for the dustyagb stars, the pulsation periods suggest ages in excess of 2 or 3 gyr. we fitthe spectra of the observed stars using the dusty radiative transfer model anddetermine their dust mass-loss rates to be in the range 1.0--3.3$\times 10^{-8}$m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. the two galactic foreground carbon-rich agb stars arelocated at the far side of the solar circle, beyond the galactic centre. one ofthese two stars show the strongest sic feature in our present local groupsample.

0903.1123	the global gas and dust budget of the large magellanic cloud: agb stars  and supernovae, and the impact on the ism evolution	we report on an analysis of the gas and dust budget in the the interstellarmedium (ism) of the large magellanic cloud (lmc). recent observations from thespitzer space telescope enable us to study the mid-infrared dust excess ofasymptotic giant branch (agb) stars in the lmc. this is the first time we canquantitatively assess the gas and dust input from agb stars over a completegalaxy, fully based on observations. the integrated mass-loss rate over allintermediate and high mass-loss rate carbon-rich agb candidates in the lmc is8.5x10^-3 solar mass per year, up to 2.1x10^-2 solar mass per year. this numbercould be increased up to 2.7x10^-2 solar mass per year, if oxygen-rich starsare included. this is overall consistent with theoretical expectations,considering the star formation rate when these low- and intermediate-mass starswhere formed, and the initial mass functions. agb stars are one of the mostimportant gas sources in the lmc, with supernovae (sne), which produces about2-4x10^-2 solar mass per year. at the moment, the star formation rate exceedsthe gas feedback from agb stars and sne in the lmc, and the current starformation depends on gas already present in the ism. this suggests that as thegas in the ism is exhausted, the star formation rate will eventually decline inthe lmc, unless gas is supplied externally. our estimates suggest `a missingdust-mass problem' in the lmc, which is similarly found in high-z galaxies: theaccumulated dust mass from agb stars and possibly sne over the dust life time(400--800 myrs) is significant less than the dust mass in the ism. another dustsource is required, possibly related to star-forming regions.

0905.1124	unusual dust emission from planetary nebulae in the magellanic clouds	we present a spitzer space telescope spectroscopic study of a sample of 25planetary nebulae in the magellanic clouds. the low-resolution modules are usedto analyze the dust features present in the infrared spectra. this studycomplements a previous work by the same authors where the same sample wasanalyzed in terms of neon and sulfur abundances. over half of the objects (14)show emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, typical of carbon-rich dustenvironments. we compare the hydrocarbon emission in our objects to those ofgalactic hii regions and planetary nebulae, and lmc/smc hii regions. amorphoussilicates are seen in just two objects, enforcing the now well-known-fact thatoxygen-rich dust is less common at low metallicities. besides these commonfeatures, some planetary nebulae show very unusual dust. nine objects show astrong silicon carbide feature at 11um and twelve of them show magnesiumsulfide emission starting at 25um. the high percentage of spectra with siliconcarbide in the magellanic clouds is not common. two objects show a broad bandwhich may be attributed to hydrogenated amorphous carbon and weaklow-excitation atomic lines. it is likely that these nebulae are very young.the spectra of the remaining eight nebulae are dominated by the emission offine-structure lines with a weak continuum due to thermal emission of dust,although in a few cases the s/n in the spectra is low, and weak dust featuresmay not have been detected.

0908.2812	a spitzer high resolution mid-infrared spectral atlas of starburst  galaxies	we present an atlas of spitzer/irs high resolution (r~600) 10-37um spectrafor 24 well known starburst galaxies. the spectra are dominated byfine-structure lines, molecular hydrogen lines, and emission bands ofpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. six out of the eight objects with a known agncomponent show emission of the high excitation [nev] line. this line is alsoseen in one other object (ngc4194) with, a priori, no known agn component. inaddition to strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission features in thiswavelength range (11.3, 12.7, 16.4um), the spectra reveal other weakhydrocarbon features at 10.6, 13.5, 14.2um, and a previously unreportedemission feature at 10.75um. an unidentified absorption feature at 13.7um isdetected in many of the starbursts. we use the fine-structure lines to derivethe abundance of neon and sulfur for 14 objects where the hi 7-6 line isdetected. we further use the molecular hydrogen lines to sample the propertiesof the warm molecular gas. several basic diagrams characterizing the propertiesof the sample are also shown. we have combined the spectra of all the purestarburst objects to create a high s/n template, which is available to thecommunity.

0908.3087	luminosities and mass-loss rates of smc and lmc agb stars and red  supergiants	(abridged) dust radiative transfer models are presented for 101 carbon starsand 86 oxygen-rich evolved stars in the magellanic clouds for which 5-35 \mum\{\it spitzer} irs spectra are available. the spectra are complemented withavailable optical and infrared photometry to construct the spectral energydistribution. a minimisation procedure is used to fit luminosity, mass-lossrate and dust temperature at the inner radius. different effective temperaturesand dust content are also considered. periods from the literature and from newogle-iii data are compiled and derived. the o-rich stars are classified inforeground objects, agb stars and red super giants.  for the o-rich stars silicates based on laboratory optical constants arecompared to "astronomical silicates". overall, the grain type by volk &amp; kwok(1988) fit the data best. however, the fit based on laboratory opticalconstants for the grains can be improved by abandoning the small-particlelimit. the influence of grain size, core-mantle grains and porosity areexplored.  relations between mass-loss rates and luminosity and pulsation period arepresented and compared to the predictions of evolutionary models, those byvassiliadis &amp; wood (1993) and their adopted mass-loss recipe, and those basedon a reimers mass-loss law with a scaling of a factor of five. the vassiliadis&amp; wood models describe the data better, although there are also somedeficiencies, in particular to the maximum adopted mass-loss rate.  the ogle-iii data reveal an o-rich star in the smc with a period of 1749days. its absolute magnitude of $m_{\rm bol}= -8.0$ makes it a good candidatefor a super-agb star.

0704.1518	crystalline silicates and dust processing in the protoplanetary disks of  the taurus young cluster	we characterize the crystalline silicate content and spatial distribution ofsmall dust grains in a large sample of protoplanetary disks in thetaurus-auriga young cluster, using spitzer space telescope mid-infraredspectra. in turn we use the results to analyze the evolution of structure andcomposition of these 1-2 myr-old disks around solar- and later-type youngstars, and test the standard models of dust processing which result in theconversion of originally amorphous dust into minerals. we find strong evidenceof evolution of the dust crystalline mass fraction in parallel with that of thestructure of the disks, in the sense that increasing crystalline mass fractionis strongly linked to dust settling to the disk midplane. we also confirm thatthe crystalline silicates are confined to small radii, r &lt; 10 au. however, wesee no significant correlation of crystalline mass fraction with stellar massor luminosity, stellar accretion rate, disk mass, or disk/star mass ratio, aswould be expected in the standard models of dust processing based uponphoto-evaporation and condensation close to the central star,accretion-heating-driven annealing at r &lt; 1 au, or spiral-shock heating at r &lt;10 au, with or without effective radial mixing mechanisms. either anothergrain-crystallizing mechanism dominates over these, or another process must beat work within the disks to erase the correlations they produce. we propose oneof each sort that seem to be worth further investigation, namely x-ray heatingand annealing of dust grains, and modulation of disk structure bygiant-planetary formation and migration.

0910.5624	chemical depletion in the large magellanic cloud: rv tauri stars and the  photospheric feedback from their dusty discs	aims: by studying the photospheric abundances of 4 rv tauri stars in the lmc,we test whether the depletion pattern of refractory elements, seen in similargalactic sources, is also common for extragalactic sources. since thisdepletion process probably only occurs through interaction with a stable disc,we investigate the circumstellar environment of these sources. methods: adetailed photospheric abundance study was performed using high-resolution uvesoptical spectra. to study the circumstellar environment we use photometric datato construct the spectral energy distributions of the stars, and determine thegeometry of the circumstellar environment, whereas low-resolution spitzer-irsinfrared spectra are used to trace its mineralogy. results: our results showthat, also in the lmc, the photospheres of rv tauri stars are commonly affectedby the depletion process, although it can differ significantly in strength fromsource to source. from our detailed disc modelling and mineralogy study, wefind that this process, as in the galaxy, appears closely related to thepresence of a stable keplerian disc. the newly studied extragalactic objectshave similar observational characteristics as galactic post-agb binariessurrounded by a dusty disc, and are therefore also believed to be part of abinary system. one source shows a very small infrared excess, atypical for adisc source, but still has evidence for depletion. we speculate this couldpoint to the presence of a very evolved disc, similar to debris discs seenaround young stellar objects.

0911.0532	ice chemistry in embedded young stellar objects in the large magellanic  cloud	we present spectroscopic observations of a sample of 15 embedded youngstellar objects (ysos) in the large magellanic cloud (lmc). these observationswere obtained with the spitzer infrared spectrograph (irs) as part of thesage-spec legacy program. we analyze the two prominent ice bands in the irsspectral range: the bending mode of co_2 ice at 15.2 micron and the ice bandbetween 5 and 7 micron that includes contributions from the bending mode ofwater ice at 6 micron amongst other ice species. the 5-7 micron band isdifficult to identify in our lmc sample due to the conspicuous presence of pahemission superimposed onto the ice spectra. we identify water ice in thespectra of two sources; the spectrum of one of those sources also exhibits the6.8 micron ice feature attributed to ammonium and methanol. we model the co_2band in detail, using the combination of laboratory ice profiles available inthe literature. we find that a significant fraction (&gt; 50%) of co_2 ice islocked in a water-rich component, consistent with what is observed for galacticsources. the majority of the sources in the lmc also require a pure-co_2contribution to the ice profile, evidence of thermal processing. there is asuggestion that co_2 production might be enhanced in the lmc, but the size ofthe available sample precludes firmer conclusions. we place our results in thecontext of the star formation environment in the lmc.

0911.4376	the low wind expansion velocity of metal-poor carbon stars in the halo  and the sagittarius stream	we report the detection, from observations using the james clerk maxwelltelescope, of co j $=$ 3$\to$ 2 transition lines in six carbon stars, selectedas members of the galactic halo and having similar infrared colors. just onehalo star had been detected in co before this work. infrared observations showthat these stars are red (j-k $&gt;$3), due to the presence of large dustycircumstellar envelopes. radiative transfer models indicates that these starsare losing mass with rather large dust mass-loss rates in the range 1--3.3$\times$$10^{-8}$m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, similar to what can be observed in thegalactic disc. we show that two of these stars are effectively in the halo, oneis likely linked to the stream of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (sgrdsph), and the other three stars certainly belong to the thick disc. the windexpansion velocities of the observed stars are low compared to carbon stars inthe thin disc and are lower for the stars in the halo and the sgr dsph streamthan in the thick disc. we discuss the possibility that the low expansionvelocities result from the low metallicity of the halo carbon stars. thisimplies that metal-poor carbon stars lose mass at a rate similar to metal-richcarbon stars, but with lower expansion velocities, as predicted by recenttheoretical models. this result implies that the current estimates of mass-lossrates from carbon stars in local group galaxies will have to be reconsidered.

1004.1967	when an old star smolders: on the detection of hydrocarbon emission from  s-type agb stars	polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) produce characteristic infraredemission bands that have been observed in a wide range of astrophysicalenvironments, where carbonaceous material is subjected to ultraviolet (uv)radiation. although pahs are expected to form in carbon-rich agb stars, theyhave up to now only been observed in binary systems where a hot companionprovides a hard radiation field. in this letter, we present low-resolutioninfrared spectra of four s-type agb stars, selected from a sample of 90 s-typeagb stars observed with the infrared spectrograph aboard the spitzer satellite.the spectra of these four stars show the typical infrared features of pahmolecules. we confirm the correlation between the temperature of the centralstar and the centroid wavelength of the 7.9 {\mu}m feature, present in a widevariety of stars spanning a temperature range from 3 000 to 12 000 k. three offour sources presented in this paper extend this relation towards lowertemperatures. we argue that the mixture of hydrocarbons we see in these s-starshas a rich aliphatic component. the fourth star, bz cma, deviates from thiscorrelation. based on the similarity with the evolved binary tu tau, we predictthat bz cma has a hot companion as well.

1011.1579	dust at sub-solar metallicity: the case of post-agb stars in the large  magellanic cloud	low- and intermediate-mass stars are one of the important dust sources in theinterstellar medium (ism) of galaxies. the compositions of dust ejected fromthese stars are likely to affect those in the ism. we investigate dust inpost-asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars, which are in a late evolutionaryphase for low- and intermediate-mass stars, and which produce a wide variety ofdust grains. we are particularly targeting post-agb stars in the largemagellanic cloud (lmc), which has about half of the solar metallicity, toinvestigate the effects of sub-solar metallicity on dust compositions.  using the spitzer space telescope, we obtained 5-30 micron spectra of 24post-agb candidates in the lmc. five are c-rich post-agb stars, and thispresentation focuses on spectra of these stars.  we found that rare dust features in the milky way, such as a 21 micronunidentified feature are commonly found in lmc post-agb stars. the 6-8 micronspectra are compared with those of galactic objects. four spectra match thegalactic templates of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) features. however,we found the three objects show 7.85 micron feature which have not found ingalactic post-agb stars. low metallicity conditions definitely affect the dustformation process and compositions.

1011.2786	ice chemistry in massive young stellar objects: the role of metallicity	we present the comparison of the three most important ice constituents(water, co and co2) in the envelopes of massive young stellar objects (ysos),in environments of different metallicities: the galaxy, the large magellaniccloud (lmc) and, for the first time, the small magellanic cloud (smc). wepresent observations of water, co and co2 ice in 4 smc and 3 lmc ysos (obtainedwith spitzer-irs and vlt/isaac). while water and co2 ice are detected in allmagellanic ysos, co ice is not detected in the smc objects. both co and co2 iceabundances are enhanced in the lmc when compared to high-luminosity galacticysos. based on the fact that both species appear to be enhanced in a consistentway, this effect is unlikely to be the result of enhanced co2 production inhotter yso envelopes as previously thought. instead we propose that thisresults from a reduced water column density in the envelopes of lmc ysos, adirect consequence of both the stronger uv radiation field and the reduceddust-to-gas ratio at lower metallicity. in the smc the environmental conditionsare harsher, and we observe a reduction in co2 column density. furthermore, thelow gas-phase co density and higher dust temperature in yso envelopes in thesmc seem to inhibit co freeze-out. the scenario we propose can be tested withfurther observations.

1012.1698	the 9.7 and 18 um silicate absorption profiles towards diffuse and  molecular cloud lines-of-sight	studying the composition of dust in the interstellar medium (ism) is crucialin understanding the cycle of dust in our galaxy. the mid-infrared spectralsignature of amorphous silicates, the most abundant dust species in the ism, isstudied in different lines-of-sight through the galactic plane, thus probingdifferent conditions in the ism. we have analysed 10 spectra from the spitzerarchive, of which 6 lines-of-sight probe diffuse interstellar medium materialand 4 probe molecular cloud material. the 9.7 um silicate absorption featuresin 7 of these spectra were studied in terms of their shape and strength. inaddition, the shape of the 18 um silicate absorption features in 4 of thediffuse sightline spectra were analysed. the 9.7 um silicate absorption bandsin the diffuse sightlines show a strikingly similar band shape. this is alsothe case for all but one of the 18 um silicate absorption bands observed indiffuse lines-of-sight. the 9.7 um bands in the 4 molecular sightlines showsmall variations in shape. these modest variations in the band shape areinconsistent with the interpretation of the large variations in{\tau}_9.7/e(j-k) between diffuse and molecular sightlines in terms of silicategrain growth. instead, we suggest that the large changes in {\tau}_9.7 / e(j-k)must be due to changes in e(j-k).

0709.3199	spitzer space telescope spectral observations of agb stars in the fornax  dwarf spheroidal galaxy	we have observed five carbon-rich agb stars in the fornax dwarf spheroidal(dsph) galaxy, using the infrared spectrometer on board the spitzer spacetelescope. the stars were selected from a near-infrared survey of fornax andinclude the three reddest stars, with presumably the highest mass-loss rates,in that galaxy. such carbon stars probably belong to the intermediate-agepopulation (2-8 gyr old and metallicity of [fe/h] -1) of fornax. the primaryaim of this paper is to investigate mass-loss rate, as a function of luminosityand metallicity, by comparing agb stars in several galaxies with differentmetallicities. the spectra of three stars are fitted with a radiative transfermodel. we find that mass-loss rates of these three stars are 4-7x10^-6 msunyr-1. the other two stars have mass-loss rates below 1.3x10^-6 msun yr-1. wefind no evidence that these rates depend on metallicity, although we do suggestthat the gas-to-dust ratio could be higher than at solar metallicity, in therange 240 to 800. the c2h2 bands are stronger at lower metallicity because ofthe higher c/o ratio. in contrast, the sic fraction is reduced at lowmetallicity, due to low silicon abundance. the total mass-loss rate from allknown carbon-rich agb stars into the interstellar medium of this galaxy is ofthe order of 2x10^-5 msun yr-1. this is much lower than that of the dwarfirregular galaxy wlm, which has a similar visual luminosity and metallicity.the difference is attributed to the younger stellar population of wlm. thesuppressed gas-return rate to the ism accentuates the difference between therelatively gas-rich dwarf irregular and the gas-poor dwarf spheroidal galaxies.our study will be useful to constrain gas and dust recycling processes in lowmetallicity galaxies.

(2008). we present a diagnosticdiagram that will help to identify similar sources based on spitzer/mips andherschel/pacs photometry. the sed of sage1cj053634 is peculiar because it lacksfar-ir emission and a clear stellar counterpart. we find that the sed and their spectrum can be understood as emission originating from the inner ~10 pcaround an accreting black hole. there is no need to invoke emission from thehost galaxy, either from the stars or from the interstellar medium, although apossible early-type host galaxy cannot be excluded based on the sed analysis.the hot dust around the accretion disk gives rise to a continuum, which peaksat 4 um, whereas the strong silicate features may arise from optically thinemission of dusty clouds within ~10 pc around the black hole. the weak pahemission does not appear to be linked to star formation, as star formationtemplates strongly over-predict the measured far-ir flux levels. the sed ofsage1cj053634 is rare in the local universe but may be more common in the moredistant universe. the conspicuous absence of host-galaxy ir emission placeslimits on the far-ir emission arising from the dusty torus alone.

1201.5384	the dust budget of the smc: are agb stars the primary dust source at low  metallicity?	we estimate the total dust input from the cool evolved stars in the smallmagellanic cloud (smc), using the 8 micron excess emission as a proxy for thedust-production rate. we find that asymptotic giant branch (agb) and redsupergiant (rsg) stars produce (8.6-9.5) x 10^7 solar masses per year of dust,depending on the fraction of far-infrared sources that belong to the evolvedstar population (with 10%-50% uncertainty in individual dust-production rates).rsgs contribute the least (&lt;4%), while carbon-rich agb stars (especially theso-called "extreme" agb stars) account for 87%-89% of the total dust input fromcool evolved stars. we also estimate the dust input from hot stars andsupernovae (sne), and find that if sne produce 10^-3 solar masses of dust each,then the total sn dust input and agb input are roughly equivalent. we considerseveral scenarios of sne dust production and destruction and find that theinterstellar medium (ism) dust can be accounted for solely by stellar sourcesif all sne produce dust in the quantities seen around the dustiest examples andif most sne explode in dense regions where much of the ism dust is shieldedfrom the shocks. we find that agb stars contribute only 2.1% of the ism dust.without a net positive contribution from sne to the dust budget, this suggeststhat dust must grow in the ism or be formed by another unknown mechanism.

1202.2290	the spitzer spectroscopic survey of s-type stars	s-type agb stars are thought to be in the transitional phase between m-typeand c-type agb stars. because of their peculiar chemical composition, one mayexpect a strong influence of the stellar c/o ratio on the molecular chemistryand the mineralogy of the circumstellar dust. in this paper, we present a largesample of 87 intrinsic galactic s-type agb stars, observed at infraredwavelengths with the spitzer space telescope, and supplemented withground-based optical data. on the one hand, we derive the stellar parametersfrom the optical spectroscopy and photometry, using a grid of modelatmospheres. on the other, we decompose the infrared spectra to quantify theflux-contributions from the different dust species. finally, we compare theindependently determined stellar parameters and dust properties. for the starswithout significant dust emission, we detect a strict relation between thepresence of sis absorption in the spitzer spectra and the c/o ratio of thestellar atmosphere. these absorption bands can thus be used as an additionaldiagnostic for the c/o ratio. for stars with significant dust emission, wedefine three groups, based on the relative contribution of certain dust speciesto the infrared flux. we find a strong link between group-membership and c/oratio. we show that these groups can be explained by assuming that thedust-condensation can be cut short before silicates are produced, while theremaining free atoms and molecules can then form the observed magnesiumsulfides or the carriers of the unidentified 13 and 20 micron features.finally, we present the detection of emission features attributed to moleculesand dust characteristic to c-type stars, such as molecular sis, hydrocarbonsand magnesium sulfide grains. we show that we often detect magnesium sulfidestogether with molecular sis and we propose that it is formed by a reaction ofsis molecules with mg.

1204.5754	carbon-rich dust production in metal-poor galaxies in the local group	we have observed a sample of 19 carbon stars in the sculptor, carina, fornax,and leo i dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the infrared spectrograph on thespitzer space telescope. the spectra show significant quantities of dust aroundthe carbon stars in sculptor, fornax, and leo i, but little in carina. previouscomparisons of carbon stars with similar pulsation properties in the galaxy andthe magellanic clouds revealed no evidence that metallicity affected theproduction of dust by carbon stars. however, the more metal-poor stars in thecurrent sample appear to be generating less dust. these data extend two knowntrends to lower metallicities. in more metal-poor samples, the sic dustemission weakens, while the acetylene absorption strengthens. the bolometricmagnitudes and infrared spectral properties of the carbon stars in fornax areconsistent with metallicities more similar to carbon stars in the magellanicclouds than in the other dwarf spheroidals in our sample. a study of the carbonbudget in these stars reinforces previous considerations that the dredge-up ofsufficient quantities of carbon from the stellar cores may trigger the finalsuperwind phase, ending a star's lifetime on the asymptotic giant branch.

1206.2451	discovery of a tio emission band in the infrared spectrum of the s star  np aurigae	we report on the discovery of an infrared emission band in the spitzerspectrum of the s-type agb star np aurigae that is caused by tio molecules inthe circumstellar environment. we modelled the observed emission to derive thetemperature of the tio molecules (\approx 600 k), an upper limit on the columndensity (\approx 10^17.25 cm^{-2}) and a lower limit on the spatial extent ofthe layer that contains these molecules. (\approx 4.6 stellar radii). this isthe first time that this tio emission band is observed. a search for similaremission features in the sample of s-type stars yielded two additionalcandidates. however, owing to the additional dust emission, the identificationis less stringent. by comparing the stellar characteristics of np aur to thoseof the other stars in our sample, we find that all stars with tio emission showlarge-amplitude pulsations, s-process enrichment, and a low c/o ratio. thesecharacteristics might be necessary requirements for a star to show tio inemission, but they are not sufficient.

1208.4950	on the metallicity dependence of crystalline silicates in oxygen-rich  asymptotic giant branch stars and red supergiants	we investigate the occurrence of crystalline silicates in oxygen-rich evolvedstars across a range of metallicities and mass-loss rates. it has beensuggested that the crystalline silicate feature strength increases withincreasing mass-loss rate, implying a correlation between lattice structure andwind density. to test this, we analyse spitzer irs and infrared spaceobservatory sws spectra of 217 oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch stars and 98red supergiants in the milky way, the large and small magellanic clouds andgalactic globular clusters. these encompass a range of spectral morphologiesfrom the spectrally-rich which exhibit a wealth of crystalline and amorphoussilicate features to 'naked' (dust-free) stars. we combine spectroscopic andphotometric observations with the grams grid of radiative transfer models toderive (dust) mass-loss rates and temperature. we then measure the strength ofthe crystalline silicate bands at 23, 28 and 33 microns. we detect crystallinesilicates in stars with dust mass-loss rates which span over 3 dex, down torates of ~10^-9 solar masses/year. detections of crystalline silicates are moreprevalent in higher mass-loss rate objects, though the highest mass-loss rateobjects do not show the 23-micron feature, possibly due to the low temperatureof the forsterite grains or it may indicate that the 23-micron band is goinginto absorption due to high column density. furthermore, we detect a change inthe crystalline silicate mineralogy with metallicity, with enstatite seenincreasingly at low metallicity.

1209.1023	oxygen-rich dust production in ic 10	we report the detection of oxygen-rich circumstellar envelopes in stars ofthe nearby (700 kpc) starburst galaxy ic 10. the star formation history and thechemical environment of this galaxy makes it an ideal target to observe dustproduction by high-mass stars in a low-metallicity environment. the goal ofthis study is to identify oxygen-rich stars in ic 10 and to constrain theirnature between asymptotic giant branch stars (agbs), red supergiants (rsgs),and other infrared bright sources. we examine the mass-loss rate of the starsand compare to results obtained for the magellanic clouds. our objectives areto (1) assess whether rsgs can be significant dust producers in ic 10, and (2),solve the discrepancy between the star formation history of ic 10 and therelatively low number of rsgs detected in the optical. we search for silicatedust in emission by using the spectral map observed with the infraredspectrograph on board the spitzer space telescope. the optical (ubvri) andinfrared (jhk, spitzer/irac and spitzer/mips) photometry is used to assert themembership of the stars to ic 10 and disentangle between agbs and rsgs.radiative models are used to infer mass-loss rates and stellar luminosities.the luminosity and colors of at least 9 silicate emission sources areconsistent with stars within ic 10. furthermore, the photometry of 2 of thesesources is consistent with rsgs. we derive dust mass-loss rates similar to thevalues found in the magellanic clouds. accounting for the sample completeness,rsgs are not important contributors to the dust mass budget in ic 10.

1210.5193	early-stage young stellar objects in the small magellanic cloud	we present new observations of 34 yso candidates in the smc. the anchor ofthe analysis is a set of spitzer-irs spectra, supplemented by groundbased 3-5micron spectra, spitzer and nir photometry, optical spectroscopy and radiodata. the sources' seds and spectral indices are consistent with embedded ysos;prominent silicate absorption is observed in the spectra of at least tensources, silicate emission is observed towards four sources. pah emission isdetected towards all but two sources. based on band ratios (in particular thestrength of the 11.3 micron and the weakness of the 8.6 micron bands) pahemission towards smc ysos is dominated by predominantly small neutral grains.ice absorption is observed towards fourteen sources in the smc. the comparisonof h2o and co2 ice column densities for smc, lmc and galactic samples suggeststhat there is a significant h2o column density threshold for the detection ofco2 ice. this supports the scenario proposed by oliveira et al. (2011), wherethe reduced shielding in metal-poor environments depletes the h2o columndensity in the outer regions of the yso envelopes. no co ice is detectedtowards the smc sources. emission due to pure-rotational 0-0 transitions of h2is detected towards the majority of smc sources, allowing us to estimaterotational temperatures and column densities. all but one source arespectroscopically confirmed as smc ysos. of the 33 ysos identified in the smc,30 sources populate different stages of massive stellar evolution. theremaining three sources are classified as intermediate-mass ysos with a thickdusty disc and a tenuous envelope still present. we propose one of the sourcesis a d-type symbiotic system, based on the presence of raman, h and he emissionlines in the optical spectrum, and silicate emission in the irs-spectrum. thiswould be the first dust-rich symbiotic system identified in the smc.

1305.4954	dusty ob stars in the small magellanic cloud - ii: extragalactic disks  or examples of the pleiades phenomenon?	we use mid-infrared spitzer spectroscopy and far-infrared herschel photometryfor a sample of twenty main sequence o9--b2 stars in the small magellanic cloud(smc) with strong 24 micron excesses to investigate the origin of the mid-iremission. either debris disks around the stars or illuminated patches of denseinterstellar medium (ism) can cause such mid-ir emission. in a companion paper,paper i, we use optical spectroscopy to show that it is unlikely for any ofthese sources to be classical be stars or herbig ae/be stars. we focus ouranalysis on debris disks and cirrus hot spots. we find three out of twentystars to be significantly extended in the mid-ir, establishing them as cirrushot spots. we then fit the ir spectral energy distributions to determine dusttemperatures and masses. we find the dust masses in the smc stars to be largerthan for any known debris disks, although this evidence against the debris diskhypothesis is circumstantial. finally, we created a local comparison sample ofbright mid-ir ob stars in the milky way (mw) by cross-matching the wise andhipparcos catalogs. all such local stars in the appropriate luminosity rangethat can be unambiguously classified are young stars with optical emissionlines or are spatially resolved by wise with sizes too large to be plausibledebris disk candidates. we conclude that the very strong mid-ir flux excessesare most likely explained as cirrus hot spots, although we cannot rigorouslyrule out that a small fraction of the sample is made up of debris disks ortransition disks. we present suggestive evidence that bow-shock heating aroundrunaway stars may be a contributing mechanism to the interstellar emission.these sources, interpreted as cirrus hot spots, offer a new localised probe ofdiffuse interstellar dust in a low metallicity environment.

1401.0728	spitzer space telescope spectra of post-agb stars in the large  magellanic cloud ---polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at low metallicities	this paper reports variations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs)features that were found in spitzer space telescope spectra of carbon-richpost-asymptotic giant branch (post-agb) stars in the large magellanic cloud(lmc). the paper consists of two parts. the first part describes our spitzerspectral observing programme of 24 stars including post-agb candidates. thelatter half of this paper presents the analysis of pah features in 20carbon-rich post-agb stars in the lmc, assembled from the spitzer archive aswell as from our own programme. we found that five post-agb stars showed abroad feature with a peak at 7.7 micron, that had not been classified before.further, the 10--13 micron pah spectra were classified into four classes, oneof which has three broad peaks at 11.3, 12.3 and 13.3 micron rather than twodistinct sharp peaks at 11.3 and 12.7 micron, as commonly found in hii regions.our studies suggest that pahs are gradually processed while the central starsevolve from post-agb phase to pne, changing their composition before pahs areincorporated into the interstellar medium. although some metallicity dependenceof pah spectra exists, the evolutionary state of an object is more significantthan its metallicity in determining the spectral characteristics of pahs forlmc and galactic post-agb stars.

1402.2485	modelling the alumina abundance of oxygen-rich evolved stars in the  large magellanic cloud	in order to determine the composition of the dust in the circumstellarenvelopes of oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (agb) stars we have computed agrid of modust radiative-transfer models for a range of dust compositions,mass-loss rates, dust shell inner radii and stellar parameters. we compare theresulting colours with the observed oxygen-rich agb stars from the sage-speclarge magellanic cloud (lmc) sample, finding good overall agreement for starswith a mid-infrared excess. we use these models to fit a sample of 37 o-richagb stars in the lmc with optically thin circumstellar envelopes, for which5$-$35-$\mu$m spitzer infrared spectrograph (irs) spectra and broadbandphotometry from the optical to the mid-infrared are available. from themodelling, we find mass-loss rates in the range $\sim 8\times10^{-8}$ to$5\times10^{-6}$ m$_{\odot}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, and we show that a grainmixture consisting primarily of amorphous silicates, with contributions fromamorphous alumina and metallic iron provides a good fit to the observedspectra. furthermore, we show from dust models that the akari [11]$-$[15]versus [3.2]$-$[7] colour-colour diagram, is able to determine the fractionalabundance of alumina in o-rich agb stars.

0803.1828	chemical abundances and dust in planetary nebulae in the galactic bulge	we present mid-infrared spitzer spectra of eleven planetary nebulae in thegalactic bulge. we derive argon, neon, sulfur, and oxygen abundances for themusing mainly infrared line fluxes combined with some optical line fluxes fromthe literature. due to the high extinction toward the bulge, the infraredspectra allow us to determine abundances for certain elements more accuratelythat previously possible with optical data alone. abundances of argon andsulfur (and in most cases neon and oxygen) in planetary nebulae in the bulgegive the abundances of the interstellar medium at the time their progenitorstars formed; thus these abundances give information about the formation andevolution of the bulge. the abundances of bulge planetary nebulae tend to beslightly higher than those in the disk on average, but they do not follow thetrend of the disk planetary nebulae, thus confirming the difference betweenbulge and disk evolution. additionally, the bulge planetary nebulae showpeculiar dust properties compared to the disk nebulae. oxygen-rich dust feature(crystalline silicates) dominate the spectra of all of the bulge planetarynebulae; such features are more scarce in disk nebulae. additionally,carbon-rich dust features (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) appear in roughlyhalf of the bulge planetary nebulae in our sample, which is interesting inlight of the fact that this dual chemistry is comparatively rare in the milkyway as a whole.

1406.7034	carbon-rich dust past the asymptotic giant branch: aliphatics,  aromatics, and fullerenes in the magellanic clouds	infrared spectra of carbon-rich objects which have evolved off the asymptoticgiant branch reveal a range of dust properties, including fullerenes,polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs), aliphatic hydrocarbons, and severalunidentified features, including the 21 um emission feature. to test for thepresence of fullerenes, we used the position and width of the feature at18.7-18.9 um and examined other features at 17.4 and 6-9 um. this method addsthree new fullerene sources to the known sample, but it also calls intoquestion three previous identifications. we confirm that the strong 11 umfeatures seen in some sources arise primarily from sic, which may exist as acoating around carbonaceous cores and result from photo-processing. spectrashowing the 21 um feature usually show the newly defined class d pah profile at7-9 um. these spectra exhibit unusual pah profiles at 11-14 um, with weakcontributions at 12.7 um, which we define as class d1, or show features shiftedto ~11.4, 12.4, and 13.2 um, which we define as class d2. alkyne hydrocarbonsmatch the 15.8 um feature associated with 21 um emission. sources showingfullerene emission but no pahs have blue colors in the optical, suggesting aclear line of sight to the central source. spectra with 21 um features andclass d2 pah emission also show photometric evidence for a relatively clearline of sight to the central source. the multiple associations of the 21 umfeature to aliphatic hydrocarbons suggest that the carrier is related to thismaterial in some way.

1407.0962	interstellar and circumstellar fullerenes	fullerenes are a particularly stable class of carbon molecules in the shapeof a hollow sphere or ellipsoid that might be formed in the outflows of carbonstars. once injected into the interstellar medium (ism), these stable speciessurvive and are thus likely to be widespread in the galaxy where theycontribute to interstellar extinction, heating processes, and complex chemicalreactions. in recent years, the fullerene species c60 (and to a lesser extentc70) have been detected in a wide variety of circumstellar and interstellarenvironments showing that when conditions are favourable, fullerenes are formedefficiently. fullerenes are the first and only large aromatics firmlyidentified in space. the detection of fullerenes is thus crucial to provideclues as to the key chemical pathways leading to the formation of large complexorganic molecules in space, and offers a great diagnostic tool to describe theenvironment in which they reside. since fullerenes share many physicalproperties with pahs, understanding how fullerenes form, evolve and respond totheir physical environment will yield important insights into one of thelargest reservoirs of organic material in space. in spite of all thesedetections, many questions remain about precisely which members of thefullerene family are present in space, how they form and evolve, and what theirexcitation mechanism is. we present here an overview of what we know fromastronomical observations of fullerenes in these different environments, anddiscuss current thinking about the excitation process. we highlight the variousformation mechanisms that have been proposed, discuss the physical conditionsconducive to the formation and/or detection of fullerenes in carbon stars, andtheir possible connection to pahs, hacs and other dust features.

0803.3067	effects of metallicity on the chemical composition of carbon stars	we present \emph{spitzer} irs data on 19 asymptotic giant branch (agb) starsin the large magellanic cloud, complementing existing published data sets ofcarbon stars in both magellanic clouds and the milky way, to investigate theeffects of metallicity on dust and molecular spectral features arising from thecircumstellar envelope. we find that the c$_2$h$_2$ p and r branches at 7.5micron are affected by dust dilution at higher mass-loss rates -- albeit to alesser extent for sources in the magellanic clouds, compared to the milky way-- while the narrow 13.7 micron c$_2$h$_2$ q branch only shows the effect ofdust dilution at low mass-loss rates. a strong metallicity dependence is notobserved for the q branch. independent of metallicity, we also provide anexplanation for the observed shifts in the central wavelength of the sicemission feature, as we show that these are largely caused by molecular bandabsorption on either side of the dust emission feature, dominating over shiftsin the central wavelength caused by self-absorption. we have devised a methodto study the dust condensation history in carbon-rich agb stars in differentmetallicity environments, by measuring the strength of the 11.3 \um sic and 30\um mgs features with respect to the continuum, as a function of mass-lossrate. with this method, it is possible to distinguish in what order sic andgraphite condense, which is believed to be sensitive to the metallicity, priorto the eventual deposit of the mgs layer.

1408.5922	spectral calibration in the mid-infrared: challenges and solutions	we present spectra obtained with the infrared spectrograph (irs) on thespitzer space telescope of 33 k giants and 20 a dwarfs to assess theirsuitability as spectrophotometric standard stars. the k giants confirm previousfindings that the strength of the sio absorption band at 8 um increases forboth later optical spectral classes and redder (b-v)_0 colors, but withconsiderable scatter. for k giants, the synthetic spectra underpredict thestrengths of the molecular bands from sio and oh. for these reasons, theassumed true spectra for k giants should be based on neither the assumptionthat molecular band strengths in the infrared can be predicted accurately fromoptical spectral class or color nor synthetric spectra. the oh bands in kgiants grow stronger with cooler stellar temperatures, and they are strongerthan predicted by synthetic spectra. as a group, a dwarfs are better behavedand more predictable than the k giants, but they are more likely to show redexcesses from debris disks. no suitable a dwarfs were located in parts of thesky continuously observable from spitzer, and with previous means of estimatingthe true spectra of k giants ruled out, it was necessary to use models of adwarfs to calibrate spectra of k giants from observed spectral ratios of thetwo groups and then use the calibrated k giants as standards for the fulldatabase of infrared spectra from spitzer. we also describe a lingeringartifact that affects the spectra of faint blue sources at 24 um.

1504.03349	witnessing the emergence of a carbon star	during the late stages of their evolution, sun-like stars bring the productsof nuclear burning to the surface. most of the carbon in the universe isbelieved to originate from stars with masses up to a few solar masses. althoughthere is a chemical dichotomy between oxygen-rich and carbon-rich evolvedstars, the dredge-up itself has never been directly observed. in the last threedecades, however, a few stars have been shown to display both carbon- andoxygen-rich material in their circumstellar envelopes. two models have beenproposed to explain this dual chemistry: one postulates that a recent dredge-upof carbon produced by nucleosynthesis inside the star during the asymptoticgiant branch changed the surface chemistry of the star. the other modelpostulates that oxygen-rich material exists in stable keplerian rotation aroundthe central star. the two models make contradictory, testable, predictions onthe location of the oxygen-rich material, either located further from the starthan the carbon-rich gas, or very close to the star in a stable disk. using thefaint object infrared camera (forcast) instrument on board the stratosphericobservatory for infrared astronomy (sofia) telescope, we obtained images of thecarbon-rich planetary nebula (pn) bd+30 3639 which trace both carbon-richpolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) and oxygen-rich silicate dust. with thesuperior spectral coverage of sofia, and using a 3d photoionisation and dustradiative transfer model we prove that the o-rich material is distributed in ashell in the outer parts of the nebula, while the c-rich material is located inthe inner parts of the nebula. these observations combined with the model,suggest a recent change in stellar surface composition for the double chemistryin this object. this is evidence for dredge-up occurring ~1000yr ago.

1512.04695	eu del: exploring the onset of pulsation-driven winds in giant stars	we explore the wind-driving mechanism of giant stars through the nearby (117pc), intermediate-luminosity ($l \approx 1600$ l$_\odot$) star eu del (hip101810, hd 196610). apex observations of the co (3--2) and (2--1) transitionsare used to derive a wind velocity of 9.51 $\pm$ 0.02 km s$^{-1}$, a$^{12}$c/$^{13}$c ratio of 14 $^{+9}_{-4}$, and a mass-loss rate of a few$\times$ 10$^{-8}$ m$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. from published spectra, we estimatethat the star has a metallicity of [fe/h] = --0.27 $\pm$ $\sim$0.30 dex. thestar's dusty envelope lacks a clear 10-$\mu$m silicate feature, despite thestar's oxygen-rich nature. radiative transfer modelling cannot fit a windacceleration model which relies solely on radiation pressure on condensingdust. we compare our results to vy leo (hip 53449), a star with similartemperature and luminosity, but different pulsation properties. we suggest themuch stronger mass loss from eu del may be driven by long-period stellarpulsations, due to its potentially lower mass. we explore the implications forthe mass-loss rate and wind velocities of other stars.

0807.2998	the magellanic zoo: mid-infrared spitzer spectroscopy of evolved stars  and circumstellar dust in the magellanic clouds	we observed a sample of evolved stars in the large and small magellanicclouds (lmc and smc) with the infrared spectrograph on the spitzer spacetelescope. comparing samples from the smc, lmc, and the galaxy reveals that thedust-production rate depends on metallicity for oxygen-rich stars, but carbonstars with similar pulsation properties produce similar quantities of dust,regardless of their initial metallicity. other properties of the oxygen-richstars also depend on metallicity. as the metallicity decreases, the fraction ofnaked (i.e. dust-free) stars increases, and among the naked stars, the strengthof the 8 um absorption band from sio decreases. our sample includes severalmassive stars in the lmc with long pulsation periods which produce significantamounts of dust, probably because they are young and relatively metal rich.little alumina dust is seen in circumstellar shells in the smc and lmc, unlikein galactic samples. three oxygen-rich sources also show emission frommagnesium-rich crystalline silicates. many also show an emission feature at 14um. the one s star in our sample shows a newly detected emission featurecentered at 13.5 um. at lower metallicity, carbon stars with similar amounts ofamorphous carbon in their shells have stronger absorption from molecularacetylene (c_2h_2) and weaker emission from sic and mgs dust, as discovered inprevious studies.

astro-ph;0411522	the truncated disk of coku tau/4	we present a model of a dusty disk with an inner hole which accounts for thespitzer space telescope infrared spectrograph observations of the low-masspre-main sequence star coku tau/4. we have modeled the mid-ir spectrum (between8 and 25 mic) as arising from the inner wall of a disk. our model disk has anevacuated inner zone of radius ~ 10 au, with a dusty inner ``wall'', ofhalf-height ~ 2 au, that is illuminated at normal incidence by the centralstar. the radiative equilibrium temperature decreases from the inner disk edgeoutward through the optically-thick disk; this temperature gradient isresponsible for the emission of the silicate bands at 10 and 20 mic. theobserved spectrum is consistent with being produced by fe-mg amorphous glassyolivine and/or pyroxene, with no evidence of a crystalline component. themid-infrared spectrum of coku tau/4 is reminiscent of that of the much olderstar tw hya, where it has been suggested that the significant clearing of itsinner disk is due to planet formation. however, no inner disk remains in cokutau/4, consistent with the star being a weak-emission (non-accreting) t tauristar. the relative youth of coku tau/4 (~ 1 myr) may indicate much more rapidplanet formation than typically assumed.

astro-ph;0509859	the detection of crystalline silicates in ultra-luminous infrared  galaxies	silicates are an important component of interstellar dust and the structureof these grains -- amorphous versus crystalline -- is sensitive to the localphysical conditions. we have studied the infrared spectra of a sample ofultra-luminous infrared galaxies. here, we report the discovery of weak, narrowabsorption features at 11, 16, 19, 23, and 28 microns, characteristic ofcrystalline silicates, superimposed on the broad absorption bands at 10 and 18microns due to amorphous silicates in a subset of this sample. these featuresbetray the presence of forsterite (mg_2sio_4), the magnesium-rich end member ofthe olivines. previously, crystalline silicates have only been observed incircumstellar environments. the derived fraction of forsterite to amorphoussilicates is typically 0.1 in these ulirgs. this is much larger than the upperlimit for this ratio in the interstellar medium of the milky way, 0.01. theseresults suggest that the timescale for injection of crystalline silicates intothe ism is short in a merger-driven starburst environment (e.g., as compared tothe total time to dissipate the gas), pointing towards massive stars as aprominent source of crystalline silicates. furthermore, amorphization due tocosmic rays, which is thought to be of prime importance for the local ism, lagsin vigorous starburst environments.

astro-ph;0602531	a spitzer mid-infrared spectral survey of mass-losing carbon stars in  the large magellanic cloud	we present a spitzer space telescope spectroscopic survey of mass-losingcarbon stars (and one oxygen-rich star) in the large magellanic cloud. thespectra cover the wavelength range 5--38 micron. they show varying combinationsof dust continuum, dust emission features (sic, mgs) and molecular absorptionbands (c2h2, hcn). a set of four narrow bands, dubbed the manchester system, isused to define the infrared continuum for dusty carbon stars. the relationsbetween the continuum colours and the strength of the dust and molecularfeatures are studied, and are compared to galactic stars of similar colours.the circumstellar 7-micron c2h2 band is found to be stronger at lowermetallicity, from a comparison of stars in the galaxy, the lmc and the smc.this is explained by dredge-up of carbon, causing higher c/o ratios at lowmetallicity (less o). a possible 10-micron absorption feature seen in ourspectra may be due to c3. this band has also been identified with interstellarsilicate or silicon-nitrite dust. the line-to-continuum ratio of thesic and mgsbands shows some indication of being lower at low metallicity. the mgs band isonly seen at dust temperatures below 600 k. we discuss the selection of carbonversus oxygen-rich agb stars using the j-k vs. k-a colours, and show that thesecolours are relatively insensitive to chemical type. metal-poor carbon starsform amorphous carbon dust from self-produced carbon. the formation efficiencyof oxygen-rich dust depends more strongly on metallicity. we suggest that inlower-metallicity environments, the dust input into the interstellar medium byagb stars is efficient but may be strongly biassed towards carbonaceous dust,as compare to the galaxy.

astro-ph;0603607	mid-infrared spectroscopy of carbon stars in the small magellanic cloud	we have observed a sample of 36 objects in the small magellanic cloud (smc)with the infrared spectrometer on the spitzer space telescope. nineteen ofthese sources are carbon stars. an examination of the near- and mid-infraredphotometry shows that the carbon-rich and oxygen-rich dust sources follow twoeasily separated sequences. a comparison of the spectra of the 19 carbon starsin the smc to spectra from the infrared space observatory (iso) of carbon starsin the galaxy reveals significant differences. the absorption bands at 7.5 umand 13.7 um due to c2h2 are stronger in the smc sample, and the sic dustemission feature at 11.3 um is weaker. our measurements of the mgs dustemission feature at 26-30 um are less conclusive, but this feature appears tobe weaker in the smc sample as well. all of these results are consistent withthe lower metallicity in the smc. the lower abundance of sic grains in the smcmay result in less efficient carbon-rich dust production, which could explainthe excess c2h2 gas seen in the spectra. the sources in the smc with thestrongest sic dust emission tend to have redder infrared colors than the othersources in the sample, which implies more amorphous carbon, and they also tendto show stronger mgs dust emission. the weakest sic emission features tend tobe shifted to the blue; these spectra may arise from low-density shells withlarge sic grains.

astro-ph;0611071	spitzer spectroscopy of carbon stars in the small magellanic cloud	we present spitzer space telescope spectroscopic observations of 14carbon-rich agb stars in the small magellanic cloud. sic dust is seen in mostof the carbon-rich stars but it is weak compared to lmc stars. the sic featureis strong only for stars with significant dust excess, opposite to what isobserved for galactic stars. we argue that in the smc, sic forms at lowertemperature than graphite dust, whereas the reverse situation occurs in thegalaxy where sic condenses at higher temperatures and forms first. dust inputinto the interstellar medium by agb stars consists mostly of carbonaceous dust,with little sic or silicate dust. only the two coolest stars show a 30-micronband due to mgs dust. we suggest that this is due to the fact that, in the smc,mass-losing agb stars generally have low circumstellar (dust) optical depth andtherefore effective heating of dust by the central star does not allowtemperatures below the 650 k necessary for mgs to exist as a solid. gas phasec$_2$h$_2$ bands are stronger in the smc than in the lmc or galaxy. this isattributed to an increasing c/o ratio at low metallicity. we present acolour-colour diagram based on spitzer irac and mips colours to discriminatebetween o- and c-rich stars. we show that agb stars in the smc become carbonstars early in the thermal-pulsing agb evolution, and remain optically visiblefor $\sim 6 \times 10^5$ yr. for the lmc, this lifetime is $\sim 3 \times 10^5$yr. the superwind phase traced with spitzer lasts for $\sim 10^4$ yr. spitzerspectra of a k supergiant and a compact hii region are also given.

0811.3590	silica in protoplanetary disks	mid-infrared spectra of a few t tauri stars (tts) taken with the infraredspectrograph (irs) on board the spitzer space telescope show prominent narrowemission features indicating silica (crystalline silicon dioxide). silica isnot a major constituent of the interstellar medium; therefore, any silicapresent in the circumstellar protoplanetary disks of tts must be largely theresult of processing of primitive dust material in the disks surrouding thesestars. we model the silica emission features in our spectra using the opacitiesof various polymorphs of silica and their amorphous versions computed fromearth-based laboratory measurements. this modeling indicates that the twopolymorphs of silica, tridymite and cristobalite, which form at successivelyhigher temperatures and low pressures, are the dominant forms of silica in thetts of our sample. these high temperature, low pressure polymorphs of silicapresent in protoplanetary disks are consistent with a grain composed mostly oftridymite named ada found in the cometary dust samples collected from thestardust mission to comet 81p/wild 2. the silica in these protoplanetary disksmay arise from incongruent melting of enstatite or from incongruent melting ofamorphous pyroxene, the latter being analogous to the former. the hightemperatures of 1200k-1300k and rapid cooling required to crystallize tridymiteor cristobalite set constraints on the mechanisms that could have formed thesilica in these protoplanetary disks, suggestive of processing of these grainsduring the transient heating events hypothesized to create chondrules.

0811.3622	dust processing and grain growth in protoplanetary disks in the  taurus-auriga star-forming region	mid-infrared spectra of 65 t tauri stars (tts) taken with the infraredspectrograph (irs) on board the spitzer space telescope are modeled using dustat two temperatures to probe the radial variation in dust composition in theuppermost layers of protoplanetary disks. most spectra indicating crystallinesilicates require mg-rich minerals and silica, but a few suggest otherwise.spectra indicating abundant enstatite at higher temperatures also requirecrystalline silicates at temperatures lower than those required for spectrashowing high abundance of other crystalline silicates. a few spectra show 10micron complexes of very small equivalent width. they are fit well usingabundant crystalline silicates but very few large grains, inconsistent with theexpectation that low peak-to-continuum ratio of the 10 micron complex alwaysindicates grain growth. most spectra in our sample are fit well without usingthe opacities of large crystalline silicate grains. if large grains grow byagglomeration of submicron grains of all dust types, the amorphous silicatecomponents of these aggregates must typically be more abundant than thecrystalline silicate components. crystalline silicate abundances correlatepositively with other such abundances, suggesting that crystalline silicatesare processed directly from amorphous silicates and that neither forsterite,enstatite, nor silica are intermediate steps when producing either of the othertwo. disks with more dust settling typically have greater crystallineabundances. large-grain abundance is somewhat correlated with greater settlingof disks. the lack of strong correlation is interpreted to mean that settlingof large grains is sensitive to individual disk properties. lower-mass starshave higher abundances of large grains in their inner regions.
