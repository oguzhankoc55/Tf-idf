0902.0609	the he-rich core-collapse supernova 2007y: observations from x-ray to  radio wavelengths	a detailed study spanning approximately a year has been conducted on the typeib supernova 2007y. imaging was obtained from x-ray to radio wavelengths, and acomprehensive set of multi-band (w2m2w1u'g'r'i'ubvyjhks) light curves andoptical spectroscopy is presented. a virtually complete bolometric light curveis derived, from which we infer a (56)ni-mass of 0.06 m_sun. the early spectrumstrongly resembles sn 2005bf and exhibits high-velocity features of caii andh_alpha; during late epochs the spectrum shows evidence of a ejecta-windinteraction. nebular emission lines have similar widths and exhibit profilesthat indicate a lack of major asymmetry in the ejecta. late phase spectra aremodeled with a non-lte code, from which we find (56)ni, o and total-ejectamasses (excluding he) to be 0.06, 0.2 and 0.42 m_sun, respectively, below 4,500km/s. the (56)ni mass confirms results obtained from the bolometric lightcurve. the oxygen abundance suggests the progenitor was most likely a ~3.3m_sun he core star that evolved from a zero-age-main-sequence mass of 10-13m_sun. the explosion energy is determined to be ~10^50 erg, and the mass-lossrate of the progenitor is constrained from x-ray and radio observations to be&lt;~10^-6 m_sun/yr. sn 2007y is among the least energetic normal type ibsupernovae ever studied.

0908.1918	the fast declining type ia supernova 2003gs, and evidence for a  significant dispersion in near-infrared absolute magnitudes of fast decliners  at maximum light	we obtained optical photometry of sn 2003gs on 49 nights, from 2 to 494 daysafter t(b_max). we also obtained near-ir photometry on 21 nights. sn 2003gs wasthe first fast declining type ia sn that has been well observed since sn1999by. while it was subluminous in optical bands compared to more slowlydeclining type ia sne, it was not subluminous at maximum light in the near-irbands. there appears to be a bimodal distribution in the near-ir absolutemagnitudes of type ia sne at maximum light. those that peak in the near-irafter t(b_max) are subluminous in the all bands. those that peak in the near-irprior to t(b_max), such as sn 2003gs, have effectively the same near-irabsolute magnitudes at maximum light regardless of the decline rate deltam_15(b).  near-ir spectral evidence suggests that opacities in the outer layers of sn2003gs are reduced much earlier than for normal type ia sne. that may allowgamma rays that power the luminosity to escape more rapidly and accelerate thedecline rate. this conclusion is consistent with the photometric behavior of sn2003gs in the ir, which indicates a faster than normal decline fromapproximately normal peak brightness.

0910.3317	the carnegie supernova project: analysis of the first sample of  low-redshift type-ia supernovae	we present the analysis of the first set of low-redshift type ia supernovae(sne ia) by the carnegie supernova project. well-sampled, high-precisionoptical (ugribv) and near-infrared (nir; yjhks) light curves obtained in awell-understood photometric system are used to provide light-curve parameters,and ugribvyjh template light curves. the intrinsic colors at maximum light arecalibrated to compute optical--nir color excesses for the full sample, thusallowing the properties of the reddening law in the host galaxies to bestudied. a low value of rv~1.7, is derived when using the entire sample of sne.however, when the two highly reddened sne in the sample are excluded, a valuegalactic standard of rv~3.2 is obtained. the colors of these two events arewell matched by a reddening model due to circumstellar dust. the peakluminosities are calibrated using a two-parameter linear fit to the declinerates and the colors, or alternatively, the color excesses. in both cases,dispersions in absolute magnitude of 0.12--0.16 mag are obtained, depending onthe filter-color combination. in contrast to the results obtained from colorexcesses, these fits give rv~1--2, even when the two highly reddened sne areexcluded. this discrepancy suggests that, beyond the "normal" interstellarreddening produced in the host galaxies, there is an intrinsic dispersion inthe colors of sne ia which is correlated with luminosity but independent of thedecline rate. finally, a hubble diagram is produced by combining the results ofthe fits for each filter. the resulting scatter of 0.12 mag appears to belimited by peculiar velocities as evidenced by the strong correlation betweenthe distance-modulus residuals among the different filters. the implication isthat the actual precision of sn ia distances is 3--4%.

0708.0140	optical and near-infrared observations of the highly reddened, rapidly  expanding type ia supernova 2006x in m100	we present extensive optical (ubvri), near-infrared (jk) light curves andoptical spectroscopy of the type ia supernova (sn) 2006x in the nearby galaxyngc 4321 (m100). our observations suggest that either sn 2006x has anintrinsically peculiar color evolution, or it is highly reddened [e(b -v)_{host} = 1.42+/-0.04 mag] with r_v = 1.48+/-0.06, much lower than thecanonical value of 3.1 for the average galactic dust. sn 2006x also has one ofthe highest expansion velocities ever published for a sn ia. compared with theother sne ia we analyzed, sn 2006x has a broader light curve in the u band, amore prominent bump/shoulder feature in the v and r bands, a more pronouncedsecondary maximum in the i and near-infrared bands, and a remarkably smallerlate-time decline rate in the b band. the b - v color evolution shows anobvious deviation from the lira-phillips relation at 1 to 3 months aftermaximum brightness. at early times, optical spectra of sn 2006x displayedstrong, high-velocity features of both intermediate-mass elements (si, ca, ands) and iron-peak elements, while at late times they showed a relatively bluecontinuum, consistent with the blue u-b and b-v colors at similar epochs. alight echo and/or the interaction of the sn ejecta and its circumstellarmaterial may provide a plausible explanation for its late-time photometric andspectroscopic behavior. using the cepheid distance of m100, we derive a hubbleconstant of 72.7+/-8.2 km s^{-1} mpc^{-1}(statistical) from the normalizeddereddened luminosity of sn 2006x. we briefly discuss whether abnormal dust isa universal signature for all sne ia, and whether the most rapidly expandingobjects form a subclass with distinct photometric and spectroscopic properties.

1005.2363	manganese abundances in the globular cluster omega centauri	we present manganese abundances in 10 red-giant members of the globularcluster omega centauri; 8 stars are from the most metal-poor population (rgb mpand rgb mint1) while two targets are members of the more metal rich groups (rgbmint2 and mint3). this is the first time mn abundances have been studied inthis peculiar stellar system. the lte values of [mn/fe] in omega cen overlapthose of milky way stars in the metal poor omega cen populations ([fe/h] ~ -1.5to -1.8), however unlike what is observed in milky way halo and disk stars,[mn/fe] declines in the two more metal-rich rgb mint2 and mint3 targets.non-lte calculations were carried out in order to derive corrections to the ltemn abundances. the non-lte results for omega cen in comparison with the non-lte[mn/fe] versus [fe/h] trend obtained for the milky way confirm and strengthenthe conclusion that the manganese behavior in omega cen is distinct. theseresults suggest that low-metallicity supernovae (with metallicities &lt; -2) ofeither type ii or type ia dominated the enrichment of the more metal-rich starsin omega cen. the dominance of low-metallicity stars in the chemical evolutionof omega cen has been noted previously in the s-process elements whereenrichment from metal-poor agb stars is indicated. in addition, copper, whichalso has metallicity dependent yields, exhibits lower values of [cu/fe] in thergb mint2 and mint3 omega cen populations.

1010.4040	the carnegie supernova project: light curve fitting with snoopy	in providing an independent measure of the expansion history of the universe,the carnegie supernova project (csp) has observed 71 high-z type ia supernovae(sne ia) in the near-infrared bands y and j. these can be used to constructrest-frame i-band light curves which, when compared to a low-z sample, yielddistance moduli that are less sensitive to extinction and/or decline-ratecorrections than in the optical. however, working with nir observed and i-bandrest frame photometry presents unique challenges and has necessitated thedevelopment of a new set of observational tools in order to reduce and analyzeboth the low-z and high-z csp sample. we present in this paper the methods usedto generate ubvgriyjh light-curve templates based on a sample of 24high-quality low-z csp sne. we also present two methods for determining thedistances to the hosts of sn ia events. a larger sample of 30 low-z sne ia inthe hubble flow are used to calibrate these methods. we then apply the methodand derive distances to seven galaxies that are so nearby that their motionsare not dominated by the hubble flow.

1106.3968	the most slowly declining type ia supernova 2001ay	we present optical and near-infrared photometry, as well as ground-basedoptical spectra and hubble space telescope ultraviolet spectra, of the type iasupernova (sn) 2001ay. at maximum light the si ii and mg ii lines indicatedexpansion velocities of 14,000 km/sec, while si iii and s ii showed velocitiesof 9,000 km/sec there is also evidence for some unburned carbon at 12,000km/sec. sn 2001ay exhibited a decline-rate parameter delta m_15(b) = 0.68 \pm0.05 mag; this and the b-band photometry at t &gt; +25 d past maximum make it themost slowly declining type ia sn yet discovered. three of foursuper-chandrasekhar-mass candidates have decline rates almost as slow as this.after correction for galactic and host-galaxy extinction, sn 2001ay had m_b =-19.19 and m_v = -19.17 mag at maximum light; thus, it was not overluminous inoptical bands. in near-infrared bands it was overluminous only at the 2-sigmalevel at most. for a rise time of 18 d (explosion to bolometric maximum) theimplied ni-56 yield was (0.58 \pm 0.15)/alpha m_sun, with alpha = l_max/e_niprobably in the range 1.0 to 1.2. the ni-56 yield is comparable to that of manytype ia supernovae. the "normal" ni-56 yield and the typical peak opticalbrightness suggest that the very broad optical light curve is explained by thetrapping of the gamma rays in the inner regions.

1110.3789	unburned material in the ejecta of type ia supernovae	(abridged) the presence of unburned material in the ejecta of normal type iasupernovae (sneia) is investigated using early-time spectroscopy obtained bythe csp. the tell-tale signature of pristine material from a c+o white dwarfprogenitor star is the presence of carbon. the most prominent carbon lines inoptical spectra of sneia are due to c ii. we find that at least 30% of theobjects in the sample show an absorption at ~6300 aa which is attributed to cii 6580. an association to h_alpha is considered to be unlikely. these findingsimply a larger incidence of carbon in sneia ejecta than previously noted. weshow how observational biases and physical conditions may hide these c iilines, and account for the scarcity of previous carbon detections. thisrelatively large frequency of carbon detections has crucial implications on ourunderstanding of the explosive process. the observations indicate that carbonis present merely ~1000 km s^-1 above the bulk of si ii. spectral modelingshows the detections are consistent with a mass of carbon of 10^-3--10^-2m_sun. this would imply substantial mixing, which may be related to asymmetriesof the flame propagation or clumps of unburned material along the line ofsight. however, the uniformity of the relation between c ii and si iivelocities is not consistent with the latter scenario. the observationalproperties of sneia with and without carbon signatures are compared. a trendtoward bluer color and lower luminosity is found for objects with carbon.

1110.5809	evidence for type ia supernova diversity from ultraviolet observations  with the hubble space telescope	we present ultraviolet (uv) spectroscopy and photometry of four type iasupernovae (sne 2004dt, 2004ef, 2005m, and 2005cf) obtained with the uv prismof the advanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope. this datasetprovides unique spectral time series down to 2000 angstrom. significantdiversity is seen in the near maximum-light spectra (~ 2000--3500 angstrom) forthis small sample. the corresponding photometric data, together with archivaldata from swift ultraviolet/optical telescope observations, provide furtherevidence of increased dispersion in the uv emission with respect to theoptical. the peak luminosities measured in uvw1/f250w are found to correlatewith the b-band light-curve shape parameter dm15(b), but with much largerscatter relative to the correlation in the broad-band b band (e.g., ~0.4 magversus ~0.2 mag for those with 0.8 &lt; dm15 &lt; 1.7 mag). sn 2004dt is found as anoutlier of this correlation (at &gt; 3 sigma), being brighter than normal sne iasuch as sn 2005cf by ~0.9 mag and ~2.0 mag in the uvw1/f250w and uvm2/f220wfilters, respectively. we show that different progenitor metallicity orline-expansion velocities alone cannot explain such a large discrepancy.viewing-angle effects, such as due to an asymmetric explosion, may have asignificant influence on the flux emitted in the uv region. detailed modelingis needed to disentangle and quantify the above effects.

1201.2913	the standardizability of type ia supernovae in the near-infrared:  evidence for a peak luminosity-decline rate relation in the near-infrared	we analyze the standardizability of type ia supernovae (sne ia) in thenear-infrared (nir) by investigating the correlation between observed peak nirabsolute magnitude and post-maximum b-band decline rate. a sample of 27low-redshift sne ia observed by the carnegie supernova project between 2004 to2007 is used. all 27 objects have pre-maximum coverage in optical bands, with asubset of 13 having pre-maximum nir observations as well. we describe themethods used to derive absolute peak magnitudes and decline rates from bothspline- and template-fitting procedures, and confirm prior findings thatfitting templates to sne ia light curves in the nir is problematic due to thediversity of post-maximum behaviour of objects that are characterized bysimilar decline rate values, especially at high decline rates. nevertheless, weshow that nir light curves can be reasonably fit with a template, especially ifthe observations begin within 5 days after nir maximum. for the subset of 13objects in our dataset that excludes the highly reddened and fast declining sneia, and includes only those objects for which nir observations began prior tofive days after maximum light, we find modest evidence for a peakluminosity-decline rate relation in y, and stronger evidence in j and h. usingrv values differing from the canonical value of 3.1 is shown to have littleeffect on the results. a hubble diagram is presented for the nir bands and theb band. the resulting scatter for the combined nir bands is 0.13 mag, while theb band produces a scatter of 0.22 mag. the data suggest that applying acorrection to sne ia peak luminosities for decline rate is likely to bebeneficial in the j and h bands to make sne ia more precise distanceindicators, but of only marginal importance in the y band.

1211.1362	fixing the u-band photometry of type ia supernovae	we present previously unpublished photometry of supernovae 2003gs and 2003hv.using spectroscopically-derived corrections to the u-band photometry, wereconcile u-band light curves made from imagery with the cerro tololo 0.9-m,1.3-m and las campanas 1-m telescopes. previously, such light curves showed a0.4 mag spread at one month after maximum light. this gives us hope that a setof corrected ultraviolet light curves of nearby objects can contribute to thefull utilization of rest frame u-band data of supernovae at redshift ~0.3 to0.8. as pointed out recently by kessler et al. in the context of the sloandigital sky survey supernova search, if we take the published u-band photometryof nearby type ia supernovae at face value, there is a 0.12 mag u-band anomalyin the distance moduli of higher redshift objects. this anomaly led the sloansurvey to eliminate from their analyses all photometry obtained in the restframe u-band. the supernova legacy survey eliminated observer frame u-bandphotometry, which is to say nearby objects observed in the u-band, but theyused photometry of high redshift objects no matter in which band the photonswere emitted.

1305.6997	spectroscopy of type ia supernovae by the carnegie supernova project	this is the first release of optical spectroscopic data of low-redshift typeia supernovae (sne ia) by the carnegie supernova project including 604previously unpublished spectra of 93 sne ia. the observations cover a range ofphases from 12 days before to over 150 days after the time of b-band maximumlight. with the addition of 228 near-maximum spectra from the literature westudy the diversity among sne ia in a quantitative manner. for that purpose,spectroscopic parameters are employed such as expansion velocities fromspectral line blueshifts, and pseudo-equivalent widths (pw). the values ofthose parameters at maximum light are obtained for 78 objects, thus providing acharacterization of sne ia that may help to improve our understanding of theproperties of the exploding systems and the thermonuclear flame propagation.two objects, namely sne 2005m and 2006is, stand out from the sample by showingpeculiar si ii and s ii velocities but otherwise standard velocities for therest of the ions. we further study the correlations between spectroscopic andphotometric parameters such as light-curve decline rate and color. in agreementwith previous studies, we find that the pw of si ii absorption features arevery good indicators of light-curve decline rate. furthermore, we demonstratethat parameters such as pw2(siii4130) and pw6(siii5972) provide precisecalibrations of the peak b-band luminosity with dispersions of ~0.15 mag. inthe search for a secondary parameter in the calibration of peak luminosity forsne ia, we find a ~2--3-sigma correlation between b-band hubble residuals andthe velocity at maximum light of s ii and si ii lines.

1311.0147	on the source of the dust extinction in type ia supernovae and the  discovery of anomalously strong na i absorption	high-dispersion observations of the na i d 5890, 5896 and k i 7665, 7699interstellar lines, and the diffuse interstellar band at 5780 angstroms in thespectra of 32 type ia supernovae are used as an independent means of probingdust extinction. we show that the dust extinction of the objects where thediffuse interstellar band at 5780 angstroms is detected is consistent with thevisual extinction derived from the supernova colors. this strongly suggeststhat the dust producing the extinction is predominantly located in theinterstellar medium of the host galaxies and not in circumstellar materialassociated with the progenitor system. one quarter of the supernovae displayanomalously large na i column densities in comparison to the amount of dustextinction derived from their colors. remarkably, all of the cases of unusuallystrong na i d absorption correspond to "blueshifted" profiles in theclassification scheme of sternberg et al. (2011). this coincidence suggeststhat outflowing circumstellar gas is responsible for at least some of the casesof anomalously large na i column densities. two supernovae with unusuallystrong na i d absorption showed essentially normal k i column densities for thedust extinction implied by their colors, but this does not appear to be auniversal characteristic. overall, we find the most accurate predictor ofindividual supernova extinction to be the equivalent width of the diffuseinterstellar band at 5780 angstroms, and provide an empirical relation for itsuse. finally, we identify ways of producing significant enhancements of the naabundance of circumstellar material in both the single-degenerate anddouble-degenerate scenarios for the progenitor system.

1312.3342	persistent c ii absorption in the normal type ia supernova 2002fk	we present well-sampled $ubvrijhk$ photometry of sn 2002fk starting 12 daysbefore maximum light through 122 days after peak brightness, along with aseries of 15 optical spectra from -4 to +95 days since maximum. ourobservations show the presence of c ii lines in the early-time spectra of sn2002fk, expanding at ~11,000 km s$^{-1}~$ and persisting until ~8 days pastmaximum light with a velocity of $\sim$9,000 km s$^{-1}~$. sn 2002fk ischaracterized by a small velocity gradient of $\dot v_{si~ii}=26$ km s$^{-1}$day$^{-1}$, possibly caused by an off-center explosion with the ignition regionoriented towards the observer. the connection between viewing angle of anoff-center explosion and the presence of c ii in the early time spectrumsuggests that the observation of c ii could be also due to a viewing angleeffect. adopting the cepheid distance to ngc 1309 we provide the first $h_{0}$value based on near-ir measurements of a type ia supernova between 63.0$\pm$0.8 ($\pm$ 2.8 systematic) and 66.7$\pm$1.0 ($\pm$ 3.5 systematic) km/s/mpc,depending on the absolute magnitude/decline rate relationship adopted. itappears that the near-ir yields somewhat lower (6-9 %) $h_0$ values than theoptical. it is essential to further examine this issue by (1) expanding thesample of high-quality near-ir light curves of sne in the hubble flow, and (2)increasing the number of nearby sne with near-ir sn light curves and precisecepheid distances, which affords the promise to deliver a more precisedetermination of $h_0$.

1403.7089	h-alpha spectral diversity of type ii supernovae	we present a spectroscopic analysis of the h-alpha profiles of hydrogen-richtype ii supernovae. a total of 52 type ii supernovae having well sampledoptical light curves and spectral sequences were analyzed. concentrating on theh-alpha p-cygni profile we measure its velocity from the fwhm of emission andthe ratio of absorption to emission (a/e) at a common epoch at the start of therecombination phase, and search for correlations between these spectralparameters and photometric properties of the v-band light curves. testing thestrength of various correlations we find that a/e appears to be the dominantspectral parameter in terms of describing the diversity in our measuredsupernova properties. it is found that supernovae with smaller a/e have higherh-alpha velocities, more rapidly declining light curves from maximum, duringthe plateau and radioactive tail phase, are brighter at maximum light and haveshorter optically thick phase durations. we discuss possible explanations ofthese results in terms of physical properties of type ii supernovae,speculating that the most likely parameters which influence the morphologies ofh-alpha profiles are the mass and density profile of the hydrogen envelope,together with additional emission components due to circumstellar interaction.

1403.7091	characterizing the v-band light-curves of hydrogen-rich type ii  supernovae	we present an analysis of the diversity of v-band light-curves ofhydrogen-rich type ii supernovae. analyzing a sample of 116 supernovae, severalmagnitude measurements are defined, together with decline rates at differentepochs, and time durations of different phases. it is found that magnitudesmeasured at maximum light correlate more strongly with decline rates than thosemeasured at other epochs: brighter supernovae at maximum generally have fasterdeclining light-curves at all epochs. we find a relation between the declinerate during the 'plateau' phase and peak magnitudes, which has a dispersion of0.56 magnitudes, offering the prospect of using type ii supernovae as purelyphotometric distance indicators. our analysis suggests that the type iipopulation spans a continuum from low-luminosity events which have flatlight-curves during the 'plateau' stage, through to the brightest events whichdecline much faster. a large range in optically thick phase durations isobserved, implying a range in progenitor envelope masses at the epoch ofexplosion. during the radioactive tails, we find many supernovae with fasterdeclining light-curves than expected from full trapping of radioactiveemission, implying low mass ejecta. it is suggested that the main driver oflight-curve diversity is the extent of hydrogen envelopes retained beforeexplosion. finally, a new classification scheme is introduced wherehydrogen-rich events are typed as simply 'snii' with an s2 value giving thedecline rate during the 'plateau' phase, indicating its morphological type.

(1996a) that bright events occur preferentially in young stellarenvironments. we find also that the brightest sne occur in the least luminousgalaxies, a possible indication that metal-poorer neighbourhoods produce themore luminous events. the interpretation of these results is made difficult,however, due to the fact that galaxies with younger stellar populations arealso lower in luminosity. in an attempt to remove this ambiguity we use modelsfor the line strengths in the absorption spectrum of five early-type galaxies,in order to estimate metallicities and ages of the sn host galaxies. with theaddition of abundance estimates from nebular analysis of the emission spectraof three spiral galaxies, we find possible further evidence that luminous sneare produced in metal-poor neighborhoods. further spectroscopic observations ofthe sn host galaxies will be necessary to test these results and assist indisentangling the age/metallicity effects on type ia sne.

astro-ph;0203346	modelling the hubble space telescope ultraviolet and optical spectrum of  spot 1 on the circumstellar ring of sn 1987a	we report and interpret hst/stis long-slit observations of the optical andultraviolet (1150 - 10270 angstrom) emission-line spectra of the rapidlybrightening spot 1 on the equatorial ring of sn 1987a between 1997 septemberand 1999 october (days 3869 -- 4606 after outburst). the emission is caused byradiative shocks created where the supernova blast wave strikes dense gasprotruding inward from the equatorial ring. we measure and tabulate lineidentifications, fluxes and, in some cases, line widths and shifts. we computeflux correction factors to account for substantial interstellar line absorptionof several emission lines. nebular analysis shows that optical emission linescome from a region of cool (t_e ~ 10^4 k) and dense (n_e ~ 10^6 cm^-3) gas inthe compressed photoionized layer behind the radiative shock. the observed linewidths indicate that only shocks with shock velocities v_s &lt; 250 km/s havebecome radiative, while line ratios indicate that much of the emission musthave come from yet slower (v_s &lt; 135 k/ms) shocks. we are able to fit the uvfluxes with an idealized radiative shock model consisting of two shocks (v_s =135 and 250 km/s). the observed uv flux increase with time can be explained bythe increase in shock surface areas as the blast wave overtakes more of theprotrusion. the observed flux ratios of optical to highly-ionized uv lines aregreater by a factor of ~ 2 -- 3 than predictions from the radiative shockmodels and we discuss the possible causes. we also present models for theobserved h-alpha line widths and profiles, which suggests that a chaotic flowexists in the photoionized regions of these shocks. we discuss what can belearned with future observations of all the spots present on the equatorialring.

astro-ph;0205161	new understanding of large magellanic cloud structure, dynamics and  orbit from carbon star kinematics	we derive general expressions for the lmc velocity field which we fit tokinematical data for 1041 carbon stars. we demonstrate that all previousstudies of lmc kinematics have made unnecessary over-simplifications that haveled to incorrect estimates of important structural parameters. we compile andimprove lmc proper motion estimates to support our analysis. we find that thekinematically determined position angle of the line of nodes is 129.9 +/- 6.0deg. the lmc inclination changes at a rate di/dt = -103 +/- 61 deg/gyr, aresult of precession and nutation induced by milky way tidal torques. the lmcrotation curve v(r) has amplitude 49.8 +/- 15.9 km/s, 40% lower than what haspreviously (and incorrectly) been inferred from e.g. hi. the dynamical centerof the carbon stars is consistent with the center of the bar and the center ofthe outer isophotes, but not with the hi kinematical center. the enclosed massinside 8.9 kpc is (8.7 +/- 4.3) x 10^9 m_sun, more than half of which is due toa dark halo. the lmc has a larger vertical thickness than has traditionallybeen believed. its v/sigma is less than the value for the milky way thick disk.we discuss the implications for the lmc self-lensing optical depth. wedetermine the lmc velocity and orbit in the galactocentric rest frame and findit to be consistent with the range of velocities that has been predicted bymodels for the magellanic stream. the milky way dark halo must have mass &gt;4.3 x10^{11} m_sun and extent &gt;39 kpc for the lmc to be bound. we predict the lmcproper motion velocity field, and discuss techniques for kinematical distanceestimation.

astro-ph;0210327	optical and infrared photometry of the nearby type ia supernova 2001el	we present well sampled optical (ubvri) and infrared (jhk) light curves ofthe nearby (~18.0 mpc) type ia supernova sn 2001el, from 11 days before to 142days after the time of b-band maximum. the data represent one of the best setsof optical and infrared photometry ever obtained for a type ia supernova. basedon synthetic photometry using optical spectra of sn 2001el and optical andinfrared spectra of sn 1999ee, we were able to devise filter corrections forthe bvjhk photometry of sn 2001el which to some extent resolve systematicdifferences between sn 2001el datasets obtained with differenttelescope/filter/instrument combinations. we also calculated v minus infraredcolor curves on the basis of a delayed detonation model and showed that thetheoretical color curves match the unreddened loci for type ia sne withmid-range decline rates to within 0.2 mag. given the completeness of the lightcurves and the elimination of filter-oriented systematic errors to some degree,the data presented here will be useful for the construction of photometrictemplates, especially in the infrared. on the whole the photometric behavior ofsn 2001el was quite normal. the second h-band maximum being brighter than thefirst h-band maximum is in accord with the prediction of krisciunas et al.(2000) for type ia sne with mid-range decline rates. the photometry exhibitsnon-zero host extinction, with total a_v = 0.57 +/- 0.05 mag along the line ofsight. ngc 1448, the host of sn 2001el, would be an excellent target for adistance determination using cepheids.

astro-ph;0304112	optical light curves of supernovae	photometry is the most easily acquired information about supernovae. thelight curves constructed from regular imaging provide signatures not only forthe energy input, the radiation escape, the local environment and theprogenitor stars, but also for the intervening dust. they are the main tool forthe use of supernovae as distance indicators through the determination of theluminosity. the light curve of sn 1987a still is the richest and longestobserved example for a core-collapse supernova. despite the peculiar nature ofthis object, as explosion of a blue supergiant, it displayed all thecharacteristics of type ii supernovae. the light curves of type ib/c supernovaeare more homogeneous, but still display the signatures of explosions in massivestars, among them early interaction with their circumstellar material. wrinklesin the near-uniform appearance of thermonuclear (type ia) supernovae haveemerged during the past decade. subtle differences have been observedespecially at near-infrared wavelengths. interestingly, the light curve shapesappear to correlate with a variety of other characteristics of thesesupernovae. the construction of bolometric light curves provides the mostdirect link to theoretical predictions and can yield sorely needed constraintsfor the models. first steps in this direction have been already made.

(1998a) and perlmutter et al. (1999) that supernovaluminosity distances imply an accelerating universe. more importantly, theyextend the redshift range of consistently observed sn ia to z~1, where thesignature of cosmological effects has the opposite sign of some plausiblesystematic effects. consequently, these measurements not only provide anotherquantitative confirmation of the importance of dark energy, but also constitutea powerful qualitative test for the cosmological origin of cosmic acceleration.we find a rate for sn ia of 1.4+/-0.5e-04 h^3/mpc^3/yr at a mean redshift of0.5. we present distances and host extinctions for 230 sn ia. these place thefollowing constraints on cosmological quantities: if the equation of stateparameter of the dark energy is w=-1, then h0 t0 = 0.96+/-0.04, and o_l - 1.4o_m = 0.35+/-0.14. including the constraint of a flat universe, we find o_m =0.28+/-0.05, independent of any large-scale structure measurements. adopting aprior based on the 2df redshift survey constraint on o_m and assuming a flatuniverse, we find that the equation of state parameter of the dark energy liesin the range -1.48&lt;w&lt;-0.72 at 95% confidence. if we further assume that w&gt;-1,we obtain w&lt;-0.73 at 95% confidence. these constraints are similar in precisionand in value to recent results reported using the wmap satellite, also incombination with the 2df redshift survey.

astro-ph;0306270	evidence for an asymptotic giant branch star in the progenitor system of  a type ia supernova	a type ia supernova (sn ia), one of the two main classes of exploding stars,is recognized by the absence of hydrogen and the presence of elements such assilicon and sulphur in its spectra. these explosions are thought to produce themajority of iron-peak elements in the universe and are known to be precise"standard candles" used to measure distances to galaxies. while there isgeneral agreement that sne ia are exploding white dwarfs, astronomers face theembarassing problem that the progenitor systems have never been directlyobserved. significant effort has been put into the detection of circum-stellarmaterial (csm) in order to discriminate between the different types of possibleprogenitors systems, yet no csm has been found. here we report opticalobservations of sn 2002ic which reveal large amounts of csm seen as a stronghydrogen emission. this observation suggests that the progenitor systemcontained a massive asymptotic branch giant star which lost a few solar massesof hydrogen-rich gas prior to the type ia explosion.

(sn 1991bg, the prototype of thesubclass of fast declining type ia supernovae, is a special case.) thedispersion in the hubble diagram in jhk is only ~0.15 mag. the near-infraredproperties of type ia supernovae continue to be excellent measures of theluminosity distances to the supernova host galaxies, due to the need for onlysmall corrections from the epoch of observation to maximum light, lowdispersion in absolute magnitudes at maximum light, and the minimal reddeningeffects in the near-infrared.

(1998) to describe therising lightcurve immediately after explosion but constrains it to smoothlyjoin the remainder of the lightcurve. we fit this model to a composite observedvr-band lightcurve of three sne between redshifts of 0.135 to 0.165. these snehave not been k-corrected or adjusted to account for reddening. in thisredshift range, the observed vr-band most closely matches the rest framev-band. using the best fit to our functional description of the lightcurve, wefind the time between explosion and observed vr-band maximum to be17.6+-1.3(stat)+-0.07(sys) rest-frame days for a sn ia with a vr-band deltam_{-10} of 0.52mag. for the redshifts sampled, the observed vr-bandtime-of-maximum brightness should be the same as the rest-frame v-band maximumto within 1.1 rest-frame days.

astro-ph;0609268	the type ia supernova 2004s, a clone of sn 2001el, and the optimal  photometric bands for extinction estimation	we present optical (ubvri) and near-infrared (yjhk) photometry of the normaltype ia supernova 2004s. we also present eight optical spectra and one near-irspectrum of sn 2004s. the light curves and spectra are nearly identical tothose of sn 2001el. this is the first time we have seen optical and ir lightcurves of two type ia supernovae match so closely. within the one parameterfamily of light curves for normal type ia supernovae, that two objects shouldhave such similar light curves implies that they had identical intrinsic colorsand produced similar amounts of ni-56. from the similarities of the light curveshapes we obtain a set of extinctions as a function of wavelength which allowsa simultaneous solution for the distance modulus difference of the two objects,the difference of the host galaxy extinctions, and r_v. since sn 2001el hadroughly an order of magnitude more host galaxy extinction than sn 2004s, thevalue of r_v = 2.15 (+0.24 -0.22) pertains primarily to dust in the host galaxyof sn 2001el. we have also shown via monte carlo simulations that adding restframe j-band photometry to the complement of bvri photometry of type ia snedecreases the uncertainty in the distance modulus by a factor of 2.7. acombination of rest frame optical and near-ir photometry clearly gives moreaccurate distances than using rest frame optical photometry alone.

astro-ph;9601013	the abundance spread among giants and subgiants in the globular cluster  omega centauri	we present spectroscopic abundances and radial velocities for giant stars inthe galactic globular cluster omega centauri based on the caii infraredtriplet. two samples of stars were observed: 234 stars at m_v = 1.25 on thelower giant branch at radial distances between 8 and 23arcmin, and 145 stars atm_v = -1.3 at radial distances between 3 and 22arcmin. previous metallicitystudies found a non-gaussian metallicity distribution containing a tail ofmetal-rich stars. we confirm these results except our unbiased clustermetallicity distributions are significantly narrower. they contain thefollowing key features: (1) no very metal-poor stars, (2) a sudden rise in themetal-poor distribution to a modal [fe/h] value of --1.70 consistent with anhomogeneous metallicity unresolved at the 0.07 dex level, (3) a tail to highermetallicities with more stars than predicted by simple chemical evolutionmodels, and (4) a weak correlation between metallicity and radius such that themost metal-rich stars are concentrated to the cluster core. the unresolvedmetal-weak tail implies that the gas out of which omega cen formed waswell-mixed up to the modal metallicity of the cluster. therefore, omega cenlike other galactic globular clusters, seems to have formed in a pre-enrichedand homogenized (up to the modal metallicity) environment. the existence of aweak metallicity gradient supports the idea that omega cen self-enriched, withthe enriched gas sinking to the cluster center due to gas dissipationprocesses. we also note, however, that the metal-rich stars are more massivethan the bulk of the stars in the cluster, and may have sunk to the center bydynamical mass segregation over the lifetime of the cluster.

astro-ph;9601094	a preliminary discussion of the kinematics of bhb and rr lyrae stars  near the north galactic pole	the radial velocity dispersion of 67 rr lyrae variable and blue horizontalbranch (bhb) stars that are more than 4 kpc above the galactic plane at thenorth galactic pole is 110 km/sec and shows no trend with z (the height abovethe galactic plane). nine stars with z &lt; 4 kpc show a smaller velocitydispersion (40 +/-9 km/sec) as is to be expected if they mostly belong to apopulation with a flatter distribution. both rr lyrae stars and bhb stars showevidence of stream motion; the most significant is in fields rr2 and rr3 where24 stars in the range 4.0 &lt; z &lt; 11.0 kpc have a mean radial velocity of -59 +/-16 km/sec. three halo stars in field rr 2 appear to be part of a moving groupwith a common radial velocity of -90 km/sec. the streaming phenomenon thereforeoccurs over a range of spatial scales. the bhb and rr lyrae stars in our sampleboth have a similar range of metallicity (-1.2 &lt; [fe/h] &lt; -2.2). proper motionsof bhb stars in fields sa 57 (ngp) and the anticenter field (rr 7) (both ofwhich lie close to the meridional plane of the galaxy) show that the stars thathave z &lt; 4 kpc as well as those with z &gt; 4 kpc have a galactic v motion that is&lt; -200 km/sec and which is characteristic of the halo. thus the stars that havea flatter distribution are really halo stars and not members of the metal-weakthick-disk.

astro-ph;9609062	the hubble diagram of the calan/tololo type ia supernovae and the value  of ho	the calan/tololo supernova survey has discovered ~30 type ia supernovae outto z~0.1. using bvi data for these objects and nearby sne ia, we have shownthat there exists a significant dispersion in the intrinsic luminosities ofthese objects. we have devised a robust chisquare minimization techniquesimultaneously fitting the bvi light curves to parametrize the sn event as afunction of (tb,m, m15(b)) where tb is the time of b maximum, m is the peak bvimagnitude corrected for luminosity variations, and m15(b) is a single parameterdescribing the whole light curve morphology. when properly corrected form15(b), sne ia prove to be high precision distance indicators,yielding relativedistances with errors 7-10%. the corrected peak magnitudes are used toconstruct bvi hubble diagrams (hd), and with cepheid distances recentlymeasured with the hst to four nearby sne ia (37c, 72e, 81b, 90n) we derive avalue of the hubble constant of 63.1+/-3.4 (internal) km/s/mpc. this value is~10-15% larger than the value obtained by assuming that sne ia are perfectstandard candles. as we have shown in paper v, there is now strong evidencethat galaxies with younger stellar population appear to host theslowest-declining, and therefore most luminous sne ia. hence, the use of pop iobjects such as cepheids to calibrate the zero point of the sne ia hd caneasily bias the results toward luminous sne ia, unless the absolutemagnitude-decline relation is taken into account.

astro-ph;9805200	the high-z supernova search: measuring cosmic deceleration and global  cur vature of the universe using type ia supernovae	the high-z supernova search is an international collaboration to discover andmonitor type ia supernovae (sn ia) at $z &gt; 0.2$ with the aim of measuringcosmic deceleration and global curvature. our collaboration has pursued a basicunderstanding of supernovae in the nearby universe, discovering and observing alarge sample of objects, and developing methods to measure accurate distanceswith sn ia. this paper describes the extension of this program to $z \geq 0.2$,outlining our search techniques and follow-up program. we have devisedhigh-throughput filters which provide accurate two-color restframe $b$ and $v$light curves of sn ia, enabling us to produce precise, extinction-correctedluminosity distances in the range $0.25 &lt; z &lt; 0.55$. sources of systematicerror from k-corrections, extinction, selection effects, and evolution areinvestigated, and their effects estimated. we present photometric and spectralobservations of sn 1995k, our program's first supernova, and use the data toobtain a precise measurement of the luminosity distance to the $z=0.479$ hostgalaxy. this object, when combined with a nearby sample of sn, yields anestimate for the matter density of the universe of $\omega_m =-0.2^{+1.0}_{-0.8}$ if $\omega_\lambda = 0$. for a spatially flat universecomposed of normal matter and a cosmological constant, we find $\omega_m =0.4^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$, $\omega_\lambda = 0.6^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$. we demonstrate thatwith a sample of $\sim 30$ objects, we should be able to determine relativeluminosity distances over the range $0 &lt; z&lt; 0.5$ with sufficient precision tomeasure $\omega_m$ with an uncertainty of $\pm 0.2$.

astro-ph;9805201	observational evidence from supernovae for an accelerating universe and  a cosmological constant	we present observations of 10 type ia supernovae (sne ia) between 0.16 &lt; z &lt;0.62. with previous data from our high-z supernova search team, this expandedset of 16 high-redshift supernovae and 34 nearby supernovae are used to placeconstraints on the hubble constant (h_0), the mass density (omega_m), thecosmological constant (omega_lambda), the deceleration parameter (q_0), and thedynamical age of the universe (t_0). the distances of the high-redshift sne iaare, on average, 10% to 15% farther than expected in a low mass density(omega_m=0.2) universe without a cosmological constant. different light curvefitting methods, sn ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favoreternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e.,omega_lambda &gt; 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q_0 &lt; 0).with no prior constraint on mass density other than omega_m &gt; 0, thespectroscopically confirmed sne ia are consistent with q_0 &lt;0 at the 2.8 sigmaand 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with omega_lambda &gt;0 at the 3.0 sigma and4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. fixing a``minimal'' mass density, omega_m=0.2, results in the weakest detection,omega_lambda&gt;0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. for a flat-universe prior(omega_m+omega_lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed sne ia requireomega_lambda &gt;0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. auniverse closed by ordinary matter (i.e., omega_m=1) is ruled out at the 7sigma to 8 sigma level. we estimate the size of systematic errors, includingevolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitationallensing, and sample contamination. presently, none of these effects reconcilesthe data with omega_lambda=0 and q_0 &gt; 0.

astro-ph;9811205	optical light curve of the type ia supernova 1998bu in m96 and the  supernova calibration of the hubble constant	we present the ubvri light curves of the type ia supernova sn 1998bu whichappeared in the nearby galaxy m96 (ngc 3368). m96 is a spiral galaxy in the leoi group which has a cepheid-based distance. our photometry allows us tocalculate the absolute magnitude and reddening of this supernova. these data,when combined with measurements of the four other well-observed supernovae withcepheid based distances, allow us to calculate the hubble constant with respectto the hubble flow defined by the distant calan/tololo type ia sample. we finda hubble constant of 64.0 +/- 2.2(internal) +/- 3.5(external) km/s/mpc,consistent with most previous estimates based on type ia supernovae. we notethat the two well-observed type ia supernovae in fornax, if placed at thecepheid distance to the possible fornax spiral ngc 1365, are apparently toofaint with respect to the calan/tololo sample calibrated with the five type iasupernovae with cepheid distances to the host galaxies.

astro-ph;9905370	star-to-star abundance variations among bright giants in the mildly  metal-poor globular cluster m4	we present a chemical composition analysis of 36 giants in the nearby mildymetal-poor (&lt;[fe/h]&gt; = -1.18) "cn-bimodal" globular cluster m4. confronted witha cluster that has large and variable interstellar extinction across thecluster face, we combined traditional spectroscopic abundance methods withmodifications to line-depth ratio techniques to determine the atmosphericparameters of our stars. we derive a total-to-selective extinction ratio of 3.4and an average &lt;e(b-v)&gt; reddening of 0.33 which is significantly lower thanthat estimated by using the dust maps made by schlegel et al. (1998).  abundance ratios for sc, ti, v, ni, &amp; eu are typical of halo field andcluster stars. however, si, al, ba, &amp; la are overabundant with respect to whatis seen in other globular clusters of similar metallicity. superimposed on theprimordial abundance distribution is evidence for the existence ofproton-capture synthesis. we recover some of the c, n, o, na, mg, &amp; alabundance swings and correlations found in other more metal-poor globularclusters but the range of variation is muted. the al enhancements appear to befrom the destruction of 25,26mg, not 24mg. the c+n+o abundance sum is constantto within the observational errors, and agrees with the c+n+o total that mightbe expected for m4 stars at birth.  the m4 agb stars have c,n,o abundances that show less evidence for proton-capture nucleosynthesis than is found in the less-evolved stars of the rgb.deeply-mixed stars of the rgb, subsequent to the helium core flash, might takeup residence on the blue end of the hb, and thus fail to evolve back to the agbbut reasons for skepticism concerning this scenario are noted.

astro-ph;9909058	the luminous type ic sn 1992ar at z=0.145	we present spectroscopic and photometric observations of sn1992ar, the moredistant sn in the calan/tololo survey. we compare its spectrum with those ofnearby type ia and ic sne and conclude that the latter type is a better matchto sn 1992ar. using k-corrections based on the spectra of well observed type icand ia sne we compute different possible rest frame light curves of sn 1992arand compare them with those of representative sne of each type observed in thenearby universe. from the photometry and the spectra, we are able to concludethat sn 1992ar cannot be matched by any known example of a type ia sn. eventhough the data set collected is fairly complete (one spectrum and 10photometric points), it is not possible to decide whether sn 1992ar was a fasttype ic sn, like sn 1994i, or a slow one, like sn 1983v. the absolute vmagnitudes at maximum implied by each of these possibilities are -19.2 and-20.2, respectively. the latter would make sn 1992ar one of the brightest sneon record. sn 1992ar, hence, illustrates the problem of contamination faced bythe high z type ia sne samples whose luminosity distances are used to determinethe cosmological parameters of the universe. we present observational criteriato distinguish the two sn types when the siii 6355 line is redshifted out ofthe sensitivity range of typical ccd detectors, and discuss the effect thatthese luminous type ic sne would have on the measured cosmological parameters,if not removed from the high-z type ia sn samples.
