0706.2619	algorithms for omega-regular games with imperfect information	we study observation-based strategies for two-player turn-based games ongraphs with omega-regular objectives. an observation-based strategy relies onimperfect information about the history of a play, namely, on the past sequenceof observations. such games occur in the synthesis of a controller that doesnot see the private state of the plant. our main results are twofold. first, wegive a fixed-point algorithm for computing the set of states from which aplayer can win with a deterministic observation-based strategy for anyomega-regular objective. the fixed point is computed in the lattice ofantichains of state sets. this algorithm has the advantages of being directedby the objective and of avoiding an explicit subset construction on the gamegraph. second, we give an algorithm for computing the set of states from whicha player can win with probability 1 with a randomized observation-basedstrategy for a buechi objective. this set is of interest because in the absenceof perfect information, randomized strategies are more powerful thandeterministic ones. we show that our algorithms are optimal by proving matchinglower bounds.

0903.2445	qualitative logics and equivalences for probabilistic systems	we investigate logics and equivalence relations that capture the qualitativebehavior of markov decision processes (mdps). we present qualitative randomizedctl (qrctl): formulas of this logic can express the fact that certain temporalproperties hold over all paths, or with probability 0 or 1, but they do notdistinguish among intermediate probability values. we present a symbolic,polynomial time model-checking algorithm for qrctl on mdps.  the logic qrctl induces an equivalence relation over states of an mdp that wecall qualitative equivalence: informally, two states are qualitativelyequivalent if the sets of formulas that hold with probability 0 or 1 at the twostates are the same. we show that for finite alternating mdps, wherenondeterministic and probabilistic choices occur in different states,qualitative equivalence coincides with alternating bisimulation, and can thusbe computed via efficient partition-refinement algorithms. on the other hand,in non-alternating mdps the equivalence relations cannot be computed viapartition-refinement algorithms, but rather, they require non-localcomputation. finally, we consider qrctl*, that extends qrctl with nestedtemporal operators in the same manner in which ctl* extends ctl. we show thatqrctl and qrctl* induce the same qualitative equivalence on alternating mdps,while on non-alternating mdps, the equivalence arising from qrctl* can bestrictly finer. we also provide a full characterization of the relation betweenqualitative equivalence, bisimulation, and alternating bisimulation, accordingto whether the mdps are finite, and to whether their transition relations arefinitely-branching.

0905.2195	expressiveness and closure properties for quantitative languages	weighted automata are nondeterministic automata with numerical weights ontransitions. they can define quantitative languages $l$ that assign to eachword $w$ a real number $l(w)$. in the case of infinite words, the value of arun is naturally computed as the maximum, limsup, liminf, limit average, ordiscounted sum of the transition weights. we study expressiveness and closurequestions about these quantitative languages.  we first show that the set of words with value greater than a threshold canbe non-$\omega$-regular for deterministic limit-average and discounted-sumautomata, while this set is always $\omega$-regular when the threshold isisolated (i.e., some neighborhood around the threshold contains no word). inthe latter case, we prove that the $\omega$-regular language is robust againstsmall perturbations of the transition weights.  we next consider automata with transition weights 0 or 1 and show that theyare as expressive as general weighted automata in the limit-average case, butnot in the discounted-sum case.  third, for quantitative languages $l_1$ and $l_2$, we consider the operations$\max(l_1,l_2)$, $\min(l_1,l_2)$, and $1-l_1$, which generalize the booleanoperations on languages, as well as the sum $l_1 + l_2$. we establish theclosure properties of all classes of quantitative languages with respect tothese four operations.

0909.1647	probabilistic weighted automata	nondeterministic weighted automata are finite automata with numerical weightson transitions. they define quantitative languages l that assign to each word wa real number l(w). the value of an infinite word w is computed as the maximalvalue of all runs over w, and the value of a run as the maximum, limsup,liminf, limit average, or discounted sum of the transition weights. weintroduce probabilistic weighted automata, in which the transitions are chosenin a randomized (rather than nondeterministic) fashion. under almost-suresemantics (resp. positive semantics), the value of a word w is the largest realv such that the runs over w have value at least v with probability 1 (resp.positive probability).  we study the classical questions of automata theory for probabilisticweighted automata: emptiness and universality, expressiveness, and closureunder various operations on languages. for quantitative languages, emptinessand universality are defined as whether the value of some (resp. every) wordexceeds a given threshold. we prove some of these questions to be decidable,and others undecidable. regarding expressive power, we show that probabilitiesallow us to define a wide variety of new classes of quantitative languages,except for discounted-sum automata, where probabilistic choice is no moreexpressive than nondeterminism. finally, we give an almost complete picture ofthe closure of various classes of probabilistic weighted automata for thefollowing pointwise operations on quantitative languages: max, min, sum, andnumerical complement.

1001.5183	energy parity games	energy parity games are infinite two-player turn-based games played onweighted graphs. the objective of the game combines a (qualitative) paritycondition with the (quantitative) requirement that the sum of the weights(i.e., the level of energy in the game) must remain positive. beside their owninterest in the design and synthesis of resource-constrained omega-regularspecifications, energy parity games provide one of the simplest model of gameswith combined qualitative and quantitative objective. our main results are asfollows: (a) exponential memory is necessary and sufficient for winningstrategies in energy parity games; (b) the problem of deciding the winner inenergy parity games can be solved in np \cap conp; and (c) we give an algorithmto solve energy parity by reduction to energy games. we also show that theproblem of deciding the winner in energy parity games is polynomiallyequivalent to the problem of deciding the winner in mean-payoff parity games,while optimal strategies may require infinite memory in mean-payoff paritygames. as a consequence we obtain a conceptually simple algorithm to solvemean-payoff parity games.

1004.0739	measuring and synthesizing systems in probabilistic environments	often one has a preference order among the different systems that satisfy agiven specification. under a probabilistic assumption about the possibleinputs, such a preference order is naturally expressed by a weighted automaton,which assigns to each word a value, such that a system is preferred if itgenerates a higher expected value. we solve the following optimal-synthesisproblem: given an omega-regular specification, a markov chain that describesthe distribution of inputs, and a weighted automaton that measures how well asystem satisfies the given specification under the given input assumption,synthesize a system that optimizes the measured value.  for safety specifications and measures given by mean-payoff automata, theoptimal-synthesis problem amounts to finding a strategy in a markov decisionprocess (mdp) that is optimal for a long-run average reward objective, whichcan be done in polynomial time. for general omega-regular specifications, thesolution rests on a new, polynomial-time algorithm for computing optimalstrategies in mdps with mean-payoff parity objectives.  our algorithm generates optimal strategies consisting of two memorylessstrategies and a counter. this counter is in general not bounded. to obtain afinite-state system, we show how to construct an \epsilon-optimal strategy witha bounded counter for any \epsilon&gt;0. we also show how to decide in polynomialtime if we can construct an optimal finite-state system (i.e., a system withouta counter) for a given specification.  we have implemented our approach in a tool that takes qualitative andquantitative specifications and automatically constructs a system thatsatisfies the qualitative specification and optimizes the quantitativespecification, if such a system exists. we present experimental results showingoptimal systems that were generated in this way.

1006.0673	randomness for free	we consider two-player zero-sum games on graphs. these games can beclassified on the basis of the information of the players and on the mode ofinteraction between them. on the basis of information the classification is asfollows: (a) partial-observation (both players have partial view of the game);(b) one-sided complete-observation (one player has complete observation); and(c) complete-observation (both players have complete view of the game). on thebasis of mode of interaction we have the following classification: (a)concurrent (both players interact simultaneously); and (b) turn-based (bothplayers interact in turn). the two sources of randomness in these games arerandomness in transition function and randomness in strategies. in general,randomized strategies are more powerful than deterministic strategies, andrandomness in transitions gives more general classes of games. in this work wepresent a complete characterization for the classes of games where randomnessis not helpful in: (a) the transition function probabilistic transition can besimulated by deterministic transition); and (b) strategies (pure strategies areas powerful as randomized strategies). as consequence of our characterizationwe obtain new undecidability results for these games.

1006.1492	mean-payoff automaton expressions	quantitative languages are an extension of boolean languages that assign toeach word a real number. mean-payoff automata are finite automata withnumerical weights on transitions that assign to each infinite path the long-runaverage of the transition weights. when the mode of branching of the automatonis deterministic, nondeterministic, or alternating, the corresponding class ofquantitative languages is not robust as it is not closed under the pointwiseoperations of max, min, sum, and numerical complement. nondeterministic andalternating mean-payoff automata are not decidable either, as the quantitativegeneralization of the problems of universality and language inclusion isundecidable.  we introduce a new class of quantitative languages, defined by mean-payoffautomaton expressions, which is robust and decidable: it is closed under thefour pointwise operations, and we show that all decision problems are decidablefor this class. mean-payoff automaton expressions subsume deterministicmean-payoff automata, and we show that they have expressive power incomparableto nondeterministic and alternating mean-payoff automata. we also present forthe first time an algorithm to compute distance between two quantitativelanguages, and in our case the quantitative languages are given as mean-payoffautomaton expressions.

1011.0688	timed parity games: complexity and robustness	we consider two-player games played in real time on game structures withclocks where the objectives of players are described using parity conditions.the games are \emph{concurrent} in that at each turn, both playersindependently propose a time delay and an action, and the action with theshorter delay is chosen. to prevent a player from winning by blocking time, werestrict each player to play strategies that ensure that the player cannot beresponsible for causing a zeno run. first, we present an efficient reduction ofthese games to \emph{turn-based} (i.e., not concurrent) \emph{finite-state}(i.e., untimed) parity games. our reduction improves the best known complexityfor solving timed parity games. moreover, the rich class of algorithms forclassical parity games can now be applied to timed parity games. the states ofthe resulting game are based on clock regions of the original game, and thestate space of the finite game is linear in the size of the region graph.  second, we consider two restricted classes of strategies for the player thatrepresents the controller in a real-time synthesis problem, namely,\emph{limit-robust} and \emph{bounded-robust} winning strategies. using alimit-robust winning strategy, the controller cannot choose an exactreal-valued time delay but must allow for some nonzero jitter in each of itsactions. if there is a given lower bound on the jitter, then the strategy isbounded-robust winning. we show that exact strategies are more powerful thanlimit-robust strategies, which are more powerful than bounded-robust winningstrategies for any bound. for both kinds of robust strategies, we presentefficient reductions to standard timed automaton games. these reductionsprovide algorithms for the synthesis of robust real-time controllers.

1101.1727	finitary languages	the class of omega-regular languages provides a robust specification languagein verification. every omega-regular condition can be decomposed into a safetypart and a liveness part. the liveness part ensures that something good happens"eventually". finitary liveness was proposed by alur and henzinger as astronger formulation of liveness. it requires that there exists an unknown,fixed bound b such that something good happens within b transitions. in thiswork we consider automata with finitary acceptance conditions defined byfinitary buchi, parity and streett languages. we study languages expressible bysuch automata: we give their topological complexity and present aregular-expression characterization. we compare the expressive power offinitary automata and give optimal algorithms for classical decisionsquestions. we show that the finitary languages are sigma 2-complete; we presenta complete picture of the expressive power of various classes of automata withfinitary and infinitary acceptance conditions; we show that the languagesdefined by finitary parity automata exactly characterize the star-free fragmentof omega b-regular languages; and we show that emptiness is nlogspace-completeand universality as well as language inclusion are pspace-complete for finitaryparity and streett automata.

1101.5842	synthesis of memory-efficient real-time controllers for safety  objectives (full version)	we study synthesis of controllers for real-time systems, where the objectiveis to stay in a given safe set. the problem is solved by obtaining winningstrategies in concurrent two-player \emph{timed automaton games} with safetyobjectives. to prevent a player from winning by blocking time, we restrict eachplayer to strategies that ensure that the player cannot be responsible forcausing a zeno run. we construct winning strategies for the controller whichrequire access only to (1) the system clocks (thus, controllers which requiretheir own internal infinitely precise clocks are not necessary), and (2) alinear (in the number of clocks) number of memory bits. precisely, we show thata memory of size $\big(3\cdot|c|+1 + \lg(|c|+1)\big)$ bits suffices for winningcontroller strategies for safety objectives, where $c$ is the set of clocks ofthe timed automaton game, significantly improving the previous knownexponential bound. we also settle the open question of whether \emph{region}strategies for controllers require memory for safety objectives by showing withan example that region strategies do require memory for safety objectives.

1104.3348	symbolic algorithms for qualitative analysis of markov decision  processes with b\"uchi objectives	we consider markov decision processes (mdps) with \omega-regularspecifications given as parity objectives. we consider the problem of computingthe set of almost-sure winning states from where the objective can be ensuredwith probability 1. the algorithms for the computation of the almost-surewinning set for parity objectives iteratively use the solutions for thealmost-sure winning set for b\"uchi objectives (a special case of parityobjectives). our contributions are as follows: first, we present the firstsubquadratic symbolic algorithm to compute the almost-sure winning set for mdpswith b\"uchi objectives; our algorithm takes o(n \sqrt{m}) symbolic steps ascompared to the previous known algorithm that takes o(n^2) symbolic steps,where $n$ is the number of states and $m$ is the number of edges of the mdp. inpractice mdps have constant out-degree, and then our symbolic algorithm takeso(n \sqrt{n}) symbolic steps, as compared to the previous known $o(n^2)$symbolic steps algorithm. second, we present a new algorithm, namely win-losealgorithm, with the following two properties: (a) the algorithm iterativelycomputes subsets of the almost-sure winning set and its complement, as comparedto all previous algorithms that discover the almost-sure winning set upontermination; and (b) requires o(n \sqrt{k}) symbolic steps, where k is themaximal number of edges of strongly connected components (scc's) of the mdp.the win-lose algorithm requires symbolic computation of scc's. third, weimprove the algorithm for symbolic scc computation; the previous knownalgorithm takes linear symbolic steps, and our new algorithm improves theconstants associated with the linear number of steps. in the worst case theprevious known algorithm takes 5n symbolic steps, whereas our new algorithmtakes 4n symbolic steps.

1104.3489	markov decision processes with multiple long-run average objectives	we study markov decision processes (mdps) with multiple limit-average (ormean-payoff) functions. we consider two different objectives, namely,expectation and satisfaction objectives. given an mdp with k limit-averagefunctions, in the expectation objective the goal is to maximize the expectedlimit-average value, and in the satisfaction objective the goal is to maximizethe probability of runs such that the limit-average value stays above a givenvector. we show that under the expectation objective, in contrast to the caseof one limit-average function, both randomization and memory are necessary forstrategies even for epsilon-approximation, and that finite-memory randomizedstrategies are sufficient for achieving pareto optimal values. under thesatisfaction objective, in contrast to the case of one limit-average function,infinite memory is necessary for strategies achieving a specific value (i.e.randomized finite-memory strategies are not sufficient), whereas memorylessrandomized strategies are sufficient for epsilon-approximation, for allepsilon&gt;0. we further prove that the decision problems for both expectation andsatisfaction objectives can be solved in polynomial time and the trade-offcurve (pareto curve) can be epsilon-approximated in time polynomial in the sizeof the mdp and 1/epsilon, and exponential in the number of limit-averagefunctions, for all epsilon&gt;0. our analysis also reveals flaws in previous workfor mdps with multiple mean-payoff functions under the expectation objective,corrects the flaws, and allows us to obtain improved results.

1104.4306	quantitative synthesis for concurrent programs	we present an algorithmic method for the quantitative, performance-awaresynthesis of concurrent programs. the input consists of a nondeterministicpartial program and of a parametric performance model. the nondeterminismallows the programmer to omit which (if any) synchronization construct is usedat a particular program location. the performance model, specified as aweighted automaton, can capture system architectures by assigning differentcosts to actions such as locking, context switching, and memory and cacheaccesses. the quantitative synthesis problem is to automatically resolve thenondeterminism of the partial program so that both correctness is guaranteedand performance is optimal. as is standard for shared memory concurrency,correctness is formalized "specification free", in particular as race freedomor deadlock freedom. for worst-case (average-case) performance, we show thatthe problem can be reduced to 2-player graph games (with probabilistictransitions) with quantitative objectives. while we show, using game-theoreticmethods, that the synthesis problem is nexp-complete, we present an algorithmicmethod and an implementation that works efficiently for concurrent programs andperformance models of practical interest. we have implemented a prototype tooland used it to synthesize finite-state concurrent programs that exhibitdifferent programming patterns, for several performance models representingdifferent architectures.

1107.2009	robustness of structurally equivalent concurrent parity games	we consider two-player stochastic games played on a finite state space for aninfinite number of rounds. the games are concurrent: in each round, the twoplayers (player 1 and player 2) choose their moves independently andsimultaneously; the current state and the two moves determine a probabilitydistribution over the successor states. we also consider the important specialcase of turn-based stochastic games where players make moves in turns, ratherthan concurrently. we study concurrent games with \omega-regular winningconditions specified as parity objectives. the value for player 1 for a parityobjective is the maximal probability with which the player can guarantee thesatisfaction of the objective against all strategies of the opponent. we studythe problem of continuity and robustness of the value function in concurrentand turn-based stochastic parity gameswith respect to imprecision in thetransition probabilities. we present quantitative bounds on the difference ofthe value function (in terms of the imprecision of the transitionprobabilities) and show the value continuity for structurally equivalentconcurrent games (two games are structurally equivalent if the support of thetransition function is same and the probabilities differ). we also showrobustness of optimal strategies for structurally equivalent turn-basedstochastic parity games. finally we show that the value continuity propertybreaks without the structurally equivalent assumption (even for markov chains)and show that our quantitative bound is asymptotically optimal. hence ourresults are tight (the assumption is both necessary and sufficient) and optimal(our quantitative bound is asymptotically optimal).

1107.2132	magnifying lens abstraction for stochastic games with discounted and  long-run average objectives	turn-based stochastic games and its important subclass markov decisionprocesses (mdps) provide models for systems with both probabilistic andnondeterministic behaviors. we consider turn-based stochastic games with twoclassical quantitative objectives: discounted-sum and long-run averageobjectives. the game models and the quantitative objectives are widely used inprobabilistic verification, planning, optimal inventory control, networkprotocol and performance analysis. games and mdps that model realistic systemsoften have very large state spaces, and probabilistic abstraction techniquesare necessary to handle the state-space explosion. the commonly usedfull-abstraction techniques do not yield space-savings for systems that havemany states with similar value, but does not necessarily have similartransition structure. a semi-abstraction technique, namely magnifying-lensabstractions (mla), that clusters states based on value only, disregardingdifferences in their transition relation was proposed for qualitativeobjectives (reachability and safety objectives). in this paper we extend themla technique to solve stochastic games with discounted-sum and long-runaverage objectives. we present the mla technique based abstraction-refinementalgorithm for stochastic games and mdps with discounted-sum objectives. forlong-run average objectives, our solution works for all mdps and a sub-class ofstochastic games where every state has the same value.

1107.2141	partial-observation stochastic games: how to win when belief fails	in two-player finite-state stochastic games of partial observation on graphs,in every state of the graph, the players simultaneously choose an action, andtheir joint actions determine a probability distribution over the successorstates. we consider reachability objectives where player 1 tries to ensure atarget state to be visited almost-surely or positively. on the basis ofinformation, the game can be one-sided with either (a)player 1 or (b)player 2having partial observation, or two-sided with both players having partialobservation. on the basis of randomization (a)players may not be allowed to userandomization (pure strategies), or (b)may choose a probability distributionover actions but the actual random choice is not visible (actions invisible),or (c)may use full randomization. our results for pure strategies are asfollows: (1)for one-sided games with player 2 perfect observation we show thatbelief-based strategies are not sufficient, and present an exponential upperbound on memory both for almost-sure and positive winning strategies; we showthat the problem of deciding the existence of almost-sure and positive winningstrategies for player 1 is exptime-complete and present symbolic algorithmsthat avoid the explicit exponential construction. (2)for one-sided games withplayer 1 perfect observation we show that non-elementary memory is bothnecessary and sufficient for both almost-sure and positive winning strategies.(3)we show that for the two-sided case finite memory strategies are sufficientfor both positive and almost-sure winning. we establish the equivalence of thealmost-sure winning problem for pure strategies with randomized strategies withactions invisible. our equivalence result exhibit serious flaws in previousresults in the literature: we show a non-elementary memory lower bound foralmost-sure winning whereas an exponential upper bound was claimed.

1107.2146	bounded rationality in concurrent parity games	we consider 2-player games played on a finite state space for infiniterounds. the games are concurrent: in each round, the two players choose theirmoves simultaneously; the current state and the moves determine the successor.we consider omega-regular winning conditions given as parity objectives. weconsider the qualitative analysis problems: the computation of the almost-sureand limit-sure winning set of states, where player 1 can ensure to win withprobability 1 and with probability arbitrarily close to 1, respectively. ingeneral the almost-sure and limit-sure winning strategies require bothinfinite-memory and infinite-precision. we study the bounded-rationalityproblem for qualitative analysis of concurrent parity games, where the strategyset player 1 is restricted to bounded-resource strategies. in terms ofprecision, strategies can be deterministic, uniform, finite-precision orinfinite-precision; and in terms of memory, strategies can be memoryless,finite-memory or infinite-memory. we present a precise and completecharacterization of the qualitative winning sets for all combinations ofclasses of strategies. in particular, we show that uniform memorylessstrategies are as powerful as finite-precision infinite-memory strategies, andinfinite-precision memoryless strategies are as powerful as infinite-precisionfinite-memory strategies. we show that the winning sets can be computed ino(n^{2d+3}) time, where n is the size of the game and 2d is the number ofpriorities, and our algorithms are symbolic. the membership problem of whethera state belongs to a winning set can be decided in np cap conp. while thiscomplexity is the same as for the simpler class of turn-based games, where ineach state only one of the players has a choice of moves, our algorithms, thatare obtained by characterization of the winning sets as mu-calculus formulas,are considerably more involved.

1201.2834	strategy improvement for concurrent reachability and safety games	we consider concurrent games played on graphs. at every round of a game, eachplayer simultaneously and independently selects a move; the moves jointlydetermine the transition to a successor state. two basic objectives are thesafety objective to stay forever in a given set of states, and its dual, thereachability objective to reach a given set of states. first, we present asimple proof of the fact that in concurrent reachability games, for all$\epsilon&gt;0$, memoryless $\epsilon$-optimal strategies exist. a memorylessstrategy is independent of the history of plays, and an $\epsilon$-optimalstrategy achieves the objective with probability within $\epsilon$ of the valueof the game. in contrast to previous proofs of this fact, our proof is moreelementary and more combinatorial. second, we present a strategy-improvement(a.k.a.\ policy-iteration) algorithm for concurrent games with reachabilityobjectives. we then present a strategy-improvement algorithm for concurrentgames with safety objectives. our algorithms yield sequences of player-1strategies which ensure probabilities of winning that converge monotonically tothe value of the game. our result is significant because thestrategy-improvement algorithm for safety games provides, for the first time, away to approximate the value of a concurrent safety game from below. previousmethods could approximate the values of these games only from one direction,and as no rates of convergence are known, they did not provide a practical wayto solve these games.

1206.5174	obligation blackwell games and p-automata	we recently introduced p-automata, automata that read discrete-time markovchains. we used turn-based stochastic parity games to define acceptance ofmarkov chains by a subclass of p-automata. definition of acceptance required acumbersome and complicated reduction to a series of turn-based stochasticparity games. the reduction could not support acceptance by general p-automata,which was left undefined as there was no notion of games that supported it.  here we generalize two-player games by adding a structural acceptancecondition called obligations. obligations are orthogonal to the linear winningconditions that define winning. obligations are a declaration that player 0 canachieve a certain value from a configuration. if the obligation is met, thevalue of that configuration for player 0 is 1.  one cannot define value in obligation games by the standard mechanism ofconsidering the measure of winning paths on a markov chain and taking thesupremum of the infimum of all strategies. mainly because obligations needdefinition even for markov chains and the nature of obligations has the flavorof an infinite nesting of supremum and infimum operators. we define value via areduction to turn-based games similar to martin's proof of determinacy ofblackwell games with borel objectives. based on this definition, we show thatgames are determined. we show that for markov chains with borel objectives andobligations, and finite turn-based stochastic parity games with obligationsthere exists an alternative and simpler characterization of the value function.based on this simpler definition we give an exponential time algorithm toanalyze finite turn-based stochastic parity games with obligations. finally, weshow that obligation games provide the necessary framework for reasoning aboutp-automata and that they generalize the previous definition.

1209.3234	the complexity of multi-mean-payoff and multi-energy games	in mean-payoff games, the objective of the protagonist is to ensure that thelimit average of an infinite sequence of numeric weights is nonnegative. inenergy games, the objective is to ensure that the running sum of weights isalways nonnegative. multi-mean-payoff and multi-energy games replace individualweights by tuples, and the limit average (resp. running sum) of each coordinatemust be (resp. remain) nonnegative. these games have applications in thesynthesis of resource-bounded processes with multiple resources.  we prove the finite-memory determinacy of multi-energy games and show theinter-reducibility of multimean-payoff and multi-energy games for finite-memorystrategies. we also improve the computational complexity for solving bothclasses of games with finite-memory strategies: while the previously best knownupper bound was expspace, and no lower bound was known, we give an optimalconp-complete bound. for memoryless strategies, we show that the problem ofdeciding the existence of a winning strategy for the protagonist isnp-complete. finally we present the first solution of multi-meanpayoff gameswith infinite-memory strategies. we show that multi-mean-payoff games withmean-payoff-sup objectives can be decided in np and conp, whereasmulti-mean-payoff games with mean-payoff-inf objectives are conp-complete.

1210.3141	hyperplane separation technique for multidimensional mean-payoff games	we consider both finite-state game graphs and recursive game graphs (orpushdown game graphs), that can model the control flow of sequential programswith recursion, with multi-dimensional mean-payoff objectives. in pushdowngames two types of strategies are relevant: global strategies, that depend onthe entire global history; and modular strategies, that have only local memoryand thus do not depend on the context of invocation. we present solutions toseveral fundamental algorithmic questions and our main contributions are asfollows: (1) we show that finite-state multi-dimensional mean-payoff games canbe solved in polynomial time if the number of dimensions and the maximalabsolute value of the weight is fixed; whereas if the number of dimensions isarbitrary, then problem is already known to be conp-complete. (2) we show thatpushdown graphs with multi-dimensional mean-payoff objectives can be solved inpolynomial time. (3) for pushdown games under global strategies both single andmulti-dimensional mean-payoff objectives problems are known to be undecidable,and we show that under modular strategies the multi-dimensional problem is alsoundecidable (whereas under modular strategies the single dimensional problem isnp-complete). we show that if the number of modules, the number of exits, andthe maximal absolute value of the weight is fixed, then pushdown games undermodular strategies with single dimensional mean-payoff objectives can be solvedin polynomial time, and if either of the number of exits or the number ofmodules is not bounded, then the problem is np-hard. (4) finally we show that afixed parameter tractable algorithm for finite-state multi-dimensionalmean-payoff games or pushdown games under modular strategies withsingle-dimensional mean-payoff objectives would imply the solution of thelong-standing open problem of fixed parameter tractability of parity games.

1212.6556	quantitative timed simulation functions and refinement metrics for timed  systems (full version)	we introduce quantatitive timed refinement and timed simulation (directed)metrics, incorporating zenoness check s, for timed systems. these metricsassign positive real numbers between zero and infinity which quantify the\emph{timing mismatches} between two timed systems, amongst non-zeno runs. wequantify timing mismatches in three ways: (1) the maximal timing mismatch thatcan arise, (2) the "steady-state" maximal timing mismatches, where initialtransient timing mismatches are ignored; and (3) the (long-run) average timingmismatches amongst two systems. these three kinds of mismatches constitutethree important types of timing differences. our event times are the\emph{global times}, measured from the start of the system execution, not justthe time durations of individual steps. we present algorithms over timedautomata for computing the three quantitative simulation distances to withinany desired degree of accuracy. in order to compute the values of thequantitative simulation distances, we use a game theoretic formulation. weintroduce two new kinds of objectives for two player games on finite-state gamegraphs: (1) eventual debit-sum level objectives, and (2) average debit-sumlevel objectives. we present algorithms for computing the optimal values forthese objectives in graph games, and then use these algorithms to compute thevalues of the timed simulation distances over timed automata.

1305.4103	trading performance for stability in markov decision processes	we study the complexity of central controller synthesis problems forfinite-state markov decision processes, where the objective is to optimize boththe expected mean-payoff performance of the system and its stability.  we argue that the basic theoretical notion of expressing the stability interms of the variance of the mean-payoff (called global variance in our paper)is not always sufficient, since it ignores possible instabilities on respectiveruns. for this reason we propose alernative definitions of stability, which wecall local and hybrid variance, and which express how rewards on each rundeviate from the run's own mean-payoff and from the expected mean-payoff,respectively.  we show that a strategy ensuring both the expected mean-payoff and thevariance below given bounds requires randomization and memory, under all theabove semantics of variance. we then look at the problem of determining whetherthere is a such a strategy. for the global variance, we show that the problemis in pspace, and that the answer can be approximated in pseudo-polynomialtime. for the hybrid variance, the analogous decision problem is in np, and apolynomial-time approximating algorithm also exists. for local variance, weshow that the decision problem is in np. since the overall performance can betraded for stability (and vice versa), we also present algorithms forapproximating the associated pareto curve in all the three cases.  finally, we study a special case of the decision problems, where we require agiven expected mean-payoff together with zero variance. here we show that theproblems can be all solved in polynomial time.

1308.4256	forgiver triumphs in alternating prisoner's dilemma	cooperative behavior, where one individual incurs a cost to help another, isa wide spread phenomenon. here we study direct reciprocity in the context ofthe alternating prisoner's dilemma. we consider all strategies that can beimplemented by one and two-state automata. we calculate the payoff matrix ofall pairwise encounters in the presence of noise. we explore deterministicselection dynamics with and without mutation. using different error rates andpayoff values, we observe convergence to a small number of distinct equilibria.two of them are uncooperative strict nash equilibria representing always-defect(alld) and grim. the third equilibrium is mixed and represents a cooperativealliance of several strategies, dominated by a strategy which we call forgiver.forgiver cooperates whenever the opponent has cooperated; it defects once whenthe opponent has defected, but subsequently forgiver attempts to re-establishcooperation even if the opponent has defected again. forgiver is not anevolutionarily stable strategy, but the alliance, which it rules, isasymptotically stable. for a wide range of parameter values the most commonlyobserved outcome is convergence to the mixed equilibrium, dominated byforgiver. our results show that although forgiving might incur a short-termloss it can lead to a long-term gain. forgiveness facilitates stablecooperation in the presence of exploitation and noise.

1402.2967	verification of markov decision processes using learning algorithms	we present a general framework for applying machine-learning algorithms tothe verification of markov decision processes (mdps). the primary goal of thesetechniques is to improve performance by avoiding an exhaustive exploration ofthe state space. our framework focuses on probabilistic reachability, which isa core property for verification, and is illustrated through two distinctinstantiations. the first assumes that full knowledge of the mdp is available,and performs a heuristic-driven partial exploration of the model, yieldingprecise lower and upper bounds on the required probability. the second tacklesthe case where we may only sample the mdp, and yields probabilistic guarantees,again in terms of both the lower and upper bounds, which provides efficientstopping criteria for the approximation. the latter is the first extension ofstatistical model-checking for unbounded properties in mdps. in contrast withother related approaches, we do not restrict our attention to time-bounded(finite-horizon) or discounted properties, nor assume any particular propertiesof the mdp. we also show how our techniques extend to ltl objectives. wepresent experimental results showing the performance of our framework onseveral examples.

1409.5306	qualitative analysis of concurrent mean-payoff games	we consider concurrent games played by two-players on a finite-state graph,where in every round the players simultaneously choose a move, and the currentstate along with the joint moves determine the successor state. we study afundamental objective, namely, mean-payoff objective, where a reward isassociated to each transition, and the goal of player 1 is to maximize thelong-run average of the rewards, and the objective of player 2 is strictly theopposite. the path constraint for player 1 could be qualitative, i.e., themean-payoff is the maximal reward, or arbitrarily close to it; or quantitative,i.e., a given threshold between the minimal and maximal reward. we consider thecomputation of the almost-sure (resp. positive) winning sets, where player 1can ensure that the path constraint is satisfied with probability 1 (resp.positive probability). our main results for qualitative path constraints are asfollows: (1) we establish qualitative determinacy results that show that forevery state either player 1 has a strategy to ensure almost-sure (resp.positive) winning against all player-2 strategies, or player 2 has a spoilingstrategy to falsify almost-sure (resp. positive) winning against all player-1strategies; (2) we present optimal strategy complexity results that preciselycharacterize the classes of strategies required for almost-sure and positivewinning for both players; and (3) we present quadratic time algorithms tocompute the almost-sure and the positive winning sets, matching the best knownbound of algorithms for much simpler problems (such as reachabilityobjectives). for quantitative constraints we show that a polynomial timesolution for the almost-sure or the positive winning set would imply a solutionto a long-standing open problem (the value problem for turn-based deterministicmean-payoff games) that is not known to be solvable in polynomial time.

1410.7724	faster algorithms for algebraic path properties in rsms with constant  treewidth	interprocedural analysis is at the heart of numerous applications inprogramming languages, such as alias analysis, constant propagation, etc.recursive state machines (rsms) are standard models for interproceduralanalysis. we consider a general framework with rsms where the transitions arelabeled from a semiring, and path properties are algebraic with semiringoperations. rsms with algebraic path properties can model interproceduraldataflow analysis problems, the shortest path problem, the most probable pathproblem, etc. the traditional algorithms for interprocedural analysis focus onpath properties where the starting point is \emph{fixed} as the entry point ofa specific method. in this work, we consider possible multiple queries asrequired in many applications such as in alias analysis. the study of multiplequeries allows us to bring in a very important algorithmic distinction betweenthe resource usage of the \emph{one-time} preprocessing vs for \emph{eachindividual} query. the second aspect that we consider is that the control flowgraphs for most programs have constant treewidth.  our main contributions are simple and implementable algorithms that supportmultiple queries for algebraic path properties for rsms that have constanttreewidth. our theoretical results show that our algorithms have smalladditional one-time preprocessing, but can answer subsequent queriessignificantly faster as compared to the current best-known solutions forseveral important problems, such as interprocedural reachability and shortestpath. we provide a prototype implementation for interprocedural reachabilityand intraprocedural shortest path that gives a significant speed-up on severalbenchmarks.

1502.00611	unifying two views on multiple mean-payoff objectives in markov decision  processes	we consider markov decision processes (mdps) with multiple limit-average (ormean-payoff) objectives. there exist two different views: (i) the expectationsemantics, where the goal is to optimize the expected mean-payoff objective,and (ii) the satisfaction semantics, where the goal is to maximize theprobability of runs such that the mean-payoff value stays above a given vector.we consider optimization with respect to both objectives at once, thus unifyingthe existing semantics. precisely, the goal is to optimize the expectationwhile ensuring the satisfaction constraint. our problem captures the notion ofoptimization with respect to strategies that are risk-averse (i.e., ensurecertain probabilistic guarantee). our main results are as follows: first, wepresent algorithms for the decision problems which are always polynomial in thesize of the mdp. we also show that an approximation of the pareto-curve can becomputed in time polynomial in the size of the mdp, and the approximationfactor, but exponential in the number of dimensions. second, we present acomplete characterization of the strategy complexity (in terms of memory boundsand randomization) required to solve our problem.

1502.02834	counterexample explanation by learning small strategies in markov  decision processes	while for deterministic systems, a counterexample to a property can simply bean error trace, counterexamples in probabilistic systems are necessarily morecomplex. for instance, a set of erroneous traces with a sufficient cumulativeprobability mass can be used. since these are too large objects to understandand manipulate, compact representations such as subchains have been considered.in the case of probabilistic systems with non-determinism, the situation iseven more complex. while a subchain for a given strategy (or scheduler,resolving non-determinism) is a straightforward choice, we take a differentapproach. instead, we focus on the strategy - which can be a counterexample toviolation of or a witness of satisfaction of a property - itself, and extractthe most important decisions it makes, and present its succinct representation.the key tools we employ to achieve this are (1) introducing a concept ofimportance of a state w.r.t. the strategy, and (2) learning using decisiontrees. there are three main consequent advantages of our approach. firstly, itexploits the quantitative information on states, stressing the more importantdecisions. secondly, it leads to a greater variability and degree of freedom inrepresenting the strategies. thirdly, the representation uses aself-explanatory data structure. in summary, our approach produces moresuccinct and more explainable strategies, as opposed to e.g. binary decisiondiagrams. finally, our experimental results show that we can extract severalrules describing the strategy even for very large systems that do not fit inmemory, and based on the rules explain the erroneous behaviour.

1502.04844	the complexity of synthesis from probabilistic components	the synthesis problem asks for the automatic construction of a system fromits specification. in the traditional setting, the system is "constructed fromscratch" rather than composed from reusable components. however, this is rarein practice, and almost every non-trivial software system relies heavily on theuse of libraries of reusable components. recently, lustig and vardi introduceddataflow and controlflow synthesis from libraries of reusable components. theyproved that dataflow synthesis is undecidable, while controlflow synthesis isdecidable. the problem of controlflow synthesis from libraries of probabilisticcomponents was considered by nain, lustig and vardi, and was shown to bedecidable for qualitative analysis (that asks that the specification besatisfied with probability 1). our main contributions for controlflow synthesisfrom probabilistic components are to establish better complexity bounds for thequalitative analysis problem, and to show that the more general quantitativeproblem is undecidable. for the qualitative analysis, we show that the problem(i) is exptime-complete when the specification is given as a deterministicparity word automaton, improving the previously known 2exptime upper bound; and(ii) belongs to up $\cap$ coup and is parity-games hard, when the specificationis given directly as a parity condition on the components, improving thepreviously known exptime upper bound.

0804.4530	strategy improvement for concurrent safety games	we consider concurrent games played on graphs. at every round of the game,each player simultaneously and independently selects a move; the moves jointlydetermine the transition to a successor state. two basic objectives are thesafety objective: ``stay forever in a set f of states'', and its dual, thereachability objective, ``reach a set r of states''. we present in this paper astrategy improvement algorithm for computing the value of a concurrent safetygame, that is, the maximal probability with which player 1 can enforce thesafety objective. the algorithm yields a sequence of player-1 strategies whichensure probabilities of winning that converge monotonically to the value of thesafety game.  the significance of the result is twofold. first, while strategy improvementalgorithms were known for markov decision processes and turn-based games, aswell as for concurrent reachability games, this is the first strategyimprovement algorithm for concurrent safety games. second, and mostimportantly, the improvement algorithm provides a way to approximate the valueof a concurrent safety game from below (the known value-iteration algorithmsapproximate the value from above). thus, when used together withvalue-iteration algorithms, or with strategy improvement algorithms forreachability games, our algorithm leads to the first practical algorithm forcomputing converging upper and lower bounds for the value of reachability andsafety games.

1504.06117	nested weighted automata	recently there has been a significant effort to handle quantitativeproperties in formal verification and synthesis. while weighted automata overfinite and infinite words provide a natural and flexible framework to expressquantitative properties, perhaps surprisingly, some basic system propertiessuch as average response time cannot be expressed using weighted automata, norin any other know decidable formalism. in this work, we introduce nestedweighted automata as a natural extension of weighted automata which makes itpossible to express important quantitative properties such as average responsetime. in nested weighted automata, a master automaton spins off and collectsresults from weighted slave automata, each of which computes a quantity along afinite portion of an infinite word. nested weighted automata can be viewed asthe quantitative analogue of monitor automata, which are used in run-timeverification. we establish an almost complete decidability picture for thebasic decision problems about nested weighted automata, and illustrate theirapplicability in several domains. in particular, nested weighted automata canbe used to decide average response time properties.

0805.4167	environment assumptions for synthesis	the synthesis problem asks to construct a reactive finite-state system froman $\omega$-regular specification. initial specifications are oftenunrealizable, which means that there is no system that implements thespecification. a common reason for unrealizability is that assumptions on theenvironment of the system are incomplete. we study the problem of correcting anunrealizable specification $\phi$ by computing an environment assumption $\psi$such that the new specification $\psi\to\phi$ is realizable. our aim is toconstruct an assumption $\psi$ that constrains only the environment and is asweak as possible. we present a two-step algorithm for computing assumptions.the algorithm operates on the game graph that is used to answer therealizability question. first, we compute a safety assumption that removes aminimal set of environment edges from the graph. second, we compute a livenessassumption that puts fairness conditions on some of the remaining environmentedges. we show that the problem of finding a minimal set of fair edges iscomputationally hard, and we use probabilistic games to compute a locallyminimal fairness assumption.

1510.07565	algorithms for algebraic path properties in concurrent systems of  constant treewidth components	we study algorithmic questions for concurrent systems where the transitionsare labeled from a complete, closed semiring, and path properties are algebraicwith semiring operations. the algebraic path properties can model dataflowanalysis problems, the shortest path problem, and many other natural problemsthat arise in program analysis. we consider that each component of theconcurrent system is a graph with constant treewidth, a property satisfied bythe controlflow graphs of most programs. we allow for multiple possiblequeries, which arise naturally in demand driven dataflow analysis. the study ofmultiple queries allows us to consider the tradeoff between the resource usageof the one-time preprocessing and for each individual query. the traditionalapproach constructs the product graph of all components and applies thebest-known graph algorithm on the product. in this approach, even the answer toa single query requires the transitive closure, which provides no room fortradeoff between preprocessing and query time.  our main contributions are algorithms that significantly improve theworst-case running time of the traditional approach, and provide varioustradeoffs depending on the number of queries. for example, in a concurrentsystem of two components, the traditional approach requires hexic time in theworst case for answering one query as well as computing the transitive closure,whereas we show that with one-time preprocessing in almost cubic time, eachsubsequent query can be answered in at most linear time, and even thetransitive closure can be computed in almost quartic time. furthermore, weestablish conditional optimality results showing that the worst-case runningtime of our algorithms cannot be improved without achieving major breakthroughsin graph algorithms.

1510.08517	algorithmic analysis of qualitative and quantitative termination  problems for affine probabilistic programs	in this paper, we consider termination of probabilistic programs withreal-valued variables. the questions concerned are:  1. qualitative ones that ask (i) whether the program terminates withprobability 1 (almost-sure termination) and (ii) whether the expectedtermination time is finite (finite termination); 2. quantitative ones that ask(i) to approximate the expected termination time (expectation problem) and (ii)to compute a bound b such that the probability to terminate after b stepsdecreases exponentially (concentration problem).  to solve these questions, we utilize the notion of ranking supermartingaleswhich is a powerful approach for proving termination of probabilistic programs.in detail, we focus on algorithmic synthesis of linear ranking-supermartingalesover affine probabilistic programs (app's) with both angelic and demonicnon-determinism. an important subclass of app's is lrapp which is defined asthe class of all app's over which a linear ranking-supermartingale exists.  our main contributions are as follows. firstly, we show that the membershipproblem of lrapp (i) can be decided in polynomial time for app's with at mostdemonic non-determinism, and (ii) is np-hard and in pspace for app's withangelic non-determinism; moreover, the np-hardness result holds already forapp's without probability and demonic non-determinism. secondly, we show thatthe concentration problem over lrapp can be solved in the same complexity asfor the membership problem of lrapp. finally, we show that the expectationproblem over lrapp can be solved in 2exptime and is pspace-hard even for app'swithout probability and non-determinism (i.e., deterministic programs). ourexperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to answerthe qualitative and quantitative questions over app's with at most demonicnon-determinism.

0807.1165	timed parity games: complexity and robustness	we consider two-player games played in real time on game structures withclocks and parity objectives. the games are concurrent in that at each turn,both players independently propose a time delay and an action, and the actionwith the shorter delay is chosen. to prevent a player from winning by blockingtime, we restrict each player to strategies that ensure that the player cannotbe responsible for causing a zeno run. first, we present an efficient reductionof these games to turn-based (i.e., nonconcurrent) finite-state (i.e., untimed)parity games. the states of the resulting game are pairs of clock regions ofthe original game. our reduction improves the best known complexity for solvingtimed parity games. moreover, the rich class of algorithms for classical paritygames can now be applied to timed parity games.  second, we consider two restricted classes of strategies for the player thatrepresents the controller in a real-time synthesis problem, namely,limit-robust and bounded-robust strategies. using a limit-robust strategy, thecontroller cannot choose an exact real-valued time delay but must allow forsome nonzero jitter in each of its actions. if there is a given lower bound onthe jitter, then the strategy is bounded-robust. we show that exact strategiesare more powerful than limit-robust strategies, which are more powerful thanbounded-robust strategies for any bound. for both kinds of robust strategies,we present efficient reductions to standard timed automaton games. thesereductions provide algorithms for the synthesis of robust real-timecontrollers.

0809.4017	termination criteria for solving concurrent safety and reachability  games	we consider concurrent games played on graphs. at every round of a game, eachplayer simultaneously and independently selects a move; the moves jointlydetermine the transition to a successor state. two basic objectives are thesafety objective to stay forever in a given set of states, and its dual, thereachability objective to reach a given set of states. we present in this papera strategy improvement algorithm for computing the value of a concurrent safetygame, that is, the maximal probability with which player~1 can enforce thesafety objective. the algorithm yields a sequence of player-1 strategies whichensure probabilities of winning that converge monotonically to the value of thesafety game.  our result is significant because the strategy improvement algorithmprovides, for the first time, a way to approximate the value of a concurrentsafety game from below. since a value iteration algorithm, or a strategyimprovement algorithm for reachability games, can be used to approximate thesame value from above, the combination of both algorithms yields a method forcomputing a converging sequence of upper and lower bounds for the values ofconcurrent reachability and safety games. previous methods could approximatethe values of these games only from one direction, and as no rates ofconvergence are known, they did not provide a practical way to solve thesegames.

0809.4326	algorithms for game metrics	simulation and bisimulation metrics for stochastic systems provide aquantitative generalization of the classical simulation and bisimulationrelations. these metrics capture the similarity of states with respect toquantitative specifications written in the quantitative {\mu}-calculus andrelated probabilistic logics. we first show that the metrics provide a boundfor the difference in long-run average and discounted average behavior acrossstates, indicating that the metrics can be used both in system verification,and in performance evaluation. for turn-based games and mdps, we provide apolynomial-time algorithm for the computation of the one-step metric distancebetween states. the algorithm is based on linear programming; it improves onthe previous known exponential-time algorithm based on a reduction to thetheory of reals. we then present pspace algorithms for both the decisionproblem and the problem of approximating the metric distance between twostates, matching the best known algorithms for markov chains. for thebisimulation kernel of the metric our algorithm works in time o(n^4) for bothturn-based games and mdps; improving the previously best known o(n^9\cdotlog(n)) time algorithm for mdps. for a concurrent game g, we show thatcomputing the exact distance between states is at least as hard as computingthe value of concurrent reachability games and the square-root-sum problem incomputational geometry. we show that checking whether the metric distance isbounded by a rational r, can be done via a reduction to the theory of realclosed fields, involving a formula with three quantifier alternations, yieldingo(|g|^o(|g|^5)) time complexity, improving the previously known reduction,which yielded o(|g|^o(|g|^7)) time complexity. these algorithms can be iteratedto approximate the metrics using binary search.
