0911.5581	interpretation of strong short-term central perturbations in the light  curves of moderate-magnification microlensing events	to improve the planet detection efficiency, current planetary microlensingexperiments are focused on high-magnification events searching for planetarysignals near the peak of lensing light curves. however, it is known thatcentral perturbations can also be produced by binary companions and thus it isimportant to distinguish planetary signals from those induced by binarycompanions. in this paper, we analyze the light curves of microlensing eventsogle-2007-blg-137/moa-2007-blg-091, ogle-2007-blg-355/moa-2007-blg-278, andmoa-2007-blg-199/ogle-2007-blg-419, for all of which exhibit short-termperturbations near the peaks of the light curves. from detailed modeling of thelight curves, we find that the perturbations of the events are caused by binarycompanions rather than planets. from close examination of the light curvescombined with the underlying physical geometry of the lens system obtained frommodeling, we find that the short time-scale caustic-crossing feature occurringat a low or a moderate base magnification with an additional secondaryperturbation is a typical feature of binary-lens events and thus can be usedfor the discrimination between the binary and planetary interpretations.

1004.5247	the ogle view of microlensing towards the magellanic clouds. ii. ogle-ii  smc data	the primary goal of this paper is to provide the evidence that can eitherprove or falsify the hypothesis that dark matter in the galactic halo can clumpinto stellar-mass compact objects. if such objects existed, they would act aslenses to external sources in the magellanic clouds, giving rise to anobservable effect of microlensing. we present the results of our search forsuch events, based on the data from the second phase of the ogle survey(1996-2000) towards the smc. the data set we used is comprised of 2.1 millionmonitored sources distributed over an area of 2.4 square degrees. we found onlyone microlensing event candidate, however its poor quality light curve limitedour discussion on the exact distance to the lensing object.  given a single event, taking the blending (crowding of stars) into accountfor the detection efficiency simulations, and deriving the hst-corrected numberof monitored stars, the microlensing optical depth is tau=(1.55+-1.55)10e-7.this result is consistent with the expected smc self-lensing signal, with noneed of introducing dark matter microlenses. rejecting the unconvincing eventleads to the upper limit on the fraction of dark matter in the form of machosto f&lt;20 per cent for deflectors' masses around 0.4 msun and f&lt;11 per cent formasses between 0.003 and 0.2 msun (95 per cent confidence limit). our resultindicates that the milky way's dark matter is unlikely to be clumpy and formcompact objects in the sub-solar-mass range.

1005.0966	ogle 2008--blg--290: an accurate measurement of the limb darkening of a  galactic bulge k giant spatially resolved by microlensing	gravitational microlensing is not only a successful tool for discoveringdistant exoplanets, but it also enables characterization of the lens and sourcestars involved in the lensing event. in high magnification events, the lenscaustic may cross over the source disk, which allows a determination of theangular size of the source and additionally a measurement of its limbdarkening. when such extended-source effects appear close to maximummagnification, the resulting light curve differs from the characteristicpaczynski point-source curve. the exact shape of the light curve close to thepeak depends on the limb darkening of the source. dense photometric coveragepermits measurement of the respective limb-darkening coefficients. in the caseof microlensing event ogle 2008-blg-290, the k giant source star reached a peakmagnification of about 100. thirteen different telescopes have covered thisevent in eight different photometric bands. subsequent light-curve analysisyielded measurements of linear limb-darkening coefficients of the source in sixphotometric bands. the best-measured coefficients lead to an estimate of thesource effective temperature of about 4700 +100-200 k. however, the photometricestimate from colour-magnitude diagrams favours a cooler temperature of 4200+-100 k. as the limb-darkening measurements, at least in the ctio/smarts2 v andi bands, are among the most accurate obtained, the above disagreement needs tobe understood. a solution is proposed, which may apply to previous events wheresuch a discrepancy also appeared.

0711.3978	ogle-tr-211 - a new transiting inflated hot jupiter from the ogle survey  and eso lp666 spectroscopic follow-up program	we present results of the photometric campaign for planetary andlow-luminosity object transits conducted by the ogle survey in 2005 season(campaign #5). about twenty most promising candidates discovered in these datawere subsequently verified spectroscopically with the vlt/flames spectrograph.  one of the candidates, ogle-tr-211, reveals clear changes of radial velocitywith small amplitude of 82 m/sec, varying in phase with photometric transitephemeris. thus, we confirm the planetary nature of the ogle-tr-211 system.follow-up precise photometry of ogle-tr-211 with vlt/fors together with radialvelocity spectroscopy supplemented with high resolution, high s/n vlt/uvesspectra allowed us to derive parameters of the planet and host star.ogle-tr-211b is a hot jupiter orbiting a f7-8 spectral type dwarf star with theperiod of 3.68 days. the mass of the planet is equal to 1.03+/-0.20 m_jup whileits radius 1.36+0.18-0.09 r_jup. the radius is about 20% larger than thetypical radius of hot jupiters of similar mass. ogle-tr-211b is, then, anotherexample of inflated hot jupiters - a small group of seven exoplanets with largeradii and unusually small densities - objects being a challenge to the currentmodels of exoplanets.

0804.1354	ogle-2005-blg-071lb, the most massive m-dwarf planetary companion?	we combine all available information to constrain the nature ofogle-2005-blg-071lb, the second planet discovered by microlensing and the firstin a high-magnification event. these include photometric and astrometricmeasurements from hubble space telescope, as well as constraints from higherorder effects extracted from the ground-based light curve, such as microlensparallax, planetary orbital motion and finite-source effects. our primaryanalysis leads to the conclusion that the host of jovian planetogle-2005-blg-071lb is an m dwarf in the foreground disk with mass m= 0.46 +/-0.04 msun, distance d_l = 3.3 +/- 0.4 kpc, and thick-disk kinematics v_lsr ~103 km/s. from the best-fit model, the planet has mass m_p = 3.8 +/- 0.4 m_jup,lies at a projected separation r_perp = 3.6 +/- 0.2 au from its host and so hasan equilibrium temperature of t ~ 55 k, i.e., similar to neptune. a degeneratemodel less favored by \delta\chi^2 = 2.1 (or 2.2, depending on the sign of theimpact parameter) gives similar planetary mass m_p = 3.4 +/- 0.4 m_jup with asmaller projected separation, r_\perp = 2.1 +/- 0.1 au, and higher equilibriumtemperature t ~ 71 k. these results from the primary analysis suggest thatogle-2005-blg-071lb is likely to be the most massive planet yet discovered thatis hosted by an m dwarf. however, the formation of such high-mass planetarycompanions in the outer regions of m-dwarf planetary systems is predicted to beunlikely within the core-accretion scenario. there are a number of caveats tothis primary analysis, which assumes (based on real but limited evidence) thatthe unlensed light coincident with the source is actually due to the lens, thatis, the planetary host. however, these caveats could mostly be resolved by asingle astrometric measurement a few years after the event.

0806.0025	a low-mass planet with a possible sub-stellar-mass host in microlensing  event moa-2007-blg-192	we report the detection of an extrasolar planet of mass ratio q ~ 2 x 10^(-4)in microlensing event moa-2007-blg-192. the best fit microlensing model showsboth the microlensing parallax and finite source effects, and these can becombined to obtain the lens masses of m = 0.060 (+0.028 -0.021) m_sun for theprimary and m = 3.3 (+4.9 -1.6) m_earth for the planet. however, theobservational coverage of the planetary deviation is sparse and incomplete, andthe radius of the source was estimated without the benefit of a source starcolor measurement. as a result, the 2-sigma limits on the mass ratio and finitesource measurements are weak. nevertheless, the microlensing parallax signalclearly favors a sub-stellar mass planetary host, and the measurement of finitesource effects in the light curve supports this conclusion. adaptive opticsimages taken with the very large telescope (vlt) naco instrument are consistentwith a lens star that is either a brown dwarf or a star at the bottom of themain sequence. follow-up vlt and/or hubble space telescope (hst) observationswill either confirm that the primary is a brown dwarf or detect the low-masslens star and enable a precise determination of its mass. in either case, thelens star, moa-2007-blg-192l, is the lowest mass primary known to have acompanion with a planetary mass ratio, and the planet, moa-2007-blg-192lb, isprobably the lowest mass exoplanet found to date, aside from the lowest masspulsar planet.

astro-ph;0404394	ogle-2003-blg-238: microlensing mass estimate of an isolated star	microlensing is the only known direct method to measure the masses of starsthat lack visible companions. in terms of microlensing observables, the mass isgiven by m=(c^2/4g)\tilde r_e \theta_e and so requires the measurement of boththe angular einstein radius, \theta_e, and the projected einstein radius,\tilde r_e. simultaneous measurement of these two parameters is extremely rare.here we analyze ogle-2003-blg-238, a spectacularly bright (i_min=10.3),high-magnification (a_max = 170) microlensing event. pronounced finite sourceeffects permit a measurement of \theta_e = 650 uas. although the timescale ofthe event is only t_e = 38 days, one can still obtain weak constraints on themicrolens parallax: 4.4 au &lt; \tilde r_e &lt; 18 au at the 1 \sigma level. togetherthese two parameter measurements yield a range for the lens mass of 0.36 m_sun&lt; m &lt; 1.48 m_sun. as was the case for macho-lmc-5, the only other single star(apart from the sun) whose mass has been determined from its gravitationaleffects, this estimate is rather crude. it does, however, demonstrate theviability of the technique. we also discuss future prospects for single-lensmass measurements.

astro-ph;0412505	the optical gravitational lensing experiment. ellipsoidal variability of  red giants in the large magellanic cloud	we used the ogle-ii and ogle-iii photometry of red giants in the largemagellanic cloud to select and study objects revealing ellipsoidal variability.we detected 1546 candidates for long period ellipsoidal variables and 121eclipsing binary systems with clear ellipsoidal modulation. the ellipsoidal redgiants follow a period-luminosity (pl) relationship (sequence e), and thescatter of the relation is correlated with the amplitude of variability: thelarger the amplitude, the smaller the scatter.  we note that some of the ellipsoidal candidates exhibit simultaneously oglesmall amplitude red giants pulsations. thus, in some cases the long secondaryperiod (lsp) phenomenon can be explained by the ellipsoidal modulation.  we also select about 1600 red giants with distinct lsp, which are notellipsoidal variables. we discover that besides the sequence d in the pldiagram known before, the lsp giants form additional less numerous sequence forlonger periods. we notice that the pl sequence of the ellipsoidal candidates isa direct continuation of the lsp sequence toward fainter stars, what mightsuggest that the lsp phenomenon is related to binarity but there are strongarguments against such a possibility.  about 10% of the presented light curves reveal clear deformation by theeccentricity of the system orbits. the largest estimated eccentricity in oursample is about 0.4.  all presented data, including individual bvi observations and finding chartsare available from the ogle internet archive.

astro-ph;0502363	microlensing optical depth toward the galactic bulge using bright  sources from ogle-ii	we present a measurement of the microlensing optical depth toward thegalactic bulge based on 4 years of the ogle-ii survey using red clump giant(rcg). using 32 events we find tau=2.55_{-0.46}^{+0.57}* 10^{-6} at(l,b)=(1.16, -2.75). taking into account the measured gradient along thegalactic latitude b, tau = [ (4.48+/- 2.37) + (0.78+/- 0.84)* b]* 10^{-6}, thisvalue is consistent with previous measurements using rcg sources and recenttheoretical predictions. we determine the microlensing parameters and selectevents using a model light curve with the flux blending. we find that ~38% ofthe ogle-ii events which appear to have rcg sources are actually due to muchfainter stars blended with a bright companion. we show explicitly that modelfits without blending result in similar tau estimates through partialcancellation of contributions from higher detection efficiency, underestimatedtime-scales and larger number of selected events. this approach, however, leadsto biased time-scale distributions and event rates. consequently, microlensingstudies should carefully consider source confusion effects even for brightstars.

astro-ph;0507079	planetary detection efficiency of the magnification 3000 microlensing  event ogle-2004-blg-343	ogle-2004-blg-343 was a microlensing event with peak magnificationa_{max}=3000+/-1100, by far the highest-magnification event ever analyzed andhence potentially extremely sensitive to planets orbiting the lens star. due tohuman error, intensive monitoring did not begin until 43 minutes after peak, atwhich point the magnification had fallen to a~1200, still by far the highestever observed. as the light curve does not show significant deviations due to aplanet, we place upper limits on the presence of such planets by extending themethod of yoo et al. (2004b), which combines light-curve analysis with priorsfrom a galactic model of the source and lens populations, to take account offinite-source effects. this is the first event so analyzed for whichfinite-source effects are important, and hence we develop two new techniquesfor evaluating these effects. somewhat surprisingly, we find thatogle-2004-blg-343 is no more sensitive to planets than two previously analyzedevents with a_{max}~100, despite the fact that it was observed at ~12 timeshigher magnification. however, we show that had the event been observed overits peak, it would have been sensitive to almost all neptune-mass planets overa factor of 5 of projected separation and even would have had some sensitivityto earth-mass planets. this shows that some microlensing events being detectedin current experiments are sensitive to very low-mass planets. we also givesuggestions on how extremely high-magnification events can be more promptlymonitored in the future.

astro-ph;0512578	the optical gravitational lensing experiment. miras and semiregular  variables in the large magellanic cloud	we use the ogle-ii and ogle-iii data in conjunction with the 2massnear-infrared (nir) photometry to identify and study miras and semiregularvariables (srvs) in the large magellanic cloud. we found in total 3221variables of both types, populating two of the series of nir period-luminosity(pl) sequences. the majority of these objects are double periodic pulsators,with periods belonging to both pl ridges. we indicate that in the period -wesenheit index plane the oxygen-rich and carbon-rich agb stars from the nir plsequences c, c' and d split into well separated ridges. thus, we discover aneffective method of distinguishing between o-rich and c-rich miras, srvs andstars with long secondary periods using their v and i-band photometry. wepresent an empirical method of estimating the mean k_s magnitudes of the longperiod variables using single-epoch k_s measurements and complete light curvesin the i-band. we utilize these corrected magnitudes to show that the o-richand c-rich miras and srvs follow somewhat different k_s-band pl relations.

(we propose to name it ogle-2005-blg-390lb,indicating a planetary mass companion to the lens star of the microlensingevent.) the mass is lower than that of gj876d, although the error bars overlap.our detection suggests that such cool, sub-neptune-mass planets may be morecommon than gas giant planets, as predicted by the core accretion theory.

astro-ph;0603276	microlens ogle-2005-blg-169 implies cool neptune-like planets are common	we detect a neptune mass-ratio (q~8e-5) planetary companion to the lens starin the extremely high-magnification (a~800) microlensing eventogle-2005-blg-169. if the parent is a main-sequence star, it has mass m~0.5m_sun implying a planet mass of ~13 m_earth and projected separation of ~2.7au. when intensely monitored over their peak, high-magnification events similarto ogle-2005-blg-169 have nearly complete sensitivity to neptune mass-ratioplanets with projected separations of 0.6 to 1.6 einstein radii, correspondingto 1.6--4.3 au in the present case. only two other such events were monitoredwell enough to detect neptunes, and so this detection by itself suggests thatneptune mass-ratio planets are common. moreover, another neptune was recentlydiscovered at a similar distance from its parent star in a low-magnificationevent, which are more common but are individually much less sensitive toplanets. combining the two detections yields 90% upper and lower frequencylimits f=0.37^{+0.30}_{-0.21} over just 0.4 decades of planet-star separation.in particular, f&gt;16% at 90% confidence. the parent star hosts no jupiter-masscompanions with projected separations within a factor 5 of that of the detectedplanet. the lens-source relative proper motion is \mu~7--10 mas/yr, implyingthat if the lens is sufficiently bright, i&lt;23.8, it will be detectable by hstby 3 years after peak. this would permit a more precise estimate of the lensmass and distance, and so the mass and projected separation of the planet.analogs of ogle-2005-blg-169lb orbiting nearby stars would be difficult todetect by other methods of planet detection, including radial velocities,transits, or astrometry.

astro-ph;0607134	the optical gravitational lensing experiment. variable baseline  microlensing events in the galactic bulge	we present the first systematic search for microlensing events withvariability in their baselines using data from the third phase of the opticalgravitational lensing experiment (ogle-iii). a total of 137 candidates (88 new)was discovered toward the galactic bulge. among these, 21 have periodicoscillations in their baselines, 111 are irregular variables and 5 arepotential long period detached eclipsing binaries. this is about 10% of thetotal number of constant baseline events. they are hence quite common and canbe regarded as a new type of exotic events, which allow the determination ofextra parameters of the events. we show that microlensing of variable stars mayallow us to break the degeneracy between the blending parameter andmagnification. we note that in some cases variability hidden in the baselinedue to strong blending may be revealed in highly magnified events and resembleother exotic microlensing behavior, including planetary deviation. a new system(vews) for detecting ongoing variable baseline microlensing events ispresented.

astro-ph;0702240	first space-based microlens parallax measurement: spitzer observations  of ogle-2005-smc-001	we combine spitzer and ground-based observations to measure the microlensparallax of ogle-2005-smc-001, the first such space-based determination sinces. refsdal proposed the idea in 1966. the parallax measurement yields aprojected velocity \tilde v ~ 230 km/s, the typical value expected for halolenses, but an order of magnitude smaller than would be expected for lenseslying in the small magellanic cloud (smc) itself. the lens is a weak (i.e.,non-caustic-crossing) binary, which complicates the analysis considerably butultimately contributes additional constraints. using a test proposed by assefet al. (2006), which makes use only of kinematic information about differentpopulations but does not make any assumptions about their respective massfunctions, we find that the likelihood ratio is l_halo/l_smc = 20. hence, halolenses are strongly favored but smc lenses are not definitively ruled out.similar spitzer observations of additional lenses toward the magellanic cloudswould clarify the nature of the lens population. the space interferometrymission could make even more constraining measurements.

0809.2997	microlensing event moa-2007-blg-400: exhuming the buried signature of a  cool, jovian-mass planet	we report the detection of the cool, jovian-mass planet moa-2007-blg-400lb.the planet was detected in a high-magnification microlensing event (with peakmagnification a_max = 628) in which the primary lens transited the source,resulting in a dramatic smoothing of the peak of the event. the angular extentof the region of perturbation due to the planet is significantly smaller thanthe angular size of the source, and as a result the planetary signature is alsosmoothed out by the finite source size. thus the deviation from a single-lensfit is broad and relatively weak (~ few percent). nevertheless, we demonstratethat the planetary nature of the deviation can be unambiguously ascertainedfrom the gross features of the residuals, and detailed analysis yields a fairlyprecise planet/star mass ratio of q = 0.0026+/-0.0004, in accord with the largesignificance (\delta\chi^2=1070) of the detection. the planet/star projectedseparation is subject to a strong close/wide degeneracy, leading to twoindistinguishable solutions that differ in separation by a factor of ~8.5.upper limits on flux from the lens constrain its mass to be m &lt; 0.75 m_sun(assuming it is a main-sequence star). a bayesian analysis that includes allavailable observational constraints indicates a primary in the galactic bulgewith a mass of ~0.2-0.5 m_sun and thus a planet mass of ~ 0.5-1.3 m_jupiter.the separation and equilibrium temperature are ~0.6-1.1au (~5.3-9.7au) and~103k (~34k) for the close (wide) solution. if the primary is a main-sequencestar, follow-up observations would enable the detection of its light and so ameasurement of its mass and distance.
