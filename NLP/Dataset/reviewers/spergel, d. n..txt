0903.4002	probing the galactic potential with next-generation observations of disk  stars	near-future surveys promise a dramatic improvement in the number andprecision of astrometric, photometric and spectroscopic measurements of starsin the milky way's disk. we examine the impact of such surveys on ourunderstanding of the galaxy by "observing" particle realizations ofnon-axisymmetric disk distributions orbiting in an axisymmetric halo withappropriate errors and then attempting to recover the underlying potentialusing a markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) approach. we demonstrate that theazimuthally averaged gravitational force field in the galactic plane--andhence, to a lesser extent, the galactic mass distribution--can be tightlyconstrained over a large range of radii using a variety of types of surveys solong as the error distribution of the measurements of the parallax, propermotion and radial velocity are well-understood and the disk is surveyedglobally. one advantage of our method is that the target stars can be selectednon-randomly in real or apparent-magnitude space to ensure just such a globalsample without biasing the results. assuming we can always measure theline-of-sight velocity of a star with at least 1 km/s precision, we demonstratethat the force field can be determined to better than ~1% for galactocentricradii in the range r=4-20 kpc we conclude that near-future surveys, like simlite, gaia, and vera, will provide the first precise mapping of thegravitational force field in the region of the galactic disk.

0907.0461	the atacama cosmology telescope (act): beam profiles and first sz  cluster maps	the atacama cosmology telescope (act) is currently observing the cosmicmicrowave background with arcminute resolution at 148 ghz, 218 ghz, and 277ghz. in this paper, we present act's first results. data have been analyzedusing a maximum-likelihood map-making method which uses b-splines to model andremove the atmospheric signal. it has been used to make high-precision beammaps from which we determine the experiment's window functions. this beaminformation directly impacts all subsequent analyses of the data. we also usedthe method to map a sample of galaxy clusters via the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz)effect, and show five clusters previously detected with x-ray or szobservations. we provide integrated compton-y measurements for each cluster. ofparticular interest is our detection of the z = 0.44 component of a3128 and ourcurrent non-detection of the low-redshift part, providing strong evidence thatthe further cluster is more massive as suggested by x-ray measurements. this isa compelling example of the redshift-independent mass selection of the szeffect.

1001.2934	the atacama cosmology telescope: a measurement of the 600&lt; ell &lt;8000  cosmic microwave background power spectrum at 148 ghz	we present a measurement of the angular power spectrum of the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) radiation observed at 148 ghz. the measurement usesmaps with 1.4' angular resolution made with data from the atacama cosmologytelescope (act). the observations cover 228 square degrees of the southern sky,in a 4.2-degree-wide strip centered on declination 53 degrees south. the cmb atarcminute angular scales is particularly sensitive to the silk damping scale,to the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect from galaxy clusters, and to emission byradio sources and dusty galaxies. after masking the 108 brightest point sourcesin our maps, we estimate the power spectrum between 600 &lt; \ell &lt; 8000 using theadaptive multi-taper method to minimize spectral leakage and maximize use ofthe full data set. our absolute calibration is based on observations of uranus.to verify the calibration and test the fidelity of our map at large angularscales, we cross-correlate the act map to the wmap map and recover the wmappower spectrum from 250 &lt; ell &lt; 1150. the power beyond the silk damping tail ofthe cmb is consistent with models of the emission from point sources. wequantify the contribution of sz clusters to the power spectrum by fitting to amodel normalized at sigma8 = 0.8. we constrain the model's amplitude asz &lt; 1.63(95% cl). if interpreted as a measurement of sigma8, this implies sigma8^sz &lt;0.86 (95% cl) given our sz model. a fit of act and wmap five-year data jointlyto a 6-parameter lcdm model plus terms for point sources and the sz effect isconsistent with these results.

1001.4555	seven-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) observations:  galactic foreground emission	[abridged] we present updated estimates of galactic foreground emission usingseven years of wmap data. using the power spectrum of differences betweenmulti-frequency template-cleaned maps, we find no evidence for foregroundcontamination outside of the updated (kq85y7) foreground mask. we place a 15microkelvin upper bound on rms foreground contamination in the cleaned mapsused for cosmological analysis. we find no indication in the polarization dataof an extra "haze" of hard synchrotron emission from energetic electrons nearthe galactic center. we provide an updated map of the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) using the internal linear combination (ilc) method, updatedforeground masks, and updates to point source catalogs with 62 newly detectedsources. also new are tests of the markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) foregroundfitting procedure against systematics in the time-stream data, and testsagainst the observed beam asymmetry.  within a few degrees of the galactic plane, wmap total intensity data show arapidly steepening spectrum from 20-40 ghz, which may be due to emission fromspinning dust grains, steepening synchrotron, or other effects. comparisons aremade to a 1-degree 408 mhz map (haslam et al.) and the 11-degree arcade 2 data(singal et al.). we find that spinning dust or steepening synchrotron modelsfit the combination of wmap and 408 mhz data equally well. arcade data appearinconsistent with the steepening synchrotron model, and consistent with thespinning dust model, though some discrepancies remain regarding the relativestrength of spinning dust emission. more high-resolution data in the 10-40 ghzrange would shed much light on these issues.

1001.4758	seven-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) observations: are  there cosmic microwave background anomalies?	(abridged) a simple six-parameter lcdm model provides a successful fit towmap data, both when the data are analyzed alone and in combination with othercosmological data. even so, it is appropriate to search for any hints ofdeviations from the now standard model of cosmology, which includes inflation,dark energy, dark matter, baryons, and neutrinos. the cosmological communityhas subjected the wmap data to extensive and varied analyses. while there iswidespread agreement as to the overall success of the six-parameter lcdm model,various "anomalies" have been reported relative to that model. in this paper weexamine potential anomalies and present analyses and assessments of theirsignificance. in most cases we find that claimed anomalies depend on posteriorselection of some aspect or subset of the data. compared with sky simulationsbased on the best fit model, one can select for low probability features of thewmap data. low probability features are expected, but it is not usuallystraightforward to determine whether any particular low probability feature isthe result of the a posteriori selection or of non-standard cosmology. weexamine in detail the properties of the power spectrum with respect to the lcdmmodel. we examine several potential or previously claimed anomalies in the skymaps and power spectra, including cold spots, low quadrupole power,quadropole-octupole alignment, hemispherical or dipole power asymmetry, andquadrupole power asymmetry. we conclude that there is no compelling evidencefor deviations from the lcdm model, which is generally an acceptablestatistical fit to wmap and other cosmological data.

0803.0586	five-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) observations:  likelihoods and parameters from the wmap data	this paper focuses on cosmological constraints derived from analysis of wmapdata alone. a simple lcdm cosmological model fits the five-year wmaptemperature and polarization data. the basic parameters of the model areconsistent with the three-year data and now better constrained: omega_b h^2 =0.02273+-0.00062, omega_c h^2 = 0.1099+-0.0062, omega_l = 0.742+-0.030, n_s =0.963+0.014- 0.015, tau = 0.087+-0.017, sigma_8 = 0.796+-0.036. with five yearsof polarization data, we have measured the optical depth to reionization,tau&gt;0, at 5 sigma significance. the redshift of an instantaneous reionizationis constrained to be z_reion = 11.0+-1.4 with 68% confidence. this excludes asudden reionization of the universe at z=6 at more than 3.5 sigma significance,suggesting that reionization was an extended process. using two methods forpolarized foreground cleaning we get consistent estimates for the opticaldepth, indicating an error due to foreground treatment of tau~0.01. thiscosmological model also fits small-scale cmb data, and a range of astronomicaldata measuring the expansion rate and clustering of matter in the universe. wefind evidence for the first time in the cmb power spectrum for a non-zerocosmic neutrino background, or a background of relativistic species, with thestandard three light neutrino species preferred over the best-fit lcdm modelwith n_eff=0 at &gt;99.5% confidence, and n_eff &gt; 2.3 (95% cl) when varied. thefive-year wmap data improve the upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio to r&lt; 0.43 (95% cl), for power-law models. with longer integration we find noevidence for a running spectral index, with dn_s/dlnk = -0.037+-0.028.

0803.0715	five-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) observations:  galactic foreground emission	we present a new estimate of foreground emission in the wmap data, using amarkov chain monte carlo (mcmc) method. the new technique delivers maps of eachforeground component for a variety of foreground models, error estimates of theuncertainty of each foreground component, and provides an overallgoodness-of-fit measurement. the resulting foreground maps are in broadagreement with those from previous techniques used both within thecollaboration and by other authors.  we find that for wmap data, a simple model with power-law synchrotron,free-free, and thermal dust components fits 90% of the sky with a reducedchi-squared of 1.14. however, the model does not work well inside the galacticplane. the addition of either synchrotron steepening or a modified spinningdust model improves the fit. this component may account for up to 14% of thetotal flux at ka-band (33 ghz). we find no evidence for foregroundcontamination of the cmb temperature map in the 85% of the sky used forcosmological analysis.

astro-ph;0007354	gravitational lens statistics for generalized nfw profiles: parameter  degeneracy and implications for self-interacting cold dark matter	strong lensing is a powerful probe of the distribution of matter in the coresof clusters of galaxies. recent studies suggest that the cold dark matter modelpredicts cores that are denser than those observed in galaxies, groups andclusters. one possible resolution of the discrepancy is that the dark matterhas strong interactions (sidm), which leads to lower central densities. ageneralized form of the navarro, frenk and white profile (zhao profile) may beused to describe these halos. in this paper we examine gravitational lensingstatistics for this class of model. the optical depth to multiple imaging is avery sensitive function of the profile parameters in the range of interest forsidm halos around clusters of galaxies. less concentrated profiles, whichresult from larger self-interaction cross-sections, can produce many fewerlensed pairs. lensing statistics provide a powerful test for sidm. morerealistic and observationally oriented calculations remain to be done, howeverlarger self-interaction cross-sections may well be ruled out by the veryexistence of strong lenses on galaxy cluster scales. the inclusion of centrallydominant cluster galaxies should boost the cross-section to multiple imaging.however our preliminary calculations suggest that the additional multipleimaging rate is small with respect to the differences in multiple imaging ratefor different halo profiles. in future statistical studies, it will beimportant to properly account for the scatter among halo profiles since theoptical depth to multiple imaging is dominated by the most concentrated membersof a cluster population.

astro-ph;0302208	first year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) observations:  foreground emission	full sky maps are made in five microwave frequency bands to separate thetemperature anisotropy of the cmb from foreground emission. we define masksthat excise regions of high foreground emission. the effectiveness of templatefits to remove foreground emission from the wmap data is examined. theseefforts result in a cmb map with minimal contamination and a demonstration thatthe wmap cmb power spectrum is insensitive to residual foreground emission. weconstruct a model of the galactic emission components. we find that the milkyway resembles other normal spiral galaxies between 408 mhz and 23 ghz, with asynchrotron spectral index that is flattest (beta ~ -2.5) near star-formingregions, especially in the plane, and steepest (beta ~ -3) in the halo. thesignificant synchrotron index steepening out of the plane suggests a diffusionprocess in which the halo electrons are trapped in the galactic potential longenough to suffer synchrotron and inverse compton energy losses and hence aspectral steepening. the synchrotron index is steeper in the wmap bands than inlower frequency radio surveys, with a spectral break near 20 ghz to beta &lt; -3.the modeled thermal dust spectral index is also steep in the wmap bands, withbeta ~ 2.2. microwave and h alpha measurements of the ionized gas agree.spinning dust emission is limited to &lt; ~5% of the ka-band foreground emission.a catalog of 208 point sources is presented. derived source counts suggest acontribution to the anisotropy power from unresolved sources of (15.0 +- 1.4)10^{-3} microk^2 sr at q-band and negligible levels at v-band and w-band.

astro-ph;0302209	first year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) observations:  determination of cosmological parameters	wmap precision data enables accurate testing of cosmological models. we findthat the emerging standard model of cosmology, a flat lambda-dominated universeseeded by nearly scale-invariant adiabatic gaussian fluctuations, fits the wmapdata. with parameters fixed only by wmap data, we can fit finer scale cmbmeasurements and measurements of large scle structure (galaxy surveys and thelyman alpha forest). this simple model is also consistent with a host of otherastronomical measurements. we then fit the model parameters to a combination ofwmap data with other finer scale cmb experiments (acbar and cbi), 2dfgrsmeasurements and lyman alpha forest data to find the model's best fitcosmological parameters: h=0.71+0.04-0.03, omega_b h^2=0.0224+-0.0009, omega_mh^2=0.135+0.008-0.009, tau=0.17+-0.06, n_s(0.05/mpc)=0.93+-0.03, andsigma_8=0.84+-0.04. wmap's best determination of tau=0.17+-0.04 arises directlyfrom the te data and not from this model fit, but they are consistent. theseparameters imply that the age of the universe is 13.7+-0.2 gyr. the data favorsbut does not require a slowly varying spectral index. by combining wmap datawith other astronomical data sets, we constrain the geometry of the universe,omega_tot = 1.02 +- 0.02, the equation of state of the dark energy w &lt; -0.78(95% confidence limit assuming w &gt;= -1), and the energy density in stableneutrinos, omega_nu h^2 &lt; 0.0076 (95% confidence limit). for 3 degenerateneutrino species, this limit implies that their mass is less than 0.23 ev (95%confidence limit). the wmap detection of early reionization rules out warm darkmatter.

astro-ph;0302217	first year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) observations:  angular power spectrum	we present the angular power spectrum derived from the first-year wilkinsonmicrowave anisotropy probe (wmap) sky maps. we study a variety of powerspectrum estimation methods and data combinations and demonstrate that theresults are robust. the data are modestly contaminated by diffuse galacticforeground emission, but we show that a simple galactic template model issufficient to remove the signal. point sources produce a modest contaminationin the low frequency data. after masking ~700 known bright sources from themaps, we estimate residual sources contribute ~3500 uk^2 at 41 ghz, and ~130uk^2 at 94 ghz, to the power spectrum l*(l+1)*c_l/(2*pi) at l=1000. systematicerrors are negligible compared to the (modest) level of foreground emission.our best estimate of the power spectrum is derived from 28 cross-power spectraof statistically independent channels. the final spectrum is essentiallyindependent of the noise properties of an individual radiometer. the resultingspectrum provides a definitive measurement of the cmb power spectrum, withuncertainties limited by cosmic variance, up to l~350. the spectrum clearlyexhibits a first acoustic peak at l=220 and a second acoustic peak at l~540 andit provides strong support for adiabatic initial conditions. kogut et al.(2003) analyze the c_l^te power spectrum, and present evidence for a relativelyhigh optical depth, and an early period of cosmic reionization. among otherthings, this implies that the temperature power spectrum has been suppressed by\~30% on degree angular scales, due to secondary scattering.

astro-ph;0511061	correlation properties of the kinematic sunyaev-zel'dovich effect and  implications for dark energy	in the context of a cosmological study of the bulk flows in the universe, wepresent a detailed study of the statistical properties of the kinematicsunyaev-zel'dovich (ksz) effect. we first compute analytically the correlationfunction and the power spectrum of the projected peculiar velocities of galaxyclusters. by taking into account the spatial clustering properties of thesesources, we perform a line-of-sight computation of the {\em all-sky} ksz powerspectrum and find that at large angular scales ($l&lt;10$), the local bulk flowshould leave a visible signature above the poisson-like fluctuations dominantat smaller scales, while the coupling of density and velocity fluctuationsshould give much smaller contribution. we conduct an analysis of the prospectsof future high resolution cmb experiments (such as act and spt) to detect theksz signal and to extract cosmological information and dark energy constraintsfrom it. we present two complementary methods, one suitable for ``deep andnarrow'' surveys such as act and one suitable for ``wide and shallow'' surveyssuch as spt. both methods can constraint the equation of state of dark energy$w$ to about 5-10% when applied to forthcoming and future surveys, and probe$w$ in complementary redshift ranges, which could shed some light on its timeevolution. these determinations of $w$ do not rely on the knowledge of clustermasses, although they make minimal assumptions on cluster physics.

astro-ph;0603449	wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) three year results:  implications for cosmology	a simple cosmological model with only six parameters (matter density, omega_mh^2, baryon density, omega_b h^2, hubble constant, h_0, amplitude offluctuations, sigma_8, optical depth, tau, and a slope for the scalarperturbation spectrum, n_s) fits not only the three year wmap temperature andpolarization data, but also small scale cmb data, light element abundances,large-scale structure observations, and the supernova luminosity/distancerelationship. using wmap data only, the best fit values for cosmologicalparameters for the power-law flat lcdm model are (omega_m h^2, omega_b h^2, h,n_s, tau, sigma_8) = 0.1277+0.0080-0.0079, 0.02229+-0.00073, 0.732+0.031-0.032,0.958+-0.016, 0.089+-0.030, 0.761+0.049-0.048). the three year datadramatically shrink the allowed volume in this six dimensional parameter space.assuming that the primordial fluctuations are adiabatic with a power lawspectrum, the wmap data_alone_ require dark matter, and favor a spectral indexthat is significantly less than the harrison-zel'dovich-peebles scale-invariantspectrum (n_s=1, r=0). models that suppress large-scale power through a runningspectral index or a large-scale cut-off in the power spectrum are a better fitto the wmap and small scale cmb data than the power-law lcdm model; however,the improvement in the fit to the wmap data is only delta chi^2 = 3 for 1 extradegree of freedom. the combination of wmap and other astronomical data yieldssignificant constraints on the geometry of the universe, the equation of stateof the dark energy, the gravitational wave energy density, and neutrinoproperties. consistent with the predictions of simple inflationary theories, wedetect no significant deviations from gaussianity in the cmb maps.

astro-ph;0603451	three-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) observations:  temperature analysis	we present new full-sky temperature maps in five frequency bands from 23 to94 ghz, based on the first three years of the wmap sky survey. the new maps,which are consistent with the first-year maps and more sensitive, incorporateimprovements in data processing made possible by the additional years of dataand by a more complete analysis of the polarization signal. these includerefinements in the gain calibration and beam response models. we employ twoforms of multi-frequency analysis to separate astrophysical foreground signalsfrom the cmb, each of which improves on our first-year analyses. first, we forman improved 'internal linear combination' map, based solely on wmap data, byadding a bias correction step and by quantifying residual uncertainties in theresulting map. second, we fit and subtract new spatial templates that tracegalactic emission; in particular, we now use low-frequency wmap data to tracesynchrotron emission. the wmap point source catalog is updated to include 115new sources. we derive the angular power spectrum of the temperature anisotropyusing a hybrid approach that combines a maximum likelihood estimate at low l(large angular scales) with a quadratic cross-power estimate for l&gt;30. our bestestimate of the cmb power spectrum is derived by averaging cross-power spectrafrom 153 statistically independent channel pairs. the combined spectrum iscosmic variance limited to l=400, and the signal-to-noise ratio per l-modeexceeds unity up to l=850. the first two acoustic peaks are seen at l=220.8 +-0.7 and l=530.9 +- 3.8, respectively, while the first two troughs are seen atl=412.4 +- 1.9 and l=675.1 +- 11.1, respectively. the rise to the third peak isunambiguous; when the wmap data are combined with higher resolution cmbmeasurements, the existence of a third acoustic peak is well established.

astro-ph;9409024	signatures of bulge triaxiality from kinematics in baade's window/	we study a sample of 62 baade's window (1,-4) k giants that have publishedproper motions, radial velocity and metallicity. we construct the velocityellipsoids for the metal rich stars and metal poor stars. we find a vertexdeviation characteristic of a non-axisymmetric system. the long axes of thevelocity ellipsoids of two samples point to two nearly perpendicular directions(lv,bv)=(-65+-9,+14+-9) and (25+-14,-11+-14) respectively. the vertexdeviations of the velocity ellipsoids cannot be consistently explained by anyoblate model. we populate orbits in a realistic bar potential with a gaussianvelocity distribution, allowing us to simulate and interpret observations. weconclude that the data are consistent with a triaxial bulge pointing towards(l,b) with l&lt;0 and b=0 as suggested by earlier work. we also predict that lowlatitude abs(b)&lt;4 deg bulge fields should show the vertex deviation morestrongly and would therefore be the best locations for future proper motionstudies. the metal rich and metal poor stars appear to occupy the direct boxyand retrograde loop orbits. the correlations between the metallicity and theorbit families can develop if the bulge forms dissipatively on a sufficientlylong time scale. however, it is difficult to reconcile the existence of suchcorrelations with a violent history for the potential of the inner galaxy.

astro-ph;9503093	the formation of lsb galaxies	the formation of low surface brightness galaxies is an unavoidable predictionof any hierarchical clustering scenario. in these models, low surfacebrightness galaxies form at late times from small initial overdensities, andmake up most of the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function. because thereare tremendous observational biases against finding low surface brightnessgalaxies, the observed faint end of the galaxy luminosity function may easilyfall short of predictions, if hierarchical structure formation is correct. wecalculate the number density and mass density in collapsed objects as afunction of baryonic surface density and redshift, and show that the mass inrecently formed low surface brightness galaxies can be comparable to the massbound into ``normal'' high surface brightness galaxies. because of their lowgas surface densities, these galaxies are easily ionized by the uv backgroundand are not expected to appear in hi surveys. low surface brightness galaxies(lsbs) are not a special case of galaxy formation and are perhaps better viewedas a continuance of the hubble sequence.

astro-ph;9611226	the formation of disk galaxies	we present a scenario for the formation of disks which explains not only theproperties of normal galaxies, but the properties of the population of lowsurface brightness galaxies (lsbs) as well. we use a gravitationallyself-consistent model for disk collapse to calculate the observable propertiesof disk galaxies as a function of mass and angular momentum of the initialprotogalaxy. the model naturally produces smooth, asymptotically flat rotationcurves, exponential surface brightness profiles over many disk scale lengths,the tully-fisher relation as a function of surface brightness, the observeddistribution of scale lengths and surface brightnesses, and the variation ofrotation curve shapes. in the model, low mass and/or high angular momentumhalos naturally form low surface brightness disks. theoretical and numericalcalculations suggest galaxy halos should form with a wide range of mass andangular momenta, and thus, the disks which form within these halos should havea wide range of surface brightnesses and scale lengths. we use the formalism tocalculate the expected change in the observed luminosity function (lf) andluminosity density as a function of limiting surface brightness. currentmeasurements of the lf may by off by factors of 2 at l*.

astro-ph;9806349	extragalactic foregrounds of the cosmic microwave background: prospects  for the map mission	(abridged) while the major contribution to the cosmic microwave background(cmb) anisotropies are the sought-after primordial fluctuations produced at thesurface of last scattering, other effects produce secondary fluctuations atlower redshifts. here, we study the extragalactic foregrounds of the cmb in thecontext of the upcoming map mission. we first survey the major extragalacticforegrounds and show that discrete sources, the sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect,and gravitational lensing are the most dominant ones for map. we then show thatmap will detect (&gt;5 sigma) about 46 discrete sources and 10 sz clustersdirectly with 94 ghz fluxes above 2 jy. the mean sz fluxes of fainter clusterscan be probed by cross-correlating map with cluster positions extracted fromexisting catalogs. for instance, a map-xbacs cross-correlation will besensitive to clusters with s(94ghz)&gt;200mjy, and will thus provide a test oftheir virialization state and a measurement of their gas fraction. finally, weconsider probing the hot gas on supercluster scales by cross-correlating thecmb with galaxy catalogs. assuming that galaxies trace the gas, we show that across-correlation between map and the apm catalog should yield a marginaldetection, or at least a four-fold improvement on the cobe upper limits for therms compton y-parameter.

astro-ph;9912180	the power spectrum of the sunyaev-zel'dovich effect	(abridged) the hot gas in the igm produces anisotropies in the cosmicmicrowave background (cmb) through the thermal sunyaev-zel'dovich (sz) effect.the sz effect is a powerful probe of large-scale structure in the universe andmust be carefully subtracted from measurements of the primary cmb anisotropies.we use moving-mesh hydrodynamical simulations to study the 3-dimensionalstatistics of the gas, and compute the mean comptonization parameter and theangular power spectrum of the sz fluctuations, for different cosmologies. wecompare these results with predictions using the press-schechter formalism. wefind that the two methods agree approximately, but differ in details. wediscuss this discrepancy, and show that resolution limits the reliability ofour results to the 200&lt;l&lt;2000 range. for cluster- normalized cdm models, the szpower spectrum is comparable to the primordial power spectrum around l=2000. weshow that groups and filaments (kt&lt;5 kev) contribute about 50% of the sz powerspectrum at l=500. about half of the sz power spectrum on these scales isproduced at redshifts z&lt;0.1, and can thus be detected and removed usingexisting catalogs of galaxies and x-ray clusters. we discuss the implicationsof these results for the future map and planck surveyor missions.

0811.4280	five-year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (wmap) observations:  bayesian estimation of cmb polarization maps	we describe a sampling method to estimate the polarized cmb signal fromobserved maps of the sky. we use a metropolis-within-gibbs algorithm toestimate the polarized cmb map, containing q and u stokes parameters at eachpixel, and its covariance matrix. these can be used as inputs for cosmologicalanalyses. the polarized sky signal is parameterized as the sum of threecomponents: cmb, synchrotron emission, and thermal dust emission. the polarizedgalactic components are modeled with spatially varying power law spectralindices for the synchrotron, and a fixed power law for the dust, and theircomponent maps are estimated as by-products. we apply the method to simulatedlow resolution maps with pixels of side 7.2 degrees, using diagonal and fullnoise realizations drawn from the wmap noise matrices. the cmb maps arerecovered with goodness of fit consistent with errors. computing the likelihoodof the e-mode power in the maps as a function of optical depth to reionization,tau, for fixed temperature anisotropy power, we recover tau=0.091+-0.019 for asimulation with input tau=0.1, and mean tau=0.098 averaged over 10 simulations.a `null' simulation with no polarized cmb signal has maximum likelihoodconsistent with tau=0. the method is applied to the five-year wmap data, usingthe k, ka, q and v channels. we find tau=0.090+-0.019, compared totau=0.086+-0.016 from the template-cleaned maps used in the primary wmapanalysis. the synchrotron spectral index, beta, averaged over highsignal-to-noise pixels with standard deviation sigma(beta)&lt;0.25, but excluding~6% of the sky masked in the galactic plane, is -3.03+-0.04. this estimate doesnot vary significantly with galactic latitude, although includes an informativeprior.
