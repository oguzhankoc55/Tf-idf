0706.1345	spectroscopy and multiband photometry of the afterglow of intermediate  duration gamma-ray burst 040924 and its host galaxy	we present optical photometry and spectroscopy of the afterglow and hostgalaxy of gamma-ray burst 040924. this grb had a rather short duration of t90~2.4s, and a well sampled optical afterglow light curve. we aim to use thisdataset to find further evidence that this burst is consistent with a massivestar core-collapse progenitor. we combine the afterglow data reported here withdata taken from the literature and compare the host properties with surveydata. we find that the global behaviour of the optical afterglow is well fit bya broken power-law, with a break at ~0.03 days. we determine the redshift z =0.858 +/- 0.001 from the detected emission lines in our spectrum. using thespectrum and photometry we derive global properties of the host, showing it tohave similar properties to long grb hosts. we detect the [ne iii] emission linein the spectrum, and compare the fluxes of this line of a sample of 15 long grbhost galaxies with survey data, showing the long grb hosts to be comparable tolocal metal-poor emission line galaxies in their [ne iii] emission. we fit thesupernova bump accompanying this burst, and find that it is similar to otherlong grb supernova bumps, but fainter. all properties of grb 040924 areconsistent with an origin in the core-collapse of a massive star: thesupernova, the spectrum and sed of the host and the afterglow.

0907.1057	physical conditions in high-redshift grb-dla absorbers observed with  vlt/uves: implications for molecular hydrogen searches	we aim to understand the nature of the absorbing neutral gas in the galaxieshosting high-redshift long-duration grbs and to determine their physicalconditions. we report the detection of a significant number of previouslyunidentified allowed transition lines of fe+, involving the fine structure ofthe ground term and that of other excited levels, from the zabs=3.969, logn(h0)=22.10 dla system located in the host galaxy of grb 050730. thetime-dependent evolution of the observed fe+ energy-level populations ismodelled by assuming the excitation mechanism is fluorescence followingexcitation by ultraviolet photons. this uv pumping model successfullyreproduces the observations, yielding a burst/cloud distance (defined to thenear-side of the cloud) of d=440\pm 30 pc and a linear cloud size ofl=520{+240}{-190} pc. we discuss these results in the context of no detectionsof h2 and ci lines in a sample of seven z&gt;1.8 grb host galaxies observed withvlt/uves. we show that the lack of h2 can be explained by the lowmetallicities, [x/h]&lt;-1, low depletion factors and, at most, moderate particledensities of the systems. this points to a picture where grb-dlas typicallyexhibiting very high h0 column densities are diffuse metal-poor atomic cloudswith high kinetic temperatures, tkin&gt;~1000 k, and large physical extents,l&gt;~100 pc. the properties of grb-dlas observed at high spectral resolutiontowards bright grb afterglows differ markedly from the high metal and dustcontents of grb-dlas observed at lower resolution. this difference likelyresults from the effect of a bias, against systems of high metallicity and/orclose to the grb, due to dust obscuration in the magnitude-limited grbafterglow samples observed with high-resolution spectrographs.

0907.3449	low-resolution spectroscopy of gamma-ray burst optical afterglows:  biases in the swift sample and characterization of the absorbers	(abridged). we present a sample of 77 optical afterglows (oas) of swiftdetected grbs for which spectroscopic follow-up observations have been secured.we provide linelists and equivalent widths for all detected lines redward ofly-alpha. we discuss to what extent the current sample of swift bursts with oaspectroscopy is a biased subsample of all swift detected grbs. for that purposewe define an x-ray selected sample of swift bursts with optimal conditions forground-based follow up from the period march 2005 to september 2008; 146 burstsfulfill our sample criteria. we derive the redshift distribution for thissample and conclude that less than 19% of swift bursts are at z&gt;7. we comparethe high energy properties for three sub-samples of bursts in the sample: i)bursts with redshifts measured from oa spectroscopy, ii) bursts with detectedoa, but no oa-based redshift, and iii) bursts with no detection of the oa. thebursts in group i) have significantly less excess x-ray absorption than burstsin the other two groups. in addition, the fraction of dark bursts is 14% ingroup i), 38% in group ii) and &gt; 39% in group iii). from this we conclude thatthe sample of grbs with oa spectroscopy is not representative for all swiftbursts, most likely due to a bias against the most dusty sight-lines. finally,we characterize grb absorption systems as a class and compare them to qsoabsorption systems, in particular dlas. on average grb absorbers arecharacterized by significantly stronger ews for hi as well as for both low andhigh ionization metal lines than what is seen in intervening qso absorbers.based on the z&gt;2 bursts in the sample we place a 95% confidence upper limit of7.5% on the mean escape fraction of ionizing photons from star-forminggalaxies.

1002.4626	galaxy counterparts of metal-rich damped lyman-alpha absorbers - i: the  case of the z=2.35 dla towards q2222-0946	we have initiated a survey using the newly commissioned x-shooterspectrograph to target candidate relatively metal-rich damped lyman-alphaabsorbers (dlas). the spectral coverage of x-shooter allows us to search fornot only lyman-alpha emission, but also rest-frame optical emission lines. wehave chosen dlas where the strongest rest-frame optical lines ([oii], [oiii],hbeta and halpha) fall in the nir atmospheric transmission bands. in this firstpaper resulting from the survey, we report on the discovery of the galaxycounterpart of the z_abs = 2.354 dla towards the z=2.926 quasar q2222$-0946.this dla is amongst the most metal-rich z&gt;2 dlas studied so far at comparableredshifts and there is evidence for substantial depletion of refractoryelements onto dust grains. we measure metallicities from znii, siii, niii, mniiand feii of -0.46+/-0.07, -0.51+/-0.06, -0.85+/-0.06, -1.23+/-0.06, and-0.99+/-0.06, respectively. the galaxy is detected in the lyman-alpha, [oiii]lambda4959,5007 halpha emission lines at an impact parameter of about 0.8arcsec (6 kpc at z_abs = 2.354). we infer a star-formation rate of 10 m_sunyr^-1, which is a lower limit due to the possibility of slit-loss. compared tothe recently determined halpha luminosity function for z=2.2 galaxies thedla-galaxy counterpart has a luminosity of l~0.1l^*_halpha. the emission-lineratios are 4.0 (lyalpha/halpha) and 1.2 ([oiii]/halpha). the lyalpha line showsclear evidence for resonant scattering effects, namely an asymmetric,redshifted (relative to the systemic redshift) component and a much weakerblueshifted component. the fact that the blueshifted component is relativelyweak indicates the presence of a galactic wind. the properties of the galaxycounterpart of this dla is consistent with the prediction that metal-rich dlasare associated with the most luminous of the dla-galaxy counterparts.

1004.1131	grb 021004: tomography of a gamma-ray burst progenitor and its host  galaxy	we analyse the distribution of matter around the progenitor star of gamma-rayburst grb 021004 as well as the properties of its host galaxy withhigh-resolution echelle as well as near-infrared spectroscopy. observationswere taken by the 8.2m very large telescope with the ultraviolet and visualechelle spectrograph (uves) and the infrared spectrometer and array camera(isaac) between 10 and 14 hours after the onset of the event. we report thefirst detection of emission lines from a grb host galaxy in the near-infrared,detecting h-alpha and the [o iii] doublet. these allow an independentmeasurement of the systemic redshift (z = 2.3304 +/- 0.0005) which is notcontaminated by absorption as the ly-alpha line is, and the deduction ofproperties of the host galaxy. from the visual echelle spectroscopy, we findseveral absorption line groups spanning a range of about 3,000 km/s in velocityrelative to the redshift of the host galaxy. the absorption profiles are verycomplex with both velocity-broadened components extending over several 100 km/sand narrow lines with velocity widths of only 20 km/s. by analogy with qsoabsorption line studies, the relative velocities,widths, and degrees ofionization of the lines ("line-locking", "ionization--velocity correlation")show that the progenitor had both an extremely strong radiation field andseveral distinct mass loss phases (winds). these results are consistent withgrb progenitors being massive stars, such as luminous blue variables (lbvs) orwolf--rayet stars, providing a detailed picture of the spatial and velocitystructure of the grb progenitor star at the time of explosion. the host galaxyis a prolific star-forming galaxy with a sfr of about 40 solar masses per year.

1007.5357	vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of the grb 090926a afterglow	the aim of this paper is to study the environment and intervening absorbersof the gamma-ray burst grb 090926a through analysis of optical spectra of itsafterglow. we analyze medium resolution spectroscopic observations (r=10 000,corresponding to 30 km/s, s/n=15 - 30 and wavelength range 3000-25000) of theoptical afterglow of grb 090926a, taken with x-shooter at the vlt ~ 22 hr afterthe grb trigger. the spectrum shows that the ism in the grb host galaxy at z =2.1071 is rich in absorption features, with two components contributing to theline profiles. in addition to the ground state lines, we detect c ii, o i, siii, fe ii and ni ii excited absorption features. no host galaxy emission lines,molecular absorption features nor diffuse interstellar bands are detected inthe spectrum. the hydrogen column density associated to grb 090926a is logn_h/cm^{-2} = 21.60 +/- 0.07, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in therange [x/h] =3.2x10^{-3}-1.2x10^{-2} with respect to the solar values, i.e.,among the lowest values ever observed for a grb host galaxy. a comparison withgalactic chemical evolution models has suggested that the host of grb090926a islikely to be a dwarf irregular galaxy. we put an upper limit to the hydrogenmolecular fraction of the host galaxy ism, which is f &lt; 7x10^{-7}. we deriveinformation on the distance between the host absorbing gas and the site of thegrb explosion. the distance of component i is found to be 2.40 +/- 0.15 kpc,while component ii is located far away from the grb, possibly at ~ 5 kpc. thesevalues are compatible with that found for other grbs.

1011.4239	probing grb environments with time variability: ultraspec fast imaging  of grb 080210	we present high time resolution (1.09 s) photometry of grb 080210 obtainedwith ultraspec mounted on the eso/3.6-m telescope, starting 68.22 min after theburst and lasting for 26.45 min. the light curve is smooth on both short (downto 2.18 s) and long time scales, confirmed by a featureless power spectrum. ontop of the fireball power-law decay, bumps and wiggles at different time scalescan, in principle, be produced by density fluctuations in the circumburstmedium, substructures in the jet or by refreshed shocks. comparing ourconstraints with variability limits derived from kinematic arguments, weexclude under-density fluctuations producing flux dips larger than 1 per centwith time scales \deltat &gt; 9.2 min (2 per cent on \deltat &gt; 2.3 min for manyfluctuating regions). in addition, we study the afterglow vlt/fors2 spectrum,the optical-to-x-ray spectral energy distribution (sed) and the time decay. thesed is best fit with a broken power law with slopes {\beta}opt = 0.71 \pm 0.01and {\beta}x = 1.59 \pm 0.07, in disagreement with the fireball model,suggesting a non-standard afterglow for grb 080210. we find av = 0.18 \pm 0.03mag optical extinction due to smc-like dust and an excess x-ray absorption oflog (nh/cm-2) = 21.58 +0.18 -0.26 assuming solar abundances. the spectralanalysis reveals a damped ly{\alpha} absorber (log (nh i /cm-2) = 21.90 \pm0.10) with a low metallicity ([x/h] = -1.21 \pm 0.16), likely associated withthe interstellar medium of the grb host galaxy (z = 2.641).

1107.3748	grb 070125 and the environments of spectral-line poor afterglow  absorbers	grb 070125 is among the most energetic bursts detected and the mostextensively observed so far. nevertheless, unresolved issues are still open inthe literature on the physics of the afterglow and on the grb environment. inparticular, grb 070125 was claimed to have exploded in a galactic haloenvironment, based on the uniqueness of the optical spectrum and thenon-detection of an underlying host galaxy. in this work we collect allpublicly available data and address these issues by modelling the nir-to-x-rayspectral energy distribution (sed) and studying the high signal-to-noisevlt/fors afterglow spectrum in comparison with a larger sample of grbabsorbers. the sed reveals a synchrotron cooling break in the uv, lowequivalent hydrogen column density and little reddening caused by a lmc- orsmc-type extinction curve. from the weak mgii absorption at z=1.5477 in thespectrum, we derived logn(mgii)=12.96+0.13-0.18 and upper limits on the ioniccolumn density of several metals. these suggest that the grb absorber is mostlikely an lls with a 0.03z\odot&lt;z&lt;1.3z\odot metallicity. the comparison withother grb absorbers places grb070125 at the low end of the absorption lineequivalent width distribution, confirming that weak spectral features andspectral-line poor absorbers are not so uncommon in afterglow spectra.moreover, we show that the effect of photo-ionization on the gas surroundingthe grb, combined with a low n(hi) along a short segment of the line of sightwithin the host galaxy, can explain the lack of spectral features in grb070125.finally, the non-detection of an underlying galaxy is consistent with a faintgrb host galaxy, well within the grb host brightness distribution. thus, thepossibility that grb070125 is simply located in the outskirts of a gas-rich,massive star-forming region inside its small and faint host galaxy seems morelikely than a gas-poor, halo environment origin.

1205.3490	the optically unbiased grb host (tough) survey. iii. redshift  distribution	we present 10 new gamma-ray burst (grb) redshifts and another five redshiftlimits based on host galaxy spectroscopy obtained as part of a large programconducted at the very large telescope (vlt). the redshifts span the range 0.345&lt; z &lt; 2.54. three of our measurements revise incorrect values from theliterature. the homogeneous host sample researched here consists of 69 hoststhat originally had a redshift completeness of 55% (with 38 out of 69 hostshaving redshifts considered secure). our project, including vlt/x-shooterobservations reported elsewhere, increases this fraction to 77% (53/69), makingthe survey the most comprehensive in terms of redshift completeness of anysample to the full swift depth, analyzed to date. we present the cumulativeredshift distribution and derive a conservative, yet small, associateduncertainty. we constrain the fraction of swift grbs at high redshift to amaximum of 14% (5%) for z &gt; 6 (z &gt; 7). the mean redshift of the host sample isassessed to be &lt;z&gt; &gt; 2.2, with the 10 new redshifts reducing it significantly.using this more complete sample, we confirm previous findings that the grb rateat high redshift (z &gt; 3) appears to be in excess of predictions based onassumptions that it should follow conventional determinations of the starformation history of the universe, combined with an estimate of its likelymetallicity dependence. this suggests that either star formation at highredshifts has been significantly underestimated, for example due to a dominantcontribution from faint, undetected galaxies, or that grb production isenhanced in the conditions of early star formation, beyond that usuallyascribed to lower metallicity.

1207.6088	galaxy counterparts of intervening high-z sub-dlas/dlas and mgii  absorbers towards gamma-ray bursts	we present the first search for galaxy counterparts of intervening high-z(2&lt;z&lt; 3.6) sub-dlas and dlas towards grbs. our final sample comprises of fiveintervening sub-dlas and dlas in four grb fields. to identify candidate galaxycounterparts of the absorbers we use deep optical and near-infrared imaging,and low-, mid- and high-resolution spectroscopy acquired with 6 to 10-m classtelescopes, the hubble and the spitzer space telescopes. furthermore, we usethe spectroscopic information and spectral-energy-distribution fittingtechniques to study them in detail. our main result is the detection andspectroscopic confirmation of the galaxy counterpart of the intervening dla atz=3.096 in the field of grb 070721b (z_grb=3.6298) as proposed by otherauthors. we also identify good candidates for the galaxy counterparts of thetwo strong mgii absorbers at z=0.6915 and 1.4288 towards grb 050820a(z_grb=2.615). the properties of the detected dla galaxy are typical forlyman-break galaxies (lbgs) at similar redshifts; a young, highly starforminggalaxy that shows evidence for a galactic outflow. this supports the hypothesisthat a dla can be the gaseous halo of an lbg. in addition, we report a redshiftcoincidence of different objects associated with metal lines in the same field,separated by 130-161 kpc. the high detection rate of three correlatedstructures on a length scale as small as ~150 kpc in two pairs of lines ofsight is intriguing. the absorbers in each of these are most likely not part ofthe same gravitationally bound structure. they more likely represent groups ofgalaxies.

1207.6102	rapid-response mode vlt/uves spectroscopy of super iron-rich gas exposed  to grb 080310. evidence of ionization in action and episodic star formation  in the host	we analyse high-resolution near-uv and optical spectra of the afterglow ofgrb 080310, obtained with the very large telescope ultraviolet and visualechelle spectrograph (vlt/uves), to investigate the circumburst environment andthe interstellar medium of the gamma-ray burst (grb) host galaxy. the vltrapid-response mode (rrm) enabled the observations to start only 13 minutesafter the swift trigger and a series of four exposures to be collected beforedawn. a low neutral-hydrogen column-density (log n (hi) = 18.7) is measured atthe host-galaxy redshift of z = 2.42743. at this redshift, we also detect alarge number of resonance ground-state absorption lines (e.g., cii, mgii, alii,siii, crii, civ, siiv), as well as time-varying absorption from thefine-structure levels of feii. time-varying absorption from a highly excitedfeiii energy level (7s3), giving rise to the so-called uv34 line triplet, isalso detected, for the first time in a grb afterglow. the crii ground-state andall observed feii energy levels are found to depopulate with time, whilst thefeiii 7s3 level is increasingly populated. this absorption-line variability isclear evidence of ionization by the grb, which is for the first timeconclusively observed in a grb afterglow spectrum. we derive ionic columndensities at each epoch of observations by fitting absorption lines with afour-component voigt-profile model. we perform cloudy photo-ionizationmodelling of the expected pre-burst ionic column densities, to estimate that,before the onset of the burst, [c/h] = -1.3 \pm 0.2, [o/h] &lt; -0.8, [si/h] =-1.2 \pm 0.2, [cr/h] = +0.7 \pm 0.2, and [fe/h] = +0.2 \pm 0.2 for theintegrated line profile, indicating strong overabundances of iron and chromium.for one of the components, we observe even more extreme ratios of [si/fe] \leq-1.47 and [c/fe] \leq -1.74.

1209.1506	time-dependent excitation and ionization modelling of absorption-line  variability due to grb 080310	we model the time-variable absorption of feii, feiii, siii, cii and criidetected in uves spectra of grb 080310, with the afterglow radiation excitingand ionizing the interstellar medium in the host galaxy at a redshift ofz=2.42743. to estimate the rest-frame afterglow brightness as a function oftime, we use a combination of the optical vri photometry obtained by theraptor-t telescope array -- which are presented in this paper -- and swift'sx-ray telescope observations. excitation alone, which has been successfullyapplied for a handful of other grbs, fails to describe the observedcolumn-density evolution in the case of grb 080310. inclusion of ionization isrequired to explain the column-density decrease of all observed feii levels(including the ground state 6d9/2) and increase of the feiii 7s3 level. thelarge population of ions in this latter level (up to 10% of all feiii) can onlybe explained through ionization of feii, whereby a large fraction of theionized feii ions -- we calculate 31% using the flexible atomic (fac) and cowancodes -- initially populate the 7s3 level of feiii rather than the groundstate. this channel for producing a significant feiii 7s3 level population maybe relevant for other objects in which absorption lines from this level -- theuv34 triplet -- are observed, such as bal quasars and eta carinae. thisprovides conclusive evidence for time-variable ionization in the circumburstmedium, which to date has not been convincingly detected. however, the best-fitdistance of the neutral absorbing cloud to the grb is 200--400 pc, i.e. similarto grb-absorber distance estimates for grbs without any evidence forionization. we find that the presence of time-varying ionization in grb 080310is likely due to a combination of the super-solar iron abundance ([fe/h]=+0.2)and the low hi column density (log n(hi)=18.7).

1406.7640	a wolf-rayet-like progenitor of supernova sn 2013cu from spectral  observations of a wind	the explosive fate of massive stripped wolf-rayet (w-r) stars is a key openquestion in stellar physics. an appealing option is that hydrogen-deficient w-rstars are the progenitors of some h-poor supernova (sn) explosions of typesiib, ib, and ic. a blue object, having luminosity and colors consistent withthose of some w-r stars, has been recently identified at the location of asn~ib in pre-explosion images but has not yet been conclusively determined tohave been the progenitor. similar previous works have so far only resulted innondetections. comparison of early photometric observations of type icsupernovae with theoretical models suggests that the progenitor stars had radii&lt;10^12 cm, as expected for some w-r stars. however, the hallmark signature ofw-r stars, their emission-line spectra, cannot be probed by such studies. here,we report the detection of strong emission lines in an early-time spectrum ofsn 2013cu (iptf13ast; type iib) obtained ~15.5 hr after explosion ("flashspectroscopy"). we identify w-r-like wind signatures suggesting a progenitor ofthe wn(h) subclass. the extent of this dense wind may indicate increased massloss from the progenitor shortly prior to its explosion, consistent with recenttheoretical predictions.

1409.4804	vlt/x-shooter spectroscopy of the afterglow of the swift grb 130606a:  chemical abundances and reionisation at $z\sim6$	the reionisation of the universe is thought to have ended around z~6, asinferred from spectroscopy of distant bright background sources, such asquasars (qso) and gamma-ray burst (grb) afterglows. furthermore, spectroscopyof a grb afterglow provides insight in its host galaxy, which is often too dimand distant to study otherwise. we present the high s/n vlt/x-shooter spectrumof grb130606a at z=5.913. we aim to measure the degree of ionisation of the igmbetween 5.02&lt;z&lt;5.84 and to study the chemical abundance pattern and dustcontent of its host galaxy. we measured the flux decrement due to absorption atly$\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ wavelength regions. the hydrogen and metalabsorption lines formed in the host galaxy were fitted with voigt profiles toobtain column densities. our measurements of the ly$\alpha$-forest opticaldepth are consistent with previous measurements of qsos, but have a muchsmaller uncertainty. the analysis of the red damping wing yields a neutralfraction $x_{hi}&lt;0.05$ (3$\sigma$). we obtain column density measurements ofseveral elements. the ionisation corrections due to the grb is estimated to benegligible (&lt;0.03 dex), but larger corrections may apply due to thepre-existing radiation field (up to 0.4 dex based on sub-dla studies). ourmeasurements confirm that the universe is already predominantly ionised overthe redshift range probed in this work, but was slightly more neutral at z&gt;5.6.grbs are useful probes of the ionisation state of the igm in the earlyuniverse, but because of internal scatter we need a larger statistical sampleto draw robust conclusions. the high [si/fe] in the host can be due to dustdepletion, alpha-element enhancement, or a combination of both. the very highvalue of [al/fe]=2.40+/-0.78 might connected to the stellar population history.we estimate the host metallicity to be -1.7&lt;[m/h]&lt;-0.9 (2%-13% of solar).(trunc.)

1409.6315	the warm, the excited, and the molecular gas: grb 121024a shining  through its star-forming galaxy	we present the first reported case of the simultaneous metallicitydetermination of a gamma-ray burst (grb) host galaxy, from both afterglowabsorption lines as well as strong emission-line diagnostics. usingspectroscopic and imaging observations of the afterglow and host of thelong-duration swift grb121024a at z = 2.30, we give one of the most completeviews of a grb host/environment to date. we observe a strong damped ly-alphaabsorber (dla) with a hydrogen column density of log n(hi) = 21.88 +/- 0.10, h2absorption in the lyman-werner bands (molecular fraction of log(f)~ -1.4;fourth solid detection of molecular hydrogen in a grb-dla), the nebularemission lines h-alpha, h-beta, [o ii], [o iii] and [n ii], as well as metalabsorption lines. we find a grb host galaxy that is highly star-forming (sfr ~40 solar masses/yr ), with a dust-corrected metallicity along the line of sightof [zn/h]corr = -0.6 +/- 0.2 ([o/h] ~ -0.3 from emission lines), and adepletion factor [zn/fe] = 0.85 +/- 0.04. the molecular gas is separated by 400km/s (and 1-3 kpc) from the gas that is photoexcited by the grb. this implies afairly massive host, in agreement with the derived stellar mass oflog(m/m_solar ) = 9.9+/- 0.2. we dissect the host galaxy by characterising itsmolecular component, the excited gas, and the line-emitting star-formingregions. the extinction curve for the line of sight is found to be unusuallyflat (rv ~15). we discuss the possibility of an anomalous grain sizedistributions. we furthermore discuss the different metallicity determinationsfrom both absorption and emission lines, which gives consistent results for theline of sight to grb 121024a.

1505.06743	grb hosts through cosmic time - vlt/x-shooter emission-line spectroscopy  of 96 grb-selected galaxies at 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 3.6	[abridged] we present data and initial results from vlt/x-shooteremission-line spectroscopy of 96 grb-selected galaxies at 0.1&lt;z&lt;3.6, thelargest sample of grb host spectroscopy available to date. most of our grbswere detected by swift and 76% are at 0.5&lt;z&lt;2.5 with a median z~1.6. based onbalmer and/or forbidden lines of oxygen, nitrogen, and neon, we measuresystemic redshifts, star formation rates (sfrs), visual attenuations, oxygenabundances (12+log(o/h)), and emission-line widths. we find a strong change ofthe typical physical properties of grb hosts with redshift. the median sfr, forexample, increases from ~0.6 m_sun/yr at z~0.6 up to ~15 m_sun/yr at z~2. ahigher ratio of [oiii]/[oii] at higher redshifts leads to an increasingdistance of grb-selected galaxies to the locus of local galaxies in the bptdiagram. oxygen abundances of the galaxies are distributed between12+log(o/h)=7.9 and 12+log(o/h)=9.0 with a median of 12+log(o/h)~8.5. thefraction of grb-selected galaxies with super-solar metallicities is around 20%at z&lt;1 in the adopted metallicity scale. this is significantly less than thefraction of star formation in similar galaxies, illustrating that grbs arescarce in high-metallicity environments. at z~3, sensitivity limits us toprobing only the most luminous grb hosts for which we derive metallicities of z~&lt; 0.5 z_sun. together with a high incidence of galaxies with similarmetallicity in our sample at z~1.5, this indicates that the metallicitydependence observed at low redshift will not be dominant at z~3.

0806.1182	photometry and spectroscopy of grb 060526: a detailed study of the  afterglow and host galaxy of a z=3.2 gamma-ray burst	aims: with this paper we want to investigate the highly variable afterglowlight curve and environment of gamma-ray burst (grb) 060526 at $z=3.221$.methods: we present one of the largest photometric datasets ever obtained for agrb afterglow, consisting of multi-color photometric data from the ultravioletto the near infrared. the data set contains 412 data points in total to whichwe add additional data from the literature. furthermore, we presentlow-resolution high signal-to-noise spectra of the afterglow. the afterglowlight curve is modeled with both an analytical model using broken power lawfits and with a broad-band numerical model which includes energy injections.the absorption lines detected in the spectra are used to derive columndensities using a multi-ion single-component curve-of-growth analysis fromwhich we derive the metallicity of the host of grb 060526. results: thetemporal behaviour of the afterglow follows a double broken power law withbreaks at $t=0.090\pm0.005$ and $t=2.401\pm0.061$ days. it shows deviationsfrom the smooth set of power laws that can be modeled by additional energyinjections from the central engine, although some significant microvariabilityremains. the broadband spectral-energy distribution of the afterglow shows nosignificant extinction along the line of sight. the metallicity derived from\ion{s}{ii} and \ion{fe}{ii} of [s/h] = --0.57 $\pm$0.25 and [fe/h] =--1.09$\pm$0.24 is relatively high for a galaxy at that redshift but comparableto the metallicity of other grb hosts at similar redshifts. at the position ofthe afterglow, no host is detected to f775w(ab) = 28.5 mag with the hst,implying an absolute magnitude of the host m(1500 \aa{})$&gt;$--18.3 mag which isfainter than most long-duration hosts, although the grb may be associated witha faint galaxy at a distance of 11 kpc.

0807.3554	ifu observations of the grb 980425/sn 1998bw host galaxy: emission line  ratios in grb regions	the collapsar model predicts that the progenitors of gamma-ray bursts (grbs)are metal poor in fe group elements. the existence of low metallicity stellarpopulations could manifest itself through special characteristics of theimmediate environment of the grb site in the host galaxy. we analyse the strongemission lines from the sub-luminous host galaxy of grb 980425, which showedthe first connection with a supernova explosion (sn 1998bw). the host has asufficient size to allow detailed resolved spectroscopy of individual hiiregions and to look for regions with special properties close to the the grbsite. using integral field spectroscopy with vimos we cover most of the highsurface brightness part of the host including the hii region where thesupernova and grb occurred. the star formation rate, reddening, equivalentwidth and stellar mass in the grb region is similar to other hii regions in thehost. extreme values arise in the only region that shows emission lines fromwolf-rayet stars; a region that lies 800 pc in projection from the grb site.strong emission line diagnostics of all hii regions imply oxygen abundancesbetween 0.3 and 0.8 solar with the lowest values arising in the wr and grbregions. comparing the measured emission line ratios for a sample of lowredshift grb hosts to theoretical models and to observations of field galaxies,we find that grbs arise in a range of metallicity environments while theregions are consistently very young. the similar line ratios of grb hostscompared to the wr region can arise in spatially unresolved galaxies withbright hii regions near the grb location.

astro-ph;0001497	spectral evolution of the peculiar ic supernova 1998bw	sn 1998bw holds the record for the most energetic type ic explosion, one ofthe brightest radio supenovae and probably the first supernova associated witha gamma-ray burst. in this paper we present spectral observations of sn 1998bwobserved in a cooperative monitoring campaign using the aat, ukst and the sso2.3-m telescope. we investigate the evolution of the spectrum between 7 and 94days after v_band maximum in comparison to well-studied examples of type ic snein order to quantify the unusual properties of this supernova event. though theearly spectra differ greatly from the observations of classical ic sne, we findthat the evolution from the photospheric to the nebular phases is slow butotherwise typical. the spectra differ predominantly in the extensive lineblending and blanketing which has been attributed to the high velocity of theejecta. we find that by day 19, the absorption line minima blueshifts are 10% -50% higher than other sne and on day 94 emission lines are 45% broader, asexpected if the progenitor had a massive envelope. however, it is difficult toexplain the extent of line blanketing entirely by line broadening, and we arguethat additional contribution from other species is present, indicating unusualrelative abundances or physical conditions in the envelope.

astro-ph;0007201	the very red afterglow of grb 000418 - further evidence for dust  extinction in a grb host galaxy	we report near-infrared and optical follow-up observations of the afterglowof the gamma-ray burst 000418 starting 2.5 days after the occurrence of theburst and extending over nearly seven weeks. grb 000418 represents the secondcase for which the afterglow was initially identified by observations in thenear-infrared. during the first 10 days its r-band afterglow was wellcharacterized by a single power-law decay with a slope of 0.86. however, atlater times the temporal evolution of the afterglow flattens with respect to asimple power-law decay. attributing this to an underlying host galaxy we findits magnitude to be r=23.9 and an intrinsic afterglow decay slope of 1.22. theafterglow was very red with r-k=4 mag. the observations can be explained by anadiabatic, spherical fireball solution and a heavy reddening due to dustextinction in the host galaxy. this supports the picture that (long) bursts areassociated with events in star-forming regions.

astro-ph;0009025	vlt spectroscopy of grb 990510 and grb 990712; probing the faint and  bright end of the grb host galaxy population	we present time-resolved optical spectroscopy of the afterglows of thegamma-ray bursts grb 990510 and grb 990712. through the identification ofseveral absorption lines in the first epoch grb 990510 spectrum, we determinethe redshift for this burst at z &gt;= 1.619. no clear emission lines aredetected. the strength of the mgi feature is indicative of a dense environment,most likely the host galaxy of grb 990510. although the host is extremely faint(v &gt;~ 28), the grb afterglow allows us to probe its interstellar medium and -in principle - to measure its metallicity. the optical spectrum of grb 990712(whose host galaxy is the brightest of the known grb hosts at cosmologicalredshifts), shows clear features both in emission and absorption, at a redshiftof z = 0.4331 +/- 0.0004. on the basis of several line emission diagnosticdiagrams, we conclude that the host galaxy of grb 990712 is most likely an hiigalaxy. we derive a unreddened [oii] star formation rate of 2.7 +/- 0.8msun/yr. correcting for the measured extinction intrinsic to the host galaxy(a(v) = \gpm{3.4}{2.4}{1.7}), this value increases to \gpm{35}{178}{25}msun/yr. the [oii] equivalent width, compared to that of field galaxies at z &lt;=1, also suggests that the host of grb 990712 is vigorously forming stars. weemploy the oxygen and hbeta emission-line intensities to estimate the globaloxygen abundance for the host of grb 990712: log(o/h) = -3.7 +- 0.4, which isslightly below the lowest metallicity one finds in nearby spiral galaxies. forboth grbs we study the time evolution of the absorption lines, whose equivalentwidth might be expected to change with time if the burst resides in a densecompact medium. we find no evidence for a significant change in the mgii width.

astro-ph;0205241	on the progenitor of the type ic supernova 2002ap	this letter presents wide-field optical and and nir ubvri,halpha,k' images ofthe galaxy m74 which were taken between 0.6-8.3 years before the discovery ofthe type ic sn2002ap. we have located the position of the sn on these imageswith an accuracy of 0.3''. we find no sign of a progenitor object on any of theimages. the deepest of these images is the b-band exposure which has asensitivity limit corresponding to an absolute magnitude of m_b &lt;= -6.3. fromour observed limits, we rule out as the progenitor all evolved states of singlestars with initial masses greater than 20msol unless the wr phase has beenentered. two popular theories for the origin of type ic sne are the corecollapse of massive stars when they are in the wr phase, or the core collapseof a massive star in an interacting binary which has had its envelope strippedthrough mass transfer. our prediscovery images are sensitive only to the mostluminous ~30% of wr stars, leaving a substantial fraction of typical wr starsas viable progenitors. the energetics measured from modelling the spectralevolution of sn 2002ap suggest an explosion of a 5msol c+o core. while wr starsgenerally have measured final masses greater than this, the uncertaintiesassociated with the explosion model, stellar evolutionary calculations and massmeasurements suggest we cannot definitively rule out a wr star progenitor. thealternative scenario is that the progenitor was a star of initial mass20-25msol which was part of an interacting binary. we discuss futureobservations which will provide further constraints on the nature of theprogenitor.

(2002) based on a single emission line. furthermore, wehave determined the photometric redshift of all the galaxies in an area of6'x6' around the host galaxy, in order to check for their overdensity in theenvironment of the host. we find that the grb 000210 host galaxy is asubluminous galaxy (l ~ 0.5+/-0.2 l*), with no companions above our detectionthreshold of 0.18+/-0.06 l*. based on the restframe ultraviolet flux a starformation rate of 2.1+/-0.2 solar masses per year is estimated. the best fit tothe sed is obtained for a starburst template with an age of 0.181^+0.037_-0.026gyr and a very low extinction (av~0). we discuss the implications of theinferred low value of av and the age of the dominant stellar population for thenon detection of the grb 000210 optical afterglow.

astro-ph;0307153	the blue host galaxy of the red grb 000418	we report on multi-band (ubvrizjsks) observations of the host galaxy of theapril 18, 2000 gamma-ray burst. the spectral energy distribution (sed) isanalysed by fitting empirical and synthetic spectral templates. we find that:(i) the best sed fit is obtained with a starburst template, (ii) thephotometric redshift is consistent with the spectroscopic redshift, (iii) thecolours of the host are inconsistent with an old stellar population, and (iv)the global extinction is constrained to be in the range av=0.12-0.61 mag. thederived global extinction agrees with the one reported for the afterglow(av=0.4-0.9 mag), suggesting a homogeneous distribution of the interstellarmedium (ism) in the host galaxy. these findings are supplemented bymorphological information from hubble space telescope (hst) imaging: thesurface brightness profile is smooth, symmetric and compact with no underlyingstructures (like dust lanes, spiral arms or disks). a natural scenario whichaccounts of all the above results is a nuclear starburst that harbours a youngpopulation of stars from which the grb originated.

astro-ph;0408041	probing a grb progenitor at a redshift of z=2: a comprehensive observing  campaign of the afterglow of grb 030226	we report results from a comprehensive follow-up observing campaign of theafterglow of grb 030226, including vlt spectroscopy, vlt polarimetry, andchandra x-ray observations. in addition, we present bootes-1 wide-fieldobservations at the time of the occurrence of the burst. first observations ateso started 0.2 days after the event when the grb afterglow was at a magnitudeof r~19 and continued until the afterglow had faded below the detectionthreshold (r&gt;26). no underlying host galaxy was found. the optical light curveshows a break around 0.8 days after the burst, which is achromatic within theobservational errors, supporting the view that it was due to a jettedexplosion. close to the break time the degree of linear polarization of theafterglow light was less than 1.1%, which favors a uniform jet model ratherthan a structured one. vlt spectra show two absorption line systems atredshifts z=1.962+/-0.001 and at z=1.986+/-0.001, placing the lower limit forthe redshift of the grb close to 2. we emphasize that the kinematics and thecomposition of the absorbing clouds responsible for these line systems is verysimilar to those observed in the afterglow of grb 021004. this corroborates thepicture in which at least some grbs are physically related to the explosion ofa wolf-rayet star.

astro-ph;0501120	spectroscopy of grb 021004: a structured jet ploughing through a massive  stellar wind	we present spectra of the afterglow of grb 021004 taken with wht isis and vltfors1 at three epochs spanning 0.49--6.62 days after the burst. we observestrong absorption likely coming from the host galaxy, alongside absorption inhi, siiv and civ with blueshifts of up to 2900 km/s from the explosion centrewhich we assume originates close to the progenitor. we find no significantvariability of these spectral features. we investigate the origin of theoutflowing material and evaluate various possible progenitor models. the mostplausible explanation is that these result in the fossil stellar wind of ahighly evolved wolf-rayet star. however, ionization from the burst itselfprevents the existence of hi, siiv and civ close to the afterglow surface wherethe fast stellar wind should dominate, and large amounts of blueshiftedhydrogen are not expected in a wolf-rayet star wind. we propose that thewolf-rayet star wind is enriched by a hydrogen-rich companion, and that the grbhas a structured jet geometry in which the gamma rays emerge in a small openingangle within the wider opening angle of the cone of the afterglow. thisscenario is able to explain both the spectral line features and the irregularlight curve of this afterglow.

astro-ph;0504592	late-epoch optical and near-infrared observations of the grb000911  afterglow and its host galaxy	we present the results of an optical and near-infrared (nir) monitoringcampaign of the counterpart of gamma-ray burst (grb) 000911, located atredshift z=1.06, from 5 days to more than 13 months after explosion. ourextensive dataset is a factor of 2 larger and spans a time interval about 4times longer than the ones considered previously for this grb afterglow; thisallows a more thorough analysis of its light curve and of the grb host galaxyproperties. the afterglow light curves show a single power-law temporaldecline, modified at late times by light from a host galaxy with moderateintrinsic extinction, and possibly by an emerging supernova (sn). the afterglowevolution is interpreted within the classical "fireball" scenario as a weaklycollimated adiabatic shock propagating in the interstellar medium. the presenceof a sn light curve superimposed on the non-thermal afterglow emission isinvestigated: while in the optical bands no significant contribution to thetotal light is found from a sn, the nir j-band data show an excess which isconsistent with a sn as bright as the known hypernova sn1998bw. if the sninterpretation is true, this would be the farthest grb-associated sn, as wellas the farthest core-collapse sn, discovered to date. however, other possibleexplanations of this nir excess are also investigated. finally, we studied thephotometric properties of the host, and found that it is likely to be aslightly reddened, subluminous, extreme starburst compact galaxy, withluminosity about 0.1 l*, an age of about 0.5 gyr and a specific star formationrate (sfr) of approximately 30 msol yr-1 (l/l*)-1. this is the highest specificsfr value for a grb host inferred from optical/nir data.

astro-ph;0506101	on the afterglow and host galaxy of grb021004: a comprehensive study  with the hubble space telescope	(abridged) we report on hst observations of the late-time afterglow and hostgalaxy of grb021004 (z=2.33). although this grb is one of the best observed sofar, there is substantial disagreement between different interpretations ofdata sets on this burst in the literature. we have observed the field ofgrb021004 with the hst at multiple epochs from 3 days until almost 10 monthsafter the burst. with stis spectroscopy we cover the spectral region 600-1700aain the restframe. from the limit on the flux recovery bluewards of thelyman-limit we constrain the hi column density to be above 1x10^18 cm-2 basedon acs and nicmos imaging we find that the afterglow evolved achromaticallywithin the errors. the color changes observed by other authors during the firstfour days must be related to a stochastic phenomenon superimposed on anafterglow component with a constant spectral shape. this achromaticity impliesthat the cooling break has remained on the blue side of the optical part of thespectrum for at least two weeks after the burst. the optical-to-x-ray slope isconsistent with being the same at 1.4 and 52.4 days after the burst. thisindicates that the cooling frequency is constant and hence, according tofireball models, that the circumburst medium has a constant density profile.the late-time slope of the lightcurve is in the range alpha_2 = 1.8-1.9, and isinconsistent with a single power-law. this could be due to a late-timeflattening caused by the transition to non-relativistic expansion or due toexcess emission (a lightcurve `bump') 7 days after burst. the host is astarburst galaxy with no evidence for dust and with strong ly-alpha emission.the afterglow was located very close (~100 pc) to the center of the hostsuggesting that the progenitor was associated with a circumnuclear starburst.

0706.1257	detection of grb 060927 at z = 5.47: implications for the use of  gamma-ray bursts as probes of the end of the dark ages	we report on follow-up observations of the grb 060927 using the rotse-iiiatelescope and a suite of larger aperture ground-based telescopes. an opticalafterglow was detected 20 s after the burst, the earliest rest-frame detectionof optical emission from any grb. spectroscopy performed with the vlt about 13hours after the trigger shows a continuum break at lambda ~ 8070 a produced byneutral hydrogen absorption at z~5.6. we also detect an absorption line at 8158a which we interpret as siii at z=5.467. hence, grb 060927 is the second mostdistant grb with a spectroscopically measured redshift. the shape of the redwing of the spectral break can be fitted by a damped lyalpha profile with acolumn density with log(n_hi/cm^-2) ~ 22.5. we discuss the implications of thiswork for the use of grbs as probes of the end of the dark ages and draw threemain conclusions: i) grb afterglows originating from z&gt;6 should be relativelyeasy to detect from the ground, but rapid nir monitoring is necessary to ensurethat they are found; ii) the presence of large hi column densities in some grbshost galaxies at z&gt;5 makes the use of grbs to probe the reionization epoch viaspectroscopy of the red damping wing challenging; iii) grbs appear crucial tolocate typical star-forming galaxies at z&gt;5 and therefore the type of galaxiesresponsible for the reionization of the universe.
