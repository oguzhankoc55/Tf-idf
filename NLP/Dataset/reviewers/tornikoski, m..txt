0910.2607	long-term variability of radio-bright bl lacertae objects	radio-bright bl lacertae objects (blos) are typically variable and exhibitprominent flaring. we use a sample of 24 blos to get a clear idea of theirflaring behavior and to find possible commonalities in their variabilitypatterns. our goal was to compare the results given by computational timescales and the observed variability parameters determined directly from theflux curves. also, we wanted to find out if the blo flares adhere to thegeneralized shock model. we use long-term monitoring data from 4.8, 8, 14.5,22, 37, 90 and 230 ghz. the structure function, discrete correlation functionand lomb-scargle periodogram time scales, calculated in a previous study, areanalyzed in more detail. we determine flare durations, rise and decay times,absolute and relative peak fluxes from the monitoring data. we find that blosdemonstrate a wide range of variability behavior. blos include sources withfast and strong variability, such as oj 287, pks 1749+096 and bl lac, but alsosources with more rolling fluctuations like pks 0735+178. the most extremeflares can last for up to 13 years or have peak fluxes of approximately 12 jyin the observer's frame. when the doppler boosting effect is taken intoaccount, the peak flux of a flare does not depend on the duration of the flare.a rough analysis of the time lags and peak flux evolution indicates that bloflares in the mm - cm wavelengths are high-peaking, i.e., are in the adiabaticstage. thus, the results concur with the generalized shock model.

0910.4540	multiwavelength monitoring of the enigmatic narrow-line seyfert 1 pmn  j0948+0022 in march-july 2009	following the recent discovery of gamma rays from the radio-loud narrow-lineseyfert 1 galaxy pmn j0948+0022 (z=0.5846), we started a multiwavelengthcampaign from radio to gamma rays, which was carried out between the end ofmarch and the beginning of july 2009. the source displayed activity at all theobserved wavelengths: a general decreasing trend from optical to gamma-rayfrequencies was followed by an increase of radio emission after less than twomonths from the peak of the gamma-ray emission. the largest flux change, abouta factor of about 4, occurred in the x-ray band. the smallest was atultraviolet and near-infrared frequencies, where the rate of the detectedphotons dropped by a factor 1.6-1.9. at optical wavelengths, where the samplingrate was the highest, it was possible to observe day-scale variability, withflux variations up to a factor of about 3. the behavior of pmn j0948+0022observed in this campaign and the calculated power carried out by its jet inthe form of protons, electrons, radiation and magnetic field are quite similarto that of blazars, specifically of flat-spectrum radio quasars. these resultsconfirm the idea that radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies hostrelativistic jets with power similar to that of average blazars.

0708.0144	magnetic field structure in the parsec scale jet of 3c273 from  multifrequency vlba observations	we present first results from a multifrequency vlba observations of 3c273 in2003. the source was observed simultaneously at 5.0, 8.4, 15.3, 22.2, 43.2 and86.2 ghz, and from this multifrequency data set, spectra of 16 emissionfeatures in the parsec scale jet were carefully constructed by using a newmodel-fitting based method. the measured spectra and sizes of the emissionfeatures were used to calculate the magnetic field density and the energydensity of the relativistic electrons in the different parts of the parsecscale jet, independent of any equipartition assumption. we measure magneticfield density of an order of 1 gauss in the core. the magnetic energy densityin the core dominates over that of the relativistic electrons, while in thedownstream region our data are roughly consistent with an equipartition. astrong gradient in the magnetic field density across the jet width, coincidentwith a transverse velocity structure at about 1.5 mas from the core, was found:the slower superluminal component b2 on the northern side of the jet has amagnetic field density two orders of magnitude lower than the faster southerncomponents b3 and b4.

1005.3263	the december 2009 gamma-ray flare of 3c 454.3: the multifrequency  campaign	during the month of december, 2009 the blazar 3c 454.3 became the brightestgamma-ray source in the sky, reaching a peak flux f ~2000e-8 ph/cm2/s for e &gt;100 mev. starting in november, 2009 intensive multifrequency campaignsmonitored the 3c 454 gamma-ray outburst. here we report the results of a2-month campaign involving agile, integral, swift/xrt, swift/bat, rossixte forthe high-energy observations, and swift/uvot, kanata, grt, rem for thenear-ir/optical/uv data. the gasp/webt provided radio and additional opticaldata. we detected a long-term active emission phase lasting ~1 month at allwavelengths: in the gamma-ray band, peak emission was reached on december 2-3,2009. remarkably, this gamma-ray super-flare was not accompanied bycorrespondingly intense emission in the optical/uv band that reached a levelsubstantially lower than the previous observations in 2007-2008. the lack ofstrong simultaneous optical brightening during the super-flare and thedetermination of the broad-band spectral evolution severely constrain thetheoretical modelling. we find that the pre- and post-flare broad-band behaviorcan be explained by a one-zone model involving ssc plus external comptonemission from an accretion disk and a broad-line region. however, the spectraof the dec. 2-3, 2009 super-flare and of the secondary peak emission on dec. 9,2009 cannot be satisfactorily modelled by a simple one-zone model. anadditional particle component is most likely active during these states.

1009.2604	another look at the bl lacertae flux and spectral variability	the glast-agile support program (gasp) of the whole earth blazar telescope(webt) monitored bl lacertae in 2008-2009 at radio, near-ir, and opticalfrequencies. during this period, high-energy observations were performed byxmm-newton, swift, and fermi. we analyse these data with particular attentionto the calibration of swift uv data, and apply a helical jet model to interpretthe source broad-band variability. the gasp-webt observations show an opticalflare in 2008 february-march, and oscillations of several tenths of mag on afew-day time scale afterwards. the radio flux is only mildly variable. the uvdata from both xmm-newton and swift seem to confirm a uv excess that is likelycaused by thermal emission from the accretion disc. the x-ray data fromxmm-newton indicate a strongly concave spectrum, as well as moderate fluxvariability on an hour time scale. the swift x-ray data reveal fast (interday)flux changes, not correlated with those observed at lower energies. we comparethe spectral energy distribution (sed) corresponding to the 2008 low-brightnessstate, which was characterised by a synchrotron dominance, to the 1997 outburststate, where the inverse-compton emission was prevailing. a fit with aninhomogeneous helical jet model suggests that two synchrotron components are atwork with their self inverse-compton emission. most likely, they represent theradiation from two distinct emitting regions in the jet. we show that thedifference between the source seds in 2008 and 1997 can be explained in termsof pure geometrical variations. the outburst state occurred when thejet-emitting regions were better aligned with the line of sight, producing anincrease of the doppler beaming factor. our analysis demonstrates that the jetgeometry can play an extremely important role in the bl lacertae flux andspectral variability.

1009.6195	the connection between black hole mass and doppler boosted emission in  bl lacertae type objects	we investigate the relationship between black hole mass (mbh) and dopplerboosted emission for bl lacertae type objects (bl lacs) detected in the sdssand first surveys. the synthesis of stellar population and bidimensionaldecomposition methods allows us to disentangle the components of the hostgalaxy from that of the nuclear black hole in their optical spectra and images,respectively. we derive estimates of black hole masses via stellar velocitydispersion and bulge luminosity. we find that masses delivered by both methodsare consistent within errors. there is no difference between the black holemass ranges for high-synchrotron peaked bl lacs (hbl) and low-synchrotronpeaked bl lacs (lbl). a correlation between the black-hole mass and radio,optical and x-ray luminosity has been found at a high significance level. theoptical-continuum emission correlates with the jet luminosity as well. besides,x-ray and radio emission are correlated when hbls and lbls are consideredseparately. results presented in this work: (i) show that the black hole massdoes not decide the sed shapes of bl lacs, (ii) confirm that x-ray and opticalemission is associated to the relativistic jet, and (iii) present evidence of arelation between mbh and doppler boosted emission, which among bl lacs may beunderstood as a close relation between faster jets and more massive blackholes.

1101.2047	planck early results. xv. spectral energy distributions and radio  continuum spectra of northern extragalactic radio sources	spectral energy distributions (seds) and radio continuum spectra arepresented for a northern sample of 104 extragalactic radio sources, based onthe planck early release compact source catalogue (ercsc) and simultaneousmultifrequency data. the nine planck frequencies, from 30 to 857 ghz, arecomplemented by a set of simultaneous observations ranging from radio togamma-rays. this is the first extensive frequency coverage in the radio andmillimetre domains for an essentially complete sample of extragalactic radiosources, and it shows how the individual shocks, each in their own phase ofdevelopment, shape the radio spectra as they move in the relativistic jet. theseds presented in this paper were fitted with second and third degreepolynomials to estimate the frequencies of the synchrotron and inverse compton(ic) peaks, and the spectral indices of low and high frequency radio data,including the planck ercsc data, were calculated. sed modelling methods arediscussed, with an emphasis on proper, physical modelling of the synchrotronbump using multiplecomponents. planck ercsc data also suggest that the originalaccelerated electron energy spectrum could be much harder than commonlythought, with power-law index around 1.5 instead of the canonical 2.5. theimplications of this are discussed for the acceleration mechanisms effective inblazar shock. furthermore in many cases the planck data indicate that gamma-rayemission must originate in the same shocks that produce the radio emission.

1103.3647	agile detection of extreme gamma-ray activity from the blazar pks  1510-089 during march 2009. multifrequency analysis	we report on the extreme gamma-ray activity from the fsrq pks 1510-089observed by agile in march 2009. in the same period a radio-to-opticalmonitoring of the source was provided by the gasp-webt and rem. moreover,several swift too observations were triggered, adding important information onthe source behaviour from optical/uv to hard x-rays. we paid particularattention to the calibration of the swift/uvot data to make it suitable to theblazars spectra. simultaneous observations from radio to gamma rays allowed usto study in detail the correlation among the emission variability at differentfrequencies and to investigate the mechanisms at work. in the period 9-30 march2009, agile detected an average gamma-ray flux of (311+/-21)x10^-8 ph cm^-2s^-1 for e&gt;100 mev, and a peak level of (702+/-131)x10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 ondaily integration. the gamma-ray activity occurred during a period ofincreasing activity from near-ir to uv, with a flaring episode detected on26-27 march 2009, suggesting that a single mechanism is responsible for theflux enhancement observed from near-ir to uv. by contrast, swift/xrtobservations seem to show no clear correlation of the x-ray fluxes with theoptical and gamma-ray ones. however, the x-ray observations show a harderphoton index (1.3-1.6) with respect to most fsrqs and a hint ofharder-when-brighter behaviour, indicating the possible presence of a secondemission component at soft x-ray energies. moreover, the broad band spectrumfrom radio-to-uv confirmed the evidence of thermal features in the optical/uvspectrum of pks 1510-089 also during high gamma-ray state. on the other hand,during 25-26 march 2009 a flat spectrum in the optical/uv energy band wasobserved, suggesting an important contribution of the synchrotron emission inthis part of the spectrum during the brightest gamma-ray flare, therefore asignificant shift of the synchrotron peak.

1108.1114	simultaneous planck, swift, and fermi observations of x-ray and  gamma-ray selected blazars	we present simultaneous planck, swift, fermi, and ground-based data for 105blazars belonging to three samples with flux limits in the soft x-ray, hardx-ray, and gamma-ray bands. our unique data set has allowed us to demonstratethat the selection method strongly influences the results, producing biasesthat cannot be ignored. almost all the bl lac objects have been detected byfermi-lat, whereas ~40% of the flat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs) in theradio, soft x-ray, and hard x-ray selected samples are still below thegamma-ray detection limit even after integrating 27 months of fermi-lat data.the radio to sub-mm spectral slope of blazars is quite flat up to ~70ghz, abovewhich it steepens to &lt;\alpha&gt;~-0.65. bl lacs have significantly flatter spectrathan fsrqs at higher frequencies. the distribution of the rest-framesynchrotron peak frequency (\nups) in the sed of fsrqs is the same in all theblazar samples with &lt;\nups&gt;=10^13.1 hz, while the mean inverse-compton peakfrequency, &lt;\nupic&gt;, ranges from 10^21 to 10^22 hz. the distributions of \nupsand of \nupic of bl lacs are much broader and are shifted to higher energiesthan those of fsrqs and strongly depend on the selection method. the comptondominance of blazars ranges from ~0.2 to ~100, with only fsrqs reaching values&gt;3. its distribution is broad and depends strongly on the selection method,with gamma-ray selected blazars peaking at ~7 or more, and radio-selectedblazars at values ~1, thus implying that the assumption that the blazar poweris dominated by high-energy emission is a selection effect. simple ssc modelscannot explain the seds of most of the gamma-ray detected blazars in allsamples. the sed of the blazars that were not detected by fermi-lat may insteadbe consistent with ssc emission. our data challenge the correlation betweenbolometric luminosity and \nups predicted by the blazar sequence.

1109.5844	correlation between fermi/lat gamma-ray and 37 ghz radio properties of  northern agn averaged over 11 months	although the fermi mission has increased our knowledge of gamma-ray agn, manyquestions remain, such as the site of gamma-ray production, the emissionmechanism, and the factors that govern the strength of the emission. using datafrom a high radio band, 37 ghz, uncontaminated by other radiation componentsbesides the jet emission, we study these questions with averaged flux densitiesover the the first year of fermi operations. we look for possible correlationsbetween the 100 mev - 100 gev band used by the fermi satellite and 37 ghz radioband observed at the aalto university metsahovi radio telescope, as well as fordifferences between the gamma-ray emission of different agn subsamples. we usedata averaged over the 1fgl period. our sample includes 249 northern agn,including a complete sample of 68 northern agn with a measured average fluxdensity exceeding 1 jy. we find significant correlation between both the fluxdensities and luminosities in gamma and radio bands. the fermi luminosity isinversely correlated with the peak frequency of the synchrotron component ofthe agn spectral energy distributions. we also calculate the gamma dominances,defined as the ratio between the gamma and radio flux densities, and find anindication that high-energy blazars are more gamma-dominated than low-energyblazars. after studying the distributions of gamma and radio luminosities, itis clear that bl lacertae objects are different from quasars, withsignificantly lower luminosities. it is unclear whether this is an intrinsicdifference, an effect of variable relativistic boosting across the synchrotronpeak frequency range, or the result of fermi being more sensitive to hardspectrum sources like bl lacertae objects. our results suggest that the gammaradiation is produced co-spatially with the 37 ghz emission, i.e., in the jet.

1110.5267	the connection between the gamma-ray emission and millimeter flares in  fermi/lat blazars	we compare the gamma-ray photon flux variability of northern blazars in thefermi/lat first source catalog with 37 ghz radio flux density curves from themetsahovi quasar monitoring program. we find that the relationship betweensimultaneous millimeter (mm) flux density and gamma-ray photon flux isdifferent for different types of blazars. the flux relation between the twobands is positively correlated for quasars and does no exist for bllacs.furthermore, we find that the levels of gamma-ray emission in high statesdepend on the phase of the high frequency radio flare, with the brightestgamma-ray events coinciding with the initial stages of a mm flare. the meanobserved delay from the beginning of a mm flare to the peak of the gamma-rayemission is about 70 days, which places the average location of the gamma-rayproduction at or downstream of the radio core. we discuss alternative scenariosfor the production of gamma-rays at distances of parsecs along the length ofthe jet

1206.0745	the structure and emission model of the relativistic jet in the quasar  3c 279 inferred from radio to high-energy gamma-ray observations in 2008-2010	we present time-resolved broad-band observations of the quasar 3c 279obtained from multi-wavelength campaigns conducted during the first two yearsof the fermi gamma-ray space telescope mission. while investigating thepreviously reported gamma-ray/optical flare accompanied by a change in opticalpolarization, we found that the optical emission appears delayed with respectto the gamma-ray emission by about 10 days. x-ray observations reveal a pair of`isolated' flares separated by ~90 days, with only weak gamma-ray/opticalcounterparts. the spectral structure measured by spitzer reveals a synchrotroncomponent peaking in the mid-infrared band with a sharp break at thefar-infrared band during the gamma-ray flare, while the peak appears in themm/sub-mm band in the low state. selected spectral energy distributions arefitted with leptonic models including comptonization of external radiationproduced in a dusty torus or the broad-line region. adopting the interpretationof the polarization swing involving propagation of the emitting region along acurved trajectory, we can explain the evolution of the broad-band spectraduring the gamma-ray flaring event by a shift of its location from ~ 1 pc to ~4 pc from the central black hole. on the other hand, if the gamma-ray flare isgenerated instead at sub-pc distance from the central black hole, thefar-infrared break can be explained by synchrotron self-absorption. we alsomodel the low spectral state, dominated by the mm/sub-mm peaking synchrotroncomponent, and suggest that the corresponding inverse-compton componentexplains the steady x-ray emission.

1207.2932	multi-wavelength observations of blazar ao 0235+164 in the 2008-2009  flaring state	the blazar ao 0235+164 (z = 0.94) has been one of the most active objectsobserved by fermi large area telescope (lat) since its launch in summer 2008.in addition to the continuous coverage by fermi, contemporaneous observationswere carried out from the radio to {\gamma} -ray bands between 2008 septemberand 2009 february. in this paper, we summarize the rich multi-wavelength datacollected during the campaign (including f-gamma, gasp- webt, kanata, ovro,rxte, smarts, swift, and other instruments), examine the cross-correlationbetween the light curves measured in the different energy bands, and interpretthe resulting spectral energy distributions in the context of well-known blazaremission models. we find that the {\gamma} -ray activity is well correlatedwith a series of near-ir/optical flares, accompanied by an increase in theoptical polarization degree. on the other hand, the x-ray light curve shows adistinct 20 day high state of unusually soft spectrum, which does not match theextrapolation of the optical/uv synchrotron spectrum. we tentatively interpretthis feature as the bulk compton emission by cold electrons contained in thejet, which requires an accretion disk corona with an effective covering factorof 19% at a distance of 100 rg . we model the broadband spectra with a leptonicmodel with external radiation dominated by the infrared emission from the dustytorus.

1207.3979	variability of the blazar 4c 38.41 (b3 1633+382) from ghz frequencies to  gev energies	the quasar-type blazar 4c 38.41 (b3 1633+382) experienced a large outburst in2011, which was detected throughout the entire electromagnetic spectrum. wepresent the results of low-energy multifrequency monitoring by the gasp projectof the webt consortium and collaborators, as well as those ofspectropolarimetric/spectrophotometric monitoring at the steward observatory.we also analyse high-energy observations of the swift and fermi satellites. inthe optical-uv band, several results indicate that there is a contribution froma qso-like emission component, in addition to both variable and polarised jetemission. the unpolarised emission component is likely thermal radiation fromthe accretion disc that dilutes the jet polarisation. we estimate itsbrightness to be r(qso) ~ 17.85 - 18 and derive the intrinsic jet polarisationdegree. we find no clear correlation between the optical and radio lightcurves, while the correlation between the optical and \gamma-ray fluxapparently fades in time, likely because of an increasing optical to \gamma-rayflux ratio. as suggested for other blazars, the long-term variability of 4c38.41 can be interpreted in terms of an inhomogeneous bent jet, where differentemitting regions can change their alignment with respect to the line of sight,leading to variations in the doppler factor \delta. under the hypothesis thatin the period 2008-2011 all the \gamma-ray and optical variability on aone-week timescale were due to changes in \delta, this would range between ~ 7and ~ 21. if the variability were caused by changes in the viewing angle\theta\ only, then \theta\ would go from ~ 2.6 degr to ~ 5 degr. variations inthe viewing angle would also account for the dependence of the polarisationdegree on the source brightness in the framework of a shock-in-jet model.

1209.5867	radio-to-gamma-ray monitoring of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy pmn  j0948+0022 from 2008 to 2011	we present more than three years of observations at different frequencies,from radio to high-energy gamma-rays, of the narrow-line seyfert 1 (nls1)galaxy pmn j0948+0022 (z=0.585). this source is the first nls1 detected atenergies above 100 mev and therefore can be considered the prototype of thisemerging new class of gamma-ray emitting active galactic nuclei (agn). theobservations performed from 2008 august 1 to 2011 december 31 confirmed thatpmn j0948+0022 generates a powerful relativistic jet, able to develop anisotropic luminosity at gamma-rays of the order of 10^48 erg s^-1, at the levelof powerful quasars. the evolution of the radiation emission of this source in2009 and 2010 followed the canonical expectations of relativistic jets, withcorrelated multiwavelength variability (gamma-rays followed by radio emissionafter a few months), but it was difficult to retrieve a similar pattern in thelight curves of 2011. the comparison of gamma-ray spectra before and including2011 data suggested that there was a softening of the high-energy spectralslope. we selected five specific epochs to be studied by modelling thebroad-band spectrum, characterised by an outburst at gamma-rays or verylow/high flux at other wavelengths. the observed variability can largely beexplained either by changes in the injected power, the bulk lorentz factor ofthe jet or the electron spectrum. the characteristic time scale ofdoubling/halving flux ranges from a few days to a few months, depending on thefrequency and the sampling rate. the shortest doubling time scale at gamma-raysis 2.3+-0.5 days. these small values underline the need of highly-sampledmultiwavelength campaigns to better understand the physics of these sources.

1211.3073	rapid tev gamma-ray flaring of bl lacertae	we report on the detection of a very rapid tev gamma-ray flare from bllacertae on 2011 june 28 with the very energetic radiation imaging telescopearray system (veritas). the flaring activity was observed during a 34.6-minuteexposure, when the integral flux above 200 gev reached $(3.4\pm0.6) \times10^{-6} \;\text{photons}\;\text{m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}$, roughly 125% of the crabnebula flux measured by veritas. the light curve indicates that theobservations missed the rising phase of the flare but covered a significantportion of the decaying phase. the exponential decay time was determined to be$13\pm4$ minutes, making it one of the most rapid gamma-ray flares seen from atev blazar. the gamma-ray spectrum of bl lacertae during the flare was soft,with a photon index of $3.6\pm 0.4$, which is in agreement with the measurementmade previously by magic in a lower flaring state. contemporaneous radioobservations of the source with the very long baseline array (vlba) revealedthe emergence of a new, superluminal component from the core around the time ofthe tev gamma-ray flare, accompanied by changes in the optical polarizationangle. changes in flux also appear to have occurred at optical, uv, and gevgamma-ray wavelengths at the time of the flare, although they are difficult toquantify precisely due to sparse coverage. a strong flare was seen at radiowavelengths roughly four months later, which might be related to the gamma-rayflaring activities. we discuss the implications of these multiwavelengthresults.

1307.4100	the core shift effect in the blazar 3c 454.3	opacity-driven shifts of the apparent vlbi core position with frequency (the"core shift" effect) probe physical conditions in the innermost parts of jetsin active galactic nuclei. we present the first detailed investigation of thiseffect in the brightest gamma-ray blazar 3c454.3 using direct measurements fromsimultaneous 4.6-43 ghz vlba observations, and a time lag analysis of 4.8-37ghz lightcurves from the umrao, crao, and metsahovi observations in 2007-2009.the results support the standard konigl model of jet physics in the vlbi coreregion. the distance of the core from the jet origin r_c(nu), the core sizew(nu), and the lightcurve time lag dt(nu) all depend on the observing frequencynu as r_c(nu)~w(nu)~ dt(nu)~nu^-1/k. the obtained range of k=0.6-0.8 isconsistent with the synchrotron self-absorption being the dominating opacitymechanism in the jet. the similar frequency dependence of r_c(nu) and w(nu)suggests that the external pressure gradient does not dictate the jet geometryin the cm-band core region. assuming equipartition, the magnetic field strengthscales with distance r as b = 0.4(r/1pc)^-0.8 g. the total kinetic power ofelectron/positron jet is about 10^44 ergs/s.

1311.2833	magic observations and multifrequency properties of the flat spectrum  radio quasar 3c 279 in 2011	we study the multifrequency emission and spectral properties of the quasar 3c279. we observed 3c 279 in very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev) gamma rays, withthe magic telescopes during 2011, for the first time in stereoscopic mode. wecombine these measurements with observations at other energy bands: in highenergy (he, e&gt;100mev) gamma rays from fermi-lat, in x-rays from rxte, in theoptical from the kva telescope and in the radio at 43ghz, 37ghz and 15ghz fromthe vlba, mets\"ahovi and ovro radio telescopes and optical polarisationmeasurements from the kva and liverpool telescopes. during the magicobservations (february to april 2011) 3c 279 was in a low state in optical,x-ray and gamma rays. the magic observations did not yield a significantdetection. these upper limits are in agreement with the extrapolation of the hegamma-ray spectrum, corrected for extragalactic background light absorption,from fermi-lat. the second part of the magic observations in 2011 was triggeredby a high activity state in the optical and gamma-ray bands. during the opticaloutburst the optical electric vector position angle rotatated of about 180degrees. there was no simultaneous rotation of the 43ghz radio polarisationangle. no vhe gamma rays were detected by magic, and the derived upper limitssuggest the presence of a spectral break or curvature between the fermi-lat andmagic bands. the combined upper limits are the strongest derived to date forthe source at vhe and below the level of the previously detected flux by afactor 2. radiation models that include synchrotron and inverse comptonemissions match the optical to gamma-ray data, assuming an emission componentinside the broad line region (blr) responsible for the high-energy emission andone outside the blr and the infrared torus causing optical and low-energyemission. we interpreted the optical polarisation with a bent trajectory model.

1401.5646	magic gamma-ray and multifrequency observations of flat spectrum radio  quasar pks 1510-089 in early 2012	among more than fifty blazars detected in very high energy (vhe, e&gt;100gev)gamma-rays, only three belong to the subclass of flat spectrum radio quasars(fsrqs). magic observed fsrq pks 1510-089 in february-april 2012 during a highactivity state in the high energy (he, e&gt;100 mev) gamma-ray band observed byagile and fermi. magic observations result in the detection of a source withsignificance of 6.0 sigma. in agreement with the previous vhe observations ofthe source, we find no statistically significant variability during the magicobservations in daily, weekly or monthly time scales. the other two known vhefsrqs have shown daily scale to sub-hour variability.  we study the multifrequency behaviour of the source at the epoch of magicobservation, collecting quasi-simultaneous data at radio and optical (gasp-webtand f-gamma collaborations, rem, steward, perkins, liverpool, ovro and vlbatelescopes), x-ray (swift satellite) and he gamma-ray frequencies. thegamma-ray sed combining agile, fermi and magic data joins smoothly and shows nohint of a break. the multifrequency light curves suggest a common origin forthe millimeter radio and he gamma-ray emission and the he gamma-ray flaringstarts when the new component is ejected from the 43ghz vlba core. thequasi-simultaneous multifrequency sed is modelled with a one-zone inversecompton model. we study two different origins of the seed photons for theinverse compton scattering, namely the infra-red torus and a slow sheathsurrounding the jet around the vlba core. both models fit the data well.however, the fast he gamma-ray variability requires that within the modelledlarge emitting region, there must exist more compact regions. we suggest thatthese observed signatures would be most naturally explained by a turbulentplasma flowing at a relativistic speed down the jet and crossing a standingconical shock.

0802.3012	multifrequency monitoring of the blazar 0716+714 during the  gasp-webt-agile campaign of 2007	since the cgro operation in 1991-2000, one of the primary unresolvedquestions about the blazar gamma-ray emission has been its possible correlationwith the low-energy (in particular optical) emission. to help answer thisproblem, the whole earth blazar telescope (webt) consortium has organized theglast-agile support program (gasp) to provide the optical-to-radio monitoringdata to be compared with the gamma-ray detections by the agile and glastsatellites. this new webt project started in early september 2007, just beforea strong gamma-ray detection of 0716+714 by agile. we present the gasp-webtoptical and radio light curves of this blazar obtained in july-november 2007,about various agile pointings at the source. we construct nir-to-uv spectralenergy distributions (seds), by assembling gasp-webt data together with uv datafrom the swift too observations of late october. we observe a contemporaneousoptical-radio outburst, which is a rare and interesting phenomenon in blazars.the shape of the seds during the outburst appears peculiarly wavy because of anoptical excess and a uv drop-and-rise. the optical light curve is well sampledduring the agile pointings, showing prominent and sharp flares. a futurecross-correlation analysis of the optical and agile data will shed light on theexpected relationship between these flares and the gamma-ray events.

0803.0654	blazar sequence - an artefact of doppler boosting	the blazar sequence is a scenario in which the bolometric luminosity of theblazar governs the appearance of its spectral energy distribution. the mostprominent result is the significant negative correlation between thesynchrotron peak frequencies and the synchrotron peak luminosities of theblazar population. observational studies of the blazar sequence have, ingeneral, neglected the effect of doppler boosting. we study the dependence ofboth the synchrotron peak frequency and luminosity with doppler-correctedquantities. we determine the spectral energy distributions of 135 radio-brightagn and find the best-fit parabolic function for the distribution to quantifytheir synchrotron emission. the corresponding measurements of synchrotron peakluminosities and frequencies are doppler-corrected with a new set of dopplerfactors calculated from variability data. the relevant correlations for theblazar sequence are determined for these intrinsic quantities. the dopplerfactor depends strongly on the synchrotron peak frequency, the lower energysources being more boosted. applying the doppler correction to the peakfrequencies and luminosities annuls the negative correlation between the twoquantities, which becomes positive. for bl lacertae objects, the positivecorrelation is particularly strong. the blazar sequence, when defined as theanticorrelation between the peak frequency and luminosity of the synchrotroncomponent of the spectral energy distribution, disappears when the intrinsic,doppler-corrected values are used. it is an observational phenomenon created byvariable doppler boosting across the synchrotron peak frequency range.

1408.1975	probing the very-high-energy gamma-ray spectral curvature in the blazar  pg 1553+113 with the magic telescopes	pg 1553+113 is a very-high-energy (vhe, $e&gt;100\,\mathrm{gev}$) $\gamma$-rayemitter classified as a bl lac object. its redshift is constrained byintergalactic absorption lines in the range $0.4&lt;z&lt;0.58$. the magic telescopeshave monitored the source's activity since 2005. in early 2012, pg 1553+113 wasfound in a high-state, and later, in april of the same year, the source reachedits highest vhe flux state detected so far. simultaneous observations carriedout in x-rays during 2012 april show similar flaring behaviour. in contrast,the $\gamma$-ray flux at $e&lt;100\,\mathrm{gev}$ observed by fermi-lat iscompatible with steady emission. in this paper, a detailed study of the flaringstate is presented. the vhe spectrum shows clear curvature, being well fittedeither by a power law with an exponential cut-off or by a log-parabola. asimple power-law fit hypothesis for the observed shape of the pg 1553+113 vhe$\gamma$-ray spectrum is rejected with a high significance (fit probabilityp=2.6 $\times 10^{-6}$). the observed curvature is compatible with theextragalactic background light (ebl) imprint predicted by current generationebl models assuming a redshift $z\sim0.4$. new constraints on the redshift arederived from the vhe spectrum. these constraints are compatible with previouslimits and suggest that the source is most likely located around the opticallower limit, $z=0.4$, based on the detection of ly$\alpha$ absorption. finally,we find that the synchrotron self-compton (ssc) model gives a satisfactorydescription of the observed multi-wavelength spectral energy distributionduring the flare.

1409.3716	properties of flat-spectrum radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies	we have conducted a multiwavelength survey of 42 radio loud narrow-1ineseyfert 1 galaxies (rlnls1s), selected by searching among all the known sourcesof this type and omitting those with steep radio spectra. we analyse data fromradio frequencies to x-rays, and supplement these with information availablefrom online catalogs and the literature in order to cover the fullelectromagnetic spectrum. this is the largest known multiwavelength survey forthis type of source. we detected 90% of the sources in x-rays and found 17% atgamma rays. extreme variability at high energies was also found, down totimescales as short as hours. in some sources, dramatic spectral and fluxchanges suggest interplay between a relativistic jet and the accretion disk.the estimated masses of the central black holes are in the range $\sim10^{6-8}m_{\odot}$, smaller than those of blazars, while the accretionluminosities span a range from $\sim 0.01$ to $\sim 0.49$ times the eddingtonlimit, with an outlier at $0.003$. the distribution of the calculated jet powerspans a range from $\sim 10^{42.6}$ to $\sim 10^{45.6}$ erg s$^{-1}$, generallylower than quasars and bl lac objects, but partially overlapping with thelatter. once normalised by the mass of the central black holes, the jet powerof the three types of active galactic nuclei are consistent with each other,indicating the scalability of the jet. despite the observational differences,the central engine of rlnls1s is apparently quite similar to that of blazars.the historical difficulties in finding radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1galaxies might be due to their low power and to intermittent jet activity.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1412.3576	unprecedented study of the broadband emission of mrk 421 during flaring  activity in march 2010	a flare from the tev blazar mrk 421, occurring in march 2010, was observedfor 13 consecutive days from radio to very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev)gamma-rays with magic, veritas, whipple, fermilat, maxi, rxte, swift,gasp-webt, and several optical and radio telescopes. we model the day-scaleseds with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-compton (ssc) models,investigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observedbroadband sed variability can be associated to variations in the relativisticparticle population.  flux variability was remarkable in the x-ray and vhe bands while it was minoror not significant in the other bands. the one-zone ssc model can describereasonably well the sed of each day for the 13 consecutive days. this flaringactivity is also very well described by a two-zone ssc model, where one zone isresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which isspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variableemission occurring in x-rays and vhe gamma-rays.  both the one-zone ssc and the two-zone ssc models can describe the daily sedsvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesisthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particlepopulation. this shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanismproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for thebroadband sed variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. the two-zonessc model provides a better agreement to the observed sed at the narrow peaksof the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although thereported one-zone ssc model could be further improved by the variation of theparameters related to the emitting region itself ($\delta$, $b$ and $r$), inaddition to the parameters related to the particle population.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

1506.07137	frequency dependent core shifts and parameter estimation for the blazar  3c 454.3	we study the core shift effect in the parsec scale jet of the blazar 3c 454.3using the 4.8 ghz - 36.8 ghz radio light curves obtained from three decades ofcontinuous monitoring. from a piecewise gaussian fit to each flare, time lags$\delta t$ between the observation frequencies $\nu$ and spectral indices$\alpha$ based on peak amplitudes $a$ are determined. from the fit $\delta t\propto \nu^{1/k_r}$, $k_r = 1.10 \pm 0.18$ indicating equipartition betweenthe magnetic field energy density and the particle energy density. from the fit$a \propto \nu^\alpha$, $\alpha$ is in the range $-0.24$ to $1.52$. a meanmagnetic field strength at 1 pc, $b_1 = 0.5 \pm 0.2$ g, and at the core,$b_{\rm core} = 46 \pm 16$ mg, are inferred, consistent with previousestimates. the measure of core position offset is $\omega_{r\nu} = 6.4 \pm 2.8$pc ghz$^{1/k_r}$ when averaged over all frequency pairs. based on thestatistical trend shown by the measured core radius $r_{\rm core}$ as afunction of $\nu$, we infer that the synchrotron opacity model may not be validfor all cases. a fourier periodogram analysis yields power law slopes in therange $-1.6$ to $-3.5$ describing the power spectral density shape and givesbend timescales in the range $0.52 - 0.66~$yr. this result, and both positiveand negative $\alpha$, indicate that the flares originate from multiple shocksin a small region. important objectives met in our study include: thedemonstration of the computational efficiency and statistical basis of thepiecewise gaussian fit; consistency with previously reported results; evidencefor the core shift dependence on observation frequency and its utility in jetdiagnostics in the region close to the resolving limit of very long baselineinterferometry observations.

1507.04287	locating the gamma-ray emission site in fermi/lat blazars from  correlation analysis between 37 ghz radio and gamma-ray light curves	we address the highly debated issue of constraining the gamma-ray emissionregion in blazars from cross-correlation analysis using discrete correlationfunction between radio and gamma-ray light curves. the significance of thecorrelations is evaluated using two different approaches: simulating lightcurves and mixed source correlations. the cross-correlation analysis yielded 26sources with significant correlations. in most of the sources, the gamma-raypeaks lead the radio with time lags in the range +20 and +690 days, whereas insources 1633+382 and 3c 345 we find the radio emission to lead the gamma raysby -15 and -40 days, respectively. apart from the individual source study, westacked the correlations of all sources and also those based on sub-samples.the time lag from the stacked correlation is +80 days for the whole sample andthe distance travelled by the emission region corresponds to 7 pc. we alsocompared the start times of activity in radio and gamma rays of the correlatedflares using bayesian block representation. this shows that most of the flaresat both wavebands start at almost the same time, implying a co-spatial originof the activity. the correlated sources show more flares and are brighter inboth bands than the uncorrelated ones.

0805.3411	the multiwavelength variability of 3c 273	we present an update of 3c 273's database hosted by the isdc, completed withdata from radio to gamma-ray observations over the last 10 years. we use thislarge data set to study the multiwavelength properties of thisquasar,especially focussing on its variability behaviour. we study theamplitude of the variations and the maximum variability time scales across thebroad-band spectrum and correlate the light curves in different bands,specifically with the x-rays, to search for possible connections between theemission at different energies. 3c 273 shows variability at all frequencies,with amplitudes and time scales strongly depending on the energy and being thesignatures of the different emission mechanisms. the variability properties ofthe x-ray band imply the presence of either two separate components (possibly aseyfert-like and a blazar-like) or at least two parameters with distinct timingproperties to account for the x-ray emission below and above ~20 kev. thedominant hard x-ray emission is most probably not due to electrons acceleratedby the shock waves in the jet as their variability does not correlate with theflaring millimeter emission, but seems to be associated to long-timescalevariations in the optical. this optical component is consistent with beingoptically thin synchrotron radiation from the base of the jet and the hardx-rays would be produced through inverse compton processes (ssc and/or ec) bythe same electron population. we show evidence that this synchrotron componentextends from the optical to the near-infrared domain, where it is blended byemission of heated dust that we find to be located within about 1 light-yearfrom the ultraviolet source.

1511.02654	locating the gamma-ray emission site in fermi/lat blazars. ii  multifrequency correlations	in an attempt to constrain and understand the emission mechanism of gammarays, we perform a cross-correlation analysis of 15 blazars using light curvesin millimetre, optical and gamma rays. we use discrete correlation function andconsider only correlations significant at 99 per cent level. a strongcorrelation was found between 37 and 95 ghz with a near-zero time delay in mostof the sources, and ~1 month or longer in the rest. a similar result wasobtained between the optical and gamma-ray bands. of the 15 sources, less than50 per cent showed a strong correlation between the millimetre and gamma-ray ormillimetre and optical bands. the primary reason for the lack of statisticallysignificant correlation is the absence of a major outburst in the millimetrebands of most of the sources during the 2.5 yr time period investigated in ourstudy. this may indicate that only the long-term variations or large flares arecorrelated between these bands. the variability of the sources at everywaveband was also inspected using fractional rms variability. the fractionalrms variability displays an increase with frequency reaching its maximum in thegamma rays.

1512.00192	multiwavelength survey of a sample of flat-spectrum radio-loud  narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies	we report on a multiwavelength survey of a sample of 42 flat-spectrumradio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies (rlnls1s). this is the largest knownsample of this type of active galactic nucleus (agn) to date. we found that 17%of sources were detected at high-energy gamma rays (e&gt;100 mev), and 90% atx-rays (0.3-10 kev). the masses of the central black holes are in the range$\sim 10^{6-8}m_{\odot}$, smaller than the values of blazars. the diskluminosities are about 1-49% of the eddington value, with one outlier at 0.3%,comparable with the luminosities observed in flat-spectrum radio quasars(fsrqs). the jet powers are $\sim 10^{42-46}$ erg s$^{-1}$, comparable with bllac objects, yet relatively smaller than fsrqs. however, once renormalized bythe mass of the central black hole, the jet powers of rlnls1s, bl lacs, andfsrqs are consistent each other, indicating the scalability of the jets. wefound episodes of extreme variability at high energies on time scales of hours.in some cases, dramatic spectral and flux changes are interpreted as theinterplay between the relativistic jet and the accretion disk. we concludethat, despite the distinct observational properties, the central engines ofrlnls1s are similar to those of blazars.

1512.02235	multiwavelength study of quiescent states of mrk 421 with unprecedented  hard x-ray coverage provided by nustar in 2013	we present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the bright, nearby bllac object mrk 421 taken in 2013 january-march, involving gasp-webt, swift,nustar, fermi-lat, magic, veritas, and other collaborations and instruments,providing data from radio to very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray bands. nustaryielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 3-79 kev range, revealingthat the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the x-ray spectralshape saturates into a steep power law with a photon index of approximately 3,with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up toabout 80 kev. for the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and theinverse-compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (sed) simultaneouslyshifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order ofmagnitude. the fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows adouble-bump structure which relates to the two bumps of the broadband sed. ineach bump, the variability increases with energy which, in the framework of thesynchrotron self-compton model, implies that the electrons with higher energiesare more variable. the measured multi-band variability, the significantx-ray-to-vhe correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed inboth bands, the lack of correlation between optical/uv and x-ray flux, the lowdegree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the shortestimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer variabilitytimescale observed in the nustar light curves point toward in-situ electronacceleration, and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributingto the broadband emission of mrk 421 during low-activity states.

0705.3293	statistical analyses of long-term variability of agn at high radio  frequencies	we present a study of variability time scales in a large sample of activegalactic nuclei at several frequencies between 4.8 and 230 ghz. we investigatethe differences of various agn types and frequencies and correlate the measuredtime scales with physical parameters such as the luminosity and the lorentzfactor. our sample consists of both high and low polarization quasars, bllacertae objects and radio galaxies. the basis of this work is the 22 ghz, 37ghz and 87 ghz monitoring data from the metsahovi radio observatory spanningover 25 years. in addition,we used higher 90 ghz and 230 ghz frequency dataobtained with the sest-telescope between 1987 and 2003. further lower frequencydata at 4.8 ghz, 8 ghz and 14.5 ghz from the university of michigan monitoringprogramme have been used. we have applied three different statistical methodsto study the time scales: the structure function, the discrete correlationfunction and the lomb-scargle periodogram. we discuss also the differences andrelative merits of these three methods. our study reveals that smaller fluxdensity variations occur in these sources on short time scales of 1-2 years,but larger outbursts happen quite rarely, on the average only once in every 6years. we do not find any significant differences in the time scales betweenthe source classes. the time scales are also only weakly related to theluminosity suggesting that the shock formation is caused by jet instabilitiesrather than the central black hole.

astro-ph;0207355	broad-band continuum and line emission of the gamma-ray blazar pks  0537-441	pks 0537-441, a bright gamma-ray emitting blazar, was observed at radio,optical, uv and x-ray frequencies during various egret pointings, oftenquasi-simultaneously. in 1995 the object was found in an intense emission stateat all wavelengths. bepposax observations made in 1998, non-simultaneously withexposures at other frequencies, allow us to characterize precisely the spectralshape of the high energy blazar component, which we attribute to inversecompton scattering. the optical-to-gamma-ray spectral energy distributions atthe different epochs show that the gamma-ray luminosity dominates thebolometric output. this, together with the presence of optical and uv lineemission, suggests that, besides the synchrotron self-compton mechanism, thecompton upscattering of photons external to the jet (e.g., in the broad lineregion) may have a significant role for high energy radiation. themultiwavelength variability can be reproduced by changes of the plasma bulklorentz factor. the spectrum secured by iue in 1995 appears to be partiallyabsorbed shortward of ~1700 a. however, this signature is not detected in thehst spectrum taken during a lower state of the source. the presence ofintervening absorbers is not supported by optical imaging and spectroscopy ofthe field.

astro-ph;0401501	a multifrequency analysis of radio variability of blazars	we have carried out a multifrequency analysis of the radio variability ofblazars, exploiting the data obtained during the extensive monitoring programscarried out at the university of michigan radio astronomy observatory (umrao,at 4.8, 8, and 14.5 ghz) and at the metsahovi radio observatory (22 and 37ghz). two different techniques detect, in the metsahovi light curves, evidencesof periodicity at both frequencies for 5 sources (0224+671, 0945+408, 1226+023,2200+420, and 2251+158). for the last three sources consistent periods arefound also at the three umrao frequencies and the scargle (1982) method yieldsan extremely low false-alarm probability. on the other hand, the 22 and 37 ghzperiodicities of 0224+671 and 0945+408 (which were less extensively monitoredat metsahovi and for which we get a significant false-alarm probability) arenot confirmed by the umrao database, where some indications of ill-definedperiods about a factor of two longer are retrieved. we have also investigatedthe variability index, the structure function, and the distribution ofintensity variations of the most extensively monitored sources. we find astatistically significant difference in the distribution of the variabilityindex for bl lac objects compared to flat-spectrum radio quasars (fsrqs), inthe sense that the former objects are more variable. for both populations thevariability index steadily increases with increasing frequency. thedistribution of intensity variations also broadens with increasing frequency,and approaches a log-normal shape at the highest frequencies. we find thatvariability enhances by 20-30% the high frequency counts of extragalacticradio-sources at bright flux densities, such as those of the wmap and plancksurveys.

astro-ph;0408007	mutiwavelength observations of radio galaxy 3c 120 with xmm-newton	we present xmm-newton observations of the radio galaxy 3c 120. the hard x-rayspectrum contains a marginally resolved fe i k-alpha emission line withfwhm=9,000 km/s and an equivalent width of 57 ev. the line arises viafluorescence in a broad-line region with covering fraction of 0.4. there is noevidence of relativistically broad fe k-alpha, contrary to some previousreports. the normal equivalent widths of the x-ray and optical emission linesexclude a strongly beamed synchrotron component to the hard x-ray and opticalcontinua. there is an excess of 0.3-2 kev soft x-ray continuum over anextrapolation of the hard x-ray power-law, which may arise in a disk corona.analysis of an archival chandra image shows that extended emission from the jetand other sources contributes &lt;3% of the total x-ray flux. a break in the x-rayspectrum below 0.6 kev indicates an excess neutral hydrogen column density ofn_h=1.57 * 10^21 cm^{-2}. however, the neutral absorber must have an oxygenabundance of &lt;1/50 of the solar value to explain the absence of an intrinsic orintervening o i edge. there is no ionized absorption in the soft x-rayspectrum, but there is a weak, narrow o viii ly-alpha emission line. we do notdetect previously claimed o viii absorption from the intervening intergalacticmedium. radio observations at 37 ghz show a fast, high frequency flare starting8 days after the xmm-newton observation. however, this has no obvious effect onthe x-ray spectrum. the x-ray spectrum, including the soft excess, becameharder as the x-ray flux decreased, with an estimated pivot energy of 40 kev.the uv and soft x-ray fluxes are strongly correlated over the 120 ks durationof the xmm-newton observation. this is qualitatively consistent withcomptonization of uv photons by a hot corona.

astro-ph;0509045	spectral energy distributions of a large sample of bl lacertae objects	we have collected a large amount of multifrequency data for the objects inthe metsahovi radio observatory bl lacertae sample and computed their spectralenergy distributions (sed). this is the first time the seds of bl lacs havebeen studied with a sample of over 300 objects. the synchrotron components ofthe seds were fitted with a parabolic function to determine the synchrotronpeak frequency. we checked the dependence between luminosities at severalfrequency bands and synchrotron peak frequency to test the blazar sequencescenario, which states that the source luminosity depends on the location ofthe synchrotron peak. we also calculated broad band spectral indices andplotted them against each other and the peak frequency. the range of peakfrequencies in our study was considerably extended compared to previousstudies. there were 22 objects for which log\nu_{peak}&gt;19. the data shows thatat 5 ghz, 37 ghz and 5500 a there is negative correlation between luminosityand nu_{peak}. there is no significant correlation between source luminosity atsynchrotron peak and peak frequency. several low radio luminosity-low energypeaked bl lacs were found. the negative correlation between broad band spectralindices and nu_{peak} is also significant, although there is substantialscatter. therefore we find that neither alpha_{rx} nor alpha_{ro} can be usedto determine the synchrotron peak of bl lacs. on the grounds of our results weconclude that the blazar sequence scenario is not valid. in all our results thebl lac population is continuous with no hint of the bimodality of the first bllac samples.

astro-ph;0606646	synchrotron flaring in the jet of 3c 279	we study the synchrotron flaring behaviour of the blazar 3c279 based on anextensive dataset covering 10 years of monitoring at 19 different frequenciesin the radio-to-optical range. the properties of a typical outburst are derivedfrom the observations by decomposing the 19 lightcurves into a series ofself-similar events. this analysis is achieved by fitting all datasimultaneously to a succession of outbursts defined according to theshock-in-jet model of marscher &amp; gear (1985). we compare the derived propertiesof the synchrotron outbursts in 3c279 to those obtained with a similar methodfor the quasar 3c273. it is argued that differences in the flaring behaviour ofthese two sources are intrinsic to the sources themselves rather than being dueto orientation effects. we also compare the start times and flux densities ofour modelled outbursts with those measured from radio components identified invery long baseline interferometry (vlbi) images. we find vlbi counterparts formost of our model outbursts, although some high-frequency peaking events arenot seen in the radio maps. finally, we study the link between the appearanceof a new synchrotron component and the egret gamma-ray state of the source at10 different epochs. we find that an early-stage shock component is alwayspresent during high gamma-ray states, while in low gamma-ray states the timesince the onset of the last synchrotron outburst is significantly longer. thisstatistically significant correlation supports the idea that gamma-ray flaresare associated with the early stages of shock components propagating in thejet. we note, however, that the shock wave is already beyond the broad lineregion during the gamma-ray flaring.

0809.2227	testing the inverse-compton catastrophe scenario in the intra-day  variable blazar s5 0716+71, iii. rapid and correlated flux density  variability from radio to sub-mm bands	the bl lac object s5 0716+71 was observed in a global multi-frequencycampaign to search for rapid and correlated flux density variability andsignatures of an inverse-compton (ic) catastrophe during the states of extremeapparent brightness temperatures. the observing campaign involved simultaneousmonitoring at radio to ir/optical wavelengths centered around a 500-ks integralpointing (november 10-17, 2003). we present the combined analysis and resultsof the cm- to sub-mm observations including a detailed study of the inter- tointra-day variability and spectral characteristics of 0716+714. we furtherconstrain the variability brightness temperatures (t_b) and doppler factors(delta) comparing the radio-bands with the hard x-ray emission (3-200 kev).0716+714 was in an exceptionally high state (outburst) and different (slower)phase of short-term variability. the flux density variability in the cm- tomm-bands is dominated by a correlated, ~4 day time scale amplitude increase ofup to ~35% systematically more pronounced towards shorter wavelengths. thiscontradicts expectations from standard interstellar scintillation (iss) andsuggests a source-intrinsic origin of the variability. the derived lower limitsto t_b exceed the 10^12 k ic-limit by up to 3-4 orders of magnitude. assumingrelativistic boosting, we obtain robust and self-consistent lower limits ofdelta &gt;= 5-33, in good agreement with delta_vlbi obtained from vlbi studies andthe ic-doppler factors delta_ic &gt; 14-16 obtained from the integral data. sincea strong contribution from iss can be excluded and a simultaneous iccatastrophe was not observed, we conclude that relativistic doppler boostingnaturally explains the apparent violation of the theoretical limits withinstandard synchrotron-self-compton (ssc) jet models of agn.

0812.1486	studying the continuum spectrum of the parsec scale jets by  multi-frequency vlbi measurements	multi-frequency vlbi observations allow studies of the continuum spectrum inthe different parts of the parsec scale jets of agn, providing information onthe physical properties of the plasma and magnetic fields in them. since vlbinetworks cannot be scaled, the range of spatial frequencies observed differssignificantly between the different observing frequencies, which makes itdifficult to obtain a broadband spectrum of the individual emission features inthe jet. in this paper we discuss a model-fitting based spectral extractionmethod, which can significantly relieve this problem. the method uses a prioriknowledge of the source structure, measured at high frequencies, to allow atlower frequencies the derivation of the sizes and flux densities of even thoseemission features that have mutual separations significantly less than therayleigh limit at the given frequency. we have successfully used this method inthe analysis of 5-86 ghz vlba data of 3c273. the spectra and sizes of severalindividual jet features were measured, thus allowing derivation of the magneticflux density and the energy density of the relativistic electrons in thedifferent parts of the jet. we discuss the results, which include e.g. adetection of a strong gradient in the magnetic field across the jet of 3c273.
