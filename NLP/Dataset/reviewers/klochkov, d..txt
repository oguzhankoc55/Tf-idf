0904.2307	updating the orbital ephemeris of her x-1; rate of decay and  eccentricity of the orbit	we present an update of the orbital ephemeris of the binary x-ray pulsar herx-1 and determine an improved value for the rate of orbital decay. in addition,we report the first measurement of the orbital eccentricity. we have analyzedpulse timing data of her x-1 from x-ray observations by rxte (rossi x-raytiming explorer) and integral over the period 1996-2007. accurate pulse arrivaltimes were determined from solar system bary-centered photon arrival times bygenerating pulse profiles averaged over appropriately short integration times.applying pulse phase connection techniques, it was possible to determinesufficiently accurate local ephemeris data for seven observation periodsdistributed over 12 years. combining the new local t90 values with historicalvalues from the literature we update the orbital ephemeris of her x-1 to t90 =mjd 46359.871940(6) and porb = 1.700167590(2) d and measure a continuous changeof the orbital period of dporb/dt = -(4.85 +/- 0.13) x 10-11 s/s. for the firsttime, a value for the eccentricity of the orbit of her x-1 is measured to be e= (4.2 +/- 0.8) x 10-4.

0907.3844	is there a highly magnetized neutron star in gx 301-2?	we present the results of an in-depth study of the long-period x-ray pulsargx 301-2. using archival data of integral, rxte asm, and cgro batse, we studythe spectral and timing properties of the source. comparison of our timingresults with previously published work reveals a secular decay of the orbitalperiod at a rate of \simeq -3.25 \times 10^{-5} d yr^{-1}, which is an order ofmagnitude faster than for other known systems. we argue that this is probablyresult either of the apsidal motion or of gravitational coupling of the matterlost by the optical companion with the neutron star, although currentobservations do not allow us to distinguish between those possibilities. wealso propose a model to explain the observed long pulse period. we find that avery strong magnetic field b \sim 10^{14} g can explain the observed pulseperiod in the framework of existing models for torques affecting the neutronstar. we show that the apparent contradiction with the magnetic field strengthb_{crsf} \sim 4 \times 10^{12} g derived from the observed cyclotron lineposition may be resolved if the line formation region resides in a tallaccretion column of height \sim 2.5 - 3 r_{ns}. the color temperature measuredfrom the spectrum suggests that such a column may indeed be present, and ourestimates show that its height is sufficient to explain the observed cyclotronline position.

0908.0053	continuous monitoring of pulse period variations in her x-1 using  swift/bat	context: monitoring of pulse period variations in accreting binary pulsars isan important tool to study the interaction between the magnetosphere of theneutron star and the accretion disk. while the x-ray flux of the brightestx-ray pulsars have been successfully monitored over many years (e.g. withrxte/asm, cgro/batse, swift/bat), the possibility to monitor their pulse timingproperties continuously has so far been very limited. aims: in our work we showthat the swift/bat observations can be used to monitor coherent pulsations ofbright x-ray sources and use the swift archival data to study one of the mostenigmatic x-ray pulsars, hercules x-1. a quasi-continuous monitoring of thepulse period and the pulse period derivative of an x-ray pulsar, here her x-1,is achieved over a long time (&lt;~ 4 yrs). we compare our observational resultswith predictions of accretion theory and use them to test different aspects ofthe physical model of the system. methods: in our analysis we use the dataaccumulated with swift/bat starting from the beginning of 2005 (shortly afterlaunch) until the present time. to search for pulsations and for theirsubsequent analysis we used the count rate measured by the bat detector in theentire field of view. results: the slope of the correlation between the locallydetermined spin-up rate and the x-ray luminosity is measured for her x-1 andfound to be in agreement with predictions of basic accretion torque theory. theobserved behaviour of the pulse period together with the previously measuredsecular decrease of the system's orbital period is discussed in the frame of amodel assuming ejection of matter close to the inner boundary of the accretiondisk.

0911.3566	variable precession of the neutron star in her x-1	we present evidence for an identical behavior of the precession of theaccretion disk and that of the neutron star (ns) in her x-1, based oninvestigating the well established 35 day modulation in her x-1 in twodifferent ways: 1) following the turn-ons, thought to be due to the precessionof the accretion disk, and 2) following the re-appearance of the shape of thepulse profiles, which we assume to be due to precession of the ns. the turn-onevolution and the evolution of the phase-zero values of the precessing ns (asdetermined from the pulse profiles) track each other very closely. since theturn-on evolution is strongly correlated with the pulse period evolution, thismeans that there is also a strong correlation between the spin and theprecession of the ns. there is a very strong physical coupling between the nsand the accretion disk, we suggest through physical feedback in the binarysystem. the apparent long-term stability of the 35 d clock may be due to theinterior of the ns, the coupling of which to the observable surface effects isof general importance for the physics of super-dense, highly magnetizedmaterial.

1001.5252	monitoring of pulse period in her x-1 with swift/bat: evidence of mass  ejection	monitoring of pulse period variations in accreting binary pulsars is animportant tool to study the interaction between the magnetosphere of theneutron star and the accretion disk. while the x-ray flux of the brightestx-ray pulsars have been successfully monitored over many years (e.g. withrxte/asm, cgro/batse, swift/bat), the possibility to monitor their pulse timingproperties continuously has so far been very limited. in our work we useswift/bat observations to study one of the most enigmatic x-ray pulsars,hercules x-1. for the first time, a quasi-continuous monitoring of the pulseperiod and the pulse period derivative of her x-1, is achieved over a long time(&gt; 4 yrs). we argue that together with the long-term decrease of the orbitalperiod in her x-1 the measured pulse period behaviour requires the presence ofmass ejection from the inner parts of the accretion disk along the openmagnetic field lines. the mass ejection episodes probably take place duringstrong spin-down episodes which are associated with the low x-ray luminosity.

1107.3417	the be/x-ray binary a0535+26 during its recent 2009/2010 outbursts	the be/x-ray binary a0535+26 showed a giant outburst in december 2009 thatreached ~5.14 crab in the 15-50 kev range. unfortunately, due to sunconstraints it could not be observed by most x-ray satellites. the outburst waspreceded by four weaker outbursts associated with the periastron passage of theneutron star. the fourth of them, in august 2009, presented a peculiardouble-peaked light curve, with a first peak lasting about 9 days that reacheda (15-50 kev) flux of 440 mcrab. the flux then decreased to less than 220mcrab, and increased again reaching 440 crab around the periastron. theoutburst was monitored with integral, rxte, and suzaku too observations. oneorbital period (~111 days) after the 2009 giant outburst, a new andunexpectedly bright outburst took place (~1.4crab in the 15-50 kev range). itwas monitored with too obs ervations with integral, rxte, suzaku, and swift.first results of the spectral and timing analysis of these observations arepresented, with a specific focus on the cyclotron lines present in the systemand its variation with the mass accretion rate.

1108.2855	discovery of the source hess j1356-645 associated with the young and  energetic psr j1357-6429	several newly discovered very-high-energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) gamma-raysources in the galaxy are thought to be associated with energetic pulsars.among them, middle-aged (&gt; 1e+4 yr) systems exhibit large centre-filled vhenebulae, offset from the pulsar position, which result from the complexrelationship between the pulsar wind and the surrounding medium, and reflectthe past evolution of the pulsar. imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes(iacts) have been successful in revealing extended emission from these sourcesin the vhe regime. together with radio and x-ray observations, thisobservational window allows one to probe the energetics and magnetic fieldinside these large-scale nebulae. h.e.s.s., with its large field of view,angular resolution of &lt; 0.1deg and unprecedented sensitivity, has been used todiscover a large population of such vhe sources. in this paper, the h.e.s.s.data from the continuation of the galactic plane survey (-80deg &lt; l &lt; 60deg,|b| &lt; 3deg), together with the existing multi-wavelength observations, areused. a new vhe gamma-ray source was discovered at r.a.

1110.6717	does the neutron star in her x-1 really show free precession?	the accreting x-ray pulsar her x-1 shows two types of long-term variations,both with a period of 35 days: 1) a modulation of the flux with a ten day longmain-on and a 5 d long short-on, separated by two off-states, and 2) asystematic variation of the shape of the 1.24 s pulse profile. while there isgeneral consensus that the flux modulation is due to variable shading of thex-ray emitting regions on the surface of the neutron star by the precessingaccretion disk, the physical reason for the variation of the pulse profiles hadremained controversial. following the suggestion by truemper et al. (1986) thatfree precession of the neutron star may be responsible for the variation of thepulse profiles, we had developed physical models of strong feedback interactionbetween the neutron star and the accretion disk in order to explain theseemingly identical values for the periods of the two types of variations. in adeep analysis of pulse profiles observed by several different satellites overthe last three decades we find now that the clock behind the pulse profilevariations shows exactly the same erratic behavior as the turn-on clock, evenon short time scales (100 d), suggesting that there may in fact be only one 35d clock in the system. if this is true, it presents a serious challenge for theidea of free precession of the neutron star and calls for alternative physicalmodels for the variation in pulse shape.

1111.1800	a suzaku view of cyclotron line sources and candidates	seventeen accreting neutron star pulsars, mostly high mass x-ray binarieswith half of them be-type transients, are known to exhibit cyclotron resonancescattering features (crsfs) in their x-ray spectra, with characteristic lineenergies from 10 to 60 kev. to date about two thirds of them, plus a fewsimilar systems without known crsfs, have been observed with suzaku. we presentan overview of results from these observations, including the discovery of acrsf in the transient 1a 1118-61 and pulse phase resolved spectroscopy of gx301-2. these observations allow for the determination of cyclotron lineparameters to an unprecedented degree of accuracy within a moderate amount ofobserving time. this is important since these parameters vary - e.g., withorbital phase, pulse phase, or luminosity - depending on the geometry of themagnetic field of the pulsar and the properties of the accretion column at themagnetic poles. we briefly introduce a spectral model for crsfs that iscurrently being developed and that for the first time is based on thesephysical properties. in addition to cyclotron line measurements, selectedhighlights from the suzaku analyses include dip and flare studies, e.g., of 4u1907+09 and vela x-1, which show clumpy wind effects (like partial absorptionand/or a decrease in the mass accretion rate supplied by the wind) and may alsodisplay magnetospheric gating effects.

1205.5316	spectral formation in accreting x-ray pulsars: bimodal variation of the  cyclotron energy with luminosity	accretion-powered x-ray pulsars exhibit significant variability of thecyclotron resonance scattering feature (crsf) centroid energy on pulse-to-pulsetimescales, and also on much longer timescales. two types of spectralvariability are observed. for sources in group 1, the crsf energy is negativelycorrelated with the variable source luminosity, and for sources in group 2, theopposite behavior is observed. the physical basis for this bimodal behavior iscurrently not understood. we explore the hypothesis that the accretion dynamicsin the group 1 sources is dominated by radiation pressure near the stellarsurface, and that coulomb interactions decelerate the gas to rest in the group2 sources. we derive a new expression for the critical luminosity such thatradiation pressure decelerates the matter to rest in the supercritical sources.the formula for the critical luminosity is evaluated for 5 sources, using themaximum value of the crsf centroid energy to estimate the surface magneticfield strength. the results confirm that the group 1 sources are supercriticaland the group 2 sources are subcritical, although the situation is less clearfor those highly variable sources that cross over the critical line. we alsoexplain the variation of the crsf energy with luminosity as a consequence ofthe variation of the characteristic emission height. the sign of the heightvariation is opposite in the supercritical and subcritical cases, hencecreating the observed bimodal behavior.

1210.1359	probing the extent of the non-thermal emission from the vela x region at  tev energies with h.e.s.s	vela x is a region of extended radio emission in the western part of the velaconstellation: one of the nearest pulsar wind nebulae (pwne), and associatedwith the energetic vela pulsar (psr b0833-45). extended very-high-energy (vhe)$\gamma$-ray emission (hess $\mathrm{j0835\mhyphen 455}$) was discovered usingthe h.e.s.s. experiment in 2004. the vhe $\gamma$-ray emission was found to becoincident with a region of x-ray emission discovered with ${\it rosat}$ above1.5 kev (the so-called \textit{vela x cocoon}): a filamentary structureextending southwest from the pulsar to the centre of vela x. a deeperobservation of the entire vela x nebula region, also including larger offsetsfrom the cocoon, has been performed with h.e.s.s. this re-observation wascarried out in order to probe the extent of the non-thermal emission from thevela x region at tev energies and to investigate its spectral properties. inorder to increase the sensitivity to the faint $\gamma$-ray emission from thevery extended vela x region, a multivariate analysis method combining threecomplementary reconstruction techniques of cherenkov-shower images is appliedfor the selection of $\gamma$-ray events. the analysis is performed with theon/off background method, which estimates the background from separateobservations pointing away from vela x; towards regions free of $\gamma$-raysources but with comparable observation conditions. the $\gamma$-ray surfacebrightness over the large vela x region reveals that the detection ofnon-thermal vhe $\gamma$-ray emission from the pwn hess $\mathrm{j0835\mhyphen455}$ is statistically significant over a region of radius 1.2$^{\circ}$ aroundthe position $\alpha$ = 08$^{\mathrm{h}}$ 35$^{\mathrm{m}}$ 00$^{\mathrm{s}}$,$\delta$ = -45$^{\circ}$ 36$^{\mathrm{\prime}}$00$^{\mathrm{\prime}\mathrm{\prime}}$ (j2000).

1212.5472	variable pulse profiles of her x-1 repeating with the same irregular 35d  clock as the turn-ons	the accreting x-ray pulsar her x-1 shows two types of long-term variations,both with periods of ~35 days: 1) turn-on cycles, a modulation of the flux},with a ten-day long main-on and a five-day long short-on, separated by twooff-states, and 2) a systematic variation in the shape of the 1.24 s pulseprofile. while there is general consensus that the flux modulation is due tovariable shading of the x-ray emitting regions on the surface of the neutronstar by the precessing accretion disk, the physical reason for the variation inthe pulse profiles has remained controversial. following the suggestion thatfree precession of the neutron star may be responsible for the variation in thepulse profiles, we developed a physical model of strong feedback interactionbetween the neutron star and the accretion disk in order to explain theseemingly identical values for the periods of the two types of variations,which were found to be in basic synchronization. in a deep analysis of pulseprofiles observed by several different satellites over the last three decadeswe now find that the clock behind the pulse profile variations shows exactlythe same erratic behavior as the turn-on clock, even on short time scales (afew 35 d cycles), suggesting that there may in fact be only one 35 d clock inthe system. if this is true, it raises serious questions with respect to theidea of free precession of the neutron star, namely how the neutron star canchange its precessional period every few years by up to 2.5% and how thefeedback can be so strong, such that these changes can be transmitted to theaccretion disk on rather short time scales.

1301.1173	search for photon line-like signatures from dark matter annihilations  with h.e.s.s	gamma-ray line signatures can be expected in the very-high-energy (vhe;e_\gamma &gt; 100 gev) domain due to self-annihilation or decay of dark matter(dm) particles in space. such a signal would be readily distinguishable fromastrophysical \gamma-ray sources that in most cases produce continuous spectrawhich span over several orders of magnitude in energy. using data collectedwith the h.e.s.s. \gamma-ray instrument, upper limits on line-like emission areobtained in the energy range between ~500 gev and ~25 tev for the central partof the milky way halo and for extragalactic observations, complementing recentlimits obtained with the fermi-lat instrument at lower energies. nostatistically significant signal could be found. for monochromatic \gamma-rayline emission, flux limits of (2x10^-7 - 2x10^-5) m^-2 s^-1 sr^-1 and (1x10^-8- 2x10^-6) m^-2 s^-1 sr^-1 are obtained for the central part of the milky wayhalo and extragalactic observations, respectively. for a dm particle mass of 1tev, limits on the velocity-averaged dm annihilation cross section &lt; \sigma v&gt;(\chi\chi -&gt; \gamma\gamma) reach ~10^-27 cm^3 s^-1, based on the einastoparametrization of the galactic dm halo density profile.

1404.1613	tev {\gamma}-ray observations of the young synchrotron-dominated snrs  g1.9+0.3 and g330.2+1.0 with h.e.s.s	the non-thermal nature of the x-ray emission from the shell-type supernovaremnants (snrs) g1.9+0.3 and g330.2+1.0 is an indication of intense particleacceleration in the shock fronts of both objects. this suggests that the snrsare prime candidates for very-high-energy (vhe; e $&gt;$ 0.1 tev) {\gamma}-rayobservations. g1.9+0.3, recently established as the youngest known snr in thegalaxy, also offers a unique opportunity to study the earliest stages of snrevolution in the vhe domain. the purpose of this work is to probe the level ofvhe {\gamma}-ray emission from both snrs and use this to constrain theirphysical properties. observations were conducted with the h.e.s.s. (high energystereoscopic system) cherenkov telescope array over a more than six-year periodspanning 2004-2010. the obtained data have effective livetimes of 67 h forg1.9+0.3 and 16 h for g330.2+1.0. the data are analyzed in the context of themulti-wavelength observations currently available and in the framework of bothleptonic and hadronic particle acceleration scenarios. no significant{\gamma}-ray signal from g1.9+0.3 or g330.2+1.0 was detected. upper limits (99%confidence level) to the tev flux from g1.9+0.3 and g330.2+1.0 for the assumedspectral index {\gamma} = 2.5 were set at 5.6 $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ above 0.26 tev and 3.2 $\times$ 10$^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ above0.38 tev, respectively. in a one-zone leptonic scenario, these upper limitsimply lower limits on the interior magnetic field to b$_{\mathrm{g1.9}}$$\gtrsim$ 11 {\mu}g for g1.9+0.3 and to b$_{\mathrm{g330}}$ $\gtrsim$ 8 {\mu}gfor g330.2+1.0. in a hadronic scenario, the low ambient densities and the largedistances to the snrs result in very low predicted fluxes, for which theh.e.s.s. upper limits are not constraining.

1405.6855	formation of phase lags at the cyclotron energies in the pulse profiles  of magnetized, accreting neutron stars	context: accretion-powered x-ray pulsars show highly energy-dependent andcomplex pulse-profile morphologies. significant deviations from the averagepulse profile can appear, in particular close to the cyclotron line energies.these deviations can be described as energy-dependent phase lags, that is, asenergy-dependent shifts of main features in the pulse profile. aims: using anumerical study we explore the effect of cyclotron resonant scattering onobservable, energy-resolved pulse profiles. methods: we generated theobservable emission as a function of spin phase, using monte carlo simulationsfor cyclotron resonant scattering and a numerical ray-tracing routineaccounting for general relativistic light-bending effects on the intrinsicemission from the accretion columns. results: we find strong changes in thepulse profile coincident with the cyclotron line energies. features in thepulse profile vary strongly with respect to the average pulse profile with theobserving geometry and shift and smear out in energy additionally when assuminga non-static plasma. conclusions: we demonstrate how phase lags at thecyclotron energies arise as a consequence of the effects of angularredistribution of x-rays by cyclotron resonance scattering in a strong magneticfield combined with relativistic effects. we also show that phase lags arestrongly dependent on the accretion geometry. these intrinsic effects will inprinciple allow us to constrain a system's accretion geometry.

1411.7568	diffuse galactic gamma-ray emission with h.e.s.s	diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission is the most prominent observable signature ofcelestial cosmic-ray interactions at high energies. while already beinginvestigated at gev energies over several decades, assessments of diffuse$\gamma$-ray emission at tev energies remain sparse. after completion of thesystematic survey of the inner galaxy, the h.e.s.s. experiment is in a primeposition to observe large-scale diffuse emission at tev energies. data of theh.e.s.s. galactic plane survey are investigated in regions off known$\gamma$-ray sources. corresponding $\gamma$-ray flux measurements were madeover an extensive grid of celestial locations. longitudinal and latitudinalprofiles of the observed $\gamma$-ray fluxes show characteristic excessemission not attributable to known $\gamma$-ray sources. for the first timelarge-scale $\gamma$-ray emission along the galactic plane using imagingatmospheric cherenkov telescopes has been observed. while the backgroundsubtraction technique limits the ability to recover modest variation on thescale of the h.e.s.s. field of view or larger, which is characteristic of theinverse compton scatter-induced galactic diffuse emission, contributions ofneutral pion decay as well as emission from unresolved $\gamma$-ray sources canbe recovered in the observed signal to a large fraction. calculations show thatthe minimum $\gamma$-ray emission from $\pi^0$-decay represents a significantcontribution to the total signal. this detection is interpreted as a mix ofdiffuse galactic $\gamma$-ray emission and unresolved sources.

1502.03244	constraints on an annihilation signal from a core of constant dark  matter density around the milky way center with h.e.s.s	an annihilation signal of dark matter is searched for from the central regionof the milky way. data acquired in dedicated on/off observations of thegalactic center region with h.e.s.s. are analyzed for this purpose. nosignificant signal is found in a total of $\sim 9$ h of on/off observations.upper limits on the velocity averaged cross section, $&lt;\sigma v &gt;$, for theannihilation of dark matter particles with masses in the range of $\sim 300$gev to $\sim 10$ tev are derived. in contrast to previous constraints derivedfrom observations of the galactic center region, the constraints that arederived here apply also under the assumption of a central core of constant darkmatter density around the center of the galaxy. values of $&lt;\sigma v &gt;$ thatare larger than $3\cdot 10^{-24}\:\mathrm{cm^3/s}$ are excluded for dark matterparticles with masses between $\sim 1$ and $\sim 4$ tev at 95% cl if the radiusof the central dark matter density core does not exceed $500$ pc. this is thestrongest constraint that is derived on $&lt;\sigma v&gt;$ for annihilating tev massdark matter without the assumption of a centrally cusped dark matter densitydistribution in the search region.

1503.02711	discovery of variable vhe gamma-ray emission from the binary system 1fgl  j1018.6-5856	re-observations with the h.e.s.s. telescope array of the very-high-energy(vhe) source hess j1018-589 a coincident with the fermi-lat $\gamma$-ray binary1fgl j1018.6-5856 have resulted in a source detection significance of more than9$\sigma$, and the detection of variability ($\chi^2$/$\nu$ of 238.3/155) inthe emitted $\gamma$-ray flux. this variability confirms the association ofhess j1018-589 a with the high-energy $\gamma$-ray binary detected byfermi-lat, and also confirms the point-like source as a new very-high-energybinary system. the spectrum of hess j1018-589 a is best fit with a power-lawfunction with photon index $\gamma = 2.20 \pm 0.14_{\rm stat} \pm 0.2_{\rmsys}$. emission is detected up to ~20 tev. the mean differential flux level is$(2.9 \pm 0.4)\times10^{-13}$ tev$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at 1 tev,equivalent to ~1% of the flux from the crab nebula at the same energy.variability is clearly detected in the night-by-night lightcurve. when foldedon the orbital period of 16.58 days, the rebinned lightcurve peaks in phasewith the observed x-ray and high-energy phaseograms. the fit of the h.e.s.s.phaseogram to a constant flux provides evidence of periodicity at the level of3$\sigma$. the shape of the vhe phaseogram and measured spectrum suggest a lowinclination, low eccentricity system with a modest impact from vhe $\gamma$-rayabsorption due to pair production ($\tau$ &lt; 1 at 300 gev).

1504.07501	swift/bat measurements of the cyclotron line energy decay in the  accreting neutron star her x-1: indication of an evolution of the magnetic  field?	context: the magnetic field is a crucial ingredient of neutron stars. itgoverns the physics of accretion and of the resulting high-energy emission inaccreting pulsars. studies of the cyclotron resonant scattering features(crsfs) seen as absorption lines in the x-ray spectra of the pulsars permitdirect measuremets of the field strength. aims: from an analysis of a number ofpointed observations with different instruments, the energy of crsf, ecyc, hasrecently been found to decay in her x-1, which is one of the best-studiedaccreting pulsars. we present our analysis of a homogeneous and almostuninterrupted monitoring of the line energy with swift/bat. methods: weanalyzed the archival swift/bat observations of her x-1 from 2005 to 2014. thedata were used to measure the crsf energy averaged over several months.results: the analysis confirms the long-term decay of the line energy. thedownward trend is highly significant and consistent with the trend measuredwith the pointed observations: decyc/dt ~-0.3 kev per year. conclusions: thedecay of ecyc either indicates a local evolution of the magnetic fieldstructure in the polar regions of the neutron star or a geometricaldisplacement of the line-forming region due to long-term changes in thestructure of the x-ray emitting region. the shortness of the observed timescaleof the decay, -ecyc/(decyc/dt) ~ 100 yr, suggests that trend reversals and/orjumps of the line energy might be observed in the future.

0805.1811	integral observations of the variability of oao 1657-415	the galactic plane scan (gps) was one of the core observation programmes ofthe integral satellite. the highly variable accreting pulsar oao 1657-415 wasfrequently observed within the gps. we investigate the spectral and timingproperties of oao 1657-415 and their variability on short and long time scalesin the energy range 6-160 kev. during the time covered by the integralobservations, the pulse period evolution shows an initial spin-down, which isfollowed by an equally strong spin-up. in combining our results with historicalpulse period measurements (correcting them for orbital variation) and withstretches of continuous observations by batse, we find that the long-termperiod evolution is characterised by a long-term spin-up overlayed by sets ofrelative spin-down/spin-up episodes, which appear to repeat quasi-periodicallyon a 4.8 yr time scale. we measure an updated local ephemeris and confirm thepreviously determined orbital period with an improved accuracy. the spectraclearly change with pulse phase. the spectrum measured during the main peak ofthe pulse profile is particularly hard. we do not find any evidence of acyclotron line, wether in the phase-averaged spectrum or in phase-resolvedspectra.

1506.07082	on the dependence of the x-ray continuum variations with luminosity in  accreting x-ray pulsars	using rxte/asm archival data, we investigate the behaviour of the spectralhardness ratio as a function of x-ray luminosity in a sample of six transientx-ray pulsars (exo 2030+375, gx 304-1, 4u 0115+63, v 0332+63, a 0535+26 and mxb0656-072). in all sources we find that the spectral hardness ratio defined as$f_{5-12\mathrm{kev}}/ f_{1.33-3\mathrm{kev}}$ increases with the asm flux(1.33--12 kev) at low luminosities and then saturates or even slightlydecreases above some critical x-ray luminosity falling into the range$\sim(3-7)\times10^{37}$~erg~s$^{-1}$. two-dimensional structure of accretioncolumns in the radiation-diffusion limit is calculated for two possiblegeometries (filled and hollow cylinder) for mass accretion rates $\dot m$ranging from $10^{17}$ to 1.2$\times 10^{18}$~g s$^{-1}$. the observed spectralbehaviour in the transient x-ray pulsars with increasing $\dot m$ can bereproduced by a compton saturated sidewall emission from optically thickmagnetized accretion columns with taking into account the emission reflectedfrom the neutron star atmosphere. at $\dot m$ above some critical value $\dotm_{cr}\sim (6-8)\times 10^{17}$~g~s$^{-1}$, the hight of the column becomessuch that the contribution of the reflected component to the total emissionstarts decreasing, which leads to the saturation and even slight decrease ofthe spectral hardness. hollow-cylinder columns have a smaller height than thefilled-cylinder ones, and the contribution of the reflected component in thetotal emission does not virtually change with $\dot m$ (and hence the hardnessof the continuum monotonically increases) up to higher mass accretion ratesthan $\dot m_{cr}$ for the filled columns.

astro-ph;0701791	integral and swift observations of exo 2030+375 during a giant outburst	aims: we investigate the x-ray spectral and timing properties of the highmass x-ray binary exo 2030+375 observed during its june-september 2006 giant(type ii) outburst. methods: the data analyzed in this work are from partlysimultaneous observations with integral swift. the pulse period p and itstemporal derivative p_dot are measured. x-ray pulse profiles in differentenergy ranges and time intervals are constructed. pulse averaged x-ray spectrafor different time intervals are studied. results: we report a strong spin-upof the source during the outburst, comparable to that observed in 1985 duringthe previous giant outburst when the source was discovered. the value of p_dotis found to be linearly related to the x-ray luminosity of the source duringthe outburst. for the first time the hard x-ray (&gt;25 kev) characteristics ofthe source during a type ii outburst are studied. the x-ray pulse profilesapparently change with luminosity. the x-ray spectral continuum in the 3--120kev energy range is modeled with an absorbed power law with an exponentialcutoff around e ~26 kev. an iron emission line at ~6-7 kev is observed. thespectrum reveals some features between 10 and 20 kev which can be modeledeither by a broad emission line at ~13-15 kev (a ``bump'') or by two absorptionlines at ~10 and ~20 kev.

astro-ph;0702490	discovery of a flux-related change of the cyclotron line energy in her  x-1	we present the results of ten years of repeated measurements of the cyclotronresonance scattering feature (crsf) in the spectrum of the binary x-ray pulsarher x-1 and report the discovery of a positive correlation of the centroidenergy of this absorption feature in pulse phase averaged spectra with sourceluminosity.our results are based on a uniform analysis of observations bytherxte satellite from 1996 to 2005, using sufficiently long observations of 12individual 35-day main-on states of the source. the mean centroid energy e_c ofthe crsf in pulse phase averaged spectra of her x-1 during this time is around40 kev, with significant variations from one main-on state to the next. we findthat the centroid energy of the crsf in her x-1 changes by ~5% in energy for afactor of 2 in luminosity. the correlation is positive, contrary to what isobserved in some high luminosity transient pulsars. our finding is the firstsignificant measurement of a positive correlation between e_c and luminosity inany x-ray pulsar. we suggest that this behaviour is expected in the case ofsub-eddington accretion and present a calculation of a quantitative estimate,which is very consistent with the effect observed in her x-1.we urge that herx-1 is regularly monitored further and that other x-ray pulsars areinvestigated for a similar behaviour.

astro-ph;0702528	long-term developments in her x-1: correlation between the histories of  the 35 day turn-on cycle and the 1.24 sec pulse period	we have studied the long-term (1971-2005) behaviour of the 1.24 sec pulseperiod and the 35 day precession period of her x-1 and show that both periodsvary in a highly correlated way (see also staubert et al. 1997 and 2000). whenthe spin-up rate decreases, the 35 day turn-on period shortens.this correlationis most evident on long time scales (~2000 days),e.g.around four extendedspin-down episodes, but also on shorter time scales (a few 100 days) on whichquasi-periodic variations are apparent. we argue that the likely common causeis variations of the mass accretion rate onto the neutron star.the data since1991 allow a continuous sampling and indicate a lag between the turn-onbehaviour and the spin behaviour, in the sense that changes are first seen inthe spin, about one cycle later in the turn-on. both the coronal wind model(schandl &amp; meyer 1994) as well as the stream-disk model (shakura et al.999)predict this kind of behaviour.

astro-ph;0702536	a 0535+26 in the august/september 2005 outburst observed by rxte and  integral	in this letter we present results from integral and rxte observations of thespectral and timing behavior of the high mass x-ray binary a 0535+26 during itsaugust/september 2005 normal (type i) outburst with an average fluxf(5-100kev)~400mcrab. the search for cyclotron resonance scattering features(fundamental and harmonic) is one major focus of the paper. our analysis isbased on data from integral and rxte target of opportunity observationsperformed during the outburst. the pulse period is determined. x-ray pulseprofiles in different energy ranges are analyzed. the broad band integral andrxte pulse phase averaged x-ray spectra are studied. the evolution of thefundamental cyclotron line at different luminosities is analyzed. the pulseperiod p is measured to be 103.39315(5)s at mjd 53614.5137. two absorptionfeatures are detected in the phase averaged spectra at e_1~45kev ande_2~100kev. these can be interpreted as the fundamental cyclotron resonancescattering feature and its first harmonic and therefore the magnetic field canbe estimated to be b~4x10^12g.

0809.4190	giant outburst of exo 2030+375: pulse-phase resolved analysis of  integral data	in june-september 2006 the be/x-ray binary exo 2030+375 experienced thesecond giant outburst since its discovery. the source was shown to have acomplicated pulse-averaged x-ray spectral continuum with possible evidence ofcyclotron absorption features. in this paper we present the first pulse-phaseresolved analysis of the broad band x-ray spectra of exo 2030+375 obtained withthe integral observatory close to the maximum and during the decay phase of thegiant outburst. we report a strong variability of the spectrum with pulsephase. alternative spectral continuum models are discussed. the dependence ofthe spectral parameters on pulse phase during the maximum of the outburst andthe evolution of the pulse profiles with time are qualitatively consistent withthe pulsar's emission diagram changing from the fan-beam geometry close to themaximum of the outburst to a combination of pencil and fan beams (of comparableintesities) at the end of the decay phase. evidence of a cyclotron absorptionline around 63 kev at the pulse phase interval preceeding the main peak of thepulse profile is present in the spectrum obtained close to the maximum of theoutburst.

0811.4045	two ~35 day clocks in her x-1: evidence for neutron star free precession	we present evidence for the existence of two ~35 day clocks in the her x-1/hzher binary system. ~35 day modulations are observed 1) in the turn-on cycleswith two on- and two off-states, and 2) in the changing shape of the pulseprofiles which re-appears regularly. the two ways of counting the 35 day cyclesare generally in synchronization. this synchronization did apparently breakdown temporarily during the long anomalous low (al3) which her x-1 experiencedin 1999/2000, in the sense that there must have been one extra turn-on cycle.our working hypothesis is that there are two clocks in the system, both with aperiod of about ~35 days: precession of the accretion disk (the less stable"turn-on clock") and free precession of the neutron star (the more stable"pulse profile clock"). we suggest that free precession of the neutron star isthe master clock, and that the precession of the accretion disk is basicallysynchronized to that of the neutron star through a feed-back mechanism in thebinary system. however, the turn-on clock can slip against its master when theaccretion disk has a very low inclination, as is observed to be the case duringal3. we take the apparent correlation between the histories of the turn-ons, ofthe anomalous lows and of the pulse period evolution, with a 5 yrquasi-periodicity, as evidence for strong physical interaction and feed-backbetween the major components in the system. we speculate that the 5 yr (10 yr)period is either due to a corresponding activity cycle of hz her or a naturalringing period of the physical system of coupled components. the questionwhether free precession really exists in neutron stars is of great importancefor the understanding of matter with supra-nuclear density.
