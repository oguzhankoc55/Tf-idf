0901.0550	the dependence of star formation activity on stellar mass surface  density and sersic index in zcosmos galaxies at 0.5&lt;z&lt;0.9 compared with sdss  galaxies at 0.04&lt;z&lt;0.08	one of the key unanswered questions in the study of galaxy evolution is whatphysical processes inside galaxies drive the changes in the sfrs in individualgalaxies that, taken together, produce the large decline in the globalstar-formation rate density (sfrd) to redshifts since z~2. many studies of thesfr at intermediate redshifts have been made as a function of the integratedstellar mass of galaxies but these did not use information on the internalstructural properties of the galaxies. in this paper we present a comparativestudy of the dependence of sfrs on the average surface mass densities (sigmam)of galaxies of different morphological types up to z~1 using the zcosmos andsdss surveys. the main findings about the evolution of these relatively massivegalaxies are: 1) there is evidence that, for both sdss ans zcosmos galaxies,the mean specific sfr within a given population (either disk-dominated orbulge-dominated) is independent of sigmam; 2) the observed ssfr - sigmamstep-function relation is due, at all investigated redshifts, to the changingmix of disk-dominated and bulge-dominated galaxies as surface density increasesand the strong difference in the average ssfr between disks and bulges. we alsofind a modest differential evolution in the size-mass relations of disk andspheroid galaxies; 3) the shape of the median ssfr - sigmam relation issimilar, but with median ssfr values that are about 5-6 times higher in zcosmosgalaxies than for sdss, across the whole range of sigmam, and in both spheroidand disk galaxies. this increase matches that of the global sfrd of theuniverse as a whole, emphasizing that galaxies of all types are contributing,proportionally, to the global increase in sfrd in the universe back to theseredshifts (abridged).

0901.2929	discovery of the most-distant double-peaked emitter at z=1.369	we report the discovery of the most-distant double-peaked emitter, cxoecdfsj033115.0-275518, at z=1.369. a keck/deimos spectrum shows a clearlydouble-peaked broad mg ii $\lambda2799$ emission line, with fwhm 11000 km/s forthe line complex. the line profile can be well fit by an ellipticalrelativistic keplerian disk model. this is one of a handful of double-peakedemitters known to be a luminous quasar, with excellent multiwavelength coverageand a high-quality x-ray spectrum. cxoecdfs j033115.0-275518 is a radio-loudquasar with two radio lobes (fr ii morphology) and a radio loudness of f_{5ghz}/f_{4400 \aa}~429. the x-ray spectrum can be modeled by a power law withphoton index 1.72 and no intrinsic absorption; the rest-frame 0.5-8.0 kevluminosity is $5.0\times10^{44}$ erg/s. the spectral energy distribution (sed)of cxoecdfs j033115.0-275518 has a shape typical for radio-loud quasars anddouble-peaked emitters at lower redshift. the local viscous energy releasedfrom the line-emitting region of the accretion disk is probably insufficient topower the observed line flux, and external illumination of the disk appears tobe required. the presence of a big blue bump in the sed along with theunexceptional x-ray spectrum suggest that the illumination cannot arise from aradiatively inefficient accretion flow.

0903.3409	the density field of the 10k zcosmos galaxies	we use the current sample of ~10,000 zcosmos spectra of sources selected withi(ab) &lt; 22.5 to define the density field out to z~1, with much greaterresolution in the radial dimension than has been possible with eitherphotometric redshifts or weak lensing. we apply new algorithms that we havedeveloped (zade) to incorporate objects not yet observed spectroscopically bymodifying their photometric redshift probability distributions using thespectroscopic redshifts of nearby galaxies. this strategy allows us to probe abroader range of galaxy environments and reduce the poisson noise in thedensity field. the reconstructed overdensity field of the 10k zcosmos galaxiesconsists of cluster-like patterns surrounded by void-like regions, extending upto z~1. some of these structures are very large, spanning the ~50 mpc/htransverse direction of the cosmos field and extending up to delta z~0.05 inredshift. we present the three dimensional overdensity maps and compare thereconstructed overdensity field to the independently identified virialisedgroups of galaxies and clusters detected in the visible and in x-rays. thedistribution of the overdense structures is in general well traced by thesevirialised structures. a comparison of the large scale structures in thezcosmos data and in the mock catalogues reveals an excellent agreement betweenthe fractions of the volume enclosed in structures of all sizes above a givenoverdensity between the data and the mocks in 0.2&lt;z&lt;1.

0903.3411	an optical group catalogue to z = 1 from the zcosmos 10k sample	we present a galaxy group catalogue spanning the redshift range 0.1 &lt;~ z &lt;~ 1in the ~1.7 deg^2 cosmos field, based on the first ~10,000 zcosmos spectra. theperformance of both the friends-of-friends (fof) and voronoi-delaunay-method(vdm) approaches to group identification has been extensively explored andcompared using realistic mock catalogues. we find that the performance improvessubstantially if groups are found by progressively optimizing the group-findingparameters for successively smaller groups, and that the highest fidelitycatalogue, in terms of completeness and purity, is obtained by combining theindependently created fof and vdm catalogues. the final completeness and purityof this catalogue, both in terms of the groups and of individual members,compares favorably with recent results in the literature. the current groupcatalogue contains 102 groups with n &gt;= 5 spectroscopically confirmed members,with a further ~700 groups with 2 &lt;= n &lt;= 4. most of the groups can be assigneda velocity dispersion and a dark-matter mass derived from the mock catalogues,with quantifiable uncertainties. the fraction of zcosmos galaxies in groups isabout 25% at low redshift and decreases toward ~15% at z ~ 0.8. the zcosmosgroup catalogue is broadly consistent with that expected from the semi-analyticevolution model underlying the mock catalogues. not least, we show that thenumber density of groups with a given intrinsic richness increases fromredshift z ~ 0.8 to the present, consistent with the hierarchical growth ofstructure.

0906.1807	the zcosmos survey. the dependence of clustering on luminosity and  stellar mass at z=0.2-1	we study the dependence of galaxy clustering on luminosity and stellar massat redshifts z ~ [0.2-1] using the first zcosmos 10k sample.  we measure the redshift-space correlation functions xi(rp,pi) and itsprojection wp(rp) for sub-samples covering different luminosity, mass andredshift ranges. we quantify in detail the observational selection biases andwe check our covariance and error estimate techniques using ensembles ofsemi-analytic mock catalogues. we finally compare our measurements to thecosmological model predictions from the mock surveys.  at odds with other measurements, we find a weak dependence of galaxyclustering on luminosity in all redshift bins explored. a mild dependence onstellar mass is instead observed. at z~0.7, wp(rp) shows strong excess power onlarge scales. we interpret this as produced by large-scale structure dominatingthe survey volume and extending preferentially in direction perpendicular tothe line-of-sight. we do not see any significant evolution with redshift of theamplitude of clustering for bright and/or massive galaxies.  the clustering measured in the zcosmos data at 0.5&lt;z&lt;1 for galaxies withlog(m/m_\odot)&gt;=10 is only marginally consistent with predictions from the mocksurveys. on scales larger than ~2 h^-1 mpc, the observed clustering amplitudeis compatible only with ~1% of the mocks. thus, if the power spectrum of matteris lcdm with standard normalization and the bias has no unnaturalscale-dependence, this result indicates that cosmos has picked up aparticularly rare, ~2-3 sigma positive fluctuation in a volume of ~10^6 h^-1mpc^3. these findings underline the need for larger surveys of the z~1 universeto appropriately characterize the level of structure at this epoch.

0906.4556	the zcosmos redshift survey: the role of environment and stellar mass in  shaping the rise of the morphology-density relation from z~1	for more than two decades we have known that galaxy morphological segregationis present in the local universe. it is important to see how this relationevolves with cosmic time. to investigate how galaxy assembly took place withcosmic time, we explore the evolution of the morphology-density relation up toredshift z~1 using about 10000 galaxies drawn from the zcosmos galaxy redshiftsurvey. taking advantage of accurate hst/acs morphologies from the cosmossurvey, of the well-characterised zcosmos 3d environment, and of a large sampleof galaxies with spectroscopic redshift, we want to study here the evolution ofthe morphology-density relation up to z~1 and its dependence on galaxyluminosity and stellar mass. the multi-wavelength coverage of the field alsoallows a first study of the galaxy morphological segregation dependence oncolour. we further attempt to disentangle between processes that occurred earlyin the history of the universe or late in the life of galaxies. the zcosmosfield benefits of high-resolution imaging in the f814w filter from the advancedcamera for survey (acs). we use standard morphology classifiers, optimised forbeing robust against band-shifting and surface brightness dimming, and a new,objective, and automated method to convert morphological parameters into early,spiral, and irregular types. we use about 10000 galaxies down to i_ab=22.5 witha spectroscopic sampling rate of 33% to characterise the environment ofgalaxies up to z~1 from the 100 kpc scales of galaxy groups up to the 100 mpcscales of the cosmic web. abridged

0907.0013	tracking the impact of environment on the galaxy stellar mass function  up to z~1 in the 10k zcosmos sample	we study the impact of the environment on the evolution of galaxies in thezcosmos 10k sample in the redshift range 0.1&lt;z&lt;1.0 over an area of ~1.5 deg2.the considered sample of secure spectroscopic redshifts contains about 8500galaxies, with their stellar masses estimated by sed fitting of themultiwavelength optical to nir photometry. the evolution of the galaxy stellarmass function (gsmf) in high and low density regions provides a tool to studythe mass assembly evolution in different environments; moreover, thecontributions to the gsmf from different galaxy types, as defined by their sedsand their morphologies, can be quantified. at redshift z~1, the gsmf is onlyslightly dependent on environment, but at lower redshifts the shapes of thegsmfs in high- and low-density environments become extremely different, withhigh density regions exhibiting a marked bimodality. as a result, we infer thatgalaxy evolution depends on both the stellar mass and the environment, thelatter setting the probability of a galaxy to have a given mass: all the galaxyproperties related to the stellar mass show a dependence on environment,reflecting the difference observed in the mass functions. the shapes of thegsmfs of early- and late-type galaxies are almost identical for the extremes ofthe density contrast we consider. the evolution toward z=0 of the mass at whichthe early- and late-type gsmfs match each other is more rapid in high densityenvironments. the comparison of the observed gsmfs to the same quantitiesderived from a set of mock catalogues shows that blue galaxies in sparseenvironments are overproduced in the semi-analytical models at intermediate andhigh masses, because of a deficit of star formation suppression, while at z&lt;0.5an excess of red galaxies is present in dense environments at intermediate andlow masses, because of the overquenching of satellites. abridged

0907.5416	zcosmos - 10k-bright spectroscopic sample. the bimodality in the galaxy  stellar mass function: exploring its evolution with redshift	we present the galaxy stellar mass function (mf) up to z~1 from thezcosmos-bright 10k spectroscopic sample. we investigate the total mf and thecontribution of etgs and ltgs, defined by different criteria (sed, morphologyor star formation). we unveil a galaxy bimodality in the global mf, betterrepresented by 2 schechter functions dominated by etgs and ltgs, respectively.for the global population we confirm that low-mass galaxies number densityincreases later and faster than for massive galaxies. we find that the mfevolution at intermediate-low values of mstar (logm&lt;10.6) is mostly explainedby the growth in stellar mass driven by smoothly decreasing star formationactivities. the low residual evolution is consistent with ~0.16 merger pergalaxy per gyr (of which fewer than 0.1 are major). we find that etgs increasein number density with cosmic time faster for decreasing mstar, with a median"building redshift" increasing with mass, in contrast with hierarchical models.for ltgs we find that the number density of blue or spiral galaxies remainsalmost constant from z~1. instead, the most extreme population of active starforming galaxies is rapidly decreasing in number density. we suggest atransformation from blue active spirals of intermediate mass into bluequiescent and successively (1-2 gyr after) into red passive types. the completemorphological transformation into red spheroidals, required longer time-scalesor follows after 1-2 gyr. a continuous replacement of blue galaxies is expectedby low-mass active spirals growing in stellar mass. we estimate that on average~25% of blue galaxies is transforming into red per gyr for logm&lt;11. we concludethat the build-up of galaxies and etgs follows the same downsizing trend withmass as the formation of their stars, converse to the trend predicted bycurrent sams. we expect a negligible evolution of the global galaxy baryonicmf.

0909.1951	the zcosmos redshift survey: how group environment alters global  downsizing trends	we took advantage of the wealth of information provided by the first ~10000galaxies of the zcosmos-bright survey and its group catalogue to study thecomplex interplay between group environment and galaxy properties. theclassical indicator f_blue (fraction of blue galaxies) proved to be a simplebut powerful diagnostic tool. we studied its variation for different luminosityand mass selected galaxy samples. using rest-frame b-band selected samples, thegroups galaxy population exhibits significant blueing as redshift increases,but maintains a lower f_blue with respect both to the global and the isolatedgalaxy population. however moving to mass selected samples it becomes apparentthat such differences are largely due to the biased view imposed by the b-bandluminosity selection, being driven by the population of lower mass, bright bluegalaxies for which we miss the redder, equally low mass, counterparts. byfocusing the analysis on narrow mass bins such that mass segregation becomesnegligible we find that only for the lowest mass bin explored (logmass &lt;= 10.6)does a significant residual difference in color remain as a function ofenvironment, while this difference becomes negligible toward higher masses. ourresults indicate that red galaxies of logmass &gt;= 10.8 are already in place at z~ 1 and do not exhibit any strong environmental dependence, possiblyoriginating from so-called 'nature'/internal mechanisms. in contrast, for lowergalaxy masses and redshifts lower than z ~ 1, we observe the emergence ingroups of a population of 'nurture' red galaxies: slightly deviating from thetrend of the downsizing scenario followed by the global galaxy population, andmore so with cosmic time. these galaxies exhibit signatures of group-relatedsecular physical mechanisms directly influencing galaxy evolution.

0909.1968	k+a galaxies in the zcosmos survey: physical properties of systems in  their post-starburst phase	the identities of the main processes triggering and quenching star-formationin galaxies remain unclear. a key stage in evolution, however, appears to berepresented by post-starburst galaxies. to investigate their impact on galaxyevolution, we initiated a multiwavelength study of galaxies with k+a spectralfeatures in the cosmos field. we examine a mass-selected sample of k+a galaxiesat z=0.48-1.2 using the spectroscopic zcosmos sample. k+a galaxies occupy thebrightest tail of the luminosity distribution. they are as massive as quiescentgalaxies and populate the green valley in the colour versus luminosity (orstellar mass) distribution. a small percentage (&lt;8%) of these galaxies haveradio and/or x-ray counterparts (implying an upper limit to the sfr of~8msun/yr). over the entire redshift range explored, the class of k+a galaxiesis morphologically a heterogeneous population with a similar incidence ofbulge-dominated and disky galaxies. this distribution does not vary with thestrength of the hdelta absorption line but instead with stellar mass in a wayreminiscent of the well-known mass-morphology relation. although k+a galaxiesare also found in underdense regions, they appear to reside typically in asimilarly rich environment as quiescent galaxies on a physical scale of~2-8mpc, and in groups they show a morphological early-to-late type ratiosimilar to the quiescent galaxy class. with the current data set, we do notfind evidence of statistical significant evolution in either the number/massdensity of k+a galaxies at intermediate redshift with respect to the localvalues, or the spectral properties. those galaxies, which are affected by asudden quenching of their star-formation activity, may increase the stellarmass of the red-sequence by up to a non-negligible level of ~10%.

0909.2032	the 10k zcosmos: morphological transformation of galaxies in the group  environment since z~1	we study the evolution of galaxies inside and outside of the groupenvironment since z=1 using a large well defined set of groups and galaxiesfrom the zcosmos-bright redshift survey in the cosmos field. the fraction ofgalaxies with early-type morphologies increases monotonically with m_bluminosity and stellar mass and with cosmic epoch. it is higher in the groupsthan elsewhere, especially at later epochs. the emerging environmental effectis superposed on a strong global mass-driven evolution, and at z~0.5 andlog(m*/msol)~10.2, the "effect" of group environment is equivalent to (only)about 0.2 dex in stellar mass or 2 gyr in time. the stellar mass function ofgalaxies in groups is enriched in massive galaxies. we directly determine thetransformation rates from late to early morphologies, and for transformationsinvolving colour and star formation indicators. the transformation rates aresystematically about twice as high in the groups as outside, or up to 3-4 timeshigher correcting for infall and the appearance of new groups. the rates reachvalues, for masses around the crossing mass 10^10.5 msol, as high as(0.3-0.7)/gyr in the groups, implying transformation timescales of 1.4-3 gyr,compared with less than 0.2/gyr, i.e. timescales &gt;5 gyr, outside of groups. allthree transformation rates decrease at higher stellar masses, and must decreasealso at the lower masses below 10^10 msol which we cannot well probe. the ratesinvolving colour and star formation are consistently higher than those formorphology, by a factor of about 50%. our conclusion is that thetransformations which drive the evolution of the overall galaxy populationsince z~1 must occur at a rate 2-4 times higher in groups than outside of them.

0909.4674	the zcosmos survey: the role of the environment in the evolution of the  luminosity function of different galaxy types	(abridged) we studied the evolution in the b band luminosity function to z~1in the zcosmos 10k sample, for which both accurate galaxy classifications and adetailed description of the local density field are available.  the global lf exhibits a brightening of ~0.7 mag in m* from z~0.2 to z~0.9.at low z, late types dominate at faint magnitudes, while the bright end ispopulated mainly by early types. at higher z, late-type galaxies evolvesignificantly and, at z~1, the contribution from the various types to thebright end of the lf is comparable. the evolution for early types is in bothluminosity and normalization. a similar behaviour is exhibited by late types,but with an opposite trend for the normalization. studying the role of theenvironment, we find that the global lf of galaxies in overdense regions hasalways a brighter m* and a flatter slope. in low density environments, the maincontribution to the lf is from blue galaxies, while for high densityenvironments there is an important contribution from red galaxies to the brightend. the differences between the global lf in the two environments are not dueto only a difference in the relative numbers of red and blue galaxies, but alsoto their relative luminosity distributions: the value of m* for both types inunderdense regions is always fainter than in overdense environments.  the "specular" evolution of late- and early-type galaxies is consistent witha scenario where a part of blue galaxies is transformed in red galaxies withincreasing cosmic time, without significant changes in the fraction ofintermediate-type galaxies. the bulk of this tranformation in overdense regionsprobably happened before z~1, while it is still ongoing at lower z inunderdense environments.

0910.0004	the nonlinear biasing of the 10k zcosmos galaxies up to z~1	we use the overdensity field reconstructed in the volume of the cosmos areato study the nonlinear biasing of the zcosmos galaxies. the galaxy overdensityfield is reconstructed using the current sample of ~8500 accurate zcosmosredshifts at i(ab)&lt;22.5 out to z~1 on scales r from 8 to 12 mpc/h. by comparingthe probability distribution function (pdf) of galaxy density contrast delta_gto the lognormal approximation of the pdf of the mass density contrast delta,we obtain the mean biasing function b(delta,z,r) between the galaxy and matteroverdensity field and its second moments b(hat) and b(tilde) up to z~1. overthe redshift interval 0.4&lt;z&lt;1 the conditional mean function &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; =b(delta,z,r) delta is of the following characteristic shape. the functionvanishes in the most underdense regions and then sharply rises in a nonlinearway towards the mean densities. &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; is almost a linear tracer ofthe matter in the overdense regions, up to the most overdense regions in whichit is nonlinear again and the local effective slope of &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; vs.delta is smaller than unity. the &lt;delta_g|delta&gt; function is evolving onlyslightly over the redshift interval 0.4&lt;z&lt;1. the linear biasing parameterincreases from b(hat)=1.24+/-0.11 at z=0.4 to b(hat)=1.64+/-0.15 at z=1 for them_b&lt;-20-z sample of galaxies. b(hat) does not show any dependence on thesmoothing scale from 8 to 12 mpc/h, but increases with luminosity. the measurednonlinearity parameter b(tilde)/b(hat) is of the order of a few percent (but itcan be consistent with 0) and it does not change with redshift, the smoothingscale or the luminosity. by matching the linear bias of galaxies to the halobias, we infer that the m_b&lt;-20-z galaxies reside in dark matter haloes with acharacteristic mass of about 3-6 x 10^12 msol, depending on the halo bias fit.

0911.0523	properties and environment of radio emitting galaxies in the vla-zcosmos  survey	we investigate the properties and the environment of radio sources withoptical counterpart from the combined vla-cosmos and zcosmos samples. theadvantage of this sample is the availability of optical spectroscopicinformation, high quality redshifts, and accurate density determination.  by comparing the star formation rates estimated from the optical spectralenergy distribution with those based on the radio luminosity, we divide theradio sources in three families, passive agn, non-passive agn and star forminggalaxies. these families occupy specific regions of the 8.0-4.5 $\mu$m infraredcolor--specific star formation plane, from which we extract the correspondingcontrol samples.  only the passive agn have a significantly different environment distributionfrom their control sample. the fraction of radio-loud passive agn increasesfrom ~2% in underdense regions to ~15% for overdensities (1+delta) greater than10. this trend is also present as a function of richness of the groups hostingthe radio sources. passive agn in overdensities tend to have higher radioluminosities than those in lower density environments. since the black holemass distribution is similar in both environments, we speculate that, for lowradio luminosities, the radio emission is controlled (through fueldisponibility or confinement of radio jet by local gas pressure) by theinterstellar medium of the host galaxy, while in other cases it is determinedby the structure (group or cluster) in which the galaxy resides.

1002.0071	the laboca survey of the extended chandra deep field south: two modes of  star formation in agn hosts?	we study the co-existence of star formation and agn activity in x-rayselected agn by analyzing stacked 870um submm emission from a deep and wide mapof the extended chandra deep field south, obtained with laboca at the apextelescope. the total x-ray sample of 895 sources with median redshift z~1 isdetected at a mean submm flux of 0.49+-0.04mjy, corresponding to a typical starformation rate around 30msun/yr for a t=35k, beta=1.5 greybody far-infraredsed. the good s/n permits stacking analyses for subgroups. we observe a trendof star formation rate increasing with redshift. an increase of star formationrate with agn luminosity is indicated at the highest l_2-10&gt;~1e44erg/sluminosities only. increasing trends with x-ray obscuration as expected in someagn evolutionary scenarios are not observed for the bulk of the x-ray agnsample but may be present for the highest intrinsic luminosity objects. thissuggests a transition between two modes in the coexistence of agn activity andstar formation. for the bulk of the sample, the x-ray luminosity andobscuration of the agn are not intimately linked to the global star formationrate of their hosts. the hosts are likely massive and forming stars secularly,at rates similar to the pervasive star formation seen in massive galaxieswithout an agn at similar redshifts. the change indicated towards more intensestar formation, and a more pronounced increase in star formation rates betweenunobscured and obscured agn at highest luminosities suggests that luminous agnfollow an evolutionary path on which obscured agn activity and intense starformation are linked, possibly via merging. comparison to local hard x-rayselected agn supports this interpretation.

1007.1453	color-magnitude relations of active and non-active galaxies in the  chandra deep fields: high-redshift constraints and stellar-mass selection  effects	[abridged] we extend color-magnitude relations for moderate-luminosity x-rayagn hosts and non-agn galaxies through the galaxy formation epoch in thechandra deep fields. we utilized analyses of color-magnitude diagrams (cmds) toassess the role of moderate-luminosity agns in galaxy evolution. first, weconfirm some previous results and extend them to higher redshifts, e.g., thereis no apparent color bimodality for agn hosts from z~0-2, but non-agn galaxycolor bimodality exists up to z~3; most agns reside in massive hosts and theagn fraction rises strongly toward higher stellar mass up to z~2-3; and thecolors of both agn hosts and non-agn galaxies become redder as the stellar massincreases up to z~2-3. second, we point out that it is critical to usemass-matched samples to examine color-magnitude relations of agn hosts andnon-agn galaxies. we show that for mass-matched samples up to z~2-3, agn hostslie in the same cmd region as non-agn galaxies; i.e., there is no specificclustering of agn hosts around the red sequence, the top of the blue cloud, orthe green valley in between. the agn fraction (~10%) is mostly independent ofhost-galaxy color, providing an indication of the duty cycle of smbh growth intypical massive galaxies. these results are in contrast to those obtained withnon-mass-matched samples where there is apparent agn clustering in the cmd andthe agn fraction generally increases as the color becomes redder. we also find,for mass-matched samples, that the sfrs of agn hosts are typically a factor of~2-3 larger than those of non-agn galaxies at z~0-1, whereas this differencediminishes at z~1-3. our results can be reasonably explained by two mainingredients, color-mass correlation and passive or secular evolution ofgalaxies; and thus tightly constrain any effects from moderate-luminosity agnfeedback upon color-magnitude properties over the ~80% of cosmic time.

1007.3841	the zcosmos 10k-sample: the role of galaxy stellar mass in the  colour-density relation up to z=1	[abridged] with the first 10000 spectra of the flux limited zcosmos sample(i&lt;=22.5) we study the evolution of environmental effects on galaxy propertiessince z=1.0, and disentangle the dependence among galaxy colour, stellar massand local density (3d local density contrast `delta', computed with the 5thnearest neighbour approach). we confirm that within a luminosity-limited sample(m_b&lt;=-20.5-z) the fraction of red (u-b&gt;=1) galaxies 'f_red' depends on deltaat least up to z=1, with red galaxies residing mainly in high densities. thistrend weakens for increasing z, and it is mirrored by the behaviour of thefraction of galaxies with d4000a break &gt;=1.4. we also find that up to z=1 thefraction of galaxies with log(ew[oii]) &gt;=1.15 is higher for lower delta, andalso this dependence weakens for increasing z. given the triple dependenceamong galaxy colours, stellar mass and delta, the colour-delta relation foundin the luminosity-selected sample can be due to the broad range of stellarmasses. thus, we fix the stellar mass and we find that in this case thecolour-delta relation is flat up to z=1 for galaxies with log(m/m_sun)&gt;=10.7.this means that for these masses the colour-delta relation found in aluminosity-selected sample is the result of the combined colour-mass andmass-delta relations. in contrast, we find that for 0.1&lt;=z&lt;=0.5 andlog(m/m_sun)&lt;=10.7 'f_red' depends on delta even at fixed mass. in these massand z ranges, environment affects directly also galaxy colours. we suggest ascenario in which the colour depends primarily on stellar mass, but forrelatively low mass galaxies the local density modulates this dependence. thesegalaxies formed more recently, in an epoch when evolved structures were alreadyin place, and their longer sfh allowed environment-driven physical processes tooperate during longer periods of time.

1009.0723	the bimodality of the 10k zcosmos-bright galaxies up to z ~ 1: a new  statistical and portable classification based on the optical galaxy  properties	our goal is to develop a new and reliable statistical method to classifygalaxies from large surveys. we probe the reliability of the method bycomparing it with a three-dimensional classification cube, using the same setof spectral, photometric and morphological parameters.we applied two differentmethods of classification to a sample of galaxies extracted from the zcosmosredshift survey, in the redshift range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.3. the first method is thecombination of three independent classification schemes, while the secondmethod exploits an entirely new approach based on statistical analyses likeprincipal component analysis (pca) and unsupervised fuzzy partition (ufp)clustering method. the pca+ufp method has been applied also to a lower redshiftsample (z &lt; 0.5), exploiting the same set of data but the spectral ones,replaced by the equivalent width of h$\alpha$. the comparison between the twomethods shows fairly good agreement on the definition on the two main clusters,the early-type and the late-type galaxies ones. our pca-ufp method ofclassification is robust, flexible and capable of identifying the two mainpopulations of galaxies as well as the intermediate population. theintermediate galaxy population shows many of the properties of the green valleygalaxies, and constitutes a more coherent and homogeneous population. thefairly large redshift range of the studied sample allows us to behold thedownsizing effect: galaxies with masses of the order of $3\cdot 10^{10}$ msunmainly are found in transition from the late type to the early type group at$z&gt;0.5$, while galaxies with lower masses - of the order of $10^{10}$ msun -are in transition at later epochs; galaxies with $m &lt;10^{10}$ msun did notbegin their transition yet, while galaxies with very large masses ($m &gt; 5\cdot10^{10}$ msun) mostly completed their transition before $z\sim 1$.

1009.1923	the extended chandra deep field-south survey: optical spectroscopy of  faint x-ray sources with the vlt and keck	we present the results of a program to acquire high-quality optical spectraof x-ray sources detected in the e-cdf-s and its central area. newspectroscopic redshifts are measured for 283 counterparts to chandra sourceswith deep exposures (t~2-9 hr per pointing) using multi-slit facilities on boththe vlt and keck thus bringing the total number of spectroscopically-identifiedx-ray sources to over 500 in this survey field. we provide a comprehensivecatalog of x-ray sources detected in the e-cdf-s including the optical andnear-infrared counterparts, and redshifts (both spectroscopic and photometric)that incorporate published spectroscopic catalogs thus resulting in a finalsample with a high fraction (80%) of x-ray sources having secureidentifications. we demonstrate the remarkable coverage of the lx-z plane nowaccessible from our data while emphasizing the detection of agns thatcontribute to the faint end of the luminosity function at 1.5&lt;z&lt;3. our redshiftcatalog includes 17 type 2 qsos that significantly increases such samples (2x).with our deepest vimos observation, we identify "elusive" optically-faintgalaxies (r~25) at z~2-3 based upon the detection of interstellar absorptionlines; we highlight one such case, an absorption-line galaxy at z=3.208 havingno obvious signs of an agn in its optical spectrum. in addition, we determinedistances to eight galaxy groups with extended x-ray emission. finally, wemeasure the physical extent of known large-scale structures (z~0.7) evident inthe cdf-s. while a thick sheet (radial size of 67.7 mpc) at z~0.67 extends overthe full field, the z~0.73 structure is thin (18.8 mpc) and filamentary astraced by both agns and galaxy groups. in the appendix, we providespectroscopic redshifts for 49 counterparts to fainter x-ray sources detectedonly in the 1 and 2 ms catalogs, and 48 vla radio sources not detected inx-rays.

1009.3376	zcosmos 10k-bright spectroscopic sample: exploring mass and environment  dependence in early-type galaxies	we present the analysis of the u-v rest-frame color distribution and somespectral features as a function of mass and environment for two sample ofearly-type galaxies up to z=1 extracted from the zcosmos spectroscopic survey.the first sample ("red galaxies") is defined with a photometric classification,while the second ("etgs") by combining morphological, photometric, andspectroscopic properties to obtain a more reliable sample. we find that thecolor distribution of red galaxies is not strongly dependent on environment forall mass bins, with galaxies in overdense regions redder than galaxies inunderdense regions with a difference of 0.027\pm0.008 mag. the dependence onmass is far more significant, with average colors of massive galaxies redder by0.093\pm0.007 mag than low-mass galaxies throughout the entire redshift range.we study the color-mass relation, finding a mean slope 0.12\pm0.005, while thecolor-environment relation is flatter, with a slope always smaller than 0.04.the spectral analysis that we perform on our etgs sample is in good agreementwith our photometric results: we find for d4000 a dependence on mass betweenhigh and low-mass galaxies, and a much weaker dependence on environment(respectively a difference of of 0.11\pm0.02 and of 0.05\pm0.02); for theequivalent width of h{\delta}we measure a difference of 0.28\pm0.08 {\aa}acrossthe same mass range and no significant dependence on environment.by analyzingthe lookback time of early-type galaxies, we support the possibility of adownsizing scenario, in which massive galaxies with a stronger d4000 and analmost constant equivalent width of $h\delta$ formed their mass at higherredshift than lower mass ones. we also conclude that the main driver of galaxyevolution is the galaxy mass, the environment playing a subdominant role.

1011.2280	probing the faint end of the quasar luminosity function at z ~ 4 in the  cosmos field	we searched for quasars that are ~ 3 mag fainter than the sdss quasars in theredshift range 3.7 &lt; z &lt; 4.7 in the cosmos field to constrain the faint end ofthe quasar luminosity function. using optical photometric data, we selected 31quasar candidates with 22 &lt; i' &lt; 24 at z ~ 4. we obtained optical spectra formost of these candidates using focas on the subaru telescope, and identified 8low-luminosity quasars at z ~ 4. in order to derive the quasar luminosityfunction (qlf) based on our spectroscopic follow-up campaign, we estimated thephotometric completeness of our quasar survey through detailed monte carlosimulations. our qlf at z ~ 4 has a much shallower faint-end slope beta =-1.67^{+0.11}_{-0.17} than that obtained by other recent surveys in the sameredshift. our result is consistent with the scenario of downsizing evolution ofactive galactic nuclei inferred by recent optical and x-ray quasar surveys atlower redshifts.

1012.4011	the xmm deep survey in the cdfs i. first results on heavily obscured agn	we present the first results of the spectroscopy of distant, obscured agn asobtained with the ultra-deep (~3.3 ms) xmm-newton survey in the chandra deepfield south (cdfs). one of the primary goals of the project is to characterizethe x-ray spectral properties of obscured and heavily obscured compton-thickagn over the range of redhifts and luminosities that are relevant in terms oftheir contribution to the x-ray background. the ultra-deep exposure, coupledwith the xmm detector's spectral throughput, allowed us to accumulate goodquality x-ray spectra for a large number of x-ray sources and, in particular,for heavily obscured agn at cosmological redshifts. specifically we present thex-ray spectral properties of two high-redshift - z= 1.53 and z=3.70 - sources.the xmm spectra of both are very hard, with a strong iron kalpha line at arest-frame energy of 6.4 kev. a reflection-dominated continuum provides thebest description of the x-ray spectrum of the z=1.53 source, while theintrinsic continuum of the z=3.70 agn is obscured by a large column n_h ~ 10^24cm-2 of cold gas. compton-thick absorption, or close to it, is unambiguouslydetected in both sources. interestingly, these sources would not be selected ascandidate compton thick agn by some multiwavelength selection criteria based onthe mid-infrared to optical and x-ray to optical flux ratios.

0709.3455	the evolution of agn host galaxies: from blue to red and the influence  of large-scale structures	we present an analysis of 109 moderate-luminosity (41.9 &lt; log l{0.5-8.0 kev}&lt; 43.7) agn in the extended chandra deep field-south survey, which is drawnfrom 5,549 galaxies from the combo-17 and gems surveys having 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.1.these obscured or optically-weak agn facilitate the study of their hostgalaxies since the agn provide an insubstantial amount of contamination to thegalaxy light. we find that the color distribution of agn host galaxies ishighly dependent upon (1) the strong color-evolution of luminous (m_v &lt; -20.7)galaxies, and (2) the influence of ~10 mpc scale structures. when excludinggalaxies within the redshift range 0.63 &lt; z &lt; 0.76, a regime dominated bysources in large-scale structures at z=0.67 and z=0.73, we observe a bimodalityin the host galaxy colors. galaxies hosting agn at z &gt; 0.8 preferentially havebluer (rest-frame u-v &lt; 0.7) colors than their z &lt;~ 0.6 counterparts (many ofwhich fall along the red sequence). the fraction of galaxies hosting agn peaksin the ``green valley'' (0.5 &lt; u-v &lt; 1.0); this is primarily due to enhancedagn activity in the redshift interval 0.63 &lt; z &lt; 0.76. the agn fraction in thisredshift and color interval is 12.8% (compared to its `field' value of 7.8%)and reaches a maximum of 14.8% at u-v~0.8. we further find that blue,bulge-dominated (sersic index n&gt;2.5) galaxies have the highest fraction of agn(21%) in our sample. we explore the scenario that the evolution of agn hosts isdriven by galaxy mergers and illustrate that an accurate assessment requires alarger area survey since only three hosts may be undergoing a merger withtimescales &lt;1 gyr following a starburst phase.

1104.5470	the zcosmos redshift survey : influence of luminosity, mass and  environment on the galaxy merger rate	the contribution of major mergers to galaxy mass assembly along cosmic timeis an important ingredient to the galaxy evolution scenario. we aim to measurethe evolution of the merger rate for both luminosity/mass selected galaxysamples and investigate its dependence with the local environment. we use asample of 10644 spectroscopically observed galaxies from the zcosmos redshiftsurvey to identify pairs of galaxies destined to merge, using only pairs forwhich the velocity difference and projected separation of both components witha confirmed spectroscopic redshift indicate a high probability of merging. wehave identified 263 spectroscopically confirmed pairs with r_p^{max} = 100h^{-1} kpc. we find that the density of mergers depends on luminosity/mass,being higher for fainter/less massive galaxies, while the number of mergers agalaxy will experience does not depends significantly on its intrinsicluminosity but rather on its stellar mass. we find that the pair fraction andmerger rate increase with local galaxy density, a property observed up toredshift z=1. we find that the dependence of the merger rate on the luminosityor mass of galaxies is already present up to redshifts z=1, and that theevolution of the volumetric merger rate of bright (massive) galaxies isrelatively flat with redshift with a mean value of 3*10^{-4} (8*10^{-5}respectively) mergers h^3 mpc^{-3} gyr^{-1}. the dependence of the merger ratewith environment indicates that dense environments favors major merger eventsas can be expected from the hierarchical scenario. the environment thereforehas a direct impact in shapping-up the mass function and its evolutiontherefore plays an important role on the mass growth of galaxies along cosmictime.

1105.5395	black hole accretion and host galaxies of obscured quasars in xmm-cosmos	we explore the connection between black hole growth at the center of obscuredquasars selected from the xmm-cosmos survey and the physical properties oftheir host galaxies. we study a bolometric regime (&lt;lbol &gt; 8 x 10^45 erg/s)where several theoretical models invoke major galaxy mergers as the mainfueling channel for black hole accretion. we confirm that obscured quasarsmainly reside in massive galaxies (mstar&gt;10^10 msun) and that the fraction ofgalaxies hosting such powerful quasars monotonically increases with the stellarmass. we stress the limitation of the use of rest-frame color-magnitudediagrams as a diagnostic tool for studying galaxy evolution and inferring theinfluence that agn activity can have on such a process. we instead use thecorrelation between star-formation rate and stellar mass found for star-forminggalaxies to discuss the physical properties of the hosts. we find that at z ~1,~62% of type-2 qsos hosts are actively forming stars and that their rates arecomparable to those measured for normal star-forming galaxies. the fraction ofstar-forming hosts increases with redshift: ~71% at z ~2, and 100% at z ~3. wealso find that the the evolution from z ~1 to z ~3 of the specificstar-formation rate of the type-2 qso hosts is in excellent agreement with thatmeasured for star-forming galaxies. from the morphological analysis, weconclude that most of the objects are bulge-dominated galaxies, and that only afew of them exhibit signs of recent mergers or disks. finally, bulge-dominatedgalaxies tend to host type-2 qsos with low eddington ratios (lambda&lt;0.1), whiledisk-dominated or merging galaxies have at their centers bhs accreting at higheddington ratios (lambda &gt; 0.1).

1109.1292	the impact of galaxy interactions on agn activity in zcosmos	close encounters between galaxies are expected to be a viable mechanism, aspredicted by numerical simulations, by which accretion onto supermassive blackholes can be initiated. to test this scenario, we construct a sample of 562galaxies (m*&gt;2.5x10^10 m_sun) in kinematic pairs over the redshift range 0.25 &lt;z &lt; 1.05 that are more likely to be interacting than a well-matched controlsample of 2726 galaxies not identified as being in a pair, both from thezcosmos 20k spectroscopic catalog. galaxies that harbor an active galacticnucleus (agn) are identified on the basis of their x-ray emission (l_x&gt;2x10^42erg s^-1) detected by chandra. we find a higher fraction of agn in galaxies inpairs relative to isolated galaxies of similar stellar mass. our result isprimarily due to an enhancement of agn activity, by a factor of 1.9 (observed)and 2.6 (intrinsic), for galaxies in pairs of projected separation less than 75kpc and line-of-sight velocity offset less than 500 km s^-1. this studydemonstrates that close kinematic pairs are conducive environments for blackhole growth either indicating a causal physical connection or an inherentrelation, such as, to enhanced star formation. in the appendix, we describe amethod to estimate the intrinsic fractions of galaxies (either in pairs or thefield) hosting an agn with confidence intervals, and an excess fraction inpairs. we estimate that 17.8_{-7.4}^{+8.4}% of all moderate-luminosity agnactivity takes place within galaxies undergoing early stages of interactionthat leaves open the question as to what physical processes are responsible forfueling the remaining ~80% that may include late-stage mergers.

1112.4842	environmental effects in the interaction and merging of galaxies in  zcosmos	(abridged) we analyze the environments and galactic properties (morphologiesand star-formation histories) of a sample of 153 close kinematic pairs in theredshift range 0.2 &lt; z &lt; 1 identified in the zcosmos-bright 10k spectroscopicsample of galaxies. correcting for projection effects, the fraction of closekinematic pairs is three times higher in the top density quartile than in thelowest one. this translates to a three times higher merger rate because themerger timescales are shown, from mock catalogues based on the millenniumsimulation, to be largely independent of environment once the same correctionsfor projection is applied. we then examine the morphologies and stellarpopulations of galaxies in the pairs, comparing them to control samples thatare carefully matched in environment so as to remove as much as possible thewell-known effects of environment on the properties of the parent population ofgalaxies. once the environment is properly taken into account in this way, wefind that the early-late morphology mix is the same as for the parentpopulation, but that the fraction of irregular galaxies is boosted by 50-75%,with a disproportionate increase in the number of irregular-irregular pairs(factor of 4-8 times), due to the disturbance of disk galaxies. futuredry-mergers, involving elliptical galaxies comprise less than 5% of all closekinematic pairs. in the closest pairs, there is a boost in the specificstar-formation rates of star-forming galaxies of a factor of 2-4, and there isalso evidence for an increased incidence of post star-burst galaxies. althoughsignificant for the galaxies involved, the "excess" star-formation associatedwith pairs represents only about 5% of the integrated star-formation activityin the parent sample. although most pair galaxies are in dense environments,the effects of interaction appear to be largest in the lower densityenvironments.

1201.1673	a journey from the outskirts to the cores of groups i: color- and  mass-segregation in 20k-zcosmos groups	using the group catalog obtained from zcosmos spectroscopic data and thecomplementary photometric data from the cosmos survey, we explore segregationeffects occurring in groups of galaxies at intermediate/high redshifts. webuilt two composite groups at intermediate (0.2 &lt;= z &lt;= 0.45) and high (0.45 &lt;z &lt;= 0.8) redshifts, and we divided the corresponding composite group galaxiesinto three samples according to their distance from the group center. weexplored how galaxy stellar masses and colors - working in narrow bins ofstellar masses - vary as a function of the galaxy distance from the groupcenter. we found that the most massive galaxies in our sample (log(m_gal/m_sun)&gt;= 10.6) do not display any strong group-centric dependence of the fractions ofred/blue objects. for galaxies of lower masses (9.8 &lt;= log(m_gal/m_sun) &lt;=10.6) there is a radial dependence in the changing mix of red and bluegalaxies. this dependence is most evident in poor groups, whereas richer groupsdo not display any obvious trend of the blue fraction. interestingly, masssegregation shows the opposite behavior: it is visible only in rich groups,while poorer groups have a a constant mix of galaxy stellar masses as afunction of radius. we suggest a simple scenario where color- andmass-segregation originate from different physical processes. while dynamicalfriction is the obvious cause for establishing mass segregation, bothstarvation and galaxy-galaxy collisions are plausible mechanisms to quench starformation in groups at a faster rate than in the field. in poorer groups theenvironmental effects are caught in action superimposed to secular galaxyevolution. their member galaxies display increasing blue fractions when movingfrom the group center to more external regions, presumably reflecting therecent accretion history of these groups.

1201.3609	improved constraints on the expansion rate of the universe up to z~1.1  from the spectroscopic evolution of cosmic chronometers	we present new improved constraints on the hubble parameter h(z) in theredshift range 0.15 &lt; z &lt; 1.1, obtained from the differential spectroscopicevolution of early-type galaxies as a function of redshift. we extract a largesample of early-type galaxies (\sim11000) from several spectroscopic surveys,spanning almost 8 billion years of cosmic lookback time (0.15 &lt; z &lt; 1.42). weselect the most massive, red elliptical galaxies, passively evolving andwithout signature of ongoing star formation. those galaxies can be used asstandard cosmic chronometers, as firstly proposed by jimenez &amp; loeb (2002),whose differential age evolution as a function of cosmic time directly probesh(z). we analyze the 4000 {\aa} break (d4000) as a function of redshift, usestellar population synthesis models to theoretically calibrate the dependenceof the differential age evolution on the differential d4000, and estimate thehubble parameter taking into account both statistical and systematical errors.we provide 8 new measurements of h(z) (see tab. 4), and determine its change inh(z) to a precision of 5-12% mapping homogeneously the redshift range up to z\sim 1.1; for the first time, we place a constraint on h(z) at z \neq 0 with aprecision comparable with the one achieved for the hubble constant (about 5-6%at z \sim 0.2), and covered a redshift range (0.5 &lt; z &lt; 0.8) which is crucialto distinguish many different quintessence cosmologies. these measurements havebeen tested to best match a \lambda cdm model, clearly providing astatistically robust indication that the universe is undergoing an acceleratedexpansion. this method shows the potentiality to open a new avenue in constraina variety of alternative cosmologies, especially when future surveys (e.g.euclid) will open the possibility to extend it up to z \sim 2.

1206.2642	bolometric luminosities and eddington ratios of x-ray selected active  galactic nuclei in the xmm-cosmos survey	bolometric luminosities and eddington ratios of both x-ray selectedbroad-line (type-1) and narrow-line (type-2) agn from the xmm-newton survey inthe cosmos field are presented. the sample is composed by 929 agn (382 type-1agn and 547 type-2 agn) and it covers a wide range of redshifts, x-rayluminosities and absorbing column densities. about 65% of the sources arespectroscopically identified as either type-1 or type-2 agn (83% and 52%respectively), while accurate photometric redshifts are available for the restof the sample. the study of such a large sample of x-ray selected agn with ahigh quality multi-wavelength coverage from the far-infrared (now with theinclusion of herschel data at 100 micron and 160 micron) to the optical-uvallows us to obtain accurate estimates of bolometric luminosities, bolometriccorrections and eddington ratios. the kbol-lbol relations derived in thepresent work are calibrated for the first time against a sizable agn sample,and rely on observed redshifts, x-ray luminosities and column densitydistributions. we find that kbol is significantly lower at high lbol withrespect to previous estimates by marconi et al. (2004) and hopkins et al.(2007). black hole masses and eddington ratios are available for 170 type-1agn, while black hole masses for type-2 agn are computed for 481 objects usingthe black hole mass-stellar mass relation and the morphological information. weconfirm a trend between kbol and lambda_edd, with lower hard x-ray bolometriccorrections at lower eddington ratios for both type-1 and type-2 agn. we findthat, on average, eddington ratio increases with redshift for all types of agnat any given mbh, while no clear evolution with redshift is seen at any givenlbol.

1206.5807	the zurich environmental study (zens) of galaxies in groups along the  cosmic web. i. which environment affects galaxy evolution?	the zurich environmental study (zens) is based on a sample of ~1500 galaxymembers of 141 groups in the mass range ~10^12.5-14.5 m_sun within the narrowredshift range 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.0585. zens adopts novel approaches, here described, toquantify four different galactic environments, namely: (1) the mass of the hostgroup halo; (2) the projected halo-centric distance; (3) the rank of galaxiesas central or satellites within their group halos; and (4) the filamentarylarge-scale structure (lss) density. no self-consistent identification of acentral galaxy is found in ~40% of &lt;10^13.5 m_sun groups, from which weestimate that ~15% of groups at these masses are dynamically unrelaxed systems.central galaxies in relaxed and unrelaxed groups have in general similarproperties, suggesting that centrals are regulated by their mass and not bytheir environment. centrals in relaxed groups have however ~30% larger sizesthan in unrelaxed groups, possibly due accretion of small satellites invirialized group halos. at m&gt;10^10 m_sun, satellite galaxies in relaxed andunrelaxed groups have similar size, color and (specific) star formation ratedistributions; at lower galaxy masses, satellites are marginally redder inrelaxed relative to unrelaxed groups, suggesting quenching of star formation inlow-mass satellites by physical processes active in relaxed halos. finally,relaxed and unrelated groups show similar stellar mass conversion efficiencies,peaking at halo masses around 10^12.5 m_sun. in the enclosed zens catalogue wepublish all environmental diagnostics as well as the galaxy structural andphotometric measurements described in companion zens papers ii and iii.

1206.6108	the zurich environmental study (zens) of galaxies in groups along the  cosmic web. ii. galaxy structural measurements and the concentration of  morphologically classified satellites in diverse environments	we present structural measurements for the galaxies in the 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.0585groups of the zurich environmental study, aimed at establishing how galaxyproperties depend on four environmental parameters: group halo mass m_group,group-centric distance r/r_200, ranking into central or satellite, andlarge-scale structure density delta_lss. global galaxy structure is quantifiedboth parametrically and non-parametrically. we correct all these measurementsfor observational biases due to psf blurring and surface brightness effects asa function of galaxy size, magnitude, steepness of light profile andellipticity. structural parameters are derived also for bulges, disks and bars.we use the galaxy bulge-to-total ratios (b/t), together with the calibratednon-parametric structural estimators, to implement a quantitative morphologicalclassification that maximizes purity in the resulting morphological samples. weinvestigate how the concentration c of satellite galaxies depends on galaxymass for each hubble type, and on m_group, r/r_200 and delta_lss. at galaxymasses m&gt;10^10 m_sun, the concentration of disk satellites increases withincreasing stellar mass, separately within each morphological bin of b/t. theknown increase in concentration with stellar mass for disk satellites is thusdue, at least in part, to an increase in galaxy central stellar density atconstant b/t. the correlation between concentration and galaxy stellar massbecomes progressively steeper for later morphological types. the concentrationof disk satellites shows a barely significant dependence on delta_lss orr/r_200. the strongest environmental effect is found with group mass form&gt;10^10 m_sun disk-dominated satellites, which are ~10% more concentrated inhigh mass groups than in lower mass groups.

1206.6496	the zurich environmental study of galaxies in groups along the cosmic  web. iii. galaxy photometric measurements and the spatially-resolved color  properties of early- and late-type satellites in diverse environments	we present photometric measurements for the galaxies - and when possibletheir bulges and disks - in the 0.05&lt;z&lt;0.0585 groups of the zurichenvironmental study (zens); these measurements include (b-i) colors, colorgradients and maps, color dispersions, as well as stellar masses andstar-formation rates. the zens galaxies are classified into quenched,moderately star-forming, and strongly star-forming using a combination ofspectral features and fuv-to-optical colors; this approach optimallydistinguishes quenched systems from dust-reddened star-forming galaxies. thelatter contribute up to 50% to the (b-i) "red sequence" at ~10^10msun. at fixedmorphological or spectral type, we find that galaxy stellar masses are largelyindependent of environment, and especially of halo mass. as a first utilizationof our photometric database, we study, at fixed stellar mass and hubble type,how (b-i) colors, color gradients and color dispersion of disk satellitesdepend on group mass (m_group), group-centric distance (r/r_200) andlarge-scale structure overdensity. the strongest environmental trend is foundfor disk-dominated satellites with m_group and r/r_200. at m&lt;10^10 msun,disk-dominated satellites are redder in the inner regions of the groups than inthe outer parts. at m&gt;10^10 msun, these satellites have shallower colorgradients in higher mass groups and in the cores of groups compared with lowermass groups and the outskirts of groups. stellar population analyses andsemi-analytic models suggest that disk-dominated satellites undergo quenchingof star formation in their outer disks, on timescales ~2 gyr, as theyprogressively move inside the group potential.

1210.0334	the cosmic evolution of oxygen and nitrogen abundances in star-forming  galaxies over the past 10 gyrs	the chemical evolution of galaxies on a cosmological timescale is still amatter of debate despite the increasing number of available data provided byspectroscopic surveys of star-forming galaxies at different redshifts. thefundamental relations involving metallicity, such as the mass-metallicityrelation (mzr) or the fundamental-metallicity relation, give controversialresults about the reality of evolution of the chemical content of galaxies at agiven stellar mass. in this work we shed some light on this issue using thecompleteness reached by the 20k bright sample of the zcosmos survey and usingfor the first time the nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio (n/o) as a tracer of the gasphase chemical evolution of galaxies that is independent of the star formationrate. emission-line galaxies both in the sdss and 20k zcosmos bright surveywere used to study the evolution from the local universe of the $mzr up to aredshift of 1.32 and the relation between stellar mass and nitrogen-to-oxygenratio (mnor) up to a redshift of 0.42 using the n2s2 parameter. all thephysical properties derived from stellar continuum and gas emission-lines,including stellar mass, star formation rates, metallicity and n/o, werecalculated in a self-consistent way over the full redshift range. we confirmthe trend to find lower metallicities in galaxies of a given stellar mass in ayounger universe. this trend is even observed when taking possible selectioneffects into account that are due to the observed larger median star formationrates for galaxies at higher redshifts. we also find a significant evolution ofthe mnor up to z = 0.4. taking the slope of the o/h vs. n/o relation intoaccount for the secondary-nitrogen production regime, the observed evolution ofthe mnor is consistent with the trends found for both the mzr and itsequivalent relation using new expressions to reduce its dependence on sfr.

1305.1308	spot the difference. impact of different selection criteria on observed  properties of passive galaxies in zcosmos 20-k sample	we present the analysis of photometric, spectroscopic, and morphologicalproperties for differently selected samples of passive galaxies up to z=1extracted from the zcosmos-20k spectroscopic survey. this analysis intends toexplore the dependence of galaxy properties on the selection criterion adopted,study the degree of contamination due to star-forming outliers, and provide acomparison between different commonly used selection criteria. we extractedfrom the zcosmos-20k catalog six different samples of passive galaxies, basedon morphology, optical colors, specific star-formation rate, a best fit to theobserved spectral energy distribution, and a criterion that combinesmorphological, spectroscopic, and photometric information. the morphologicalsample has the higher percentage of contamination in colors, specific starformation rate and presence of emission lines, while the red &amp; passive etgssample is the purest, with properties mostly compatible with no star formationactivity; however, it is also the less economic criterion in terms ofinformation used. the best performing among the other criteria are the red sedand the quiescent ones, providing a percentage of contamination only slightlyhigher than the red &amp; passive etgs criterion (on average of a factor of ~2) butwith absolute values of the properties of contaminants still compatible with ared, passively evolving population. we also provided two revised definitions ofearly type galaxies based on restframe color-color and color-mass criteria,that better reproduce the observed bimodalities. the analysis of the numberdensities shows evidences of mass-assembly downsizing, with galaxies at10.25&lt;log(m/msun)&lt;10.75 increasing their number by a factor ~2-4 from z=0.6 toz=0.2, by a factor ~2-3 from z=1 to z=0.2 at 10.75&lt;log(m/msun)&lt;11, and by only~10-50% from z=1 to z=0.2 at 11&lt;log(m/msun)&lt;11.5.

1305.3826	unveiling a population of galaxies harboring low-mass black holes with  x-rays	we report the discovery of three low-mass black hole candidates residing inthe centers of low-mass galaxies at z&lt;0.3 in the chandra deep field - southsurvey. these black holes are initially identified as candidate active galacticnuclei based on their x-ray emission in deep chandra observations.multi-wavelength observations are used to strengthen our claim that suchemission is powered by an accreting supermassive black hole. while the x-rayluminosities are low at l_x ~ 10^40 erg s^-1 (and variable in one case), weargue that they are unlikely to be attributed to star formation based onh\alpha or uv-fluxes. optical spectroscopy with keck/deimos and vlt/fors allowsus to (1) measure accurate redshifts, (2) confirm their low stellar host mass,(3) investigate the source(s) of photo-ionization, and (4) estimate extinction.with stellar masses of m* &lt; 3*10^9 m_\sun determined from hst/acs imaging, thehost galaxies are among the lowest mass systems known to host activelyaccreting black holes. we estimate bh masses m_bh ~ 2*10^5 m_\sun based onscaling relations between bh mass and host properties for more luminoussystems. in one case, a broad component of the h\alpha emission-line profile isdetected thus providing a virial mass estimate. black holes in such low-massgalaxies are of considerable interest as the low-redshift analogs to the seedsof the most massive bhs at high redshift which have remained largely elusive todate. our study highlights the power of deep x-ray surveys to uncover suchlow-mass systems.

1305.3917	a statistical relation between the x-ray spectral index and eddington  ratio of active galactic nuclei in deep surveys	we present an investigation into how well the properties of the accretionflow onto a supermassive black hole may be coupled to those of the overlyinghot corona. to do so, we specifically measure the characteristic spectralindex, gamma, of a power-law energy distribution, over an energy range of 2 to10 kev, for x-ray selected, broad-lined radio-quiet agn up to z~2 in cosmos ande-cdf-s. we test the previously reported dependence between gamma and blackhole mass, fwhm and eddington ratio using a sample of agn covering a broadrange in these parameters based on both the mg ii and h-alpha emission lineswith the later afforded by recent near infrared spectroscopic observationsusing subaru/fmos. we calculate the eddington ratios, lambda_edd, for sourceswhere a bolometric luminosity (l_bol) has been presented in the literature,based on sed fitting, or, for sources where these data do not exist, wecalculate l_bol using a bolometric correction to the lx, derived from arelationship between the bolometric correction, and lx/l3000. from a sample of69 x-ray bright sources (&gt;250 counts), where gamma can be measured withgreatest precision, with an estimate of l_bol, we find a statisticallysignificant correlation between gamma and lambda_edd, which is highlysignificant with a chance probability of 6.59x10^-8. a statisticallysignificant correlation between gamma and the fwhm of the optical lines isconfirmed, but at lower significance than with lambda_edd indicating thatlambda_edd is the key parameter driving conditions in the corona. linearregression analysis reveals that gamma=(0.32+/-0.05)log10lambda_edd+(2.27+/-0.06) andgamma=(-0.69+/-0.11)log10(fwhm/km/s)+(4.44+/-0.42). our results ongamma-lambda_edd are in very good agreement with previous results.

(2010), based on the x-ray to[nev] luminosity ratio, has been exploited to search for the more heavilyobscured agn. we found that [ne v]-selected narrow line agn have seyfert 2-likeoptical spectra, although with emission line ratios diluted by a star-formingcomponent. the acs morphologies and stellar component in the optical spectraindicate a preference for our type-2 agn to be hosted in early-spirals withstellar masses greater than 10^(9.5-10)msun, on average higher than those ofthe galaxy parent sample. the fraction of galaxies hosting [nev]-selectedobscured agn increases with the stellar mass, reaching a maximum of about 3% at2x10^11 msun. a comparison with other selection techniques at z~1 shows thatthe detection of the [ne v] line is an effective method to select agn in theoptical band, in particular the most heavily obscured ones, but can not provideby itself a complete census of agn2. finally, the high fraction of[nev]-selected type-2 agn not detected in medium-deep chandra observations(67%) is suggestive of the inclusion of compton-thick sources in our sample.the presence of a population of heavily obscured agn is corroborated by thex-ray to [nev] ratio; we estimated, by mean of x-ray stacking technique andsimulations, that the compton-thick fraction in our sample of type-2 agn is43+-4%, in good agreement with standard assumptions by the xrb synthesismodels.

1310.1922	the mean star-forming properties of qso host galaxies	quasi-stellar objects (qsos) occur in galaxies in which supermassive blackholes (smbhs) are growing substantially through rapid accretion of gas. manypopular models of the co-evolutionary growth of galaxies and smbhs predict thatqsos are also sites of substantial recent star formation, mediated by importantprocesses, such as major mergers, which rapidly transform the nature ofgalaxies. a detailed study of the star-forming properties of qsos is a criticaltest of such models. we present a far-infrared herschel/pacs study of the meanstar formation rate (sfr) of a sample of spectroscopically observed qsos to z~2from the cosmos extragalactic survey. this is the largest sample to date ofmoderately luminous agns studied using uniform, deep far-infrared photometry.we study trends of the mean sfr with redshift, black hole mass, nuclearbolometric luminosity and specific accretion rate (eddington ratio). tominimize systematics, we have undertaken a uniform determination of smbhproperties, as well as an analysis of important selection effects withinspectroscopic qso samples that influence the interpretation of sfr trends. wefind that the mean sfrs of these qsos are consistent with those of normalmassive star-forming galaxies with a fixed scaling between smbh and galaxy massat all redshifts. no strong enhancement in sfr is found even among the mostrapidly accreting systems, at odds with several co-evolutionary models.finally, we consider the qualitative effects on mean sfr trends from differentassumptions about the star-forming properties of qso hosts and redshiftevolution of the smbh-galaxy relationship. while limited currently byuncertainties, valuable constraints on agn-galaxy co-evolution can emerge fromour approach.

1310.3051	the x-ray zurich environmental study (x-zens). i. chandra and xmm-newton  observations of agns in galaxies in nearby groups	we describe x-ray observations with chandra and xmm-newton of 18 galaxygroups (m_group ~ 1-6x10^13 msolar, z~0.05) from the zurich environmental study(zens). we aim to establish the frequency and properties, unaffected by hostgalaxy dilution and obscuration, of agns in central and satellite galaxymembers, also as a function of halo-centric distance. x-ray point-sourcedetections are reported for 22 of 177 observed galaxies, down to a limit off_(0.5-8 kev) ~ 5x10^-15 erg cm^-2 s^-1, corresponding to a limiting luminosityof l_(0.5-8 kev)~3x10^40 erg s^-1. with the majority of the x-ray sourcesattributed to agns of low-to-moderate levels (l/l_edd&gt;~10^-4), we discuss thedetection rate in the context of the occupation of agns to halos of this massscale and redshift, and compare the structural/morphological properties betweenagn-active and non-active galaxies of different rank and location within thegroup halos. we see a slight tendency for agn hosts to have either relativelybrighter/denser disks (or relatively fainter/diffuse bulges) than non-activegalaxies of similar mass. at galaxy mass scales &lt;10^11 msolar, central galaxiesappear to be a factor ~4 more likely to host agns than satellite galaxies ofsimilar mass. this effect, coupled with the tendency for agns to reside inmassive galaxies, explains the (weak) trend for agns to be preferentially foundin the inner regions of groups, with no detectable trend with halo-centricdistance in the frequency of agns within the satellite population. finally, ourdata support other analyses in finding that the rate of decline with redshiftof agn activity in groups matches that of the global agn population, indicatingthat either agns occur preferentially in groups, or that the evolution rate isindependent of halo mass. these trends are of potential importance, and requirex-ray coverage of a larger sample to be solidly confirmed.

1310.4950	the fmos-cosmos survey of star-forming galaxies at z~1.6 ii. the  mass-metallicity relation and the dependence on star formation rate and dust  extinction	we investigate the relationships between stellar mass, gas-phase oxygenabundance (metallicity), star formation rate, and dust content of star-forminggalaxies at z$\sim$1.6 using subaru/fmos spectroscopy in the cosmos field. themass-metallicity relation at $z\sim1.6$ is steeper than the relation observedin the local universe. the steeper mz relation at $z\sim1.6$ is mainly due toevolution in the stellar mass where the mz relation begins to turnover andflatten. this turnover mass is 1.2 dex larger at $z\sim1.6$. the most massivegalaxies at $z\sim1.6$ ($\sim 10^{11}m_\odot$) are enriched to the levelobserved in massive galaxies in the local universe. the mass-metallicityrelation we measure at $z\sim1.6$ supports the suggestion of an empirical uppermetallicity limit that does not significantly evolve with redshift. we find ananti-correlation between metallicity and star formation rate for galaxies at afixed stellar mass at $z\sim1.6$ which is similar to trends observed in thelocal universe. we do not find a relation between stellar mass, metallicity andstar formation rate that is independent of redshift; our data suggest thatthere is redshift evolution in this relation. we examine the relation betweenstellar mass, metallicity and dust extinction. we find that at a fixed stellarmass dustier galaxies tend to be more metal rich. from examination of thestellar masses, metallicities, sfrs and dust extinctions we conclude thatstellar mass is most closely related to dust extinction.

1402.1172	zens iv. similar morphological changes associated with mass- and  environment-quenching, and the relative importance of bulge growth versus the  fading of disks	we use zens data at low redshift to study the dependence of the quenchedsatellite fraction and of the morphological mix of these quenched satellites,on three different environmental parameters: group halo mass, halo-centricdistance and large-scale structure over-density. the fraction of quenchedsatellites is independent of halo mass and the surrounding large-scaleoverdensity, but increases towards the centres of the haloes, as previouslyfound. the morphological mix is, however, constant with radial position,indicating that the well-known morphology-density relation results from theincreasing fraction of quenched galaxies towards the centres of haloes. theconstancy of the morphological outcome suggests that mass-quenching andsatellite quenching have the same effect on the morphologies of the galaxies.the quenched satellites have larger b/t and smaller half-light radii than thestar-forming satellites. these are mostly due to differences in the disks. thebulges in quenched satellites have very similar luminosities and surfacebrightness profiles, and any mass growth of the bulges associated withquenching cannot greatly change these quantities. the quenched disks arefainter and have smaller scale lengths than in star-forming satellites. thiscan be explained either by a differential fading of the disks or if disks weregenerally smaller in the past, both of which are expected in an inside-outgrowth of disks. at least at low redshifts, the structure of massive quenchedsatellites is produced by processes that operate before quenching takes place.a comparison with semi-analytic models argues for a reduction in the efficiencyof group halos in quenching their disk satellites and for mechanisms toincrease the b/t of low mass quenched satellites.

1406.2327	late-stage galaxy mergers in cosmos to z~1	the role of major mergers in galaxy and black hole formation is not wellconstrained. to help address this, we develop an automated method to identifylate-stage galaxy mergers before coalescence of the galactic cores. theresulting sample of mergers is distinct from those obtained using pair-findingand morphological indicators. our method relies on median-filtering ofhigh-resolution images in order to distinguish two concentrated galaxy nucleiat small separations. using mock images, we derive statistical contaminationand incompleteness corrections for the fraction of late-stage mergers. we applyour new method to a magnitude-limited (i &lt; 23) sample of 44,164 galaxies fromthe cosmos hst/acs catalog. using a mass-complete sample with $\log m_*/m_\odot&gt; 10.6$ and $0.25 &lt; z \leq 1.00$, we find ~5% of systems are late-stage mergerswith separations between 2.2 and 8 kpc. correcting for incompleteness andcontamination, the fractional merger rate increases strongly with redshift as$(1+z)^{3.8\pm0.9}$, in agreement with earlier studies and with dark matterhalo merger rates. separating the sample into star-forming and quiescentgalaxies shows that the merger rate for star-forming galaxies increasesstrongly redshift, $(1+z)^{4.5\pm1.3}$, while the merger rate for quiescentgalaxies is consistent with no evolution, $(1+z)^{1.1\pm1.2}$. limiting oursample to galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from zcosmos, we find that thestar formation rates and x-ray selected agn activity in likely late-stagemergers are enhanced by factors of ~2 relative to a control sample. combiningour sample with more widely separated pairs, we find that $8\pm5\%$ of starformation and $20\pm8\%$ of agn activity is triggered by close encounters (&lt;143kpc) or mergers, once more suggesting that major mergers are not the onlychannels for star formation and black hole growth.

1409.0447	the fmos-cosmos survey of star-forming galaxies at z~1.6 iii. survey  design, performance, and sample characteristics	we present a spectroscopic survey of galaxies in the cosmos field using thefiber multi-object spectrograph (fmos), a near-infrared instrument on thesubaru telescope. our survey is specifically designed to detect the halphaemission line that falls within the h-band (1.6-1.8 um) spectroscopic windowfrom star-forming galaxies with 1.4 &lt; z &lt; 1.7 and m_stellar&gt;~10^10 msolar. withthe high multiplex capability of fmos, it is now feasible to construct samplesof over one thousand galaxies having spectroscopic redshifts at epochs thatwere previously challenging. the high-resolution mode (r~2600) effectivelyseparates halpha and [nii]6585 thus enabling studies of the gas-phasemetallicity and photoionization state of the interstellar medium. the primaryaim of our program is to establish how star formation depends on stellar massand environment, both recognized as drivers of galaxy evolution at lowerredshifts. in addition to the main galaxy sample, our target selection placespriority on those detected in the far-infrared by herschel/pacs to assess thelevel of obscured star formation and investigate, in detail, outliers from thestar formation rate - stellar mass relation. galaxies with halpha detectionsare followed up with fmos observations at shorter wavelengths using the j-long(1.11-1.35 um) grating to detect hbeta and [oiii]5008 that provides anassessment of extinction required to measure star formation rates not hamperedby dust, and an indication of embedded active galactic nuclei. with 460redshifts measured from 1153 spectra, we assess the performance of theinstrument with respect to achieving our goals, discuss inherent biases in thesample, and detail the emission-line properties. our higher-level dataproducts, including catalogs and spectra, are available to the community.

0803.3620	tracing the mass-dependent star formation history of late-type galaxies  using x-ray emission: results from the chandra deep fields	we report on the x-ray evolution over the last ~9 gyr of cosmic history(i.e., since z = 1.4) of late-type galaxy populations in the chandra deepfield-north and extended chandra deep field-south (cdf-n and e-cdf-s,respectively; jointly cdfs) survey fields. our late-type galaxy sample consistsof 2568 galaxies, which were identified using rest-frame optical colors and hstmorphologies. we utilized x-ray stacking analyses to investigate the x-rayemission from these galaxies, emphasizing the contributions from normalgalaxies that are not dominated by active galactic nuclei (agns). over thisredshift range, we find significant increases (factors of ~5--10) in thex-ray--to--optical mean luminosity ratio (l_x/l_b) and thex-ray--to--stellar-mass mean ratio (l_x/m*) for galaxy populations selected byl_b and m*, respectively. when analyzing galaxy samples selected via sfr, wefind that the mean x-ray--to--sfr ratio (l_x/sfr) is consistent with beingconstant over the entire redshift range for galaxies with sfr = 1--100 msolyr^-1, thus demonstrating that x-ray emission can be used as a robust indicatorof star-formation activity out to z = 1.4. we find that the star-formationactivity (as traced by x-ray luminosity) per unit stellar mass in a givenredshift bin increases with decreasing stellar mass over the redshift range z =0.2--1, which is consistent with previous studies of how star-formationactivity depends on stellar mass. finally, we extend our x-ray analyses tolyman break galaxies at z ~ 3 and estimate that l_x/l_b at z ~ 3 is similar toits value at z = 1.4.

1409.8298	the zurich environmental study (zens) of galaxies in groups along the  cosmic web. v. properties and frequency of merging satellites and centrals in  different environments	we use the zurich environmental study (zens) database to investigate theenvironmental dependence of the merger fraction $\gamma$ and merging galaxyproperties in a sample of ~1300 group galaxies with $m&gt;10^{9.2}m_\odot$ and0.05&lt;z&lt;0.0585. in all galaxy mass bins investigated in our study, we find that$\gamma$ decreases by a factor of ~2-3 in groups with halo masses$m_{halo}&gt;10^{13.5} m_\odot$ relative to less massive systems, indicating asuppression of merger activity in large potential wells. in the fiducial caseof relaxed groups only, we measure a variation $\delta\gamma/\delta \log(m_{halo}) \sim - 0.07$ dex$^{-1}$, which is almost independent of galaxy massand merger stage. at galaxy masses $&gt;10^{10.2} m_\odot$, most mergers are dryaccretions of quenched satellites onto quenched centrals, leading to a strongincrease of $\gamma$ with decreasing group-centric distance at these massscales.both satellite and central galaxies in these high mass mergers do notdiffer in color and structural properties from a control sample of nonmerginggalaxies of equal mass and rank. at galaxy masses $&lt;10^{10.2} m_\odot$, wherewe mostly probe satellite-satellite pairs and mergers between star-formingsystems, close pairs (projected distance $&lt;10-20$ kpc) show instead$\sim2\times$ enhanced (specific) star formation rates and $\sim1.5\times$larger sizes than similar mass, nonmerging satellites. the increase in bothsize and sfr leads to similar surface star-formation densities in the mergingand control-sample satellite populations.

1410.4875	evolution of the specific star formation rate function at z&lt;1.4 -  dissecting the mass-sfr plane in cosmos and goods	the relation between the stellar mass and the star formation ratecharacterizes how the instantaneous star formation is determined by the galaxypast star formation history and by the growth of the dark matter structures. wedeconstruct the m-sfr plane by measuring the specific sfr functions in severalstellar mass bins from z=0.2 out to z=1.4. our analysis is primary based on amips 24$\mu m$ selected catalogue combining the cosmos and goods surveys. weestimate the sfr by combining mid- and far-infrared data for 20500 galaxies.the ssfr functions are derived in four stellar mass bins within the range9.5&lt;log(m/msun)&lt;11.5. first, we demonstrate the importance of taking intoaccount selection effects when studying the m-sfr relation. secondly, we find amass-dependent evolution of the median ssfr with redshift varying as $ssfr\propto (1+z)^{b}$, with $b$ increasing from $b=2.88$ to $b=3.78$ between$m=10^{9.75}msun$ and $m=10^{11.1}msun$, respectively. at low masses, thisevolution is consistent with the cosmological accretion rate and predictionsfrom semi-analytical models (sam). this agreement breaks down for more massivegalaxies showing the need for a more comprehensive description of thestar-formation history in massive galaxies. third, we obtain that the shape ofthe ssfr function is invariant with time at z&lt;1.4 but depends on the mass. weobserve a broadening of the ssfr function ranging from 0.28 dex at$m=10^{9.75}msun$ to 0.46 dex at $m=10^{11.1}msun$. such increase in thescatter of the m-sfr relation suggests an increasing diversity of sfhs as thestellar mass increases. finally, we find a gradual decline of the ssfr withmass as $log(ssfr) \propto -0.17m$. we discuss the numerous physical processes,as gas exhaustion in hot gas halos or secular evolution, which can graduallyreduce the ssfr and increase the sfh diversity.

1411.4208	blowin' in the wind: both `negative' and `positive' feedback in an  obscured high-z quasar	quasar feedback in the form of powerful outflows is invoked as a keymechanism to quench star formation in galaxies, preventing massive galaxies toover-grow and producing the red colors of ellipticals. on the other hand, somemodels are also requiring `positive' agn feedback, inducing star formation inthe host galaxy through enhanced gas pressure in the interstellar medium.however, finding observational evidence of the effects of both types offeedback is still one of the main challenges of extragalactic astronomy, as fewobservations of energetic and extended radiatively-driven winds are available.here we present sinfoni near infrared integral field spectroscopy of xid2028,an obscured, radio-quiet z=1.59 qso detected in the xmm-cosmos survey, in whichwe clearly resolve a fast (1500 km/s) and extended (up to 13 kpc from the blackhole) outflow in the [oiii] lines emitting gas, whose large velocity andoutflow rate are not sustainable by star formation only. the narrow componentof ha emission and the rest frame u band flux from hst-acs imaging enable tomap the current star formation in the host galaxy: both tracers independentlyshow that the outflow position lies in the center of an empty cavity surroundedby star forming regions on its edge. the outflow is therefore removing the gasfrom the host galaxy (`negative feedback'), but also triggering star formationby outflow induced pressure at the edges (`positive feedback'). xid2028represents the first example of a host galaxy showing both types of feedbacksimultaneously at work.

1505.03527	rest-frame optical emission lines in far-infrared selected galaxies at  z&lt;1.7 from the fmos-cosmos survey	we have used fmos on subaru to obtain near-infrared spectroscopy of 123far-infrared selected galaxies in cosmos and obtain the key rest-frame opticalemission lines. this is the largest sample of infrared galaxies withnear-infrared spectroscopy at these redshifts. the far-infrared selectionresults in a sample of galaxies that are massive systems that span a range ofmetallicities in comparison with previous optically selected surveys, and thushas a higher agn fraction and better samples the agn branch. we establish thepresence of agn and starbursts in this sample of (u)lirgs selected asherschel-pacs and spitzer-mips detections in two redshift bins (z~0.7 andz~1.5) and test the redshift dependence of diagnostics used to separate agnfrom star-formation dominated galaxies. in addition, we construct a lowredshift (z~0.1) comparison sample of infrared selected galaxies and find thatthe evolution from z~1.5 to today is consistent with an evolving agn selectionline and a range of ism conditions and metallicities from the models of kewleyet al. (2013b). we find that a large fraction of (u)lirgs are bpt-selected agnusing their new, redshift-dependent classification line. we compare theposition of known x-ray detected agn (67 in total) with the bpt selection andfind that the new classification line accurately selects most of these objects(&gt; 70%). furthermore, we identify 35 new (likely obscured) agn not selected assuch by their x-ray emission. our results have direct implications for agnselection at higher redshift with either current (mosfire, kmos) or future(pfs, moons) spectroscopic efforts with near-infrared spectral coverage.

1505.04977	a higher efficiency of converting gas to stars push galaxies at z ~ 1.6  well above the star-forming main sequence	local starbursts have a higher efficiency of converting gas into stars, ascompared to typical star-forming galaxies at a given stellar mass, possiblyindicative of different modes of star formation. with the peak epoch of galaxyformation occurring at z &gt; 1, it remains to be established whether such anefficient mode of star formation is occurring at high-redshift. to address thisissue, we measure the molecular gas content of seven high-redshift (z ~ 1.6)starburst galaxies with the atacama large (sub-)millimeter array andiram/plateau de bure interferometer. our targets are selected from the sampleof herschel far-infrared detected galaxies having star formation rates(~300-800 msolar/yr) elevated (&gt;4x) above the star-forming `main sequence', andincluded in the fmos-cosmos near-infrared spectroscopic survey of star-forminggalaxies at z ~ 1.6 with subaru. we detect co emission in all cases at highlevels of significance, indicative of high gas fractions (~30-50%). even morecompelling, we firmly establish with a clean and systematic selection thatstarbursts, identified as main-sequence outliers, at high redshift generallyhave a lower ratio of co to total infrared luminosity as compared to typicalmain-sequence star-forming galaxies, although with a smaller offset thanexpected based on past studies of local starbursts. we put forward a hypothesisthat there exists a continuous increase in star formation efficiency withelevation from the main sequence with galaxy mergers as a possible physicaldriver. along with a heightened star formation efficiency, our high-redshiftsample is similar in other respects to local starbursts such as being metalrich and having a higher ionization state of the interstellar medium.

0805.2615	the champ extended stellar survey (chess): photometric and spectroscopic  properties of serendipitously detected stellar x-ray sources	we present 348 x-ray emitting stars identified from correlating the extendedchandra multiwavelength project (champ), a serendipitous wide-area x-raysurvey, with the sloan digital sky survey (sdss). we use morphologicalstar/galaxy separation, an sdss quasar catalog, an optical color-magnitude cut,and x-ray data quality tests to create our catalog, the champ extended stellarsurvey (chess), from a sample of 2121 matched champ/sdss sources. our cutsretain 92% of the spectroscopically confirmed stars while excluding 99.6% ofthe 684 spectoscopically confirmed extragalactic sources. fewer than 3% of thesources in our final catalog are previously identified stellar x-ray emitters;we expect ~10% of the catalog is composed by giants, and identify seven giantstars and three cataclysmic variables. we derive distances, x-ray andbolometric luminosities for these stars, revealing that this catalog fills thegap between the nearby stars identified by the rosat all-sky survey and themore distant stars detected in deep chandra and xmm-newton surveys. for 36newly identified x-ray emitting m stars we calculate l_(halpha)/l_(bol).l_(h\alpha)/l_(bol) and l_(x)/l_(bol) are linearly related below l_(x)/l_(bol)~ 3 x 10^(-4), while l_(halpha)/l_(bol) appears to turn over at largerl_(x)/l_(bol) values. stars with reliable sdss photometry have an ~0.1 mag blueexcess in (u-g), likely due to increased chromospheric continuum emission.photometric metallicity estimates suggest the sample is split between the youngand old disk populations of the galaxy; the lowest activity sources belong tothe old disk population, a clear signature of the decay of magnetic activitywith age. future papers will present analyses of source variability andcomparisons of this catalog to models of stellar activity in the galactic disk.

1511.03734	the splash survey: quiescent galaxies are more strongly clustered but  are not necessarily located in high-density environments	we use the stellar-mass-selected catalog from the spitzer large area surveywith hyper-suprime-cam (splash) in the cosmos field to study the environmentsof galaxies via galaxy density and clustering analyses up to $z \sim 2.5$. theclustering strength of quiescent galaxies exceeds that of star-forminggalaxies, implying that quiescent galaxies are preferentially located in moremassive halos. when using local density measurement, we find a clear positivequiescent fraction--density relation at $z &lt; 1$, consistent with earlierresults. however, the quiescent fraction--density relation reverses its trendat intermediate redshifts ($1 &lt; z &lt; 1.5$) with marginal significance(&lt;1.8$\sigma$) and is found to be scale dependent (1.6$\sigma$). the lowerfraction of quiescent galaxies seen in large-scale dense environments, ifconfirmed to be true, may be associated with the fact that the star formationcan be more easily sustained via cold stream accretion in `large-scale'high-density regions, preventing galaxies from permanent quenching. finally, at$z &gt; 1.5$, the quiescent fraction depends little on the local density, eventhough clustering shows that quiescent galaxies are in more massive halos. weargue that at high redshift the typical halo size falls below $10^{13}$$m_{\odot}$, where intrinsically the local density measurements are so variedthat they do not trace the halo mass. our results thus suggest that in thehigh-redshift universe, halo mass may be the key in quenching the starformation in galaxies, rather than the conventionally measured galaxy density.

1512.00018	rest-uv absorption lines as metallicity estimator: the metal content of  star-forming galaxies at z~5	we measure a relation between the depth of four prominent rest-uv absorptioncomplexes and metallicity for local galaxies and verify it up to z~3. we thenapply this relation to a sample of 224 galaxies at 3.5 &lt; z &lt; 6.0 (&lt;z&gt; = 4.8) incosmos, for which unique uv spectra from deimos and accurate stellar massesfrom splash are available. the average galaxy population at z~5 and log(m/msun)&gt; 9 is characterized by 0.3-0.4 dex (in units of 12+log(o/h)) lowermetallicities than at z~2, but comparable to z~3.5. we find galaxies withweak/no ly-alpha emission to have metallicities comparable to z~2 galaxies andtherefore may represent an evolved sub-population of z~5 galaxies. we find acorrelation between metallicity and dust in good agreement with local galaxiesand an inverse trend between metallicity and star-formation rate (sfr)consistent with observations at z~2. the relation between stellar mass andmetallicity (mz relation) is similar to z~3.5, however, there are indicationsof it being slightly shallower, in particular for the young, ly-alpha emittinggalaxies. we show that, within a "bathtub" approach, a shallower mz relation isexpected in the case of a fast (exponential) build-up of stellar mass with ane-folding time of 100-200 myr. due to this fast evolution, the process of dustproduction and metal enrichment as a function of mass could be more stochasticin the first billion years of galaxy formation compared to later times.

1512.01105	the chandra cosmos legacy survey: optical/ir identifications	we present the catalog of optical and infrared counterparts of the chandracosmos-legacy survey, a 4.6 ms chandra program on the 2.2 square degrees of thecosmos field, combination of 56 new overlapping observations obtained in cycle14 with the previous c-cosmos survey. in this paper we report the i, k, and 3.6micron identifications of the 2273 x-ray point sources detected in the newcycle 14 observations. we use the likelihood ratio technique to derive theassociation of optical/infrared (ir) counterparts for 97% of the x-ray sources.we also update the information for the 1743 sources detected in c-cosmos, usingnew k and 3.6 micron information not available when the c-cosmos analysis wasperformed. the final catalog contains 4016 x-ray sources, 97% of which have anoptical/ir counterpart and a photometric redshift, while 54% of the sourceshave a spectroscopic redshift. the full catalog, including spectroscopic andphotometric redshifts and optical and x-ray properties described here indetail, is available online. we study several x-ray to optical (x/o)properties: with our large statistics we put better constraints on the x/o fluxratio locus, finding a shift towards faint optical magnitudes in both soft andhard x-ray band. we confirm the existence of a correlation between x/o and thethe 2-10 kev luminosity for type 2 sources. we extend to low luminosities theanalysis of the correlation between the fraction of obscured agn and the hardband luminosity, finding a different behavior between the optically and x-rayclassified obscured fraction.

astro-ph;0011027	extensive serendipitous x-ray coverage of a flare star with rosat	we report the serendipitous discovery of a flare star observed with the rosatx-ray observatory. from optical spectra, which show strong and variableemission lines of the hydrogen balmer series and neutral helium, we classifythis object as a m3.0ve star, and estimate a distance of 52 pc from publishedphotometry. due to the star's close proximity (13.6') to the calibration sourceand rs cvn binary ar lacertae, long term x-ray coverage is available in therosat archive (~50 hours spanning 6.5 years). two large flare events occurredearly in the mission (6-7/1990), and the end of a third flare was detected in6/1996. one flare, observed with the position sensitive proportional counter(pspc), had a peak luminosity lx=1.1x10^{30} erg/s, an e-folding rise time of2.2 hours and a decay time of 7 hours. this decay time is one of the longestdetected on a dme star, providing evidence for the possibility of additionalheating during the decay phase. a large hri flare (peak lx=2.9x10^{30} erg/s)is also studied. the "background" x-ray emission is also variable - evidencefor low-level flaring or microflaring. we find that &gt;=59% of the hri counts and&gt;=68% of the pspc counts are due to flares. at least 41% of the hri exposuretime and 47% of the pspc are affected by detectable flare enhancement.

astro-ph;0308492	chandra multi-wavelength project (champ). i. first x-ray source catalog	the chandra multi-wavelength project (champ) is a wide-area (~14 deg^2)survey of serendipitous chandra x-ray sources, aiming to establish fairstatistical samples covering a wide range of characteristics (such as absorbedagns, high z clusters of galaxies) at flux levels (fx ~ 10^-15 - 10^-14 ergsec-1 cm-2) intermediate between the chandra deep surveys and previousmissions. we present the first champ catalog, which consists of 991 nearon-axis, bright x-ray sources obtained from the initial sample of 62observations. the data have been uniformly reduced and analyzed with techniquesspecifically developed for the champ and then validated by visual examination.to assess source reliability and positional uncertainty, we perform a series ofsimulations and also use chandra data to complement the simulation study. thefalse source detection rate is found to be as good as or better than expectedfor a given limiting threshold. on the other hand, the chance of missing a realsource is rather complex, depending on the source counts, off-axis distance (orpsf), and background rate. the positional error (95% confidence level) isusually &lt; 1" for a bright source, regardless of its off-axis distance while itcan be as large as 4" for a weak source (~20 counts) at a large off-axisdistance (doff-axis &gt; 8'). we have also developed new methods to find spatiallyextended or temporary variable sources and those sources are listed in thecatalog.

astro-ph;0308493	chandra multi-wavelength project (champ). ii. first results of x-ray  source properties	we present the first results of champ x-ray source properties obtained fromthe initial sample of 62 observations. the data have been uniformly reduced andanalyzed with techniques specifically developed for the champ and thenvalidated by visual examination. utilizing only near on-axis, bright x-raysources (to avoid problems caused by incompleteness and the eddington bias), wederive the log(n)-log(s) relation in soft (0.5-2 kev) and hard (2-8 kev) energybands. the champ data are consistent with previous results of rosat, asca andchandra deep surveys. in particular, our data nicely fill in the flux gap inthe hard band between the chandra deep field data and the previous asca data.we check whether there is any systematic difference in the source densitybetween cluster and non-cluster fields and also search for field-to-fieldvariations, both of which have been previously reported. we found nosignificant field-to-field cosmic variation in either test within thestatistics (~1 sigma) across the flux levels included in our sample. in thex-ray color-color plot, most sources fall in the location characterized byphoton index = 1.5-2 and nh = a few x 10^20 cm^2, suggesting that they aretypical broad-line agns. there also exist a considerable number of sources withpeculiar x-ray colors (e.g., highly absorbed, very hard, very soft). we confirma trend that on average the x-ray color hardens as the count rate decreases.since the hardening is confined to the softest energy band (0.3-0.9 kev), weconclude it is most likely due to absorption. we cross-correlate the x-raysources with other catalogs and describe their properties in terms of opticalcolor, x-ray-to-optical luminosity ratio and x-ray colors.

astro-ph;0404409	ionization mechanisms in jet-dominated seyferts: a detailed case study	for the past 10 years there has been an active debate over whether fastshocks play an important role in ionizing emission line regions in seyfertgalaxies. to investigate this claim, we have studied the seyfert 2 galaxy mkn78, using hst uv/optical images and spectroscopy. since mkn 78 provides thearchetypal jet-driven bipolar velocity field, if shocks are important anywherethey should be important in this object. having mapped the emission line fluxesand velocity field, we first compare the ionization conditions to standardphotoionization and shock models. we find coherent variations of ionizationconsistent with photoionization model sequences which combine optically thickand thin gas, but are inconsistent with either autoionizing shock models orphotoionization models of just optically thick gas. furthermore, we findabsolutely no link between the ionization of the gas and its kinematic state,while we do find a simple decline of ionization degree with radius. we feelthis object provides the strongest case to date against the importance of shockrelated ionization in seyferts.

astro-ph;0506607	the extended chandra deep field-south survey. chandra point-source  catalogs	we present chandra point-source catalogs for the extended chandra deepfield-south (e-cdf-s) survey. the e-cdf-s consists of four contiguous 250 kschandra observations covering an approximately square region of total solidangle ~0.3 deg^2, which flank the existing ~1 ms chandra deep field-south(cdf-s). the survey reaches sensitivity limits of 1.1 x 10^-16 erg/cm^2/s and6.7 x 10^-16 erg/cm^2/s for the 0.5-2.0 kev and 2-8 kev bands, respectively. wedetect 762 distinct x-ray point sources within the e-cdf-s exposure; 589 ofthese sources are new (i.e., not previously detected in the ~1 ms cdf-s). thisbrings the total number of x-ray point sources detected in the e-cdf-s regionto 915 (via the e-cdf-s and ~1 ms cdf-s observations). source positions aredetermined using matched-filter and centroiding techniques; the medianpositional uncertainty is ~0.35". the basic x-ray and optical properties ofthese sources indicate a variety of source types, although absorbed activegalactic nuclei (agns) seem to dominate. in addition to our main chandracatalog, we constructed a supplementary source catalog containing 33 lowersignificance x-ray point sources that have bright optical counterparts (r&lt;23).these sources generally have x-ray-to-optical flux ratios expected for normaland starburst galaxies, which lack a strong agn component. we present basicnumber-count results for our main chandra catalog and find good agreement withthe ~1 ms cdf-s for sources with 0.5-2.0 kev and 2-8 kev fluxes greater than 3x 10^-16 erg/cm^2/s and 1 x 10^-15 erg/cm^2/s, respectively. furthermore, threeextended sources are detected in the 0.5-2.0 kev band, which are found to belikely associated with galaxy groups or poor clusters at z ~ 0.1-0.7; thesehave typical rest-frame 0.5-2.0 kev luminosities of (1-5) x 10^42 erg/s.

astro-ph;0512338	chandra multiwavelength project: normal galaxies at intermediate  redshift	(abridged) we have investigated 136 chandra extragalactic sources withoutbroad optical emission lines, including 93 galaxies with narrow emission lines(nelg) and 43 with only absorption lines (alg). based on fx/fo, lx, x-rayspectral hardness and optical emission line diagnostics, we have conservativelyclassified 36 normal galaxies (20 spirals and 16 ellipticals) and 71 agns. wefound no statistically significant evolution in lx/lb, within the limited zrange. we have built log(n)-log(s), after correcting for completeness based ona series of simulations. the best-fit slope is -1.5 for both s and b energybands, which is considerably steeper than that of the agn-dominated cosmicbackground sources, but slightly flatter than the previous estimate, indicatingnormal galaxies will not exceed the agn population until fx ~ 2 x 10-18 erg s-1cm-2 (a factor of ~5 lower than the previous estimate). a group of nelgs appearto be heavily obscured in x-rays, i.e., a typical type 2 agn. after correctingfor intrinsic absorption, their x-ray luminosities could be lx &gt; 10^44 erg s-1,making them type 2 quasar candidates. while most x-ray luminous algs (xbong -x-ray bright, optically normal galaxy candidates) do not appear to besignificantly absorbed, we found two heavily obscured objects, which could beas luminous as an unobscured broad-line quasar. among 43 algs, we found two e+agalaxy candidates with strong balmer absorption lines, but no [oii] line. thex-ray spectra of both galaxies are soft and one of them has a nearby closecompanion galaxy, supporting the merger/interaction scenario rather than thedusty starburst hypothesis.

0809.1058	a full year's chandra exposure on sdss quasars from the chandra  multiwavelength project	we study the spectral energy distributions and evolution of a large sample ofoptically selected quasars from the sloan digital sky survey (sdss) that wereobserved in 323 chandra images analyzed by the chandra multiwavelength project(champ). our highest-confidence matched sample includes 1135 x-ray detectedquasars in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;5.4, representing some 36msec of effectiveexposure. spectroscopic redshifts are available for about 1/3 of the detectedsample; elsewhere, redshifts are estimated photometrically. with 56 z&gt;3 qsosdetected, we find no evidence for evolution out to z~5 for either the x-rayphoton index gamma or for the ratio of optical/uv to x-ray flux alpha_ox. about10% of detected qsos are obscured (nh&gt;1e22), but the fraction might reach ~1/3if most non-detections are absorbed. we confirm a significant correlationbetween alpha_ox and optical luminosity, but it flattens or disappears forfainter agn alone. gamma hardens significantly both towards higher x-rayluminosity, and for relatively x-ray loud quasars. these trends may represent arelative increase in non-thermal x-ray emission, and our findings therebystrengthen analogies between galactic black hole binaries and agn.

astro-ph;0612360	the xmm-newton wide-field survey in the cosmos field: vi. statistical  properties of clusters of galaxies	we present the results of a search for galaxy clusters in the first 36xmm-newton pointings on the cosmos field. we reach a depth for a total clusterflux in the 0.5-2 kev band of 3x10-15 ergs cm-2 s-1, having one of the widestxmm-newton contiguous raster surveys, covering an area of 2.1 square degrees.cluster candidates are identified through a wavelet detection of extended x-rayemission. verification of the cluster candidates is done based on a galaxyconcentration analysis in redshift slices of thickness of 0.1-0.2 in redshift,using the multi-band photometric catalog of the cosmos field and restrictingthe search to z&lt;1.3 and i_ab &lt; 25. we identify 72 clusters and derive theirproperties based on the x-ray cluster scaling relations. a statisticaldescription of the survey in terms of the cumulative log(n&gt;s)-lg(s)distribution compares well with previous results, although yielding a somewhathigher number of clusters at similar fluxes. the x-ray luminosity function ofcosmos clusters matches well the results of nearby surveys, providing acomparably tight constraint on the faint end slope of alpha=1.93+/-0.04. forthe probed luminosity range of 8x10+42 - 2x10+44 ergs s-1, our survey is inagreement with and adds significantly to the existing data on the clusterluminosity function at high redshifts and implies no substantial evolution atthese luminosities to z=1.3.

astro-ph;9811121	spatial corrections of rosat hri observations	x-ray observations with the rosat high resolution imager (hri) often havespatial smearing on the order of 10 arcsec (morse 1994). this degradation ofthe intrinsic resolution of the instrument (5 arcsec) can be attributed toerrors in the aspect solution associated with the wobble of the space craft orwith the reacquisition of the guide stars. we have developed a set of iraf/prosand midas/exsas routines to minimize these effects. our procedure attempts toisolate aspect errors that are repeated through each cycle of the wobble. themethod assigns a 'wobble phase' to each event based on the 402 second period ofthe rosat wobble. the observation is grouped into a number of phase bins and acentroid is calculated for each sub-image. the corrected hri event list isreconstructed by adding the sub-images which have been shifted to a commonsource position. this method has shown approx. 30% reduction of the full widthhalf maximum (fwhm) of an x-ray observation of the radio galaxy 3c 120.additional examples are presented.

0810.2245	the zcosmos redshift survey: the three-dimensional classification cube  and bimodality in galaxy physical properties	aims. we investigate the relationships between three main optical galaxyobservables (spectral properties, colours, and morphology), exploiting the dataset provided by the cosmos/zcosmos survey. the purpose of this paper is todefine a simple galaxy classification cube, using a carefully selected sampleof around 1000 galaxies. methods. using medium resolution spectra of the first1k zcosmos-bright sample, optical photometry from the subaru/cosmosobservations, and morphological measurements derived from acs imaging, weanalyze the properties of the galaxy population out to z~1. applying threestraightforward classification schemes (spectral, photometric, andmorphological), we identify two main galaxy types, which appear to be linked tothe bimodality of galaxy population. the three parametric classificationsconstitute the axes of a "classification cube". results. a very good agreementexists between the classification from spectral data (quiescent/star-forminggalaxies) and that based on colours (red/blue galaxies). the third parameter(morphology) is less well correlated with the first two: in fact a goodcorrelation between the spectral classification and that based on morphologicalanalysis (early-/late-type galaxies) is achieved only after partiallycomplementing the morphological classification with additional colourinformation. finally, analyzing the 3d-distribution of all galaxies in thesample, we find that about 85% of the galaxies show a fully concordantclassification, being either quiescent, red, bulge-dominated galaxies (~20%) orstar-forming, blue, disk-dominated galaxies (~65%). these results imply thatthe galaxy bimodality is a consistent behaviour both in morphology, colour anddominant stellar population, at least out to z~1.

0810.3653	ongoing and co-evolving star formation in zcosmos galaxies hosting  active galactic nuclei	we present a study of the host galaxies of agn selected from the zcosmossurvey to establish if accretion onto supermassive black holes and starformation are explicitly linked up to z~1. we identify 152 galaxies that harboragn, based on xmm observations of 7543 galaxies (i&lt;22.5). star formation rates(sfrs), including those weighted by stellar mass, are determined using the[oii]3727 emission-line, corrected for an agn contribution. we find that themajority of agn hosts have significant levels of star formation with adistribution spanning ~1-100 msun yr^-1. the close association between agnactivity and star formation is further substantiated by an increase in the agnfraction with the youthfulness of their stars as indicated by the rest-framecolor (u-v) and spectral index dn(4000); we demonstrate that mass-selectionalleviates an artifical peak falling in the transition region when usingluminosity-limited samples. we also find that the sfrs of agn hosts evolve withcosmic time in a manner that closely mirrors the overall galaxy population andexplains the low sfrs in agns (z&lt;0.3) from the sdss. we conclude that theconditions most conducive for agn activity are a massive host galaxy and alarge reservoir of gas. furthermore, a direct correlation between massaccretion rate onto smbhs and sfr is shown to be weak although the averageratio is constant with redshift, effectively shifting the evidence for aco-evolution scenario in a statistical manner to smaller physical scales. ourfindings illustrate an intermittent scenario with an agn lifetime substantiallyshorter than that of star formation and underlying complexities regardingfueling over vastly different physical scales yet to be determined [abridged].

0811.1450	the xmm-newton serendipitous survey. vi. the x-ray luminosity function	we present the x-ray luminosity function of agn in three energy bands (soft:0.5-2 kev, hard: 2-10 kev and ultrahard: 4.5-7.5 kev). we have used the xmssurvey along with other highly complete flux-limited deeper and shallowersurveys for a total of 1009, 435 and 119 sources in the soft, hard andultrahard bands, respectively. we have modeled the intrinsic absorption of thehard and ultrahard sources (nh function) and computed the intrinsic x-rayluminosity function in all bands using a maximum likelihood fit technique to ananalytical model. we find that the x-ray luminosity function (xlf) is bestdescribed by a luminosity-dependent density evolution (ldde) model. our resultsshow a good overall agreement with previous results in the hard band, althoughwith slightly weaker evolution. our model in the soft band present slightdiscrepancies with other works in this band, the shape of our present day xlfbeing significantly flatter. we find faster evolution in the agn detected inthe ultrahard band than those in the hard band. the fraction of absorbed agn inthe hard and ultrahard bands is dependent on the x-ray luminosity. we findevidence of evolution of this fraction with redshift in the hard band but notin the ultrahard band, possibly due to the low statistics. our best-fit xlfshows that the high-luminosity agn are fully formed earlier than the lessluminous agn. the latter sources account for the vast majority of the accretionrate and mass density of the universe, according to an anti-hierarchical blackhole growth scenario.

0812.3402	the environments of active galactic nuclei within the zcosmos density  field	the impact of environment on agn activity up to z~1 is assessed by utilizinga mass-selected sample of galaxies from the 10k catalog of the zcosmosspectroscopic redshift survey. we identify 147 agn by their x-ray emission asdetected by xmm-newton from a parent sample of 7234 galaxies. we measure thefraction of galaxies with stellar mass m_*&gt;2.5x10^10 msun that host an agn as afunction of local overdensity using the 5th, 10th and 20th nearest neighborsthat cover a range of physical scales (~1-4 mpc). overall, we find that agnsprefer to reside in environments equivalent to massive galaxies withsubstantial levels of star formation. specifically, agns with host massesbetween 0.25-1x10^11 msun span the full range of environments (i.e.,field-to-group) exhibited by galaxies of the same mass and rest-frame color orspecific star formation rate. host galaxies having m_*&gt;10^11 msun clearlyillustrate the association with star formation since they are predominantlybluer than the underlying galaxy population and exhibit a preference for lowerdensity regions analogous to sdss studies of narrow-line agn. to probe theenvironment on smaller physical scales, we determine the fraction of galaxies(m_*&gt;2.5x10^10 msun) hosting agns inside optically-selected groups, and find nosignificant difference with field galaxies. we interpret our results asevidence that agn activity requires a sufficient fuel supply; the probabilityof a massive galaxy to have retained some sufficient amount of gas, as evidenceby its ongoing star formation, is higher in underdense regions where disruptiveprocesses (i.e., galaxy harrassment, tidal stripping) are lessened.
