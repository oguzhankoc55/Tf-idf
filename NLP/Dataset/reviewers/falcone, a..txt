0812.4780	jet breaks and energetics of swift grb x-ray afterglows	we present a systematic temporal and spectral study of all swift-xrtobservations of grb afterglows discovered between 2005 january and 2007december. after constructing and fitting all light curves and spectra topower-law models, we classify the components of each afterglow in terms of thecanonical x-ray afterglow and test them against the closure relations of theforward shock models for a variety of parameter combinations. the closurerelations are used to identify potential jet breaks with characteristicsincluding the uniform jet model with and without lateral spreading and energyinjection, and a power-law structured jet model, all with a range ofparameters. with this technique, we survey the x-ray afterglows with strongevidence for jet breaks (~12% of our sample), and reveal cases of potential jetbreaks that do not appear plainly from the light curve alone (another ~30%),leading to insight into the missing jet break problem. those x-ray light curvesthat do not show breaks or have breaks that are not consistent with one of thejet models are explored to place limits on the times of unseen jet breaks. thedistribution of jet break times ranges from a few hours to a few weeks with amedian of ~1 day, similar to what was found pre-swift. on average swift grbshave lower isotropic equivalent gamma-ray energies, which in turn results inlower collimation corrected gamma-ray energies than those of pre-swift grbs.finally, we explore the implications for grb jet geometry and energetics.

0905.3139	evidence for long-term gamma-ray and x-ray variability from the  unidentified tev source hess j0632+057	hess j0632+057 is one of only two unidentified very-high-energy gamma-raysources which appear to be point-like within experimental resolution. it ispossibly associated with the massive be star mwc 148 and has been suggested toresemble known tev binary systems like ls i +61 303 or ls 5039. hess j0632+057was observed by veritas for 31 hours in 2006, 2008 and 2009. during theseobservations, no significant signal in gamma rays with energies above 1 tev wasdetected from the direction of hess j0632+057. a flux upper limit correspondingto 1.1% of the flux of the crab nebula has been derived from the veritas data.the non-detection by veritas excludes with a probability of 99.993% that hessj0632+057 is a steady gamma-ray emitter. contemporaneous x-ray observationswith swift xrt reveal a factor of 1.8+-0.4 higher flux in the 1-10 kev rangethan earlier x-ray observations of hess j0632+057. the variability in thegamma-ray and x-ray fluxes supports interpretation of the ob ject as agamma-ray emitting binary.

0910.4381	correlated x-ray and very high energy emission in the gamma-ray binary  ls i +61 303	the discovery of very high energy (vhe) gamma-ray emitting x-ray binaries hastriggered an intense effort to better understand the particle acceleration,absorption, and emission mechanisms in compact binary systems, which providevariable conditions along eccentric orbits. despite this, the nature of some ofthese systems, and of the accelerated particles producing the vhe emission, isunclear. to answer some of these open questions, we conducted a multiwavelengthcampaign of the vhe gamma-ray emitting x-ray binary ls i +61 303 including themagic telescope, xmm-newton, and swift during 60% of an orbit in 2007september. we detect a simultaneous outburst at x-ray and vhe bands, with thepeak at phase 0.62 and a similar shape at both wavelengths. a linear fit to thesimultaneous x-ray/vhe pairs obtained during the outburst yields a correlationcoefficient of r=0.97, while a linear fit to all simultaneous pairs providesr=0.81. since a variable absorption of the vhe emission towards the observer isnot expected for the data reported here, the correlation found indicates asimultaneity in the emission processes. assuming that they are dominated by asingle particle population, either hadronic or leptonic, the x-ray/vhe fluxratio favors leptonic models. this fact, together with the detected photonindices, suggests that in ls i +61 303 the x-rays are the result of synchrotronradiation of the same electrons that produce vhe emission as a result ofinverse compton scattering of stellar photons.

1001.2590	discovery of variability in the very high energy gamma-ray emission of  1es 1218+304 with veritas	we present results from an intensive veritas monitoring campaign of thehigh-frequency peaked bl lac object 1es 1218+304 in 2008/2009. although 1es1218+304 was detected previously by magic and veritas at a persistent level of~6% of the crab nebula flux, the new veritas data reveal a prominent flarereaching ~20% of the crab. while very high energy (vhe) flares are quite commonin many nearby blazars, the case of 1es 1218+304 (redshift z = 0.182) isparticularly interesting since it belongs to a group of blazars that exhibitunusually hard vhe spectra considering their redshifts. when correcting themeasured spectra for absorption by the extragalactic background light, 1es1218+304 and a number of other blazars are found to have differential photonindices less than 1.5. the difficulty in modeling these hard spectral energydistributions in blazar jets has led to a range of theoretical gamma-rayemission scenarios, one of which is strongly constrained by these new veritasobservations. we consider the implications of the observed light curve of 1es1218+304, which shows day scale flux variations, for shock accelerationscenarios in relativistic jets, and in particular for the viability ofkiloparsec-scale jet emission scenarios.

1005.0041	the discovery of gamma-ray emission from the blazar rgb j0710+591	the high-frequency-peaked bl lacertae object rgb j0710+591 was observed inthe very high-energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) wave band by the veritas array ofatmospheric cherenkov telescopes. the observations, taken between 2008 decemberand 2009 march and totaling 22.1 hr, yield the discovery of vhe gamma rays fromthe source. rgb j0710+591 is detected at a statistical significance of 5.5standard deviations (5.5{\sigma}) above the background, corresponding to anintegral flux of (3.9 +/- 0.8) x 10-12 cm-2 s-1 (3% of the crab nebula's flux)above 300 gev. the observed spectrum can be fit by a power law from 0.31 to 4.6tev with a photon spectral index of 2.69 +/- 0.26stat +/- 0.20sys. these dataare complemented by contemporaneous multiwavelength data from the fermi largearea telescope, the swift x-ray telescope, the swift ultra-violet and opticaltelescope, and the michigan-dartmouth-mit observatory. modeling the broadbandspectral energy distribution (sed) with an equilibrium synchrotron self-comptonmodel yields a good statistical fit to the data. the addition of anexternal-compton component to the model does not improve the fit nor brings thesystem closer to equipartition. the combined fermi and veritas data constrainthe properties of the high-energy emission component of the source over 4orders of magnitude and give measurements of the rising and falling sections ofthe sed.

1006.5463	fermi large area telescope view of the core of the radio galaxy  centaurus a	we present gamma-ray observations with the lat on board the fermi gamma-raytelescope of the nearby radio galaxy centaurus~a. the previous egret detectionis confirmed, and the localization is improved using data from the first 10months of fermi science operation. in previous work, we presented the detectionof the lobes by the lat; in this work, we concentrate on the gamma-ray core ofcen~a. flux levels as seen by the lat are not significantly different from thatfound by egret, nor is the extremely soft lat spectrum($\g=2.67\pm0.10_{stat}\pm0.08_{sys}$ where the photon flux is $\phi\proptoe^{-\g}$). the lat core spectrum, extrapolated to higher energies, ismarginally consistent with the non-simultaneous hess spectrum of the source.the lat observations are complemented by simultaneous observations from suzaku,the swift burst alert telescope and x-ray telescope, and radio observationswith the tracking active galactic nuclei with austral milliarcsecondinterferometry (tanami) program, along with a variety of non-simultaneousarchival data from a variety of instruments and wavelengths to produce aspectral energy distribution (sed). we fit this broadband data set with asingle-zone synchrotron/synchrotron self-compton model, which describes theradio through gev emission well, but fails to account for the non-simultaneoushigher energy tev emission observed by hess from 2004-2008. the fit requires alow doppler factor, in contrast to bl lacs which generally require largervalues to fit their broadband seds. this indicates the $\g$-ray emissionoriginates from a slower region than that from bl lacs, consistent withprevious modeling results from cen~a. this slower region could be a slowermoving layer around a fast spine, or a slower region farther out from the blackhole in a decelerating flow.

1012.2200	spectral energy distribution of markarian 501: quiescent state vs.  extreme outburst	the very high energy (vhe; e &gt; 100 gev) blazar markarian 501 has awell-studied history of extreme spectral variability and is an excellentlaboratory for studying the physical processes within the jets of activegalactic nuclei. however, there are few detailed multiwavelength studies ofmarkarian 501 during its quiescent state, due to its low luminosity. ashort-term multiwavelength study of markarian 501 was coordinated in march2009, focusing around a multi-day observation with the suzaku x-ray satelliteand including {\gamma}-ray data from veritas, magic, and the fermi gamma-rayspace telescope with the goal of providing a well-sampled multiwavelengthbaseline measurement of markarian 501 in the quiescent state. the results ofthese quiescent-state observations are compared to the historically extremeoutburst of april 16, 1997, with the goal of examining variability of thespectral energy distribution between the two states. the derived broadbandspectral energy distribution shows the characteristic double-peaked profile. wefind that the x-ray peak shifts by over two orders of magnitude in photonenergy between the two flux states while the vhe peak varies little. thelimited shift in the vhe peak can be explained by the transition to theklein-nishina regime. synchrotron self-compton models are matched to the dataand the implied klein-nishina effects are explored.

1105.0449	veritas observations of the tev binary ls i +61 303 during 2008-2010	we present the results of observations of the tev binary ls i +61 303 withthe veritas telescope array between 2008 and 2010, at energies above 300 gev.in the past, both ground-based gamma-ray telescopes veritas and magic havereported detections of tev emission near the apastron phases of the binaryorbit. the observations presented here show no strong evidence for tev emissionduring these orbital phases; however, during observations taken in late 2010,significant emission was detected from the source close to the phase ofsuperior conjunction (much closer to periastron passage) at a 5.6 standarddeviation (5.6 sigma) post-trials significance. in total, between october 2008and december 2010 a total exposure of 64.5 hours was accumulated with veritason ls i +61 303, resulting in an excess at the 3.3 sigma significance level forconstant emission over the entire integrated dataset. the flux upper limitsderived for emission during the previously reliably active tev phases (i.e.close to apastron) are less than 5% of the crab nebula flux in the same energyrange. this result stands in apparent contrast to previous observations by bothmagic and veritas which detected the source during these phases at &gt;10% of thecrab nebula flux. during the two year span of observations, a large amount ofx-ray data were also accrued on ls i +61 303 by the swift x-ray telescope (xrt)and the rossi x-ray timing explorer timing (rxte) proportional counter array(pca). we find no evidence for a correlation between emission in the x-ray andtev regimes during 20 directly overlapping observations. we also comment ondata obtained contemporaneously by the fermi large area telescope (lat).

1208.0676	constraints on cosmic rays, magnetic fields, and dark matter from  gamma-ray observations of the coma cluster of galaxies with veritas and fermi	observations of radio halos and relics in galaxy clusters indicate efficientelectron acceleration. protons should likewise be accelerated, suggesting thatclusters may also be sources of very high-energy (vhe; e&gt;100 gev) gamma-rayemission. we report here on vhe gamma-ray observations of the coma galaxycluster with the veritas array of imaging cherenkov telescopes, withcomplementing fermi-lat observations at gev energies. no significant gamma-rayemission from the coma cluster was detected. integral flux upper limits at the99% confidence level were measured to be on the order of (2-5)*10^-8\ ph. m^-2s^-1 (veritas, &gt;220 gev} and ~2*10^-6 ph. m^-2 s^-1 (fermi, 1-3 gev),respectively. we use the gamma-ray upper limits to constrain crs and magneticfields in coma. using an analytical approach, the cr-to-thermal pressure ratiois constrained to be &lt; 16% from veritas data and &lt; 1.7% from fermi data(averaged within the virial radius). these upper limits are starting toconstrain the cr physics in self-consistent cosmological cluster simulationsand cap the maximum cr acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks tobe &lt;50%. assuming that the radio-emitting electrons of the coma halo resultfrom hadronic cr interactions, the observations imply a lower limit on thecentral magnetic field in coma of (2 - 5.5) mug, depending on the radialmagnetic-field profile and on the gamma-ray spectral index. since these valuesare below those inferred by faraday rotation measurements in coma (for most ofthe parameter space), this {renders} the hadronic model a very plausibleexplanation of the coma radio halo. finally, since galaxy clusters aredark-matter (dm) dominated, the veritas upper limits have been used to placeconstraints on the thermally-averaged product of the total self-annihilationcross section and the relative velocity of the dm particles, &lt;\sigma v&gt;.

1209.5867	radio-to-gamma-ray monitoring of the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy pmn  j0948+0022 from 2008 to 2011	we present more than three years of observations at different frequencies,from radio to high-energy gamma-rays, of the narrow-line seyfert 1 (nls1)galaxy pmn j0948+0022 (z=0.585). this source is the first nls1 detected atenergies above 100 mev and therefore can be considered the prototype of thisemerging new class of gamma-ray emitting active galactic nuclei (agn). theobservations performed from 2008 august 1 to 2011 december 31 confirmed thatpmn j0948+0022 generates a powerful relativistic jet, able to develop anisotropic luminosity at gamma-rays of the order of 10^48 erg s^-1, at the levelof powerful quasars. the evolution of the radiation emission of this source in2009 and 2010 followed the canonical expectations of relativistic jets, withcorrelated multiwavelength variability (gamma-rays followed by radio emissionafter a few months), but it was difficult to retrieve a similar pattern in thelight curves of 2011. the comparison of gamma-ray spectra before and including2011 data suggested that there was a softening of the high-energy spectralslope. we selected five specific epochs to be studied by modelling thebroad-band spectrum, characterised by an outburst at gamma-rays or verylow/high flux at other wavelengths. the observed variability can largely beexplained either by changes in the injected power, the bulk lorentz factor ofthe jet or the electron spectrum. the characteristic time scale ofdoubling/halving flux ranges from a few days to a few months, depending on thefrequency and the sampling rate. the shortest doubling time scale at gamma-raysis 2.3+-0.5 days. these small values underline the need of highly-sampledmultiwavelength campaigns to better understand the physics of these sources.

1211.3073	rapid tev gamma-ray flaring of bl lacertae	we report on the detection of a very rapid tev gamma-ray flare from bllacertae on 2011 june 28 with the very energetic radiation imaging telescopearray system (veritas). the flaring activity was observed during a 34.6-minuteexposure, when the integral flux above 200 gev reached $(3.4\pm0.6) \times10^{-6} \;\text{photons}\;\text{m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}$, roughly 125% of the crabnebula flux measured by veritas. the light curve indicates that theobservations missed the rising phase of the flare but covered a significantportion of the decaying phase. the exponential decay time was determined to be$13\pm4$ minutes, making it one of the most rapid gamma-ray flares seen from atev blazar. the gamma-ray spectrum of bl lacertae during the flare was soft,with a photon index of $3.6\pm 0.4$, which is in agreement with the measurementmade previously by magic in a lower flaring state. contemporaneous radioobservations of the source with the very long baseline array (vlba) revealedthe emergence of a new, superluminal component from the core around the time ofthe tev gamma-ray flare, accompanied by changes in the optical polarizationangle. changes in flux also appear to have occurred at optical, uv, and gevgamma-ray wavelengths at the time of the flare, although they are difficult toquantify precisely due to sparse coverage. a strong flare was seen at radiowavelengths roughly four months later, which might be related to the gamma-rayflaring activities. we discuss the implications of these multiwavelengthresults.

1212.4739	discovery of tev gamma-ray emission from cta 1 by veritas	we report the discovery of tev gamma-ray emission coincident with theshell-type radio supernova remnant (snr) cta 1 using the veritas gamma-rayobservatory. the source, ver j0006+729, was detected as a 6.5 standarddeviation excess over background and shows an extended morphology, approximatedby a two-dimensional gaussian of semi-major (semi-minor) axis 0.30 degree (0.24degree) and a centroid 5' from the fermi gamma-ray pulsar psr j0007+7303 andits x-ray pulsar wind nebula (pwn). the photon spectrum is well described by apower-law dn/de = n_0 (e/3 tev)^(-\gamma), with a differential spectral indexof \gamma = 2.2 +- 0.2_stat +- 0.3_sys, and normalization n_0 = (9.1 +-1.3_stat +- 1.7_sys) x 10^(-14) cm^(-2) s^(-1) tev^(-1). the integral flux,f_\gamma = 4.0 x 10^(-12) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1) above 1 tev, corresponds to 0.2%of the pulsar spin-down power at 1.4 kpc. the energetics, co-location with thesnr, and the relatively small extent of the tev emission strongly argue for thepwn origin of the tev photons. we consider the origin of the tev emission incta 1.

1304.8018	the blazar emission environment: insight from soft x-ray absorption	collecting experimental insight into the relativistic particle populationsand emission mechanisms at work within tev-emitting blazar jets, which arespatially unresolvable in most bands and have strong beaming factors, is adaunting task. new observational information has the potential to lead to majorstrides in understanding the acceleration site parameters. detection ofmolecular carbon monoxide (co) in tev emitting blazars, however, implies theexistence of intrinsic gas, a connection often found in photo-dissociatedregion models and numerical simulations. the existence of intrinsic gas withina blazar could provide a target photon field for compton up-scattering ofphotons to tev energies by relativistic particles. we investigate the possibleexistence of intrinsic gas within the three tev emitting blazars rgb j0710+591,w comae and 1es 1959+650 which have measurements or upper limits on molecularco line luminosity using an independent technique which is based on thespectral analysis of soft x-rays. evidence for x-ray absorption by additionalgas beyond that measured within the milky way is searched for in swift x-raytelescope (xrt) data between 0.3 and 10 kev. without complementary informationfrom another measurement, additional absorption could be misinterpreted as anintrinsically curved x-ray spectrum since both models can frequently fit thesoft x-ray data. after breaking this degeneracy, we do not find evidence forintrinsically curved spectra for any of the three blazars. moreover, noevidence for intrinsic gas is evident for rgb j0710+591 and w comae, while the1es 1959+650 xrt data support the existence of intrinsic gas with a columndensity of $\sim1\times10^{21}$cm$^{-2}$.

1410.6391	multiwavelength observations of mrk 501 in 2008	mrk 501 is one of the brightest blazars at tev energies and has beenextensively studied since its first vhe detection in 1996. our goal is tocharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with theradio-to-x-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is lessoften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. we organized amultiwavelength (mw) campaign on mrk 501 between march and may 2008. thismulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive vhe gamma-ray instrumentsin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopesmagic and veritas, as well as swift, rxte, the f-gamma, gasp-webt, and othercollaborations and instruments. mrk 501 was found to be in a low state ofactivity during the campaign, with a vhe flux in the range of 10%-20% of thecrab nebula flux. nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected withvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. thebroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission statesof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zonesynchrotron self-compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described byan increase in the electron number density. this agrees with previous studiesof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.we report for the first time a tentative x-ray-to-vhe correlation during a lowvhe activity. although marginally significant, this positive correlationbetween x-ray and vhe, which has been reported many times during flaringactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the x-ray/vhe emissionduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that areresponsible for the emission during flaring activity.

1410.7144	the most powerful flaring activity from the nlsy1 pmn j0948+0022	we report on multifrequency observations performed during 2012 december-2013august of the first narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy detected in gamma rays, pmnj0948+0022 ($z$ = 0.5846). a gamma-ray flare was observed by the large areatelescope on board fermi during 2012 december-2013 january, reaching a dailypeak flux in the 0.1-100 gev energy range of (155 $\pm$ 31) $\times$10$^{-8}$ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ on 2013 january 1, corresponding to an apparent isotropicluminosity of about 1.5$\times$10$^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$. the gamma-ray flaringperiod triggered swift and veritas observations in addition to radio andoptical monitoring by ovro, mojave, and crts. a strong flare was observed inoptical, uv, and x-rays on 2012 december 30, quasi-simultaneously to thegamma-ray flare, reaching a record flux for this source from optical to gammarays. veritas observations at very high energy (e &gt; 100 gev) during 2013january 6-17 resulted in an upper limit of f (&gt; 0.2 tev) &lt;4.0$\times$10$^{-12}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. we compared the spectral energydistribution (sed) of the flaring state in 2013 january with that of anintermediate state observed in 2011. the two seds, modelled as synchrotronemission and an external compton scattering of seed photons from a dust torus,can be modelled by changing both the electron distribution parameters and themagnetic field.

1412.1031	investigating broadband variability of the tev blazar 1es 1959+650	we summarize broadband observations of the tev-emitting blazar 1es 1959+650,including optical r-band observations by the robotic telescopes super-lotis anditelescope, uv observations by swift uvot, x-ray observations by the swiftx-ray telescope (xrt), high-energy gamma-ray observations with the fermi largearea telescope (lat) and very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray observations byveritas above 315 gev, all taken between 17 april 2012 and 1 june 2012 (mjd56034 and 56079). the contemporaneous variability of the broadband spectralenergy distribution is explored in the context of a simple synchrotron selfcompton (ssc) model. in the ssc emission scenario, we find that the parametersrequired to represent the high state are significantly different than those inthe low state. motivated by possible evidence of gas in the vicinity of theblazar, we also investigate a reflected-emission model to describe the observedvariability pattern. this model assumes that the non-thermal emission from thejet is reflected by a nearby cloud of gas, allowing the reflected emission tore-enter the blob and produce an elevated gamma-ray state with no simultaneouselevated synchrotron flux. the model applied here, although not required toexplain the observed variability pattern, represents one possible scenariowhich can describe the observations. as applied to an elevated vhe state of 66%of the crab nebula flux, observed on a single night during the observationperiod, the reflected-emission scenario does not support a purely leptonicnon-thermal emission mechanism. the reflected emission model does, however,predict a reflected photon field with sufficient energy to enable elevatedgamma-ray emission via pion production with protons of energies between 10 and100 tev.

1412.3576	unprecedented study of the broadband emission of mrk 421 during flaring  activity in march 2010	a flare from the tev blazar mrk 421, occurring in march 2010, was observedfor 13 consecutive days from radio to very high energy (vhe, e &gt; 100 gev)gamma-rays with magic, veritas, whipple, fermilat, maxi, rxte, swift,gasp-webt, and several optical and radio telescopes. we model the day-scaleseds with one-zone and two-zone synchrotron self-compton (ssc) models,investigate the physical parameters, and evaluate whether the observedbroadband sed variability can be associated to variations in the relativisticparticle population.  flux variability was remarkable in the x-ray and vhe bands while it was minoror not significant in the other bands. the one-zone ssc model can describereasonably well the sed of each day for the 13 consecutive days. this flaringactivity is also very well described by a two-zone ssc model, where one zone isresponsible for the quiescent emission while the other smaller zone, which isspatially separated from the first one, contributes to the daily-variableemission occurring in x-rays and vhe gamma-rays.  both the one-zone ssc and the two-zone ssc models can describe the daily sedsvia the variation of only four or five model parameters, under the hypothesisthat the variability is associated mostly to the underlying particlepopulation. this shows that the particle acceleration and cooling mechanismproducing the radiating particles could be the main one responsible for thebroadband sed variations during the flaring episodes in blazars. the two-zonessc model provides a better agreement to the observed sed at the narrow peaksof the low- and high-energy bumps during the highest activity, although thereported one-zone ssc model could be further improved by the variation of theparameters related to the emitting region itself ($\delta$, $b$ and $r$), inaddition to the parameters related to the particle population.

1502.02650	the 2009 multiwavelength campaign on mrk 421: variability and  correlation studies	we performed a 4.5-month multi-instrument campaign (from radio to vhe gammarays) on mrk421 between january 2009 and june 2009, which included vlba,f-gamma, gasp-webt, swift, rxte, fermi-lat, magic, and whipple, among otherinstruments and collaborations. mrk421 was found in its typical (non-flaring)activity state, with a vhe flux of about half that of the crab nebula, yet thelight curves show significant variability at all wavelengths, the highestvariability being in the x-rays. we determined the power spectral densities(psd) at most wavelengths and found that all psds can be described bypower-laws without a break, and with indices consistent with pink/red-noisebehavior. we observed a harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra andmeasured a positive correlation between vhe and x-ray fluxes with zero timelag. such characteristics have been reported many times during flaringactivity, but here they are reported for the first time in the non-flaringstate. we also observed an overall anti-correlation between optical/uv andx-rays extending over the duration of the campaign.  the harder-when-brighter behavior in the x-ray spectra and the measuredpositive x-ray/vhe correlation during the 2009 multi-wavelength campaignsuggests that the physical processes dominating the emission during non-flaringstates have similarities with those occurring during flaring activity. inparticular, this observation supports leptonic scenarios as being responsiblefor the emission of mrk421 during non-flaring activity. such a temporallyextended x-ray/vhe correlation is not driven by any single flaring event, andhence is difficult to explain within the standard hadronic scenarios. thehighest variability is observed in the x-ray band, which, within the one-zonesynchrotron self-compton scenario, indicates that the electron energydistribution is most variable at the highest energies.

0805.1557	grb 080319b: a naked-eye stellar blast from the distant universe	long duration gamma-ray bursts (grbs) release copious amounts of energyacross the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and so provide a window into theprocess of black hole formation from the collapse of a massive star. over thelast forty years, our understanding of the grb phenomenon has progresseddramatically; nevertheless, fortuitous circumstances occasionally arise thatprovide access to a regime not yet probed. grb 080319b presented such anopportunity, with extraordinarily bright prompt optical emission that peaked ata visual magnitude of 5.3, making it briefly visible with the naked eye. it wascaptured in exquisite detail by wide-field telescopes, imaging the burstlocation from before the time of the explosion. the combination of these uniqueoptical data with simultaneous gamma-ray observations provides powerfuldiagnostics of the detailed physics of this explosion within seconds of itsformation. here we show that the prompt optical and gamma-ray emissions fromthis event likely arise from different spectral components within the samephysical region located at a large distance from the source, implying anextremely relativistic outflow. the chromatic behaviour of the broadbandafterglow is consistent with viewing the grb down the very narrow inner core ofa two-component jet that is expanding into a wind-like environment consistentwith the massive star origin of long grbs. these circumstances can explain theextreme properties of this grb.

1506.06246	veritas detection of $\gamma$-ray flaring activity from the bl lac  object 1es 1727+502 during bright moonlight observations	during moonlit nights, observations with ground-based cherenkov telescopes atvery high energies (vhe, $e&gt;100$ gev) are constrained since the photomultipliertubes (pmts) in the telescope camera are extremely sensitive to the backgroundmoonlight. observations with the veritas telescopes in the standardconfiguration are performed only with a moon illumination less than 35$\%$ offull moon. since 2012, the veritas collaboration has implemented a newobserving mode under bright moonlight, by either reducing the voltage appliedto the pmts (reduced-high-voltage configuration, rhv), or by utilizinguv-transparent filters. while these operating modes result in lower sensitivityand increased energy thresholds, the extension of the available observing timeis useful for monitoring variable sources such as blazars and sources requiringspectral measurements at the highest energies. in this paper we report thedetection of $\gamma$-ray flaring activity from the bl lac object 1es 1727+502during rhv observations. this detection represents the first evidence of vhevariability from this blazar. the integral flux is$(1.1\pm0.2)\times10^{-11}\mathrm{cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$ above 250 gev, which is aboutfive times higher than the low-flux state. the detection triggered additional\veritas\ observations during standard dark-time. multiwavelength observationswith the flwo 48" telescope, and the swift and fermi satellites are presentedand used to produce the first spectral energy distribution (sed) of this objectduring $\gamma$-ray flaring activity. the sed is then fitted with a standardsynchrotron-self-compton model, placing constraints on the properties of theemitting region and of the acceleration mechanism at the origin of therelativistic particle population in the jet.

1512.02235	multiwavelength study of quiescent states of mrk 421 with unprecedented  hard x-ray coverage provided by nustar in 2013	we present coordinated multiwavelength observations of the bright, nearby bllac object mrk 421 taken in 2013 january-march, involving gasp-webt, swift,nustar, fermi-lat, magic, veritas, and other collaborations and instruments,providing data from radio to very-high-energy (vhe) gamma-ray bands. nustaryielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 3-79 kev range, revealingthat the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the x-ray spectralshape saturates into a steep power law with a photon index of approximately 3,with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up toabout 80 kev. for the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and theinverse-compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (sed) simultaneouslyshifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order ofmagnitude. the fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows adouble-bump structure which relates to the two bumps of the broadband sed. ineach bump, the variability increases with energy which, in the framework of thesynchrotron self-compton model, implies that the electrons with higher energiesare more variable. the measured multi-band variability, the significantx-ray-to-vhe correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed inboth bands, the lack of correlation between optical/uv and x-ray flux, the lowdegree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the shortestimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer variabilitytimescale observed in the nustar light curves point toward in-situ electronacceleration, and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributingto the broadband emission of mrk 421 during low-activity states.

astro-ph;0601125	the early x-ray emission from grbs	we present observations of the early x-ray emission for a sample of 40gamma-ray bursts (grbs) obtained using the swift satellite for which thenarrow-field instruments were pointed at the burst within 10 minutes of thetrigger. using data from the burst alert and x-ray telescopes, we show that thex-ray light curve can be well described by an exponential that relaxes into apower law, often with flares superimposed. the transition time between theexponential and the power law provides a physically defined timescale for theburst duration. in most bursts the power law breaks to a shallower decay withinthe first hour, and a late emission "hump" is observed which can last for manyhours. in other grbs the hump is weak or absent. the observed variety in theshape of the early x-ray light curve can be explained as a combination of threecomponents: prompt emission from the central engine; afterglow; and the latehump. in this scenario, afterglow emission begins during or soon after theburst and the observed shape of the x-ray light curve depends on the relativestrengths of the emission due to the central engine and that of the afterglow.there is a strong correlation such that those grbs with stronger afterglowcomponents have brighter early optical emission. the late emission hump canhave a total fluence equivalent to that of the prompt phase. grbs with thestrongest late humps have weak or no x-ray flares.

astro-ph;0602142	testing the curvature effect and internal origin of gamma-ray burst  prompt emissions and x-ray flares with swift data	the x-ray light curves of many gamma-ray bursts (grbs) observed by the swiftx-ray telescope (xrt) have a very steep-decay component (tail) following theprompt gamma-rays in the early phase and have some erratic flares occurring ata time from ~10^2 up to ~10^5 seconds. based on the assumption that these tailsand flares are of internal shock origin and that their decline behaviors aredominated by the curvature effect of the fireball, we present aself-consistency test for this scenario with a sample of 36prompt-emission-tails/flare-tails in 22 grb xrt light curves. our results showthat the t0 of the prompt emission tails and the tails of well-separated flaresare usually at the rising segment of the last pulse of the prompt emission orthe corresponding x-ray flare, being self-consistent with the expectation ofthe internal dissipation models for the prompt emission and x-ray flares. ourresults indicate that each x-ray flare forms a distinct new episode of centralengine activity and the grb central engine remains active after the promptemission is over, sometimes up to ~1 day after the grb trigger (e.g. grb050502b &amp; grb 050724). this challenges the conventional central engine modelsand calls for new ideas to re-start the central engine. we further show thatthe on-set time of the late central engine activity does not depend on the grbduration. we also identify a minority group of grbs whose combined bat-xrtlight curves are smoothly connected without an abrupt transition between theprompt emission and the afterglow. these grbs may have an external origin forboth the prompt emission and the afterglow.

astro-ph;0703150	swift detection of all previously undetected blazars in a micro-wave  flux-limited sample of wmap foreground sources	almost the totality of the bright foreground sources in the wmap cmb maps areblazars, a class of sources that show usually also x-ray emission. however, 23objects in a flux-limited sample of 140 blazars of the wmap catalog (firstyear) were never reported before as x-ray sources. we present here the resultsof 41 swift observations which led to the detection of all these 23 blazars inthe 0.3-10 kev band. we conclude that all micro-wave selected blazars are x-rayemitters and that the distribution of the micro-wave to x-ray spectral slope$\alpha_{mu x}$ of lbl blazars is very narrow, confirming that the x-ray fluxof most blazars is a very good estimator of their micro-wave emission. thex-ray spectral shape of all the objects that were observed long enough to allowspectral analysis is flat and consistent with inverse compton emission withinthe commonly accepted view where the radiation from blazars is emitted in asychrotron-inverse-compton scenario. we predict that all blazars and most radiogalaxies above the sensitivity limit of the wmap and of the planck cmb missionsare x-ray sources detectable by the present generation of x-ray satellites. anhypothetical all-sky soft x-ray survey with sensitivity of approximately$10^{-15}$ erg/s would be crucial to locate and remove over 100,000 blazarsfrom cmb temperature and polarization maps and therefore accurately clean theprimordial cmb signal from the largest population of extragalactic foregroundcontaminants.

0809.4254	long term x-ray monitoring of the tev binary ls i +61 303 with rxte	we report on the results of a long term x-ray monitoring campaign of thegalactic binary ls i +61 303 performed by the rossi x-ray timing explorer. thisdataset consists of 1 ks pointings taken every other day between 2007 august 28until 2008 february 2. the observations covered six full cycles of the 26.496day binary period and constitute the largest continuous x-ray monitoringdataset on ls i +61 303 to date with this sensitivity. there is nostatistically strong detection of modulation of flux or photon index withorbital phase; however, we do find a strong correlation between flux and photonindex, with the spectrum becoming harder at higher fluxes. the dataset containsthree large flaring episodes, the largest of these reaching a flux level of 7.2(+0.1,-0.2)*10^-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the 3-10 kev band, which is a factor ofthree times larger than flux levels typically seen in the system. analysis ofthese flares shows the x-ray emission from ls i +61 303 changing by up to afactor of six over timescales of several hundred seconds as well as doublingtimes as fast as 2 seconds. this is the fastest variability ever observed fromls i +61 303 at this wavelength and places constraints on the size of the x-rayemitting region.

0706.0669	the two-component afterglow of swift grb 050802	this paper investigates grb 050802, one of the best examples of a it swiftgamma-ray burst afterglow that shows a break in the x-ray lightcurve, while theoptical counterpart decays as a single power-law. this burst has an opticallybright afterglow of 16.5 magnitude, detected throughout the 170-650nm spectralrange of the uvot on-board swift. observations began with the xrt and uvottelescopes 286s after the initial trigger and continued for 1.2 x 10^6s. thex-ray lightcurve consists of three power-law segments: a rise until 420s,followed by a slow decay with alpha_2 = 0.63 +/- 0.03 until 5000s, after which,the lightcurve decays faster with a slope of alpha_3 = 1.59 +/- 0.03. theoptical lightcurve decays as a single power-law with alpha_o = 0.82 +/- 0.03throughout the observation. the x-ray data on their own are consistent with thebreak at 5000s being due to the end of energy injection. modelling the opticalto x-ray spectral energy distribution, we find that the optical afterglow cannot be produced by the same component as the x-ray emission at late times,ruling out a single component afterglow. we therefore considered two-componentjet models and find that the x-ray and optical emission is best reproduced by amodel in which both components are energy injected for the duration of theobserved afterglow and the x-ray break at 5000s is due to a jet break in thenarrow component. this bright, well-observed burst is likely a guide forinterpreting the surprising finding of swift that bursts seldom displayachromatic jet breaks.

0812.0546	search for primordial black holes with sgarface	the short gamma ray front air cherenkov experiment (sgarface) uses thewhipple 10 m telescope to search for bursts of $\gamma$ rays. sgarface issensitive to bursts with duration from a few ns to $\sim$20 $\mu$s and with$\gamma$-ray energy above 100 mev. sgarface began operating in march 2003 andhas collected 2.2 million events during an exposure time of 2267 hours. asearch for bursts of $\gamma$ rays from explosions of primordial black holes(pbh) was carried out. a hagedorn-type pbh explosion is predicted to be visiblewithin 60 pc of earth. background events were caused by cosmic rays and byatmospheric phenomena and their rejection was accomplished to a large extentusing the time-resolved images. no unambiguous detection of bursts of $\gamma$rays could be made as the remaining background events mimic the expected shapeand time development of bursts. upper limits on the pbh explosion rate werederived from the sgarface data and are compared to previous and futureexperiments. we note that a future array of large wide-field air-cherenkovtelescopes equipped with a sgarface-like trigger would be able to operatebackground-free with a 20 to 30 times higher sensitivity for pbh explosions.
