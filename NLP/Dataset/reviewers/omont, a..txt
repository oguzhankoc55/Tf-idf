0902.3671	imaging the cool gas, dust, star formation, and agn in the first  galaxies	when, and how, did the first galaxies and supermassive black holes (smbh)form, and how did they reionization the universe? first galaxy formation andcosmic reionization are among the last frontiers in studies of cosmic structureformation. we delineate the detailed astrophysical probes of early galaxy andsmbh formation afforded by observations at centimeter through submillimeterwavelengths. these observations include studies of the molecular gas (= thefuel for star formation in galaxies), atomic fine structure lines (= thedominant ism gas coolant), thermal dust continuum emission (= an ideal starformation rate estimator), and radio continuum emission from star formation andrelativistic jets. high resolution spectroscopic imaging can be used to studygalaxy dynamics and star formation on sub-kpc scales. these cm and mmobservations are the necessary compliment to near-ir observations, which probethe stars and ionized gas, and x-ray observations, which reveal the agn.together, a suite of revolutionary observatories planned for the next decadefrom centimeter to x-ray wavelengths will provide the requisite panchromaticview of the complex processes involved in the formation of the first generationof galaxies and smbhs, and cosmic reionization.

0903.0862	co line emission in the halo of a radio galaxy at z=2.6	we report the detection of luminous co(3-2) line emission in the halo of thez=2.6 radio galaxy (hzrg) txs0828+193, which has no detected counterpart atoptical to mid-infrared wavelengths implying a stellar mass &lt; few x10^9 m_sunand relatively low star-formation rates. with the iram pdbi we find two coemission line components at the same position at ~80 kpc distance from the hzrgalong the axis of the radio jet, with different blueshifts of few 100 km s^-1relative to the hzrg and a total luminosity of ~2x10^10 k km s^-1 pc^2 detectedat 8 sigma significance. hzrgs have significant galaxy overdensities andextended halos of metal-enriched gas often with embedded clouds or filaments ofdenser material, and likely trace very massive dark-matter halos. the coemission may be associated with a gas-rich, low-mass satellite galaxy withlittle on-going star formation, in contrast to all previous co detections ofgalaxies at similar redshifts. alternatively, the co may be related to a gascloud or filament and perhaps jet-induced gas cooling in the outer halo,somewhat in analogy with extended co emission found in low-redshift galaxyclusters.

0904.4479	irs spectroscopy and multi-wavelength study of luminous star-forming  galaxies at z~1.9	we analyze a sample of galaxies chosen to have f24&gt;0.5 mjy and satisfy acertain irac color criterion. irs spectra yield redshifts, spectral types, andpah luminosities, to which we add multi-wavelength broadband photometry.stellar population modeling and irs spectra together demonstrate that thedouble criteria used to select this sample have efficiently isolated massivestar-forming galaxies at z~1.9. this is the first starburst-dominated ulirgsample at high redshift with total infrared luminosity measured directly fromfir and millimeter photometry, and as such gives us the first accurate view ofbroadband seds for starburst galaxies at extremely high luminosity and at allwavelengths. similar broadband data are assembled for three other galaxysamples -- local starburst galaxies, local agn/ulirgs, and a second24mu-luminous z~1.9 sample dominated by agn. l(pah)/l(ir) for the new z~1.9starburst sample is the highest ever seen, some three times higher than inlocal starbursts, whereas in agns this ratio is depressed below the starbursttrend, often severely. several pieces of evidence imply that agns exist in thisstarburst dominated sample, except two of which even host very strong agn,while they still have very strong pah emission. the acs images show mostobjects have very extended morphologies in the rest-frame uv band, thusextended distribution of pah molecules. such an extended distribution preventsfurther destruction pah molecules by central agns. we conclude that objects inthis sample are ulirgs powered mainly by starburst; and the total infraredluminosity density contributed by this type of objects is 0.9-2.6x 10^7lsol/mpc^3.

0910.3097	multi-wavelength properties of spitzer-selected starbursts at z~2	a complete sample of 33 sources believed to be starbursts("5.8micron-peakers") was selected in the (0.5 sq. deg.) j1046+56 field withselection criteria f_(24micron)&gt;400mujy, the presence of a redshifted stellaremission peak at 5.8um, and r'(vega)&gt;23. the field, part of the swire lockmanhole field, benefits from very deep vla/gmrt 20cm, 50cm, and 90cm radio data(all 33 sources are detected at 50cm), and deep 160micron and 70micron spitzerdata. the 33 sources, with photometric redshifts ~1.5-2.5, were observed at1.2mm with iram-30m/mambo to an rms ~0.7-0.8mjy in most cases. theirmillimeter, radio, 7-band spitzer, and near-ir properties were jointlyanalyzed. the entire sample of 33 sources has an average 1.2mm flux density of1.56+/-0.22mjy and a median of 1.61mjy, so the majority of the sources can beconsidered smgs. four sources have confirmed 4sigma detections, and nine weretentatively detected at the 3sigma level. because of its 24micron selection,our sample shows systematically lower f_(1.2mm)/f_(24micron) flux ratios thanclassical smgs, probably because of enhanced pah emission. a median fir sed wasbuilt by stacking images at the positions of 21 sources in the region ofdeepest spitzer coverage. its parameters are t_(dust)=37+/-8k,l_(fir)=2.5x10^{12}lo, and sfr=450mo/yr. the fir-radio correlation providesanother estimate of l_(fir) for each source, with an average value of4.1x10^{12}lo; however, this value may be overestimated because of some agncontribution. most of our targets are also luminous star-forming bzk galaxieswhich constitute a significant fraction of weak smgs at 1.7&lt;z&lt;2.3.

0910.5756	molecular gas in submillimetre-faint, star-forming ultraluminous  galaxies at z&gt;1	[abridged] we present interferometric co observations of twelve z~2submillimetre-faint, star-forming radio galaxies (sfrgs) which are thought tobe ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) possibly dominated by warmer dust(t_dust ~&gt; 40 k) than submillimetre galaxies (smgs) of similar luminosities.four other co-observed sfrgs are included from the literature, and allobservations are taken at the plateau de bure interferometer (pdbi) in thecompact configuration. ten of the sixteen sfrgs observed in co (63%) aredetected at &gt;4sigma with a mean inferred molecular gas mass of ~2*10^10 m_sun.sfrgs trend slightly above the local ulirg l_fir-l'_co relation. since sfrgsare about two times fainter in radio luminosity but exhibit similar columinosities to smgs, this suggests sfrgs are slightly more efficient starformers than smgs at the same redshifts. sfrgs also have a narrow mean co linewidth, 320+-80km/s. sfrgs bridge the gap between properties of very luminous&gt;5*10^12 l_sun smgs and those of local ulirgs and are consistent withintermediate stage major mergers. we suspect that more moderate-luminositysmgs, not yet surveyed in co, would show similar molecular gas properties tosfrgs. the agn fraction of sfrgs is consistent with smgs and is estimated to be0.3+-0.1, suggesting that sfrgs are observed near the peak phase of starformation activity and not in a later, post-smg enhanced agn phase. this cosurvey of sfrgs serves as a pilot project for the much more extensive survey ofherschel and scuba-2 selected sources which only partially overlap with smgs.better constraints on co properties of a diverse high-z ulirg population areneeded from alma to determine the evolutionary origin of extreme starbursts,and what role ulirgs serve in catalyzing the formation of massive stellarsystems in the early universe.

0912.1598	high-resolution co and radio imaging of z~2 ulirgs: extended co  structures, and implications for the universal star formation law	we present high spatial resolution (0.4", ~3.5 kpc) pdbi interferometric dataon three ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) at z~2: two submillimetregalaxies and one submillimetre faint star forming radio galaxy. the threegalaxies have been ro- bustly detected in co rotational transitions, either12co(j=4-3) or 12co(j=3-2), allowing their sizes and gas masses to beaccurately constrained. these are the highest spatial resolution observationsobserved to date (by a factor of ~2) for intermediate-excitation co emission inz~2 ulirgs. the galaxies appear extended over several resolution elements,having a mean radius of 3.7 kpc. high-resolution (0.3") combined merlin-vlaobservations of their radio continua allow an analysis of the star formationbehaviour of these galaxies, on comparable spatial scales to that of the coobservations. this 'matched beam' approach sheds light on the spatialdistribution of both molecular gas and star formation, and we can thereforecalculate accurate star formation rates and gas surface densities: this allowsus to place the three systems in the context of a kennicutt-schmidt (ks)-stylestar formation law. we find a difference in size between the co and radioemission regions, and as such we suggest that using the spatial extent of theco emission region to estimate the surface density of star formation may leadto error. this size difference also causes the star formation efficiencieswithin systems to vary by up to a factor of 5. we also find, with our newaccurate sizes, that smgs lie significantly above the ks relation, indicatingthat stars are formed more efficiently in these extreme systems than in otherhigh-z star forming galaxies.

0707.3335	molecular gas in qso host galaxies at z&gt;5	we present observations with the iram plateau de bure interferometer of threeqsos at z&gt;5 aimed at detecting molecular gas in their host galaxies as tracedby co transitions. co (5-4) is detected in sdssj033829.31+002156.3 at z=5.0267,placing it amongst the most distant sources detected in co. the co emission isunresolved with a beam size of ~1", implying that the molecular gas iscontained within a compact region, less than ~3kpc in radius. we infer an upperlimit on the dynamical mass of the co emitting region of ~3x10^10msun/sin(i)^2. the comparison with the black hole mass inferred from near-irdata suggests that the bh-to-bulge mass ratio in this galaxy is significantlyhigher than in local galaxies. from the co luminosity we infer a mass reservoirof molecular gas as high as m(h2)=2.4x10^10 msun, implying that the moleculargas accounts for a significant fraction of the dynamical mass. when compared tothe star formation rate derived from the far-ir luminosity, we infer a veryshort gas exhaustion timescale (~10^7 yrs), comparable to the dynamicaltimescale. co is not detected in the other two qsos (sdssj083643.85+005453.3and sdssj163033.90+401209.6) and upper limits are given for their molecular gascontent. when combined with co observations of other type 1 agns, spanning awide redshift range (0&lt;z&lt;6.4), we find that the host galaxy co luminosity(hence molecular gas content) and the agn optical luminosity (hence bhaccretion rate) are correlated, but the relation is not linear: l(co) ~[lambda*l_lambda(4400a)]^0.72. moreover, at high redshifts (and especially atz&gt;5) the co luminosity appears to saturate. we discuss the implications ofthese findings in terms of black hole-galaxy co-evolution.

1002.2149	high molecular gas fractions in normal massive star forming galaxies in  the young universe	stars form from cold molecular interstellar gas. since this is relativelyrare in the local universe, galaxies like the milky way form only a few newstars per year. typical massive galaxies in the distant universe formed starsan order of magnitude more rapidly. unless star formation was significantlymore efficient, this difference suggests that young galaxies were much more gasrich. molecular gas observations in the distant universe have so far beenlargely restricted to very luminous, rare objects, including mergers andquasars. here we report the results of a systematic survey of molecular gas insamples of typical massive star forming galaxies at &lt;z&gt;~1.2 and 2.3, when theuniverse was 40% and 24% of its current age. our measurements provide empiricalevidence that distant star forming galaxies indeed were gas rich, and that thestar formation efficiency is not strongly dependent on cosmic epoch. theaverage fraction of cold gas relative to total galaxy baryonic mass at z= 2.3and z=1.2 is ~44% and 34%, three to ten times higher than in today's massivespiral galaxies. the slow decrease between z~2 and 1 probably requires amechanism of semi-continuous replenishment of fresh gas to the young galaxies.

1003.5180	a study of the gas-star formation relation over cosmic time	we use the first systematic data sets of co molecular line emission in z~1-3normal star forming galaxies for a comparison of the dependence ofgalaxy-averaged star formation rates on molecular gas masses at low and highredshifts, and in different galactic environments. although the current high-zsamples are still small and biased toward the luminous and massive tail of theactively star-forming 'main-sequence', a fairly clear picture is emerging.independent of whether galaxy integrated quantities or surface densities areconsidered, low- and high-z sfg galaxy populations appear to follow similarmolecular gas-star formation relations with slopes 1.1 to 1.2. thegas-depletion time scale in these sfgs grows from 0.5 gyrs at z~2 to 1.5 gyrsat z~0. because star formation depletion times are significantly smaller thanthe hubble time at all redshifts sampled, star formation rates and gasfractions are set by the balance between gas accretion from the halo andstellar feedback. in contrast, very luminous gas rich major mergers at bothlow-z and high-z produce on average 4 to10 times more far-infrared luminosityper unit gas mass. only some fraction of this difference can be explained byuncertainties in gas-mass or luminosity estimators; much of it must beintrinsic. the most likely interpretation is that the star formation relationis driven by global dynamical effects. for a given mass, the more compactmerger systems produce stars more rapidly because their gas clouds are morecompressed with shorter dynamical times, so that they churn more quicklythrough the available gas reservoir than the typical normal disk galaxies. whenthe dependence on galactic dynamical time scale is explicitly included, diskgalaxies and mergers appear to follow similar gas to star-formation relations.the mergers may be forming stars at slightly higher efficiencies than thedisks.

1004.0819	far-infrared properties of spitzer-selected luminous starbursts	we present sharc-2 350 micron data on 20 luminous z ~ 2 starbursts withs(1.2mm) &gt; 2 mjy from the spitzer-selected samples of lonsdale et al. andfiolet et al. all the sources were detected, with s(350um) &gt; 25 mjy for 18 ofthem. with the data, we determine precise dust temperatures and luminositiesfor these galaxies using both single-temperature fits and models with power-lawmass--temperature distributions. we derive appropriate formulae to use whenoptical depths are non-negligible. our models provide an excellent fit to the6um--2mm measurements of local starbursts. we find characteristicsingle-component temperatures t1 ~ 35.5+-2.2 k and integrated infrared (ir)luminosities around 10^(12.9+-0.1) lsun for the swire-selected sources.molecular gas masses are estimated at 4 x 10^(10) msun, assumingkappa(850um)=0.15 m^2/kg and a submillimeter-selected galaxy (smg)-likegas-to-dust mass ratio. the best-fit models imply &gt;~2 kpc emission scales. wealso note a tight correlation between rest-frame 1.4 ghz radio and irluminosities confirming star formation as the predominant power source. thefar-ir properties of our sample are indistinguishable from the purelysubmillimeter-selected populations from current surveys. we therefore concludethat our original selection criteria, based on mid-ir colors and 24 um fluxdensities, provides an effective means for the study of smgs at z ~ 1.5--2.5.

1005.1072	the far-infrared/radio correlation as probed by herschel	we set out to determine the ratio, q(ir), of rest-frame 8-1000um flux, s(ir),to monochromatic radio flux, s(1.4ghz), for galaxies selected at far-ir andradio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift,luminosity or dust temperature, and to identify any far-ir-bright outliers -useful laboratories for exploring why the far-ir/radio correlation is generallyso tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable.we use flux-limited 250-um and 1.4-ghz samples, obtained in goods-n usingherschel (hermes; pep) and the vla. we determine bolometric ir output using tenbands spanning 24-1250um, exploiting data from pacs and spire, as well asspitzer, scuba, aztec and mambo. we also explore the properties of anl(ir)-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of q(ir) with z, spanninglog l(ir) = 11-12 l(sun) and z=0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-irimages. for 1.4-ghz-selected galaxies, we see tentative evidence of a break inthe flux ratio, q(ir), at l(1.4ghz) ~ 10^22.7 w/hz, where agn are starting todominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with z and t(d).from our 250-um-selected sample we identify a small number of far-ir-brightoutliers, and see trends of q(ir) with l(1.4ghz), l(ir), t(d) and z, notingthat some of these are inter-related. for our l(ir)-matched sample, there is noevidence that q(ir) changes significantly as we move back into the epoch ofgalaxy formation: we find q(ir) goes as (1+z)^gamma, where gamma = -0.04 +/-0.03 at z=0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z&lt;0.5 we findgamma = -0.26 +/- 0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radiobackground seen by arcade2, perhaps driven by &lt;10ujy radio activity amongstordinary star-forming galaxies at z&gt;1.

1005.2187	the hermes spire submillimeter local luminosity function	local luminosity functions are fundamental benchmarks for high-redshiftgalaxy formation and evolution studies as well as for models describing theseprocesses. determining the local luminosity function in the submillimeter rangecan help to better constrain in particular the bolometric luminosity density inthe local universe, and herschel offers the first opportunity to do so in anunbiased way by imaging large sky areas at several submillimeter wavelengths.  we present the first herschel measurement of the submillimeter 0&lt;z&lt;0.2 localluminosity function and infrared bolometric (8-1000 $\mu$m) local luminositydensity based on spire data from the hermes herschel key program over 14.7deg^2.  flux measurements in the three spire channels at 250, 350 and 500 \mum arecombined with spitzer photometry and archival data. we fit the observedoptical-to-submillimeter spectral energy distribution of spire sources and usethe 1/v_{max} estimator to provide the first constraints on the monochromatic250, 350 and 500 \mum as well as on the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) localluminosity function based on herschel data.  we compare our results with modeling predictions and find a slightly moreabundant local submillimeter population than predicted by a number of models.our measurement of the infrared bolometric (8-1000 \mum) local luminosityfunction suggests a flat slope at low luminosity, and the inferred localluminosity density, 1.31_-0.21^+0.24 x 10^8 lsun mpc^-3, is consistent with therange of values reported in recent literature.

1005.2192	hermes: far-infrared properties of known agn in the hermes fields	nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly.herschel-spire provides sampling of the fir seds of type 1 and type 2 agn,allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust(starburst) emission. we study large samples of spectroscopically confirmedtype 1 and type 2 agn lying within the herschel multi-tiered extragalacticsurvey (hermes) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aimingto understand their fir colour distributions and constrain their starburstcontributions. we find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed agn inthe hermes fields have 5-sigma detections at 250um, in agreement with previous(sub)mm agn studies. their combined spitzer-mips and herschel-spire colours -specifically s(250)/s(70) vs. s(70)/s(24) - quite clearly separate them fromthe non-agn, star-forming galaxy population, as their 24-um flux is dominatedby the hot torus emission. however, their spire colours alone do not differfrom those of non-agn galaxies. sed fitting shows that all those agn need astarburst component to fully account for their fir emission. for objects at z &gt;2, we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to thestarburst component, l(sb), and the agn accretion luminosity, l(acc), withl(sb) propto l(acc)^0.35. type 2 agn detected at 250um show on average higherl(sb) than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establishwhether this trend indicates stronger star-formation activity.

1005.2618	from filamentary clouds to prestellar cores to the stellar imf: initial  highlights from the herschel gould belt survey	we summarize the first results from the gould belt survey, obtained towardthe aquila rift and polaris flare regions during the 'science demonstrationphase' of herschel. our 70-500 micron images taken in parallel mode with thespire and pacs cameras reveal a wealth of filamentary structure, as well asnumerous dense cores embedded in the filaments. between ~ 350 and 500prestellar cores and ~ 45-60 class 0 protostars can be identified in the aquilafield, while ~ unbound starless cores and no protostars are observed in thepolaris field. the prestellar core mass function (cmf) derived for the aquilaregion bears a strong resemblance to the stellar initial mass function (imf),already confirming the close connection between the cmf and the imf with muchbetter statistics than earlier studies. comparing and contrasting our herschelresults in aquila and polaris, we propose an observationally-driven scenariofor core formation according to which complex networks of long, thin filamentsform first within molecular clouds, and then the densest filaments fragmentinto a number of prestellar cores via gravitational instability.

1005.2859	herschel unveils a puzzling uniformity of distant dusty galaxies	the herschel space observatory enables us to accurately measure thebolometric output of starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei (agn) bydirectly sampling the peak of their far-infrared (ir) emission. here we examinewhether the spectral energy distribution (sed) and dust temperature of galaxieshave strongly evolved since z~2.5. we use herschel deep extragalactic surveysfrom 100 to 500um to compute total ir luminosities in galaxies down to thefaintest levels, using pacs and spire in the goods-north field (pep and hermeskey programs). we show that measurements in the spire bands can be used belowthe statistical confusion limit if information at higher spatial resolution isused to identify isolated galaxies whose flux is not boosted by brightneighbors. below z~1.5, mid-ir extrapolations are correct for star-forminggalaxies with a dispersion of only 40% (0.15dex), therefore similar to z~0galaxies. this narrow distribution is puzzling when considering the range ofphysical processes that could have affected the sed of these galaxies.extrapolations from only one of the 160um, 250um or 350um bands alone tend tooverestimate the total ir luminosity. this may be explained by the lack offar-ir constraints around and above ~150um (rest-frame) on local templates. wealso note that the dust temperature of luminous ir galaxies around z~1 ismildly colder by 10-15% than their local analogs and up to 20% for ulirgs atz~1.6. above z=1.5, distant galaxies are found to exhibit a substantiallylarger mid- over far-ir ratio, which could either result from stronger broademission lines or warm dust continuum heated by a hidden agn. two thirds of theagns identified in the field with a measured redshift exhibit the same behavioras purely star-forming galaxies. hence a large fraction of agns harbor starformation at very high sfr and in conditions similar to purely star-forminggalaxies.

1005.3820	the herschel lensing survey (hls): overview	the herschel lensing survey (hls) will conduct deep pacs and spire imaging of~40 massive clusters of galaxies. the strong gravitational lensing power ofthese clusters will enable us to penetrate through the confusion noise, whichsets the ultimate limit on our ability to probe the universe with herschel.here, we present an overview of our survey and a summary of the major resultsfrom our science demonstration phase (sdp) observations of the bullet cluster(z=0.297). the sdp data are rich, allowing us to study not only the backgroundhigh-redshift galaxies (e.g., strongly lensed and distorted galaxies at z=2.8and 3.2) but also the properties of cluster-member galaxies. our preliminaryanalysis shows a great diversity of far-infrared/submillimeter spectral energydistributions (seds), indicating that we have much to learn with herschel aboutthe properties of galaxy seds. we have also detected the sunyaev-zel'dovich(sz) effect increment with the spire data. the success of this sdp programdemonstrates the great potential of the herschel lensing survey to produceexciting results in a variety of science areas.

1005.3821	the far-infrared/submillimeter properties of galaxies located behind the  bullet cluster	the herschel lensing survey (hls) takes advantage of gravitational lensing bymassive galaxy clusters to sample a population of high-redshift galaxies whichare too faint to be detected above the confusion limit of currentfar-infrared/submillimeter telescopes. measurements from 100-500 micron bracketthe peaks of the far-infrared spectral energy distributions of these galaxies,characterizing their infrared luminosities and star formation rates. weintroduce initial results from our science demonstration phase observations,directed toward the bullet cluster (1e0657-56). by combining our observationswith laboca 870 micron and aztec 1.1 mm data we fully constrain the spectralenergy distributions of 19 mips 24 micron selected galaxies which are locatedbehind the cluster. we find that their colors are best fit using templatesbased on local galaxies with systematically lower infrared luminosities.thissuggests that our sources are not like local ultra-luminous infrared galaxiesin which vigorous star formation is contained in a compact highly dust-obscuredregion. instead, they appear to be scaled up versions of lower luminosity localgalaxies with star formation occurring on larger physical scales.

1007.1857	measures of star formation rates from infrared (herschel) and uv (galex)  emissions of galaxies in the hermes fields	the reliability of infrared (ir) and ultraviolet (uv) emissions to measurestar formation rates in galaxies is investigated for a large sample of galaxiesobserved with the spire and pacs instruments on herschel as part of the hermesproject. we build flux-limited 250 micron samples of sources at redshift z&lt;1,cross-matched with the spitzer/mips and galex catalogues. about 60 % of theherschel sources are detected in uv. the total ir luminosities, l_ir, of thesources are estimated using a sed-fitting code that fits to fluxes between 24and 500 micron. dust attenuation is discussed on the basis of commonly-useddiagnostics: the l_ir/l_uv ratio and the slope, beta, of the uv continuum. amean dust attenuation a_uv of ~ 3 mag is measured in the samples. l_ir/l_uv isfound to correlate with l_ir. galaxies with l_ir &gt; 10 ^{11} l_sun and 0.5&lt; z&lt;1exhibit a mean dust attenuation a_uv about 0.7 mag lower than that found fortheir local counterparts, although with a large dispersion. our galaxy samplesspan a large range of beta and l_ir/l_uv values which, for the most part, aredistributed between the ranges defined by the relations found locally forstarburst and normal star-forming galaxies. as a consequence the recipecommonly applied to local starbursts is found to overestimate the dustattenuation correction in our galaxy sample by a factor ~2-3 .

1009.5675	hermes: deep galaxy number counts from a p(d) fluctuation analysis of  spire science demonstration phase observations	dusty, star forming galaxies contribute to a bright, currently unresolvedcosmic far-infrared background. deep herschel-spire images designed to detectand characterize the galaxies that comprise this background are highlyconfused, such that the bulk lies below the classical confusion limit. weanalyze three fields from the hermes programme in all three spire bands (250,350, and 500 microns); parameterized galaxy number count models are derived toa depth of ~2 mjy/beam, approximately 4 times the depth of previous analyses atthese wavelengths, using a p(d) (probability of deflection) approach forcomparison to theoretical number count models. our fits account for 64, 60, and43 per cent of the far-infrared background in the three bands. the numbercounts are consistent with those based on individually detected spire sources,but generally inconsistent with most galaxy number counts models, whichgenerically overpredict the number of bright galaxies and are not as steep asthe p(d)-derived number counts. clear evidence is found for a break in theslope of the differential number counts at low flux densities. systematiceffects in the p(d) analysis are explored. we find that the effects ofclustering have a small impact on the data, and the largest identifiedsystematic error arises from uncertainties in the spire beam.

1101.1080	sub-millimetre galaxies reside in dark matter halos with masses greater  than 3x10^11 solar masses	the extragalactic background light at far-infrared wavelengths originatesfrom optically-faint, dusty, star-forming galaxies in the universe withstar-formation rates at the level of a few hundred solar masses per year. dueto the relatively poor spatial resolution of far-infrared telescopes, the faintsub-millimetre galaxies are challenging to study individually. instead, theiraverage properties can be studied using statistics such as the angular powerspectrum of the background intensity variations. a previous attempt atmeasuring this power spectrum resulted in the suggestion that the clusteringamplitude is below the level computed with a simple ansatz based on a halomodel. here we report a clear detection of the excess clustering over thelinear prediction at arcminute angular scales in the power spectrum ofbrightness fluctuations at 250, 350, and 500 microns. from this excess, we findthat sub-millimetre galaxies are located in dark matter halos with a minimummass of log[m_min/m_sun ]= 11.5^+0.7_-0.2 at 350 microns. this minimum darkmatter halo mass corresponds to the most efficient mass scale for starformation in the universe, and is lower than that predicted by semi-analyticalmodels for galaxy formation.

1107.2129	disk, merger, or outflow ? molecular gas kinematics in two powerful  obscured qsos at z&gt;3.4	we report on the detection of bright co(4-3) line emission in two powerful,obscured quasars discovered in the swire survey, sw022513 and sw022550 atz&gt;3.4. we analyze the line strength and profile to determine the gas mass,dynamical mass and the gas dynamics for both galaxies. in sw022513 we may havefound the first evidence for a molecular, agn-driven wind in the earlyuniverse. the line profile in sw022513 is broad (fwhm = 1000 km/s) andblueshifted by -200 km/s relative to systemic (where the systemic velocity isestimated from the narrow components of ionized gas lines, as is commonly donefor agn at low and high redshifts). sw022550 has a more regular, double-peakedprofile, which is marginally spatially resolved in our data, consistent witheither a merger or an extended disk. the molecular gas masses, 4x10^10 msun,are large and account for &lt;30% of the stellar mass, making these obscured qsosas gas rich as other powerful co emitting galaxies at high redshift, i.e.,submillimeter galaxies. our sources exhibit relatively lower star-formationefficiencies compared to other dusty, powerful starburst galaxies at highredshift. we speculate that this could be a consequence of the agn perturbingthe molecular gas.

1107.2924	gas and dust in a submillimeter galaxy at z = 4.24 from the herschel  atlas	we report ground-based follow-up observations of the exceptional source,id141, one the brightest sources detected so far in the h-atlas cosmologicalsurvey. id141 was observed using the iram 30-meter telescope and plateau debure interferometer (pdbi), the submillimeter array (sma) and the atacamapathfinder experiment (apex) submillimeter telescope to measure the dustcontinuum and emission lines of the main isotope of carbon monoxide and carbon([c i] and [c ii]). the detection of strong co emission lines with the pdbiconfirms that id141 is at high redshift (z=4.243 +/- 0.001). the strength ofthe continuum and emission lines suggests that id141 is gravitationally lensed.the width (delta v (fwhm) ~ 800 km/s}) and asymmetric profiles of the co andcarbon lines indicate orbital motion in a disc or a merger. the propertiesderived for id141 are compatible with a ultraluminous (l_fir ~ 8.5 +/- 0.3 x10^13/mu_l lsun, where mu_l is the amplification factor, dense (n ~ 10^4 cm^-3)and warm (t_kin ~ 40k) starburst galaxy, with an estimated star-formation rateof (0.7 to 1.7) x 10^4/mu_l msun/yr. the carbon emission lines indicate a dense(n ~ 10^4 cm^-3) photo-dominated region, illuminated by a far-uv radiationfield a few thousand times more intense than that in our galaxy. in conclusion,the physical properties of the high-z galaxy, id141, are remarkably similar tothose of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies.

1107.4979	observation of h2o in a strongly lensed herschel-atlas source at z=2.3	the herschel survey, h-atlas, with its large areal coverage, has recentlydiscovered a number of bright, strongly lensed high-z submillimeter galaxies.the strong magnification makes it possible to study molecular species otherthan co, which are otherwise difficult to observe in high-z galaxies. among thelensed galaxies already identified by h-atlas, the source j090302.9-014127b(sdp.17b) at z = 2.305 is remarkable due to its excitation conditions and atentative detection of the h2o 202-111 emission line (lupu et al. 2010). wereport observations of this line in sdp.17b using the iram interferometerequipped with its new 277- 371ghz receivers. the h2o line is detected at aredshift of z = 2.3049+/-0.0006, with a flux of 7.8+/-0.5 jy km s-1 and a fwhmof 250+/-60 km s-1. the new flux is 2.4 times weaker than the previoustentative detection, although both remain marginally consistent within1.6-sigma. the intrinsic line luminosity and ratio of h2o(202-111)/co8-7 seemcomparable with those of the nearby starburst/enshrouded-agn mrk 231,suggesting that sdp.17b could also host a luminous agn. the detection of astrong h2o 202-111 line in sdp.17b implies an efficient excitation mechanism ofthe water levels that must occur in very dense and warm interstellar gas.

1201.2908	a bright z=5.2 lensed submillimeter galaxy in the field of abell 773:  hlsj091828.6+514223	during our herschel lensing survey (hls) of massive galaxy clusters, we havediscovered an exceptionally bright source behind the z=0.22 cluster abell 773,which appears to be a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy (smg) at z=5.2429.this source is unusual compared to most other lensed sources discovered byherschel so far, because of its higher submm flux (\sim 200mjy at 500\micron)and its high redshift. the dominant lens is a foreground z=0.63 galaxy, not thecluster itself. the source has a far-infrared (fir) luminosity of l_fir= 1.110^{14}/\mu lo, where \mu is the magnification factor, likely \sim 11. wereport here the redshift identification through co lines with the iram-30m, andthe analysis of the gas excitation, based on co(7-6), co(6-5), co(5-4) detectedat iram and the co(2-1) at the evla. all lines decompose into a wide and strongred component, and a narrower and weaker blue component, 540\kms apart.assuming the ultraluminous galaxy (ulirg) co-to-h2 conversion ratio, the h2mass is 5.8 10^{11}/\mu mo, of which one third is in a cool component. from theci line we derive a ci/h2 number abundance of 6 10^{-5} similar to that inother ulirgs. the h2o line is strong only in the red velocity component, withan intensity ratio i(h_2o)/i(co) \sim 0.5, suggesting a strong local firradiation field, possibly from an active nucleus (agn) component. we detect the[nii]205\mics line for the first time at high-z. it shows comparable blue andred components, with a strikingly broad blue one, suggesting strong ionized gasflows.

1202.6490	molecular gas in infrared ultraluminous qso hosts	we report co detections in 17 out of 19 infrared ultraluminous qso (ir qso)hosts observed with the iram 30m telescope. the cold molecular gas reservoir inthese objects is in a range of 0.2--2.1$\times 10^{10}m_\odot$ (adopting aco-to-${\rm h_2}$ conversion factor $\alpha_{\rm co}=0.8 m_\odot {\rm (k kms^{-1} pc^2)^{-1}}$). we find that the molecular gas properties of ir qsos,such as the molecular gas mass, star formation efficiency ($l_{\rmfir}/l^\prime_{\rm co}$) and the co (1-0) line widths, are indistinguishablefrom those of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs). a comparison oflow- and high-redshift co detected qsos reveals a tight correlation betweenl$_{\rm fir}$ and $l^\prime_{\rm co(1-0)}$ for all qsos. this suggests that,similar to ulirgs, the far-infrared emissions of all qsos are mainly from dustheated by star formation rather than by active galactic nuclei (agns),confirming similar findings from mid-infrared spectroscopic observations by{\it spitzer}. a correlation between the agn-associated bolometric luminositiesand the co line luminosities suggests that star formation and agns draw fromthe same reservoir of gas and there is a link between star formation on $\sim$kpc scale and the central black hole accretion process on much smaller scales.

1203.2562	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey: hermes	the herschel multi-tiered extragalactic survey, hermes, is a legacy programdesigned to map a set of nested fields totalling ~380 deg^2. fields range insize from 0.01 to ~20 deg^2, using herschel-spire (at 250, 350 and 500 \mu m),and herschel-pacs (at 100 and 160 \mu m), with an additional wider component of270 deg^2 with spire alone. these bands cover the peak of the redshiftedthermal spectral energy distribution from interstellar dust and thus capturethe re-processed optical and ultra-violet radiation from star formation thathas been absorbed by dust, and are critical for forming a completemulti-wavelength understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.  the survey will detect of order 100,000 galaxies at 5\sigma in some of thebest studied fields in the sky. additionally, hermes is closely coordinatedwith the pacs evolutionary probe survey. making maximum use of the fullspectrum of ancillary data, from radio to x-ray wavelengths, it is designed to:facilitate redshift determination; rapidly identify unusual objects; andunderstand the relationships between thermal emission from dust and otherprocesses. scientific questions hermes will be used to answer include: thetotal infrared emission of galaxies; the evolution of the luminosity function;the clustering properties of dusty galaxies; and the properties of populationsof galaxies which lie below the confusion limit through lensing and statisticaltechniques.  this paper defines the survey observations and data products, outlines theprimary scientific goals of the hermes team, and reviews some of the earlyresults.

1205.1511	a survey of molecular gas in luminous sub-millimetre galaxies	we present the results from a survey for 12co emission in 40 luminoussub-millimetre galaxies (smgs), with 850um fluxes of s850 = 4 - 20 mjy,conducted with the plateau de bure interferometer. we detect 12co emission in32 smgs at z~1.2 - 4.1, including 16 smgs not previously published. usingmultiple 12co line (j_up =2 - 7) observations, we derive a median spectral lineenergy distribution for luminous smgs and use this to estimate a mean gas massof (5.3 +/- 1.0) \times 10^10 msun. we report the discovery of a fundamentalrelationship between 12co fwhm and 12co line luminosity in high-redshiftstarbursts, which we interpret as a natural consequence of the baryon-dominateddynamics within the regions probed by our observations. we use far-infraredluminosities to assess the star-formation efficiency in our smgs, finding asteepening of the l'co-lfir relation as a function of increasing 12co j_uptransition. we derive dynamical masses and molecular gas masses, and use theseto determine the redshift evolution of the gas content of smgs, finding thatthey do not appear to be significantly more gas rich than less vigorouslystar-forming galaxies at high redshifts. finally, we collate x-rayobservations, and study the interdependence of gas and dynamical properties ofsmgs with their agn activity and supermassive black hole masses (mbh), findingthat smgs lie significantly below the local m_bh-sigma relation. we concludethat smgs represent a class of massive, gas-rich ultraluminous galaxies withsomewhat heterogeneous properties, ranging from starbursting disc-like systemswith l~10^12 l_sun, to the most highly star-forming mergers in the universe.

1205.3778	hermes: candidate gravitationally lensed galaxies and lensing statistics  at submillimeter wavelengths	we present a list of 13 candidate gravitationally lensed submillimetergalaxies (smgs) from 95 square degrees of the herschel multi-tieredextragalactic survey, a surface density of 0.14\pm0.04deg^{-2}. the selectedsources have 500um flux densities (s_500) greater than 100mjy. gravitationallensing is confirmed by follow-up observations in 9 of the 13 systems (70%),and the lensing status of the four remaining sources is undetermined. we alsopresent a supplementary sample of 29 (0.31\pm0.06deg^{-2}) gravitationallylensed smg candidates with s_500=80--100mjy, which are expected to contain ahigher fraction of interlopers than the primary candidates. the number countsof the candidate lensed galaxies are consistent with a simple statistical modelof the lensing rate, which uses a foreground matter distribution, the intrinsicsmg number counts, and an assumed smg redshift distribution. the model predictsthat 32--74% of our s_500&gt;100mjy candidates are strongly gravitationally lensed(mu&gt;2), with the brightest sources being the most robust; this is consistentwith the observational data. our statistical model also predicts that, onaverage, lensed galaxies with s_500=100mjy are magnified by factors of ~9, withapparently brighter galaxies having progressively higher average magnification,due to the shape of the intrinsic number counts. 65% of the sources areexpected to have intrinsic 500micron flux densities less than 30mjy. thus,samples of strongly gravitationally lensed smgs, such as those presented here,probe below the nominal herschel detection limit at 500 micron. they are goodtargets for the detailed study of the physical conditions in distant dusty,star-forming galaxies, due to the lensing magnification, which can lead tospatial resolutions of ~0.01" in the source plane.

1205.6800	limits on dust emission from z~5 lbgs and their local environments	we present 1.2mm mambo-2 observations of a field which is over-dense in lymanbreak galaxies (lbgs) at z~5. the field includes sevenspectroscopically-confirmed lbgs contained within a narrow (z=4.95+/-0.08)redshift range and an eighth at z=5.2. we do not detect any individual sourceto a limit of 1.6 mjy/beam (2*rms). when stacking the flux from the positionsof all eight galaxies, we obtain a limit to the average 1.2 mm flux of thesesources of 0.6mjy/beam. this limit is consistent with fir imaging in otherfields which are over-dense in uv-bright galaxies at z~5. independently andcombined, these limits constrain the fir luminosity (8-1000 micron) to atypical z~5 lbg of lfir&lt;~3x10^11 lsun, implying a dust mass of mdust&lt;~10^8 msun(both assuming a grey body at 30k). this lfir limit is an order of magnitudefainter than the lfir of lower redshift sub-mm sources (z~1-3). we see noemission from any other sources within the field at the above level. while thisis not unexpected given millimetre source counts, the clustered lbgs tracesignificantly over-dense large scale structure in the field at z = 4.95. thelack of any such detection in either this or the previous work, implies thatmassive, obscured star-forming galaxies may not always trace the samestructures as over-densities of lbgs, at least on the length scale probed here.we briefly discuss the implications of these results for future observationswith alma.

1302.4895	the herschel census of infrared seds through cosmic time	using herschel data from the deepest spire and pacs surveys (hermes and pep)in cosmos and goods (n+s), we examine the dust properties of ir-luminous(l_ir&gt;10^10 l_sun) galaxies at 0.1&lt;z&lt;2 and determine how these evolve withcosmic time. the unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of surveyselection effects, making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated,ir-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selectionbiases. we find that ir-luminous galaxies have seds with broad far-ir peakscharacterised by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures inthe 25-45k range. hot (t&gt;45k) seds and cold (t&lt;25k), cirrus-dominated seds arerare, with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts suchas m82 and cool spirals such as m51. we observe a luminosity-temperature (l-t)relation, where the average dust temperature of log[l_ir/l_sun]=12.5 galaxiesis about 10k higher than that of their log[l_ir/l_sun]=10.5 counterparts.however, although the increased dust heating in more luminous systems is thedriving factor behind the l-t relation, the increase in dust mass and/orstarburst size with luminosity plays a dominant role in shaping it. our resultsshow that the dust conditions in ir-luminous sources evolve with cosmic time:at high redshift, dust temperatures are on average up to 10k lower than what ismeasured locally. this is manifested as a flattening of the l-t relation,suggesting that (u)lirgs in the early universe are typically characterised by amore extended dust distribution and/or higher dust masses than local equivalentsources. interestingly, the evolution in dust temperature is luminositydependent, with the fraction of lirgs with t&lt;35k showing a 2-fold increase fromz~0 to z~2, whereas that of ulirgs with t&lt;35k shows a 6-fold increase.

1304.4256	a dust-obscured massive maximum-starburst galaxy at a redshift of 6.34	massive present-day early-type (elliptical and lenticular) galaxies probablygained the bulk of their stellar mass and heavy elements through intense,dust-enshrouded starbursts - that is, increased rates of star formation - inthe most massive dark matter halos at early epochs. however, it remains unknownhow soon after the big bang such massive starburst progenitors exist. themeasured redshift distribution of dusty, massive starbursts has long beensuspected to be biased low in redshift owing to selection effects, as confirmedby recent findings of systems out to redshift z~5. here we report theidentification of a massive starburst galaxy at redshift 6.34 through asubmillimeter color-selection technique. we unambiguously determined theredshift from a suite of molecular and atomic fine structure cooling lines.these measurements reveal a hundred billion solar masses of highly excited,chemically evolved interstellar medium in this galaxy, which constitutes atleast 40% of the baryonic mass. a "maximum starburst" converts the gas intostars at a rate more than 2,000 times that of the milky way, a rate among thehighest observed at any epoch. despite the overall downturn of cosmic starformation towards the highest redshifts, it seems that environments matureenough to form the most massive, intense starbursts existed at least as earlyas 880 million years after the big bang.

1305.4930	the rapid assembly of an elliptical galaxy of 400 billion solar masses  at a redshift of 2.3	stellar archeology shows that massive elliptical galaxies today formedrapidly about ten billion years ago with star formation rates above severalhundreds solar masses per year (m_sun/yr). their progenitors are likely thesub-millimeter-bright galaxies (smgs) at redshifts (z) greater than 2. whilesmgs' mean molecular gas mass of 5x10^10 m_sun can explain the formation oftypical elliptical galaxies, it is inadequate to form ellipticals that alreadyhave stellar masses above 2x10^11 m_sun at z ~ 2. here we reportmulti-wavelength high-resolution observations of a rare merger of two massivesmgs at z = 2.3. the system is currently forming stars at a tremendous rate of2,000 m_sun/yr. with a star formation efficiency an order-of-magnitude greaterthan that of normal galaxies, it will quench the star formation by exhaustingthe gas reservoir in only ~200 million years. at a projected separation of 19kiloparsecs, the two massive starbursts are about to merge and form a passiveelliptical galaxy with a stellar mass of ~4x10^11 m_sun. our observations showthat gas-rich major galaxy mergers, concurrent with intense star formation, canform the most massive elliptical galaxies by z ~ 1.5.

1305.6351	water vapor in nearby infrared galaxies as probed by herschel	we report the first systematic study of the submillimeter water vaporrotational emission lines in infrared (ir) galaxies based on the fouriertransform spectrometer (fts) data of {\it herschel} spire. among the 176galaxies with publicly available fts data, 45 have at least one h$_2$o emissionline detected. the h$_2$o line luminosities range from $\sim 1 \times 10^5$$l_{\odot}$ to $\sim 5 \times 10^7 l_{\odot}$ while the total ir luminosities($l_\mathrm{ir}$) have a similar spread ($\sim 1-300 \times 10^{10}l_{\odot}$). in addition, emission lines of h$_2$o$^+$ and h$_2^{18}$o are alsodetected. h$_2$o is found, for most galaxies, to be the strongest molecularemitter after co in fts spectra. the luminosity of the five most importanth$_2$o lines is near-linearly correlated with $l_\mathrm{ir}$, no matterwhether strong active galactic nucleus signature is present or not. however,the luminosity of h$_2$o($2_{11}-2_{02}$) and h$_2$o($2_{20}-2_{11}$) appearsto increase slightly faster than linear with $l_\mathrm{ir}$. although theslope turns out to be slightly steeper when $z\sim 2-4$ ulirgs are included,the correlation is still closely linear. we find that$l_\mathrm{h_2o}/l_\mathrm{ir}$ decreases with increasing $f_{25}/f_{60}$, butsee no dependence on $f_{60}/f_{100}$, possibly indicating that very warm dustcontributes little to the excitation of the submillimeter h$_2$o lines. theaverage spectral line energy distribution (sled) of the entire sample isconsistent with individual sleds and the ir pumping plus collisional excitationmodel, showing that the strongest lines are h$_2$o($2_{02}-1_{11}$) andh$_2$o($3_{21}-3_{12}$).

1309.0836	gravitational lens models based on submillimeter array imaging of  herschel-selected strongly lensed sub-millimeter galaxies at z&gt;1.5	strong gravitational lenses are now being routinely discovered in wide-fieldsurveys at (sub)millimeter wavelengths. we present submillimeter array (sma)high-spatial resolution imaging and gemini-south and multiple mirror telescopeoptical spectroscopy of strong lens candidates discovered in the two widestextragalactic surveys conducted by the herschel space observatory: theherschel-astrophysical terahertz large area survey (h-atlas) and the herschelmulti-tiered extragalactic survey (hermes). from a sample of 30 herschelsources with s_500&gt;100 mjy, 21 are strongly lensed (multiply imaged), 4 aremoderately lensed (singly imaged), and the remainder require additional data todetermine their lensing status. we apply a visibility-plane lens modelingtechnique to the sma data to recover information about the masses of the lensesas well as the intrinsic (i.e., unlensed) sizes (r_half) and far-infraredluminosities (l_fir) of the lensed submillimeter galaxies (smgs). the sample oflenses comprises primarily isolated massive galaxies, but includes some groupsand clusters as well. several of the lenses are located at z_lens&gt;0.7, aredshift regime that is inaccessible to lens searches based on sloan digitalsky survey spectroscopy. the lensed smgs are amplified by factors that aresignificantly below statistical model predictions given the 500um fluxdensities of our sample. we speculate that this may reflect a deficiency in ourunderstanding of the intrinsic sizes and luminosities of the brightest smgs.the lensed smgs span nearly one decade in l_fir (median l_fir=7.9x10^12 l_sun)and two decades in fir luminosity surface density (median sigma_fir=6.0x10^11l_sun kpc^-2). the strong lenses in this sample and others identified via(sub-)mm surveys will provide a wealth of information regarding theastrophysics of galaxy formation and evolution over a wide range in redshift.

1310.4090	[cii] and 12co(1-0) emission maps in hlsj091828.6+514223: a strongly  lensed interacting system at z=5.24	we present submillimeter array (sma) [cii] 158um and jansky very large array(jvla) $^{12}$co(1-0) line emission maps for the bright, lensed, submillimetersource at $z=5.2430$ behind abell 773: hlsj091828.6+514223 (hls0918). wecombine these measurements with previously reported line profiles, includingmultiple $^{12}$co rotational transitions, [ci], water and [nii], providingsome of the best constraints on the properties of the interstellar medium (ism)in a galaxy at $z&gt;5$. hls0918 has a total far-infrared (fir) luminosityl_fir(8-1000um) = (1.6$\pm$0.1)x10^14 l_sun/mu, where the total magnificationmu_total = 8.9$\pm$1.9, via a new lens model from the [cii] and continuum maps.despite a hylirg luminosity, the fir continuum shape resembles that of a locallirg. we simultaneously fit all of the observed spectral line profiles, findingfour components which correspond cleanly to discrete spatial structuresidentified in the maps. the two most redshifted spectral components occupy thenucleus of a massive galaxy, with a source plane separation &lt;1 kpc. the reddestdominates the continuum map (de-magnified l_fir = (1.1$\pm$0.2)x10^13 l_sun),and excites strong water emission in both nuclear components via a powerful firradiation field from the intense star formation. a third star-forming componentis most likely a region of a merging companion (dv ~ 500 km/s) exhibitinggenerally similar gas properties. the bluest component originates from aspatially distinct region, and photo-dissociation region (pdr) analysissuggests that it is lower density, cooler and forming stars less vigorouslythan the other components. strikingly, it has very strong [nii] emission whichmay suggest an ionized, molecular outflow. this comprehensive view of gasproperties and morphology in hls0918 previews the science possible for a largesample of high-redshift galaxies once alma attains full sensitivity.

1310.4147	the suppression of star formation by powerful active galactic nuclei	the old, red stars which constitute the bulges of galaxies, and the massiveblack holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history whengalaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (agn)shone brightly from accretion onto black holes. it is widely suspected, butunproven, that the tight correlation in mass of the black hole and stellarcomponents results from the agn quenching the surrounding star formation as itapproaches its peak luminosity. x-rays trace emission from agn unambiguously,while powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and arebrightest at infrared to submillimetre wavelengths. here we report observationsin the submillimetre and x-ray which show that rapid star formation was commonin the host galaxies of agn when the universe was 2-6 gyrs old, but that themost vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an x-rayluminosity of 10^44 erg/s. this suppression of star formation in the hostgalaxies of powerful agn is a key prediction of models in which the agn drivesa powerful outflow, expelling the interstellar medium of its host galaxy andtransforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.

1310.7583	hermes: candidate high-redshift galaxies discovered with herschel/spire	we present a method for selecting $z&gt;4$ dusty, star forming galaxies (dsfgs)using herschel/spire 250/350/500 $\mu m$ flux densities to search for redsources. we apply this method to 21 deg$^2$ of data from the hermes survey toproduce a catalog of 38 high-$z$ candidates. follow-up of the first 5 of thesesources confirms that this method is efficient at selecting high-$z$ dsfgs,with 4/5 at $z=4.3$ to $6.3$ (and the remaining source at $z=3.4$), and thatthey are some of the most luminous dusty sources known. comparison withprevious dsfg samples, mostly selected at longer wavelengths (e.g., 850 $\mum$) and in single-band surveys, shows that our method is much more efficient atselecting high-$z$ dsfgs, in the sense that a much larger fraction are at$z&gt;3$. correcting for the selection completeness and purity, we find that thenumber of bright ($s_{500\,\mu m} \ge 30$ mjy), red herschel sources is $3.3\pm 0.8$ deg$^{-2}$. this is much higher than the number predicted by currentmodels, suggesting that the dsfg population extends to higher redshifts thanpreviously believed. if the shape of the luminosity function for high-$z$ dsfgsis similar to that at $z\sim2$, rest-frame uv based studies may be missing asignificant component of the star formation density at $z=4$ to $6$, even aftercorrection for extinction.

1503.08773	planck intermediate results. xxvii. high-redshift infrared galaxy  overdensity candidates and lensed sources discovered by planck and confirmed  by herschel-spire	[abridged] we use the planck all-sky submm and mm maps to search for raresources distinguished by extreme brightness, a few hundreds of mjy, and theirpotential for being situated at high redshift. these "cold" planck sources,selected using the high frequency instrument (hfi) directly from the maps andfrom the planck catalogue of compact sources (pccs), all satisfy the criterionof having their rest-frame far-infrared peak redshifted to the frequency range353 and 857 ghz. this colour-selection favours galaxies in the redshift rangez=2-4, which we consider as cold peaks in the cosmic infrared background (cib).we perform a dedicated herschel-spire follow-up of 234 such planck targets,finding a significant excess of red 350 and 500um sources, in comparison toreference spire fields. about 94% of the spire sources in the planck fields areconsistent with being overdensities of galaxies peaking at 350um. about 3% arecandidate lensed systems, all 12 of which have secure spectroscopicconfirmations, placing them at redshifts z&gt;2.2. the galaxy overdensities aredetected with high significance, half of the sample showing statisticalsignificance above 10sigma. the spire photometric redshifts of galaxies inoverdensities suggest a peak at z~2. under the td=35k assumption, we derive aninfrared (ir) luminosity for each spire source of about 4x10^12 lsun, yieldingstar formation rates of typically 700 msun.yr^-1. if the observed overdensitiesare actual gravitationally-bound structures, the total total star formationrates reaches 7x10^3 msun.yr^-1. taken together, these sources show thesignatures of high-z (z&gt;$) protoclusters of intensively star-forming galaxies.all these observations confirm the uniqueness of our sample and demonstrate theability of the all-sky planck-hfi cold sources to select populations ofcosmological and astrophysical interest for structure formation studies.

0806.3022	thermal emission from warm dust in the most distant quasars	we report new continuum observations of fourteen z~6 quasars at 250 ghz andfourteen quasars at 1.4 ghz. we summarize all recent millimeter and radioobservations of the sample of the thirty-three quasars known with5.71&lt;=z&lt;=6.43, and present a study of the rest frame far-infrared (fir)properties of this sample. these quasars were observed with the max plankmillimeter bolometer array (mambo) at 250 ghz with mjy sensitivity, and 30% ofthem were detected. we also recover the average 250 ghz flux density of themambo undetected sources at 4 sigma, by stacking the on-source measurements.the derived mean radio-to-uv spectral energy distributions (seds) of the fullsample and the 250 ghz non-detections show no significant difference from thatof lower-redshift optical quasars. obvious fir excesses are seen in theindividual seds of the strong 250 ghz detections, with fir-to-radio emissionratios consistent with that of typical star forming galaxies. most 250ghz-detected sources follow the l_{fir}--l_{bol} relationship derived from asample of local ir luminous quasars (l_{ir}&gt;10^{12}l_{\odot}), while theaverage l_{fir}/l_{bol} ratio of the non-detections is consistent with that ofthe optically-selected pg quasars. the mambo detections also tend to haveweaker ly\alpha emission than the non-detected sources. we discuss possible firdust heating sources, and critically assess the possibility of active starformation in the host galaxies of the z~6 quasars. the average star formationrate of the mambo non-detections is likely to be less than a few hundredm_{\odot} yr^{-1}, but in the strong detections, the host galaxy star formationis probably at a rate of \gtrsim10^{3} m_{\odot} yr^{-1}, which dominates thefir dust heating.

astro-ph;0101094	mass-losing semiregular variable stars in baade's windows	by cross-correlating the results of two recent large-scale surveys, thegeneral properties of a well defined sample of semi-regular variable stars havebeen determined. isogal mid-infrared photometry and macho lightcurves areassembled for approximately 300 stars in the baade's windows of low extinctiontowards the galactic bulge. these stars are mainly giants of late m spectraltype, evolving along the asymptotic giant branch (agb). they are found topossess a wide and continuous distribution of pulsation periods and to obey anapproximate log~period -- bolometric magnitude relation or set of suchrelations.  approximate mass-loss rates in the range of 1e-8 to 5e-7 m_sun per year arederived from isogal mid-infrared photometry and models of stellar spectraadjusted for the presence of optically-thin circumstellar silicate dust.mass-loss rates depend on luminosity and pulsation period. some stars lose massas rapidly as short-period miras but do not show mira-like amplitudes. a periodof 70 days or longer is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for massloss to occur.  for agb stars in the mass-loss ranges that we observe, the functionaldependence of mass-loss rate on temperature and luminosity is found to be inagreement with recent theoretical predictions. if we include our mass-lossrates with a sample of extreme mass-losing agb stars in the large magellaniccloud, we get the general result for agb stars that mass-loss rate isproportional to luminosity^{2.7}, valid for agb stars with 10^{-8} to 10^{-4}m_sun per year (abridged).

(2001). we detect seven sources at 1.4 ghz with flux densities, s_{1.4} &gt;50 microjy. these centimeter (cm) wavelength observations imply that themillimeter (mm) emission is most likely thermal dust emission. theradio-through-optical spectral energy distributions for these sources arewithin the broad range defined by lower redshift, lower optical luminosityqsos. for two sources the radio continuum luminosities and morphologiesindicate steep spectrum, radio loud emission from a jet-driven radio source.for the remaining 10 sources the 1.4 ghz flux densities, or limits, areconsistent with those expected for active star forming galaxies. if the radioemission is powered by star formation in these systems, then the implied starformation rates are of order 1e3 m_solar/year. we discuss the angular sizes andspatial distributions of the radio emitting regions, and we consider brieflythese results in the context of co-eval black hole and stellar bulge formationin galaxies.

(2002) based on recent theoreticalmodeling of dust formation of agb stars to determine mass-loss rates. however,the uncertainties in the mass-loss rates are rather large. the mass-loss ratesof the supergiants are comparable with those in the solar neighbourhood whilethe long-period variables cover a mass-loss range from $\rm -5 &lt; log\dot{\it{m}} &lt; -7$. the red giant candidateslie at the lower end of themass-loss rate range between $\rm -6.5 &lt; log \dot{{\it{m}}} &lt; -9$. we used theequivalent width of the co bandhead at 2.3 $\rm \mu m$, the nai doublet and thecai triplet to estimate metallicities using the relation by ram\'{\i}rez et al.(\cite{ramirez2000}). the metallicity distribution of the isogal objects showsa mean [fe/h] $\sim$ -0.25 dex with a dispersion of $\rm \pm 0.40 dex$ which isin agreement with the values of ram\'{i}rez et al.

(2003), a comparison of the line flux ratios withpredictions from a large velocity gradient model suggests that the gas islikely of high excitation, at densities ~10^5 cm^-3 and a temperature ~100 k.since in this case the co lines appear to have moderate optical depths, the gasmust be extended over a few kpc. the gas mass detected in j1148+5251 can fuelstar formation at the rate implied by the far-infrared luminosity for less than10 million years, a time comparable to the dynamical time of the region. thegas must therefore be replenished quickly, and metal and dust enrichment mustoccur fast. the strong dust emission and massive, dense gas reservoir at z~6.4provide further evidence that vigorous star formation is co-eval with the rapidgrowth of massive black holes at these early epochs of the universe.

astro-ph;0409054	a search for dense molecular gas in high redshift infrared-luminous  galaxies	we present a search for hcn emission from four high redshift far infrared(ir) luminous galaxies. current data and models suggest that these high $z$ irluminous galaxies represent a major starburst phase in the formation ofspheroidal galaxies, although many of the sources also host luminous activegalactic nuclei (agn), such that a contribution to the dust heating by the agncannot be precluded. hcn emission is a star formation indicator, tracing densemolecular hydrogen gas within star-forming molecular clouds (n(h$_2$) $\sim10^5$ cm$^{-3}$). hcn luminosity is linearly correlated with ir luminosity forlow redshift galaxies, unlike co emission which can also trace gas at muchlower density. we report a marginal detection of hcn (1-0) emission from the$z=2.5832$ qso j1409+5628, with a velocity integrated line luminosity of$l_{\rm hcn}'=6.7\pm2.2 \times10^{9}$ k km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$, while we obtain3$\sigma$ upper limits to the hcn luminosity of the $z=3.200$ qso j0751+2716 of$l_{\rm hcn}'=1.0\times10^{9}$ k km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$, $l_{\rmhcn}'=1.6\times10^{9}$ k km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$ for the $z= 2.565$ starburst galaxyj1401+0252, and $l_{\rm hcn}'=1.0\times10^{10}$ k km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$ for the $z= 6.42$ qso j1148+5251. we compare the hcn data on these sources, plus threeother high-$z$ ir luminous galaxies, to observations of lower redshiftstar-forming galaxies. the values of the hcn/far-ir luminosity ratios (orlimits) for all the high $z$ sources are within the scatter of the relationshipbetween hcn and far-ir emission for low $z$ star-forming galaxies (truncated).

astro-ph;9904010	isogal survey of baade's windows in the mid-infrared	the isogal mid-infrared survey of areas close to the galactic plane aims todetermine their stellar content and its possible bearing on the history of thegalaxy. the ngc6522 and sgr i baade's windows of low obscuration towards theinner parts of the bulge represent ideal places in which to calibrate andunderstand the isogal colour-magnitude diagrams.  the survey observations were made with the isocam instrument of the isosatellite. the filter bands chosen were lw2(~7 microns) and lw3(~15 microns).  the results presented here show that most of the detected objects are latem-type giants on the agb, with a cut-off for those earlier than m3-m4. the mostluminous members of these two bulge fields at 7 microns are the mira variables.however, it is evident that they represent the end of a sequence of increasing15 micron dust emission which commences with m giants of earlier sub-type.  in observations of late-type giants the isocam 15 micron band is mainlysensitive to the cool silicate or aluminate dust shells which overwhelm thephotospheric emission. however, in ordinary m-giant stars, the 7 micron band isnot strongly affected by dust emission and may be influenced instead byabsorption. the nu2 band of water at 6.25 microns and the sio fundamental at7.9 microns are likely contribitors to this effect.  a group of late m stars has been found which vary little or not at all buthave infrared colours typical of well-developed dust shells. their luminositiesare similar to those of 200-300 day miras but they have slightly redder[7]-[15] colours which form an extension of the ordinary m giant sequence.  the mira dust shells show a mid-infrared [7]-[15] colour-period relation. ca700 days.
