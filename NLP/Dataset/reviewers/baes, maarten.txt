1001.2303	radiative transfer in disc galaxies iv - the effects of dust attenuation  on bulge and disc structural parameters	combining monte carlo radiative transfer simulations and accurate 2dbulge/disc decompositions, we present a new study to investigate the effects ofdust attenuation on the apparent structural properties of the disc and bulge ofspiral galaxies. we find that dust affects the results from such decompositionsin ways which cannot be identified when one studies dust effects on bulge anddisc components separately. in particular, the effects of dust in galaxieshosting pseudo-bulges might be different from those in galaxies hostingclassical bulges, even if their dust content is identical. confirming previousresults, we find that disc scale lengths are overestimated when dust effectsare important. in addition, we also find that bulge effective radii and sersicindices are underestimated. furthermore, the apparent attenuation of theintegrated disc light is underestimated, whereas the corresponding attenuationof bulge light is overestimated. dust effects are more significant for thebulge parameters, and, combined, they lead to a strong underestimation of thebulge-to-disc ratio, which can reach a factor of two in the v band, even atrelatively low galaxy inclinations and dust opacities. nevertheless, it neverreaches factors larger than about three, which corresponds to a factor of twoin bulge-to-total ratio. such effect can have an impact on studies of the blackhole/bulge scaling relations.

1106.0618	the herschel virgo cluster survey. ix. dust-to-gas mass ratio and  metallicity gradients in four virgo spiral galaxies	using herschel data from the open time key project the herschel virgo clustersurvey (hevics), we investigated the relationship between the metallicitygradients expressed by metal abundances in the gas phase as traced by thechemical composition of hii regions, and in the solid phase, as traced by thedust-to-gas mass ratio. we derived the radial gradient of the dust-to-gas massratio for all galaxies observed by hevics whose metallicity gradients areavailable in the literature. they are all late type sbc galaxies, namelyngc4254, ngc4303, ngc4321, and ngc4501. we examined different dependencies onmetallicity of the co-to-h$_2$ conversion factor (\xco), used to transform the$^{12}$co observations into the amount of molecular hydrogen. we found that inthese galaxies the dust-to-gas mass ratio radial profile is extremely sensitiveto choice of the \xco\ value, since the molecular gas is the dominant componentin the inner parts. we found that for three galaxies of our sample, namelyngc4254, ngc4321, and ngc4501, the slopes of the oxygen and of the dust-to-gasradial gradients agree up to $\sim$0.6-0.7r$_{25}$ using \xco\ values in therange 1/3-1/2 galactic \xco. for ngc4303 a lower value of \xco$\sim0.1\times$10$^{20}$ is necessary. we suggest that such low \xco\ values might be due to ametallicity dependence of \xco (from close to linear for ngc4254, ngc4321, andngc4501 to superlinear for ngc4303), especially in the radial regionsr$_g&lt;$0.6-0.7r$_{25}$ where the molecular gas dominates. on the other hand, theouter regions, where the atomic gas component is dominant, are less affected bythe choice of \xco, and thus we cannot put constraints on its value.

1106.1643	the reliability of [cii] as a star formation rate indicator	the [cii] 157.74 \mu m line is an important coolant for the neutralinterstellar gas. since [cii] is the brightest spectral line for most galaxies,it is a potentially powerful tracer of star formation activity. in this paperwe present a calibration of the star formation rate as a function of the [cii]luminosity for a sample of 24 star-forming galaxies in the nearby universe.this sample includes objects classified as hii regions or liners, but omits allseyfert galaxies with a significant agn contribution to the mid-infraredphotometry. in order to calibrate the sfr against the line luminosity, we relyon both galex fuv data, which is an ideal tracer of the unobscured starformation, and mips 24 \mu m, to probe the dust-enshrouded fraction of starformation. in case of normal star-forming galaxies, the [cii] luminositycorrelates well with the star formation rate. however, the extension of thisrelation to more quiescent (halpha ew &lt;= 10 a) or ultraluminous galaxies shouldbe handled with caution, since these objects show a non-linearity in thel([cii])-to-l(fir) ratio as a function of l(fir) (and thus, their starformation activity).  we provide two possible explanations for the origin of the tight correlationbetween the [cii] emission and the star formation activity on a globalgalaxy-scale. a first interpretation could be that the [cii] emission from pdrsarises from the immediate surroundings of star-forming regions. since pdrs areneutral regions of warm dense gas at the boundaries between hii regions andmolecular clouds and they provide the bulk of [cii] emission in most galaxies,we believe that a more or less constant contribution from these outer layers ofphoton-dominated molecular clumps to the [cii] emission provides astraightforward explanation for this close link between the [cii] luminosityand sfr. alternatively,...

1108.5056	efficient 3d nlte dust radiative transfer with skirt	we present an updated version of skirt, a 3d monte carlo radiative transfercode developed to simulate dusty galaxies. the main novel characteristics ofthe skirt code are the use of a stellar foam to generate random positions, anefficient combination of eternal forced scattering and continuous absorption,and a new library approach that links the radiative transfer code to the dustemdust emission library. this approach enables a fast, accurate andself-consistent calculation of the dust emission of arbitrary mixtures oftransiently heated dust grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, even forfull 3d models containing millions of dust cells. we have demonstrated theaccuracy of the skirt code through a set of simulations based on the edge-onspiral galaxy ugc 4754. the models we ran were gradually refined from a smooth,2d, lte model to a fully 3d model that includes nlte dust emission and a clumpystructure of the dusty ism. we find that clumpy models absorb uv and opticalradiation less efficiently than smooth models with the same amount of dust, andthat the dust in clumpy models is on average both cooler and less luminous. oursimulations demonstrate that, given the appropriate use of optimizationtechniques, it is possible to efficiently and accurately run monte carloradiative transfer simulations of arbitrary 3d structures of several milliondust cells, including a full calculation of the nlte emission by arbitrary dustmixtures.

1109.0212	panchromatic radiative transfer modeling of stars and dust in the  sombrero galaxy	we present a detailed study of the dust energy balance in the sombrero galaxym104. from a full radiative transfer analysis, including scattering, absorptionand thermal re-emission, we construct models that can reproduce images atoptical/near-infrared wavelengths, the observed stellar sed and the minor axisextinction profiles in the v and r_c band. a standard model, that contains onlyan old stellar population to heat the dust, underestimates the observations ofdust emission at infrared wavelengths by a factor of ~ 3. supplementing thisbasic model with a young stellar component of low star formation activity inboth the inner disk (sfr ~ 0.21 msun/yr) and dust ring (sfr ~ 0.05 msun/yr), weare capable of solving the discrepancy in the dust energy budget of thesombrero galaxy at wavelengths shortwards of 100 \mum. to account for theincreased fir/submm emission beyond 100 \mum, we propose a additional dustcomponent distributed in quiescent clumps. this model with a clumpy duststructure predicts three-quarters of the total dust content (~ 2.8 x 10^7 msun)to reside in compact dust clouds with no associated embedded sources. althoughthe assumption of a clumpy dust structure in the sombrero galaxy is supportedby high-resolution optical data, we cannot rule out the possibility that dustgrains with a higher dust emissivity account for part of the discrepancy in theenergy budget at submm wavelengths.

1109.1286	three-dimensional radiative transfer modeling of agn dusty tori as a  clumpy two-phase medium	we investigate the emission of active galactic nuclei (agn) dusty tori in theinfrared domain. following theoretical predictions coming from hydrodynamicalsimulations, we model the dusty torus as a 3d two-phase medium withhigh-density clumps and low-density medium filling the space between theclumps. spectral energy distributions (sed) and images of the torus atdifferent wavelengths are obtained using 3d monte carlo radiative transfer codeskirt. our approach of generating clumpy structure allows us to model tori withsingle clumps, complex structures of merged clumps or interconnectedsponge-like structure. a corresponding set of clumps-only models and modelswith smooth dust distribution is calculated for comparison. we found that dustdistribution, optical depth, clump size and their actual arrangement in theinnermost region, all have an impact on the shape of near- and mid-infraredsed. the 10 micron silicate feature can be suppressed for some parameters, butmodels with smooth dust distribution are also able to produce a wide range ofthe silicate feature strength. finally, we find that having the dustdistributed in a two-phase medium, might offer a natural solution to the lackof emission in the near-infrared, compared to observed data, which affectsclumpy models currently available in the literature.

1202.0547	can dust emission be used to map the interstellar medium in  high-redshift galaxies? results from the herschel reference survey	it has often been suggested that an alternative to the standard co/21-cmmethod for estimating the mass of the interstellar medium (ism) in a galaxymight be to estimate the mass of the ism from the continuum dust emission. inthis paper, we investigate the potential of this technique using herschelobservations of ten galaxies in the herschel reference survey and in theherschel virgo cluster survey. we show that the emission detected by herschelis mostly from dust that has a temperature and emissivity index similar to thatof dust in the local ism in our galaxy, with the temperature generallyincreasing towards the centre of each galaxy. we calibrate the dust methodusing the co and 21-cm observations to provide an independent estimate of themass of hydrogen in each galaxy, solving the problem of the uncertain `xfactor' for the molecular gas by minimizing the dispersion in the ratio of themasses estimated using the two methods. with the calibration for the dustmethod and the estimate of the x-factor produced in this way, the dispersion inthe ratio of the two gas masses is 30%, which gives an upper limit on thefundamental accuracy of the dust method. the calibration we obtain for the dustmethod is very similar to an independent herschel measurement for m31 and tothe calibration for the milky way from planck measurements.

1207.0548	gravitational microlensing of agn dusty tori	we investigated the gravitational microlensing of active galactic nucleusdusty tori in the case of lensed quasars in the infrared domain. the dustytorus is modeled as a clumpy two-phase medium. to obtain spectral energydistributions and images of tori at different wavelengths, we used the 3d montecarlo radiative transfer code skirt. a ray-shooting technique has been used tocalculate microlensing magnification maps. we simulated microlensing by thestars in the lens galaxy for different configurations of the lensed system anddifferent values of the torus parameters, in order to estimate (a) amplitudesand timescales of high magnification events, and (b) the influence ofgeometrical and physical properties of dusty tori on light curves in theinfrared domain. we found that, despite their large size, dusty tori could besignificantly affected by microlensing in some cases, especially in thenear-infrared domain (rest-frame). the very long time-scales of such events, inthe range from several decades to hundreds of years, are limiting the practicaluse of this method to study the properties of dusty tori. however, our resultsindicate that, when studying flux ratios between the images in differentwavebands of lensed quasars, one should not disregard the possibility that thenear and mid-infrared flux ratios could be under the influence of microlensing.

1308.6130	the herschel virgo cluster survey xiv: transition-type dwarf galaxies in  the virgo cluster	we use dust scaling relations to investigate the hypothesis that virgocluster transition-type dwarfs are infalling star-forming field galaxies, whichis argued based on their optical features (e.g. disks, spiral arms, bars) andkinematic properties similar to late-type galaxies. after their infall,environmental effects gradually transform them into early-type galaxies throughthe removal of their interstellar medium and quenching of all star formationactivity. in this paper, we aim to verify whether this hypothesis holds usingfar-infrared diagnostics based on herschel observations of the virgo clustertaken as part of the herschel virgo cluster survey (hevics). we selecttransition-type objects in the nearest cluster, virgo, based on spectraldiagnostics indicative for their residual or ongoing star formation. we detectdust md ~ 10^{5-6} msun in 36% of the transition-type dwarfs located on thehigh end of the stellar mass distribution. this suggests that the dustreservoirs present in non-detections fall just below the herschel detectionlimit (&lt; 1.1x10^5 msun). dust scaling relations support the hypothesis of atransformation between infalling late-type galaxies to quiescent low-massspheroids governed by environmental effects, with dust-to-stellar massfractions for transition-type dwarfs in between values characteristic forlate-type objects and the lower dust fractions observed in early-type galaxies.several transition-type dwarfs demonstrate blue central cores, hinting at theradially outside-in removal of gas and quenching of star formation activity.the fact that dust is also confined to the inner regions suggests that metalsare stripped in the outer regions along with the gas. in the scenario of mostdust being stripped from the galaxy along with the gas, we argue that...(abridged)

1310.1854	using 3d voronoi grids in radiative transfer simulations	probing the structure of complex astrophysical objects requires effectivethree-dimensional (3d) numerical simulation of the relevant radiative transfer(rt) processes. as with any numerical simulation code, the choice of anappropriate discretization is crucial. adaptive grids with cuboidal cells suchas octrees have proven very popular, however several recently introducedhydrodynamical and rt codes are based on a voronoi tessellation of the spatialdomain. such an unstructured grid poses new challenges in laying down the rays(straight paths) needed in rt codes. we show that it is straightforward toimplement accurate and efficient rt on 3d voronoi grids. we present a methodfor computing straight paths between two arbitrary points through a 3d voronoigrid in the context of a rt code. we implement such a grid in our rt codeskirt, using the open source library voro++ to obtain the relevant propertiesof the voronoi grid cells based solely on the generating points. we compare theresults obtained through the voronoi grid with those generated by an octreegrid for two synthetic models, and we perform the well-known pascucci rtbenchmark using the voronoi grid. the presented algorithm produces correctresults for our test models. shooting photon packages through the geometricallymuch more complex 3d voronoi grid is only about three times slower than theequivalent process in an octree grid with the same number of cells, while infact the total number of voronoi grid cells may be lower for an equally goodrepresentation of the density field. we conclude that the benefits of using avoronoi grid in rt simulation codes will often outweigh the somewhat slowerperformance.

1310.4829	g2c2 ii: integrated colour-metallicity relations for galactic globular  clusters in sdss passbands	we use our integrated sdss photometry for 96 globular clusters in $g$ and$z$, as well as $r$ and $i$ photometry for a subset of 56 clusters, to derivethe integrated colour-metallicity relation (cmr) for galactic globularclusters. we compare this relation to previous work, including extragalacticclusters, and examine the influence of age, present-day mass functionvariations, structural parameters and the morphology of the horizontal branchon the relation. moreover, we scrutinise the scatter introduced by foregroundextinction (including differential reddening) and show that the scatter in thecolour-metallicity relation can be significantly reduced combining tworeddening laws from the literature. in all cmrs we find some low-reddeningyoung gcs that are offset to the cmr. most of these outliers are associatedwith the sagittarius system. simulations show that this is due less to age thanto a different enrichment history. finally, we introduce colour-metallicityrelations based on the infrared calcium triplet, which are clearly non-linearwhen compared to $(g^\prime-i^\prime)$ and $(g^\prime-z^\prime)$ colours.

1312.2522	herschel spire-fts observations of excited co and [ci] in the antennae  (ngc 4038/39): warm and cold molecular gas	we present herschel spire-fts observations of the antennae (ngc 4038/39), awell studied, nearby ($22$ mpc) ongoing merger between two gas rich spiralgalaxies. we detect 5 co transitions ($j=4-3$ to $j=8-7$), both [ci]transitions and the [nii]$205\mu m$ transition across the entire system, whichwe supplement with ground based observations of the co $j=1-0$, $j=2-1$ and$j=3-2$ transitions, and herschel pacs observations of [cii] and [oi]$63\mu m$.using the co and [ci] transitions, we perform both a lte analysis of [ci], anda non-lte radiative transfer analysis of co and [ci] using the radiativetransfer code radex along with a bayesian likelihood analysis. we find thatthere are two components to the molecular gas: a cold ($t_{kin}\sim 10-30$ k)and a warm ($t_{kin} \gtrsim 100$ k) component. by comparing the warm gas massto previously observed values, we determine a co abundance in the warm gas of$x_{co} \sim 5\times 10^{-5}$. if the co abundance is the same in the warm andcold gas phases, this abundance corresponds to a co $j=1-0$ luminosity-to-massconversion factor of $\alpha_{co} \sim 7 \ m_{\odot}{pc^{-2} \ (k \ km \s^{-1})^{-1}}$ in the cold component, similar to the value for normal spiralgalaxies. we estimate the cooling from h$_2$, [cii], co and [oi]$63\mu m$ to be$\sim 0.01 l_{\odot}/m_{\odot}$. we compare pdr models to the ratio of the fluxof various co transitions, along with the ratio of the co flux to thefar-infrared flux in ngc 4038, ngc 4039 and the overlap region. we find thatthe densities recovered from our non-lte analysis are consistent with abackground far-ultraviolet field of strength $g_0\sim 1000$. finally, we findthat a combination of turbulent heating, due to the ongoing merger, andsupernova and stellar winds are sufficient to heat the molecular gas.

1402.4075	the applicability of fir fine-structure lines as star formation rate  tracers over wide ranges of metallicities and galaxy types	we analyze the applicability of far-infrared fine-structure lines [cii] 158micron, [oi] 63 micron and [oiii] 88 micron to reliably trace the starformation rate (sfr) in a sample of low-metallicity dwarf galaxies from theherschel dwarf galaxy survey and compare with a broad sample of galaxies ofvarious types and metallicities in the literature. we study the trends andscatter in the relation between the sfr (as traced by galex fuv and mips 24micron) and far-infrared line emission, on spatially resolved and global galaxyscales, in dwarf galaxies. we assemble far-infrared line measurements from theliterature and infer whether the far-infrared lines can probe the sfr (astraced by the total-infrared luminosity) in a variety of galaxy populations. inmetal-poor dwarfs, the [oi] and [oiii] lines show the strongest correlationwith the sfr with an uncertainty on the sfr estimates better than a factor of2, while the link between [cii] emission and the sfr is more dispersed(uncertainty factor of 2.6). the increased scatter in the sfr-l([cii]) relationtowards low metal abundances, warm dust temperatures, large filling factors ofdiffuse, highly ionized gas suggests that other cooling lines start to dominatedepending on the density and ionization state of the gas. for the literaturesample, we evaluate the correlations for a number of different galaxypopulations. the [cii] and [oi] lines are considered to be reliable sfr tracersin starburst galaxies, recovering the star formation activity within anuncertainty of factor 2.

1403.7527	the distribution of interstellar dust in califa edge-on galaxies via  oligochromatic radiative transfer fitting	we investigate the amount and spatial distribution of interstellar dust inedge-on spiral galaxies, using detailed radiative transfer modeling of ahomogeneous sample of 12 galaxies selected from the califa survey. ourautomated fitting routine, fitskirt, was first validated against artificialdata. this is done by simultaneously reproducing the sdss $g$-, $r$-, $i$- and$z$-band observations of a toy model in order to combine the informationpresent in the different bands. we show that this combined, oligochromaticfitting, has clear advantages over standard monochromatic fitting especiallyregarding constraints on the dust properties. we model all galaxies in oursample using a three-component model, consisting of a double exponential discto describe the stellar and dust discs and using a s\'ersic profile to describethe central bulge. the full model contains 19 free parameters, and we are ableto constrain all these parameters to a satisfactory level of accuracy withouthuman intervention or strong boundary conditions. apart from two galaxies, theentire sample can be accurately reproduced by our model. we find that the dustdisc is about 75% more extended but only half as high as the stellar disc. theaverage face-on optical depth in the v-band is $0.76$ and the spread of $0.60$within our sample is quite substantial, which indicates that some spiralgalaxies are relatively opaque even when seen face-on.

1407.7040	the eagle project: simulating the evolution and assembly of galaxies and  their environments	we introduce the virgo consortium's eagle project, a suite of hydrodynamicalsimulations that follow the formation of galaxies and black holes inrepresentative volumes. we discuss the limitations of such simulations in lightof their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and howthese affect their predictive power. one major improvement is our treatment offeedback from massive stars and agn in which thermal energy is injected intothe gas without the need to turn off cooling or hydrodynamical forces, allowingwinds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. becausethe feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, wecalibrate them to the z~0 galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of thegalaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account.the observed galaxy mass function is reproduced to $\lesssim 0.2$ dex over thefull mass range, $10^8 &lt; m_*/m_\odot \lesssim 10^{11}$, a level of agreementclose to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented forhydrodynamical simulations. we compare our results to a representative set oflow-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find goodagreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passivefractions, tully-fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxyclusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic civ and ovi. whilethe mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent withobservations for $m_* \gtrsim 10^9 m_\odot$, they are insufficiently steep atlower masses. the gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters ofgalaxies, but for groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting ahigher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for agn feedback. eagleconstitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.

1409.7811	spectral and morphological analysis of the remnant of supernova 1987a  with alma &amp; atca	we present a comprehensive spectral and morphological analysis of the remnantof supernova (sn) 1987a with the australia telescope compact array (atca) andthe atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array (alma). the non-thermal andthermal components of the radio emission are investigated in images from 94 to672 ghz ($\lambda$ 3.2 mm to 450 $\mu$m), with the assistance of ahigh-resolution 44 ghz synchrotron template from the atca, and a dust templatefrom alma observations at 672 ghz. an analysis of the emission distributionover the equatorial ring in images from 44 to 345 ghz highlights a gradualdecrease of the east-to-west asymmetry ratio with frequency. we attribute thisto the shorter synchrotron lifetime at high frequencies. across the transitionfrom radio to far infrared, both the synchrotron/dust-subtracted images and thespectral energy distribution (sed) suggest additional emission beside the mainsynchrotron component ($s_{\nu}\propto\nu^{-0.73}$) and the thermal componentoriginating from dust grains at $t\sim22$ k. this excess could be due tofree-free flux or emission from grains of colder dust. however, a secondflat-spectrum synchrotron component appears to better fit the sed, implyingthat the emission could be attributed to a pulsar wind nebula (pwn). theresidual emission is mainly localised west of the sn site, as the spectralanalysis yields $-0.4\lesssim\alpha\lesssim-0.1$ across the western regions,with $\alpha\sim0$ around the central region. if there is a pwn in the remnantinterior, these data suggest that the pulsar may be offset westward from the snposition.

1505.04567	dust energy balance study of two edge-on spiral galaxies in the  herschel-atlas survey	interstellar dust in galaxies can be traced either through its extinctioneffects on the star light, or through its thermal emission at infraredwavelengths. recent radiative transfer studies of several nearby edge-ongalaxies have found an apparent inconsistency in the dust energy balance: theradiative transfer models that successfully explain the optical extinctionunderestimate the observed fluxes by an average factor of three. we investigatethe dust energy balance for ic4225 and ngc5166, two edge-on spiral galaxiesobserved by the herschel space observatory in the frame of the h-atlas survey.we start from models which were constrained from optical data and extend themto construct the entire spectral energy distribution of our galaxies. thesepredicted values are subsequently compared to the observed far-infrared fluxes.we find that including a young stellar population in the modelling is necessaryas it plays a non-negligible part in the heating of the dust grains. while themodelling approach for both galaxies is nearly identical, we find two verydifferent results. as is often seen in other edge-on spiral galaxies, thefar-infrared emission of our radiative transfer model of ic4225 underestimatesthe observed fluxes by a factor of about three. for ngc5166 on the other hand,we find that both the predicted spectral energy distribution as well as thesimulated images match the observations particularly well. we explore possiblereasons for this difference and conclude that it is unlikely that one singlemechanism is the cause of the dust energy balance problem in spiral galaxies.we discuss the different approaches that can be considered in order to get aconclusive answer on the origin this discrepancy.

1512.03059	multi-wavelength lens reconstruction of a planck \&amp;  \textit{herschel}-detected starbursting galaxy	we present a reconstruction of a {\it herschel} and planck detectedgravitationally-lensed dusty star-forming galaxy (dsfg) at $z=1.68$ using {\ithubble}, sub-millimeter array (sma), and keck observations. the backgroundsub-millimeter galaxy (smg) is strongly lensed by a foreground galaxy clusterat z=0.997 and appears as an arc of length $\sim 15"$ in the optical images.the continuum dust emission, as seen by sma, is limited to a single knot withinthis arc. we present a lens model with source plane reconstructions at severalwavelengths to show the difference in magnifications between the stars and thedust and highlight the importance of a multi-wavelength lens models for studiesinvolving lensed dsfgs. we estimate the physical properties of the galaxy byfitting the flux densities to model seds leading to a magnification-correctedstar-formation rate of $390 \pm 60$ m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ and a stellar mass of$1.1 \pm 0.4\times 10^{11}$m$_{\odot}$. these values are consistent withhigh-redshift massive galaxies that have formed most of their stars already.using the co $j = 2 \to 1$ line intensity we calculate the co-h$_2$ conversionfactor to be $1.02 \pm 0.13~$ m$_{\odot}$(k km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$)$^{-1}$,consistent with the value of $\sim 0.8$ that is typically used to estimate themolecular gas masses of ultra-luminous galaxies. the estimated gas-to-baryonfraction, molecular gas surface density, and sfr surface density have values of$0.44 \pm 0.14$, $320 \pm 130$ m$_{\odot}$pc$^{-2}$, and $\sim 33 \pm14~$m$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$, respectively. the ratio ofstar-formation-rate surface density to molecular gas surface density is higherthan that of other measured smgs and local ulirgs suggesting a rapid gasconsumption time for this galaxy compared to other dsfgs.

astro-ph;0006110	kinematics of elliptical galaxies with a diffuse dust component - ii.  dust effects on kinematic modelling	observations have demonstrated the presence of substantial amounts ofinterstellar dust in elliptical galaxies, most of which is believed to bedistributed diffusely over the galaxy. absorption by dust grains has a majorimpact on the transfer of stellar radiation, and affects the projection of eachphysical (and kinematic) quantity. in a previous paper, we have investigatedthe effects of a diffusely distributed dust component on the observedkinematics of spherical galaxies. in this paper we investigate the effect ofnot taking dust into account in dynamical modelling procedures. we use a set ofsemi-analytical dusty galaxy models to create synthetic losvd data sets, whichwe then model as if no dust were present.  we find some considerable differences between the best-fitting models and theinput models, and we find that these differences are dependent on the orbitalstructure of the input galaxy. for radial and isotropic models on the one hand,we find that the dynamical mass of the models decreases nearly linearly withoptical depth, with an amount of 5 per cent per optical depth unit, whereastheir orbital structure is hardly affected. for tangential models on the otherhand, the dynamical mass decrease is smaller, but their orbital structure isaffected: their distribution functions appears less tangentially anisotropic.for all models the mass-to-light ratio will be underestimated, by a factor ofaround 20 per cent per optical depth unit.  we discuss these results in the light of the limited effects of dustextinction on the losvds, as obtained in paper i, and conclude that thedetermination of the dynamical mass and the kinematic structure of galaxies...(for full abstract, see paper)

astro-ph;0105079	radiative transfer in disc galaxies i - a comparison of four methods to  solve the transfer equation in plane-parallel geometry	accurate photometric and kinematic modelling of disc galaxies requires theinclusion of radiative transfer models. due to the complexity of the radiativetransfer equation (rte), sophisticated techniques are required. varioustechniques have been employed for the attenuation in disc galaxies, but aquantitative comparison of them is difficult, because of the differingassumptions, approximations and accuracy requirements which are adopted in theliterature. in this paper, we present an unbiased comparison of four methods tosolve the rte, in terms of accuracy, efficiency and flexibility. we apply themall on one problem that can serve as a first approximation of large portions ofdisc galaxies: a one-dimensional plane-parallel geometry, with both absorptionand multiple scattering taken into account, with an arbitrary verticaldistributions of stars and dust and an arbitrary angular redistribution of thescattering. we find that the spherical harmonics method is by far the mostefficient way to solve the rte, whereas both monte carlo simulations and theiteration method, which are straightforward to extend to more complexgeometries, have a cost which is about 170 times larger.

astro-ph;0111137	dark matter halos around elliptical galaxies: how reliable is the  stellar kinematical evidence ?	hierarchical models of galaxy formation and various observational evidencesuggest that elliptical galaxies are, like disk galaxies, embedded in massivedark matter halos. stellar kinematics are considered the most important tracerfor this dark halo at a few effective radii. using detailed modelingtechniques, several authors have recently presented stellar kinematicalevidence of a dark halo for a number of elliptical galaxies. in these modelingtechniques, dust attenuation (absorption and scattering of starlight by dustgrains) has not been taken into account. nevertheless, elliptical galaxiescontain a significant amount of interstellar dust, which affects all observablequantities, including the observed kinematics. we constructed a set ofdynamical models for elliptical galaxies, in which dust attenuation is includedthrough a monte carlo technique. we find that a dust component, shallower thanthe stellar distribution and with an optical depth of order unity, affects theobserved kinematics significantly, in the way that it mimics the presence of adark halo. if such dust distributions are realistic in elliptical galaxies, weare faced with a new mass-dust degeneracy. taking dust into account indynamical modeling procedures will hence reduce or may even eliminate the needfor a dark matter halo at a few effective radii.

astro-ph;0205024	kinematics of elliptical galaxies with a diffuse dust component - iii. a  monte carlo approach to include the effects of scattering	this paper is the third one in a series, intended to investigate how theobserved kinematics of elliptical galaxies are affected by dust attenuation. inpaper i and paper ii, we investigated the effects of dust absorption; here weextend our modelling in order to include the effects of scattering. we describehow kinematical information can be combined with the radiative transferequation, and present a monte carlo code that can handle kinematicalinformation in an elegant way.  compared to the case where only absorption is taken into account, we findthat dust attenuation considerably affects the observed kinematics whenscattering is included. for the central lines of sight, dust can eitherdecrease or increase the central observed velocity dispersion. the mostimportant effect of dust attenuation, however, is found at large projectedradii. the kinematics at these lines of sight are strongly affected by photonsscattered into these lines of sight, which were emitted by high-velocity starsin the central regions of the galaxy. these photons bias the losvds towardshigh line-of-sight velocities, and significantly increase the observed velocitydispersion and losvd shape parameters. these effects are similar to theexpected kinematical signature of a dark matter halo, such that dustattenuation may form an alternative explanation for the usual stellarkinematical evidence for dark matter halos around elliptical galaxies.  we apply our results to discuss several other topics in galactic dynamics,where we feel dust attenuation should be taken into account. in particular, weargue that the kinematics observed at various wavelengths can help to constrainthe spatial distribution of dust in elliptical galaxies.

astro-ph;0302359	galaxies as fluctuations in the ionizing background radiation at low  redshift	some lyman continuum photons are likely to escape from most galaxies, andthese can play an important role in ionizing gas around and between galaxies,including gas that gives rise to lyman alpha absorption. thus the gassurrounding galaxies and in the intergalactic medium will be exposed to varyingamounts of ionizing radiation depending upon the distances, orientations, andluminosities of any nearby galaxies. the ionizing background can berecalculated at any point within a simulation by adding the flux from thegalaxies to a uniform quasar contribution. normal galaxies are found to almostalways make some contribution to the ionizing background radiation at redshiftzero, as seen by absorbers and at random points in space. assuming that about 2percent of ionizing photons escape from a galaxy like the milky way, we findthat normal galaxies make a contribution of at least 30 to 40 percent of theassumed quasar background. lyman alpha absorbers with a wide range of neutralcolumn densities are found to be exposed to a wide range of ionization rates,although the distribution of photoionization rates for absorbers is found to bestrongly peaked. on average, less highly ionized absorbers are found to arisefarther from luminous galaxies, while local fluctuations in the ionization rateare seen around galaxies having a wide range of properties.

astro-ph;0304501	radiative transfer in disc galaxies -- iii. the observed kinematics of  dusty disc galaxies	we present skirt (stellar kinematics including radiative transfer), a newmonte carlo radiative transfer code that allows the calculation of the observedstellar kinematics of a dusty galaxy. the code incorporates the effects of bothabsorption and scattering by interstellar dust grains, and calculates thedoppler shift of the emerging radiation exactly by taking into account thevelocities of the emitting stars and the individual scattering dust grains. thecode supports arbitrary distributions of dust through a cellular approach,whereby the integration through the dust is optimized by means of a novelefficient trilinear interpolation technique.  we apply our modelling technique to calculate the observed kinematics ofrealistic models for dusty disc galaxies. we find that the effects of dust onthe mean projected velocity and projected velocity dispersion are severe foredge-on galaxies. for galaxies which deviate more than a few degrees fromexactly edge-on, the effects are already strongly reduced. as a consequence,dust attenuation cannot serve as a possible way to reconcile the discrepancybetween the observed shallow slopes of the inner rotation curves of lsbgalaxies and the predictions of cdm cosmological models. for face-on galaxies,the velocity dispersion increases with increasing dust mass due to scattering,but the effects are limited, even for extended dust distributions. finally, weshow that serious errors can be made when the individual velocities of the dustgrains are neglected in the calculations.

astro-ph;0402527	a completely analytical family of dynamical models for spherical  galaxies and bulges with a central black hole	we present a family of spherical models for elliptical galaxies and bulgesconsisting of a stellar component and a central black hole. all models in thisfamily share the same stellar density profile, which has a steep central cusp.the gravitational potential of each models is a linear combination of thepotential generated selfconsistently by the stars and the potential of acentral black hole. the relative importance of these two contributions is afree parameter in the models. assuming an isotropic dynamical structure, almostall kinematical properties of these models can be calculated analytically. inparticular, they form the first simple dynamical models for galaxies with acentral black hole where the distribution function and differential energydistribution can be written completely in terms of elementary functions only.we also present various extensions of this family to models with anisotropicorbital structures. also for these dynamical models, the distribution functionand its moments can be expressed completely in terms of elementary functions.  this family is useful for a large range of applications, in particular togenerate initial conditions for n-body and hydrodynamical simulations to modelgalactic nuclei with a central black hole.

astro-ph;0405477	the hi detection of low column density clouds and galaxies	the hideep survey (minchin et al. 2003) was done in an attempt to findobjects having low inferred neutral hydrogen column densities, yet they found adistribution which was strongly peaked at 10^20.65 cm^-2. in an attempt tounderstand this distribution and similar survey results, we model hi profilesof gas discs and use simple simulations of objects having a wide range of hiproperties in the presence of an ionizing background. we find that inferredcolumn density (n_hi^o) values, which are found by averaging total hi massesover some disc area, do not vary strongly with central column density (n_max)for detectable objects, so that even a population having a wide range of n_maxvalues will give rise to a strongly peaked distribution of n_hi^o values. wefind that populations of objects, having a wide range of model parameters, giverise to inferred column density distributions around 10^20.6+/-0.3 cm^-2.however, populations of fairly massive objects having a wide range of centralcolumn densities work best in reproducing the hideep data, and thesepopulations are also consistent with observed lyman limit absorber counts. itmay be necessary to look two orders of magnitude fainter than hideep limits todetect ionized objects having central column densities &lt;10^20 cm^-2, but theinferred column densities of already detected objects might be lower if theirradii could be estimated more accurately.

astro-ph;0411202	the dynamical structure of isotropic spherical galaxies with a central  black hole	we discuss the kinematical structure of a two-parameter family of isotropicmodels with a central black hole. the family contains the slope of the centraldensity cusp and the relative black hole mass as parameters. most of the basickinematical quantities of these models can be expressed analytically. thisfamily contains three distinct models where also the distribution function,differential energy distribution and spatial losvds can be expressed completelyanalytically. each of these models show a drastically different behaviour ofthe distribution function. although the effect of a black hole on thedistribution function is very strong, in particular for models with a shallowdensity cusp, the differential energy distribution is only marginally affected.we discuss in detail the effects of a central black hole on the losvds. theprojected velocity dispersion increases with black hole mass at small projectedradii, but the effect of a black hole on the shape of the losvds (characterizedby the h4 parameter) is less straightforward to interpret. too much reliance onthe wings of the losvds and the value of the h4 parameter to determine blackhole masses might hence be dangerous.

astro-ph;0504037	radiative equilibrium in monte carlo radiative transfer using frequency  distribution adjustment	the monte carlo method is a powerful tool for performing radiativeequilibrium calculations, even in complex geometries. the main drawback of thestandard monte carlo radiative equilibrium methods is that they requireiteration, which makes them numerically very demanding. bjorkman &amp; woodrecently proposed a frequency distribution adjustment scheme, which allowsradiative equilibrium monte carlo calculations to be performed withoutiteration, by choosing the frequency of each re-emitted photon such that itcorrects for the incorrect spectrum of the previously re-emitted photons.although the method appears to yield correct results, we argue that itstheoretical basis is not completely transparent, and that it is not completelyclear whether this technique is an exact rigorous method, or whether it is justa good and convenient approximation. we critically study the general problem ofhow an already sampled distribution can be adjusted to a new distribution byadding data points sampled from an adjustment distribution. we show that thisadjustment is not always possible, and that it depends on the shape of theoriginal and desired distributions, as well as on the relative number of datapoints that can be added. applying this theorem to radiative equilibrium montecarlo calculations, we provide a firm theoretical basis for the frequencydistribution adjustment method of bjorkman &amp; wood, and we demonstrate that thismethod provides the correct frequency distribution through the additionalrequirement of radiative equilibrium. we discuss the advantages and limitationsof this approach, and show that it can easily be combined with the presence ofadditional heating sources and the concept of photon weighting. however, themethod may fail if small dust grains are included...

0809.1928	smart detectors for monte carlo radiative transfer	many optimization techniques have been invented to reduce the noise that isinherent in monte carlo radiative transfer simulations. as the typicaldetectors used in monte carlo simulations do not take into account all theinformation contained in the impacting photon packages, there is still room tooptimize this detection process and the corresponding estimate of the surfacebrightness distributions. we want to investigate how all the informationcontained in the distribution of impacting photon packages can be optimallyused to decrease the noise in the surface brightness distributions and hence toincrease the efficiency of monte carlo radiative transfer simulations.  we demonstrate that the estimate of the surface brightness distribution in amonte carlo radiative transfer simulation is similar to the estimate of thedensity distribution in an sph simulation. based on this similarity, a recipeis constructed for smart detectors that take full advantage of the exactlocation of the impact of the photon packages. several types of smartdetectors, each corresponding to a different smoothing kernel, are presented.we show that smart detectors, while preserving the same effective resolution,reduce the noise in the surface brightness distributions compared to theclassical detectors. the most efficient smart detector realizes a noisereduction of about 10%, which corresponds to a reduction of the required numberof photon packages (i.e. a reduction of the simulation run time) of 20%. as thepractical implementation of the smart detectors is straightforward and theadditional computational cost is completely negligible, we recommend the use ofsmart detectors in monte carlo radiative transfer simulations.

0810.5483	exact potential-density pairs for flattened dark haloes	cosmological simulations suggest that dark matter haloes are not spherical,but typically moderately to strongly triaxial systems. we investigate methodsto convert spherical potential-density pairs into axisymmetric ones, in whichthe basic characteristics of the density profile (such as the slope at smalland large radii) are retained. we achieve this goal by replacing the sphericalradius r by an oblate radius m in the expression of the gravitationalpotential.  we extend and formalize the approach pioneered by miyamoto &amp; nagai (1975) tobe applicable to arbitrary potential-density pairs. unfortunately, anasymptotic study demonstrates that, at large radii, such models always show ar^(-3) disc superposed on a smooth roughly spherical density distribution. as aresult, this recipe cannot be used to construct simple flattenedpotential-density pairs for dynamical systems such as dark matter haloes.therefore we apply a modification of our original recipe that cures the problemof the discy behaviour. an asymptotic analysis now shows that the densitydistribution has the desired asymptotic behaviour at large radii (if thedensity falls less rapidly than r^(-4)). we also show that the flatteningprocedure does not alter the shape of the density distribution at small radii:while the inner density contours are flattened, the slope of the densityprofile is unaltered.  we apply this recipe to construct a set of flattened dark matter haloes basedon the realistic spherical halo models by dehnen &amp; mclaughlin (2005). thisexample illustrates that the method works fine for modest flattening values,whereas stronger flattening values lead to peanut-shaped density distributions.
