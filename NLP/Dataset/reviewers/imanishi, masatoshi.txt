0901.0558	luminous buried agns as a function of galaxy infrared luminosity  revealed through spitzer low-resolution infrared spectroscopy	we present the results of spitzer irs infrared 5-35 micron low-resolutionspectroscopic energy diagnostics of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) atz &gt; 0.15, classified optically as non-seyferts. based on the equivalent widthsof polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission and the optical depths of silicatedust absorption features, we searched for signatures of intrinsically luminous,but optically elusive, buried agns in these optically non-seyfert ulirgs. wethen combined the results with those of non-seyfert ulirgs at z &lt; 0.15 andnon-seyfert galaxies with infrared luminosities l(ir) &lt; 10^12lsun. we foundthat the energetic importance of buried agns clearly increases with galaxyinfrared luminosity, becoming suddenly discernible in ulirgs with l(ir) &gt;10{12}lsun. for ulirgs with buried agn signatures, a significant fraction ofinfrared luminosities can be accounted for by detected buried agn andmodestly-obscured (av &lt; 20 mag) starburst activity. the implied masses ofspheroidal stellar components in galaxies for which buried agns becomeimportant roughly correspond to the value separating red massive and blue,less-massive galaxies in the local universe. our results may support thewidely-proposed agn-feedback scenario as the origin of galaxy downsizingphenomena, where galaxies with currently larger stellar masses previously hadhigher agn energetic contributions and star-formation-originating infraredluminosities, and have finished their major star-formation more quickly, due tostronger agn feedback.

0704.1156	the mid-infrared emission of m87	we discuss subaru and spitzer space telescope imaging and spectroscopy of m87in the mid-infrared from 5-35 um. these observations allow us to investigatemid-ir emission mechanisms in the core of m87 and to establish that theflaring, variable jet component hst-1 is not a major contributor to the mid-irflux. the spitzer data include a high signal-to-noise 15-35 $\mu$m spectrum ofthe knot a/b complex in the jet, which is consistent with synchrotron emission.however, a synchrotron model cannot account for the observed {\it nuclear}spectrum, even when contributions from the jet, necessary due to the degradingof resolution with wavelength, are included. the spitzer data show a clearexcess in the spectrum of the nucleus at wavelengths longer than 25 um, whichwe model as thermal emission from cool dust at a characteristic temperature of55 \pm 10 k, with an ir luminosity \sim 10^{39} {\rm ~erg ~s^{-1}}. givenspitzer's few-arcsecond angular resolution, the dust seen in the nuclearspectrum could be located anywhere within ~5'' (390 pc) of the nucleus. in anycase, the ratio of agn thermal to bolometric luminosity indicates that m87 doesnot contain the ir-bright torus that classical unified agn schemes invoke.however, this result is consistent with theoretical predictions forlow-luminosity agns

0912.2748	spitzer infrared low-resolution spectroscopic study of buried agns in a  complete sample of nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies	we present the results of spitzer irs low-resolution infrared 5-35 micronspectroscopy of 17 nearby ulirgs at z &lt; 0.2, optically classified asnon-seyferts. the presence of optically elusive, but intrinsically luminous,buried agns is investigated, based on the strengths of polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon emission and silicate dust absorption features detected in thespectra. the signatures of luminous buried agns, whose intrinsic luminositiesrange up to ~10^12 lsun, are found in eight sources. we combine these resultswith those of our previous research to investigate the energy function ofburied agns in a complete sample of optically non-seyfert ulirgs in the localuniverse at z &lt; 0.3 (85 sources). we confirm a trend that we previouslydiscovered: that buried agns are more common in galaxies with higher infraredluminosities. because optical seyferts also show a similar trend, we argue moregenerally that the energetic importance of agns is intrinsically higher in moreluminous galaxies, suggesting that the agn-starburst connections areluminosity-dependent. this may be related to the stronger agn feedback scenarioin currently more massive galaxy systems, as a possible origin of the galaxydownsizing phenomenon.

1001.0582	aste simultaneous hcn(4-3) and hco+(4-3) observations of the two  luminous infrared galaxies ngc 4418 and arp 220	we report the results of hcn(j=4-3) and hco+(j=4-3) observations of twoluminous infrared galaxies (lirgs), ngc 4418 and arp 220, made using theatacama submillimeter telescope experiment (aste). the aste wide-bandcorrelator provided simultaneous observations of hcn(4-3) and hco+(4-3) lines,and a precise determination of their flux ratios. both galaxies showed highhcn(4-3) to hco+(4-3) flux ratios of &gt;2, possibly due to agn-related phenomena.the j = 4-3 to j = 1-0 transition flux ratios for hcn (hco+) are similar tothose expected for fully thermalized (sub-thermally excited) gas in bothsources, in spite of hcn's higher critical density. if we assume collisionalexcitation and neglect an infrared radiative pumping process, our non-lteanalysis suggests that hcn traces gas with significantly higher density thanhco+. in arp 220, we separated the double-peaked hcn(4-3) emission into theeastern and western nuclei, based on velocity information. we confirmed thatthe eastern nucleus showed a higher hcn(4-3) to hcn(1-0) flux ratio, and thuscontained a larger amount of highly excited molecular gas than the westernnucleus.

1008.1585	akari irc infrared 2.5-5 micron spectroscopy of a large sample of  luminous infrared galaxies	we present the results of our systematic infrared 2.5-5 micron spectroscopyof 60 luminous infrared galaxies (lirgs) with infrared luminosities l(ir) =10^11-12 lsun, and 54 ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) with l(ir) &gt;10^12 lsun, using akari irc. akari irc slit-less spectroscopy allows us toprobe the full range of emission from these galaxies, including spatiallyextended components. the 3.3 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah)emission features, hydrogen recombination emission lines, and variousabsorption features are detected and used to investigate the properties ofthese galaxies. because of the relatively small effect of dust extinction inthe infrared range, quantitative discussion of these dusty galaxy populationsis possible. for sources with clearly detectable br beta (2.63 micron) and bralpha (4.05 micron) emission lines, the flux ratios are found to be similar tothat predicted by case b theory. starburst luminosities are estimated from both3.3 micron pah and br alpha emission, which roughly agree with each other. inaddition to the detected starburst activity, a significant fraction of theobserved sources display signatures of obscured agns, such as low pahequivalent widths, large optical depths of dust absorption features, and redcontinuum emission. the energetic importance of optically elusive buried agnsin optically non-seyfert galaxies tends to increase with increasing galaxyinfrared luminosity, from lirgs to ulirgs.

1010.2756	comparison of agn and nuclear starburst activity in seyfert 1 and 2  galaxies over a wide luminosity range based on near-infrared 2-4 micrometer  spectroscopy	we present near-infrared k- (1.9-2.5 micrometer) and l- (2.8-4.2 micrometer)band spectroscopy of 22 seyfert nuclei. we use two methods to investigate thepresence of nuclear starbursts: (1) the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah)emission feature at lambda_rest = 3.3 micrometer in the rest frame of l-bandspectrum (a starburst indicator) and (2) the co absorption feature atlambda_rest = 2.3-2.4 micrometer in the rest frame of the k-band spectrum,originating in the co molecule. we clearly detected the 3.3 micrometer pahemission features in five objects and the co absorption features in 17 objects.seyfert 2 galaxies tend to show bluer k-l colors compared with seyfert 1galaxies. we interpret the discrepancy as resulting from relative strength ofstellar emission because agn emission is affected by dust extinction. the 3.3micrometer pah emission luminosity (l_3.3pah) distributions for the seyfert 1sand seyfert 2s are very similar when normalized to the agn power.star-formation rates estimated from l_3.3pah could be large enough to inflatethe dusty torus by supernova explosion. we find that l_3.3pah positivelycorrelates with n-band luminosity with small aperture over a wide agnluminosity range, and is independent of physical area we probed. the resultssuggest that nuclear region has a concentration of star formation and the starformation would control agn activity.

0704.2818	compact starburst in the central regions of seyfert galaxies	we have conducted a high-resolution ``3d'' imaging survey of the co(1--0),hcn(1--0), and hco$^+$(1--0) lines toward the central a few kpc regions of theseyfert and starburst galaxies in the local universe using the nobeyamamillimeter array. we detected luminous hcn(1--0) emissions toward aconsiderable fraction of these seyfert galaxies (10 of 12 in our sub-sample),which indicated that some of these seyfert galaxies, such as ngc 3079, ngc3227, ngc 4051, ngc 6764, and ngc 7479, are indeed accompanied with compactnuclear starburst, given the tight correlation between the hcn(1--0) luminosityand the star formation rate among star-forming galaxies. however, we suggestthat the elevated hcn(1--0) emission from some of these seyfert galaxies,including ngc 1068, ngc 1097, ngc 5033, and ngc 5194, does not signify thepresence of massive starbursts there. this is because these seyfert nuclei showabnormally high hcn(1--0)/hco$^+$(1--0) ratios (2--3), which were neverobserved in the starburst nuclei in our sample. this could be attributed to theoverabundance of hcn molecules in the x-ray dominated regions (xdrs) at thecenters of these seyfert galaxies.

1501.06584	on the difference of torus geometry between hidden and non-hidden broad  line active galactic nuclei	we present results from the fitting of infrared (ir) spectral energydistributions of 21 active galactic nuclei (agn) with clumpy torus models. wecompiled high spatial resolution ($\sim 0.3$--$0.7$ arcsec) mid-ir $n$-bandspectroscopy, $q$-band imaging and nuclear near- and mid-ir photometry from theliterature. combining these nuclear near- and mid-ir observations, far-irphotometry and clumpy torus models, enables us to put constraints on the torusproperties and geometry. we divide the sample into three types according to thebroad line region (blr) properties; type-1s, type-2s with scattered or hiddenbroad line region (hblr) previously observed, and type-2s without any publishedhblr signature (nhblr). comparing the torus model parameters gives us the firstquantitative torus geometrical view for each subgroup. we find that nhblr agnhave smaller torus opening angles and larger covering factors than those ofhblr agn. this suggests that the chance to observe scattered (polarized) fluxfrom the blr in nhblr could be reduced by the dual effects of (a) lessscattering medium due to the reduced scattering volume given the small torusopening angle and (b) the increased torus obscuration between the observer andthe scattering region. these effects give a reasonable explanation for the lackof observed hblr in some type-2 agn.

1506.00320	hyper-luminous dust obscured galaxies discovered by the hyper  suprime-cam on subaru and wise	we present the photometric properties of a sample of infrared (ir) brightdust obscured galaxies (dogs). combining wide and deep optical images obtainedwith the hyper suprime-cam (hsc) on the subaru telescope and all-sky mid-ir(mir) images taken with wide-field infrared survey explorer (wise), wediscovered 48 dogs with $i - k_\mathrm{s} &gt; 1.2$ and $i - [22] &gt; 7.0$, where$i$, $k_\mathrm{s}$, and [22] represent ab magnitude in the $i$-band,$k_\mathrm{s}$-band, and 22 $\mu$m, respectively, in the gama 14hr field($\sim$ 9 deg$^2$). among these objects, 31 ($\sim$ 65 %) show power-lawspectral energy distributions (seds) in the near-ir (nir) and mir regime, whilethe remainder show a nir bump in their seds. assuming that the redshiftdistribution for our dogs sample is gaussian, with mean and sigma $z$ = 1.99$\pm$ 0.45, we calculated their total ir luminosity using an empirical relationbetween 22 $\mu$m luminosity and total ir luminosity. the average value of thetotal ir luminosity is (3.5 $\pm$ 1.1) $\times$ $10^{13}$ l$_{\odot}$, whichclassifies them as hyper-luminous infrared galaxies (hylirgs). we also derivedthe total ir luminosity function (lf) and ir luminosity density (ld) for aflux-limited subsample of 18 dogs with 22 $\mu$m flux greater than 3.0 mjy andwith $i$-band magnitude brighter than 24 ab magnitude. the derived spacedensity for this subsample is log $\phi$ = -6.59 $\pm$ 0.11 [mpc$^{-3}$]. their lf for dogs including data obtained from the literature is well fitted by adouble-power law. the derived lower limit for the ir ld for our sample is$\rho_{\mathrm{ir}}$ $\sim$ 3.8 $\times$ 10$^7$ [l$_{\odot}$ mpc$^{-3}$] andits contributions to the total ir ld, ir ld of all ultra-luminous infraredgalaxies (ulirgs), and that of all dogs are $&gt;$ 3 %, $&gt;$ 9 %, and $&gt;$ 15 %,respectively.

1508.05946	alma observations of the submillimeter dense molecular gas tracers in  the luminous type-1 active nucleus of ngc 7469	we present alma cycle 1 observations of the central kpc region of theluminous type-1 seyfert galaxy ngc 7469 with unprecedented high resolution(0.5$"$ $\times$ 0.4$"$ = 165 pc $\times$ 132 pc) at submillimeter wavelengths.utilizing the wide-bandwidth of alma, we simultaneously obtained hcn(4-3),hco$^+$(4-3), cs(7-6), and partially co(3-2) line maps, as well as the 860$\mu$m continuum. the region consists of the central $\sim$ 1$"$ component andthe surrounding starburst ring with a radius of $\sim$ 1.5$"$-2.5$"$. severalstructures connect these components. except for co(3-2), these dense gastracers are significantly concentrated towards the central $\sim$ 1$"$,suggesting their suitability to probe the nuclear regions of galaxies. theirspatial distribution resembles well those of centimeter and mid-infraredcontinuum emissions, but it is anti-correlated with the optical one, indicatingthe existence of dust obscured star formation. the integrated intensity ratiosof hcn(4-3)/hco$^+$(4-3) and hcn(4-3)/cs(7-6) are higher at the agn positionthan at the starburst ring, which is consistent to our previous findings(submm-hcn enhancement). however, the hcn(4-3)/hco$^+$(4-3) ratio at the agnposition of ngc 7469 (1.11$\pm$0.06) is almost half of the corresponding valueof the low-luminosity type-1 seyfert galaxy ngc 1097 (2.0$\pm$0.2), despite themore than two orders of magnitude higher x-ray luminosity of ngc 7469. but theratio is comparable to that of the close vicinity of the agn of ngc 1068($\sim$ 1.5). based on these results, we speculate that some other heatingmechanisms than x-ray (e.g., mechanical heating due to agn jet) can contributesignificantly for shaping the chemical composition in ngc 1097.

1510.02522	near-infrared spectroscopy of quasars at z~3 and estimates of their  supermassive black hole masses	we present the results of new infrared spectroscopic observations of 37quasars at z~3, selected based on the optical r'-band magnitude and theavailability of nearby bright stars for future imaging follow-up with adaptiveoptics system. the supermassive black hole (smbh) masses (m_bh) weresuccessfully estimated in 28 out of 37 observed objects from the combination ofthe h_beta emission linewidth and continuum luminosity at rest-frame 5100a.comparing these results with those from previous studies of quasars withsimilar redshift, our sample exhibited slightly lower (~ -0.11 dex in median)eddington ratios; and, the smbh masses are slightly (~ 0.38 dex in median)higher. the smbh growth time, t_grow, was calculated by dividing the estimatedsmbh mass by the mass accretion rate measured using optical luminosity. wefound, given reasonable assumptions, that t_grow was smaller than the age ofthe universe at the redshift of individual quasars for a large fraction ofobserved sources, suggesting that the smbhs in many of our observed quasars arein growing phase with high accretion rates. a comparison of the smbh massesderived from our h_beta data and archived civ data indicated considerablescattering, as indicated in previous studies. all quasars with measured smbhmasses have at least one nearby bright star, such that they are suitabletargets for adaptive optics observations to study the mass relationship betweensmbhs and host galaxies' stellar component at high redshift.

1512.03438	submillimeter-hcn diagram for an energy diagnostics in the centers of  galaxies	compiling data from literature and the alma archive, we show enhancedhcn(4-3)/hco$^+$(4-3) and/or hcn(4-3)/cs(7-6) integrated intensity ratios incircumnuclear molecular gas around active galactic nuclei (agns) compared tothose in starburst (sb) galaxies (submillimeter hcn-enhancement). the number ofsample galaxies is significantly increased from our previous work. we expectthis feature could potentially be an extinction-free energy diagnostic tool ofnuclear regions of galaxies. non-lte radiative transfer modelings of the abovemolecular emission lines involving both collisional and radiative excitation,as well as a photon trapping effect were conducted to investigate the cause ofthe high line ratios in agns. as a result, we found that enhanced abundanceratios of hcn-to-hco$^+$ and hcn-to-cs in agns as compared to sb galaxies by afactor of a few to even $&gt;$ 10 is a plausible explanation for the submillimeterhcn-enhancement. however, a counter argument of a systematically higher gasdensity in agns than in sb galaxies can also be a plausible scenario. althoughwe could not fully discriminate these two scenarios at this moment due toinsufficient amount of multi-transition, multi-species data, the formerscenario equivalently claims for abnormal chemical composition in agns.regarding the actual mechanism to realize the composition, we suggest it isdifficult with conventional gas phase x-ray dominated region (xdr) ionizationmodels to reproduce the observed high line ratios. we might have to take intoaccount other mechanisms such as neutral-neutral reactions that are efficientlyactivated at high temperature environments and/or mechanically heated regionsto further understand the high line ratios in agns.

0808.0363	systematic infrared 2.5-5 micron spectroscopy of nearby ultraluminous  infrared galaxies with akari	we report on the results of systematic infrared 2.5-5 micron spectroscopy of45 nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) at z &lt; 0.3 using irc onboardthe akari satellite. this paper investigates whether the luminosities of theseulirgs are dominated by starburst activity, or optically elusive buried agnsare energetically important. our criteria include the strengths of the 3.3micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emission features and the opticaldepths of absorption features at 3.1 micron due to ice-covered dust grains andat 3.4 micron from bare carbonaceous dust grains. because of the akari irc'sspectroscopic capability in the full 2.5-5 micron wavelength range, unaffectedby earth's atmosphere, we can apply this energy diagnostic method to ulirgs atz &gt; 0.15. we estimate the intrinsic luminosities of extended (several kpc),modestly obscured (av &lt; 15 mag) starburst activity based on the 3.3 micron pahemission luminosities measured in akari irc slitless spectra, and confirm thatsuch starbursts are energetically unimportant in nearby ulirgs. in roughly halfof the observed ulirgs classified optically as non-seyferts, we find signaturesof luminous energy sources that produce no pah emission and/or are morecentrally concentrated than the surrounding dust. we interpret these energysources as buried agns. the fraction of ulirgs with detectable buried agnsignatures increases with increasing infrared luminosity. our overall resultssupport the scenario that luminous buried agns are important in many ulirgs atz &lt; 0.3 classified optically as non-seyferts, and that the opticalundetectability of such buried agns occurs merely because of a large amount ofnuclear dust, which can make the sightline of even the lowest dust columndensity opaque to the ionizing radiation of the agns.

astro-ph;0001321	the 9.7 micron silicate dust absorption toward the cygnus a nucleus and  the inferred location of the obscuring dust	we report the detection of a 9.7 $\mu$m silicate dust absorption featuretoward the cygnus a nucleus. its optical depth is, however, significantlysmaller than that expected from the dust extinction toward the background$l$-band emission region ($a_{\rm v}$ $\sim$ 150 mag). we argue that the mostlikely explanation for the small optical depth is that the obscuring dustexists so close to the central engine that a temperature gradient occurs. ourcalculation confirms that the small optical depth and the spectral energydistribution at 3--30 $\mu$m can be quantitatively reproduced by thisexplanation. combining this picture with the huge agn luminosity, the emissionproperties of cygnus a are consistent with those of a type 2 quasar, that is, ahighly luminous agn that is highly obscured ($a_{\rm v}$ $&gt;$ 50 mag) by a dustytorus with an inner radius of $&lt;$10 pc, and not by $&gt;$ a few 100 pc scale dustin the host galaxy.

astro-ph;0001451	superwind-driven intense h_2 emission in ngc 6240	we have performed a long-slit k band spectroscopic observation of theluminous infrared galaxy ngc 6240. the peak position of the h_2 v=1-0 s(1)emission in the slit is located ~0.3" - 0.4" north of the southern nucleus. itis almost the midpoint between the southern nucleus and the peak position ofthe ^12co j=1-0 emission. based on the line-ratio analyses, we suggest theexcitation mechanism of h_2 is pure thermal at most positions. in the southernregion we find the following three velocity components in the h_2 emission: theblueshifted shell component (~-250 km s^-1 with respect to v_sys) which isrecognized as a distinct c-shape distortion in the velocity field around thesouthern nucleus, the high-velocity blueshifted ``wing'' component (~-1000 kms^-1 with respect to v_sys), and the component indicating possible linesplitting of ~500 km s^-1. the latter two components are extended to the southfrom the southern nucleus. we show that the kinematic properties of these threecomponents can be reproduced by expanding motion of a shell-like structurearound the southern nucleus. the offset peak position of the h_2 emission canbe understood if we assume that the shell expanding to the north interacts withthe extragalactic molecular gas. at the interface between the shell and themolecular gas concentration the cloud-crushing mechanism proposed by cowie etal. (1981) may work efficiently, and the intense h_2 emission is thus expectedthere. all these findings lead us to propose a model that the most h_2 emissionis attributed to the shock excitation driven by the superwind activity of thesouthern nucleus.

astro-ph;0002343	subaru observations for the k-band luminosity distribution of galaxies  in clusters near to 3c 324 at z$\sim$1.2	we investigate the $k$-band luminosity distribution of galaxies in the regionof clusters at $z\sim1.2$ near to the radio galaxy 3c 324. the imaging datawere obtained during the commissioning period of the subaru telescope. there isa significant excess of the surface number density of the galaxies with $k =$17--20 mag in the region within $\sim$ 40'' from 3c 324. at this bright end,the measured luminosity distribution shows a drop, which can be represented bythe exponential cut off of the schechter-function formula; the best-fittedvalue of the characteristic magnitude, $k^{*}$, is $\sim 18.4\pm0.8$. thismeasurement follows the evolutionary trend of the $k^*$ of the rich clustersobserved at an intermediate redshift, which is consistent with passiveevolution models with a formation redshift $z_f \gtsim 2$. at $k \gtsim 20$mag, however, the excess of the galaxy surface density in the region of theclusters decreases abruptly, which may imply that the luminosity function ofthe cluster galaxies has a negative slope at the faint end. this may implystrong luminosity segregation between the inner and outer parts of theclusters, or some deficit of faint galaxies in the cluster central region ofthe cluster.

(1998, mnras, 292, 758). the peak of thek'-band light coincides with the position of the radio core, which implies thatthe powerful agn lies at the nucleus of the host galaxy. the peak alsocoincides with the gap in the optical knotty structures which may be a dustlane hiding the uv-optical emission of the agn from our line of sight; it isvery likely that we are seeing the obscuring structure almost edge-on. weclearly detected the `aligned component' in the k'-band image by subtracting amodel elliptical galaxy from the observed image. the red r_f702w-k color of theouter region of the galaxy avoiding the aligned component indicates that thenear infrared light of the host galaxy is dominated by an old stellarpopulation.

astro-ph;0008092	energy diagnoses of nine infrared luminous galaxies based on 3--4 micron  spectra	the energy sources of nine infrared luminous galaxies (irlgs) are diagnosedbased on their ground-based 3--4 $\mu$m spectra. both the equivalent width ofthe 3.3 $\mu$m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emission feature and the3.3 $\mu$m pah to far-infrared luminosity ratio ($l_{3.3}/l_{\rm fir}$) areanalyzed. assuming nuclear compact starburst activity in these sources producesthe 3.3 $\mu$m pah emission as strongly as that in starburst galaxies withlower far-infrared luminosities, the followings results are found: for sixirlgs, both the observed equivalent widths and the $l_{3.3}/l_{\rm fir}$ ratiosare too small to explain the bulk of their far-infrared luminosities by compactstarburst activity, indicating that active galactic nucleus (agn) activity is adominant energy source. for the other three irlgs, while the 3.3 $\mu$m pahequivalent widths are within the range of starburst galaxies, the$l_{3.3}/l_{\rm fir}$ ratios after correction for screen dust extinction are afactor of $\sim$3 smaller. the uncertainty in the dust extinction correctionfactor and in the scatter of the intrinsic $l_{3.3}/l_{\rm fir}$ ratios forstarburst galaxies do not allow a determination of the ultimate energy sourcesfor these three irlgs.

astro-ph;0112299	3--4 $\mu$m spectroscopy of seyfert 2 nuclei to quantitatively assess  the energetic importance of compact nuclear starbursts	we report on 3--4 $\mu$m slit spectroscopy of 13 seyfert 2 nuclei. the 3.3$\mu$m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emission is used to estimate themagnitudes of compact ($&lt;$ a few 100 pc) nuclear starbursts and to resolve thecontroversy over their energetic importance in seyfert 2 nuclei. for threeselected seyfert 2 nuclei that have been well studied in the uv, the magnitudesof the compact nuclear starbursts estimated from the 3.3 $\mu$m pah emission(with no extinction correction) are in satisfactory quantitative agreement withthose based on the uv after extinction correction. based directly on our 3--4$\mu$m slit spectra, the following two main conclusions are drawn: (1) exceptin one case, the observed nuclear 3--4 $\mu$m emission is dominated by agn andnot by starbursts, and (2) compact nuclear starbursts are detected in 6 out of13 seyfert 2 nuclei, but cannot dominate the energetics of the galacticinfrared dust emission in the majority of the observed seyfert 2 galaxies. forseveral sources for which infrared space observatory spectra taken with largerapertures and/or soft x-ray data are available, these data are combined withour 3--4 $\mu$m slit spectra, and it is suggested that (3) extended (kpc scale)star-formation activity is energetically more important than compact nuclearstarbursts, and contributes significantly to the infrared luminosities ofseyfert 2 galaxies, and (4) the bulk of the energetically significant extendedstar-formation activity is of starburst type rather than quiescent normal diskstar-formation; the extended starbursts are responsible for thesuperwind-driven soft x-ray emission from seyfert 2 galaxies. finally, it isimplied that more powerful agns tend to be related to more powerful compactnuclear starbursts.

astro-ph;0309425	x-ray evidence for a buried active galactic nucleus in ugc 5101	we present x-ray observations of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy, ugc 5101,thought to contain a buried active galactic nucleus (agn) based on observationsin other wavebands. we detected an absorbed hard component at &gt;3 kev, as wellas soft emission in the energy range 0.5-2 kev. the soft x-ray component,possibly due to a modestly dust-obscured, extended starburst, has anabsorption-corrected 0.5-2 kev x-ray luminosity of lx(0.5-2 kev) = 1.2 * 10^41ergs s^-1. the 0.5-2 kev x-ray to infrared luminosity ratio is a factor of 5lower than typical values for a normal starburst, suggesting that this extendedstarburst is unlikely to be energetically dominant in ugc 5101. the mostplausible origin of the absorbed hard component is the putative buried agn. the6.4 kev fe k alpha emission line has a modest equivalent width (400 ev),suggesting that this hard component is direct emission from the agn, ratherthan a scattered component. the absorption-corrected 2-10 kev x-ray luminosityof the buried agn was estimated to be lx(2-10 kev) = 5 * 10^42 ergs s^-1. theintrinsic 2-10 kev x-ray luminosity and the 2-10 kev x-ray to infraredluminosity ratio are both comparable to values measured for mrk 463, aseyfert-2 galaxy of similar infrared luminosity.

astro-ph;0311112	x-ray underluminous active galactic nuclei relative to broad emission  lines in ultraluminous infrared galaxies	we present x-ray spectra of four ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs)with detectable broad near-infrared emission lines produced by active galacticnuclei (agns): mrk 463, pks 1345+12, iras 05189-2524, and iras 07598+6508. withthe exception of iras 07598+6508, high quality x-ray spectra obtained with xmmor chandra show modest (30-340 ev) equivalent widths of the 6.4 kev fe k alphaemission line and clear signatures for absorption at a level of 4-33 * 10^22cm^-2 for the main power-law components from the agns. these spectralproperties are typical of compton-thin agns, and so we estimateabsorption-corrected 2-10 kev x-ray luminosities for the agns, lx(2-10kev),using the compton-thin assumption. we compare the lx(2-10 kev) values withbroad optical/near-infrared emission-line luminosities, and confirm a previousfinding by imanishi &amp; ueno that the lx(2-10 kev) to broad-emission-lineluminosity ratios in ulirgs are systematically lower than those of moderatelyinfrared-luminous type-1 agns. a comparison of independent energy diagnosticmethods suggests that the agns are underluminous in the 2-10 kev band withrespect to their overall spectral energy distributions, as opposed to the broademission lines being overluminous. this x-ray under-luminosity should be takeninto account when using 2-10 kev x-ray data to investigate the energeticcontribution from agns to the large infrared luminosities of ulirgs.

astro-ph;0405093	obscured star formation in the central region of the dwarf galaxy  ngc5253	we present hst/nicmos observations (1.1-2.2micron) and 1.9-4.1micronspectroscopy of the central region of the dwarf galaxy ngc5253. the hst/nicmosobservations reveal the presence of a nuclear double star cluster separated by0.3-0.4arcsec or 6-8pc (for a distance d=4.1mpc). the double star cluster, alsoa bright double source of pa-alpha emission, appears to be coincident with thedouble radio nebula detected at 1.3cm. the eastern near-infrared star cluster(c1) is identified with the youngest optical cluster, whereas the western starcluster (c2), although it is almost completely obscured in the optical, becomesthe brightest star cluster in the central region of ngc 5253 at wavelengthslonger than 2micron. both clusters are extremely young with ages ofapproximately 3.5 million years old. c2 is more massive than c1 by a factor of6 to 20 (m(c2)= 7.7 x 10^5 - 2.6 x 10^6msun, for a salpeter imf in the massrange 0.1-100msun). analysis of the circumnuclear spectrum excluding c1 and c2,as well as of a number of other near-infrared selected clusters with a range of(young) ages, suggests that the star formation was triggered across the centralregions of the galaxy. we have also modelled the nuclear uv to mid-infraredspectral energy distribution (sed) of ngc5253 and found that the infrared partis well modelled with a highly obscured (a_v= 17mag) young starburst with astellar mass consistent with our photometric estimates for c1 and c2. the sedmodel predicts a moderately bright polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah)feature at 3.3micron that is not detected in our nuclear l-band spectrum.ngc5253's low metallicity and a top-heavy imf likely combine to suppress the3.3micron pah emission that is commonly seen in more massive starburst systems.

astro-ph;0407215	near-infrared k-band spectroscopic investigation of seyfert 2 nuclei in  the cfa and 12 micron samples	we present near-infrared k-band slit spectra of the nuclei of 25 seyfert 2galaxies in the cfa and 12 micron samples. the strength of the co absorptionfeatures at 2.3-2.4 micron produced by stars is measured in terms of aspectroscopic co index. a clear anti-correlation between the observed co indexand the nuclear k-l color is present, suggesting that a featureless hot dustcontinuum heated by an agn contributes significantly to the observed k-bandfluxes in the nuclei of seyfert 2 galaxies. after correction for this agncontribution, we estimate nuclear stellar k-band luminosities for all sources,and co indices for sources with modestly large observed co indices. thecorrected co indices for 10 (=40%) seyfert 2 nuclei are found to be as high asthose observed in star-forming or elliptical (=spheroidal) galaxies. we combinethe k-band data with measurements of the l-band 3.3 micron polycyclic aromatichydrocarbon (pah) emission feature, another powerful indicator forstar-formation, and find that the 3.3 micron pah to k-band stellar luminosityratios are substantially smaller than those of starburst galaxies. our resultssuggest that the 3.3 micron pah emission originates in the putative nuclearstarbursts in the dusty tori surrounding the agns, because of its high surfacebrightness, whereas the k-band co absorption features detected at the nucleiare dominated by old bulge (=spheroid) stars, and thus may not be a powerfulindicator for the nuclear starbursts. we see no clear difference in thestrength of the co absorption and pah emission features between the cfa and 12micron seyfert 2s.

astro-ph;0407469	near-infrared and millimeter constraints on the nuclear energy source of  the infrared luminous galaxy ngc 4418	we present near-infrared and millimeter investigations of the nucleus of theinfrared luminous galaxy ngc 4418, which previous observations suggestpossesses a powerful buried agn. we found the following main results: (1) theinfrared k-band spectrum shows co absorption features at 2.3-2.4 micron owingto stars and very strong h2 emission lines. the luminosity ratios of h2emission lines are suggestive of a thermal origin, and the equivalent width ofthe h2 1-0 s(1) line is the second largest observed to date in an externalgalaxy, after the well-studied strong h2-emitting galaxy ngc 6240. (2) theinfrared l-band spectrum shows a clear polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah)emission feature at 3.3 micron, which is usually found in star-forminggalaxies. the estimated star-formation luminosity from the observed pahemission can account for only a small fraction of the infrared luminosity. (3)millimeter interferometric observations of the nucleus reveal a high hcn (1-0)to hco+ (1-0) luminosity ratio of 1.8, as has been previously found in pureagns. (4) the measurements of hcn (1-0) luminosity using a single-dishmillimeter telescope show that the hcn (1-0) to infrared luminosity ratio isslightly larger than the average, but within the scattered range, for otherinfrared luminous galaxies. all of these results can be explained by thescenario in which, in addition to energetically-insignificant, weakly-obscuredstar-formation at the surface of the nucleus, a powerful x-ray emitting agndeeply buried in dust and high density molecular gas is present.

astro-ph;0408422	comparison of nuclear starburst luminosities between seyfert 1 and 2  galaxies based on near-infrared spectroscopy	we report on infrared k- (2-2.5 micron) and l-band (2.8-4.1 micron) slitspectroscopy of 23 seyfert 1 galaxies in the cfa and 12 micron samples. apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emission feature at 3.3 micron in the lband is primarily used to investigate nuclear star-forming activity in thesegalaxies. the 3.3 micron pah emission is detected in 10 sources (=43%),demonstrating that detection of nuclear star-formation in a significantfraction of seyfert 1 galaxies is now feasible. for the pah-detected nuclei,the surface brightness values of the pah emission are as high as those oftypical starbursts, suggesting that the pah emission probes the putativenuclear starbursts in the dusty tori around the central active galactic nuclei(agns). the magnitudes of the nuclear starbursts are quantitatively estimatedfrom the observed 3.3 micron pah emission luminosities. the estimated starburstluminosities relative to some indicators of agn powers in these seyfert 1s arecompared with 32 seyfert 2s in the same samples that we have previouslyobserved. we find that there is no significant difference in nuclear starburstto agn luminosity ratios between seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies, and that nuclearstarburst luminosity positively correlates with agn power in both types ofseyferts. our results favor a slightly-modified agn unification model, whichpredicts that nuclear starbursts occurring in the dusty tori of seyferts arephysically connected to the central agns, rather than the classical unificationparadigm, in which the dusty tori simply hide the central agns of seyfert 2sand reprocess agn radiation as infrared dust emission in seyferts. nosignificant differences in nuclear star formation properties are recognizablebetween seyfert 1s in the cfa and 12 micron samples.

astro-ph;0702136	a spitzer irs low-resolution spectroscopic search for buried agns in  nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies - a constraint on geometry between  energy sources and dust -	we present the results of spitzer irs low-resolution infrared 5-35 micronspectroscopy of nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ulirgs) at z &lt; 0.15. wefocus on the search for the signatures of buried active galactic nuclei (agns)in the complete sample of ulirgs classified optically as non-seyferts (linersor hii-regions). in addition to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) emissionfeatures at 6.2 micron, 7.7 micron, and 11.3 micron, the conventional tool ofstarburst-agn separation, we use the optical depths of the 9.7 micron and 18micron silicate dust absorption features to infer the geometry of energysources and dust at the nuclei of these ulirgs, namely, whether the energysources are spatially well mixed with dust(a normal starburst) or are morecentrally concentrated than the dust (a buried agn). infrared spectra of atleast 30%, and possibly 50%, of the observed optical non-seyfert ulirgs arenaturally explained by emission consisting of (1) energetically insignificant,modestly obscured (av &lt; 20-30 mag) pah-emitting normal starbursts, and (2)energetically dominant, highly dust-obscured, centrally concentrated energysources with no pah emission. we interpret the latter component as a buriedagn. the fraction of ulirgs showing some buried agn signatures is higher inliner ulirgs than in hii-region ulirgs. most of the luminous buried agncandidates are found in ulirgs with cool far-infrared colors. where theabsorption-corrected intrinsic agn luminosities are derivable with littleuncertainty, they are found to be of the order of 10^12lsun, accounting for thebulk of the ulirgs' luminosities. the 5-35 micron spectroscopic starburst/agnclassifications are generally consistent with our previous classificationsbased on 3-4 micron spectra for the same sample.

astro-ph;0702552	anti-correlation between the mass of a supermassive black hole and the  mass accretion rate in type i ultraluminous infrared galaxies and nearby qsos	we discovered a significant anti-correlation between the mass of asupermassive black hole (smbh), $m_{\rm bh}$, and the luminosity ratio ofinfrared to active galactic nuclei (agn) eddington luminosity, $l_{\rmir}/l_{\rm edd}$, over four orders of magnitude for ultraluminous infraredgalaxies with type i seyfert nuclei (type i ulirgs) and nearby qsos. thisanti-correlation ($m_{\rm bh}$ vs. $l_{\rm ir}/l_{\rm edd}$) can be interpretedas the anti-correlation between the mass of a smbh and the rate of massaccretion onto a smbh normalized by the agn eddington rate, $\dot{m}_{\rmbh}/\dot{m}_{\rm edd}$. in other words, the mass accretion rate $\dot{m}_{\rmbh}$ is not proportional to that of the central bh mass. thus, thisanti-correlation indicates that bh growth is determined by the external masssupply process, and not the agn eddington-limited mechanism. moreover, we foundan interesting tendency for type i ulirgs to favor a super-eddington accretionflow, whereas qsos tended to show a sub-eddington flow. on the basis of ourfindings, we suggest that a central smbh grows by changing its mass accretionrate from super-eddington to sub-eddington. according to a coevolution scenarioof ulirgs and qsos based on the radiation drag process, it has been predictedthat a self-gravitating massive torus, whose mass is larger than a central bh,exists in the early phase of bh growth (type i ulirg phase) but not in thefinal phase of bh growth (qso phase). at the same time, if one considers themass accretion rate onto a central smbh via a turbulent viscosity, theanti-correlation ($m_{\rm bh}$ vs. $l_{\rm ir}/l_{\rm edd}$) is well explainedby the positive correlation between the mass accretion rate $\dot{m}_{\rm bh}$and the mass ratio of a massive torus to a smbh.
