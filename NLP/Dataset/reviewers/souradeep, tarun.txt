0901.0716	assumptions of the primordial spectrum and cosmological parameter  estimation	the observables of the perturbed universe, cmb anisotropy and largestructures, depend on a set of cosmological parameters, as well as, the assumednature of primordial perturbations. in particular, the shape of the primordialpower spectrum (pps) is, at best, a well motivated assumption. it is known thatthe assumed functional form of the pps in cosmological parameter estimation canaffect the best fit parameters and their relative confidence limits. in thispaper, we demonstrate that a specific assumed form actually drives the best fitparameters into distinct basins of likelihood in the space of cosmologicalparameters where the likelihood resists improvement via modifications to thepps. the regions where considerably better likelihoods are obtained allowingfree form pps lie outside these basins. in the absence of a preferred model ofinflation, this raises a concern that current cosmological parameters estimatesare strongly prejudiced by the assumed form of pps. our results stronglymotivate approaches toward simultaneous estimation of the cosmologicalparameters and the shape of the primordial spectrum from upcoming cosmologicaldata. it is equally important for theorists to keep an open mind towards earlyuniverse scenarios that produce features in the pps.

0901.1641	model independent foreground power spectrum estimation using wmap 5-year  data	in this paper, we propose &amp; implement on wmap 5-year data, a modelindependent approach of foreground power spectrum estimation for multifrequencyobservations of cmb experiments. recently a model independent approach of cmbpower spectrum estimation was proposed by saha et al. 2006. this methodologydemonstrates that cmb power spectrum can be reliably estimated solely from wmapdata without assuming any template models for the foreground components. in thecurrent paper, we extend this work to estimate the galactic foreground powerspectrum using the wmap 5 year maps following a self contained analysis. weapply the model independent method in harmonic basis to estimate the foregroundpower spectrum and frequency dependence of combined foregrounds. we also studythe behaviour of synchrotron spectral index variation over different regions ofthe sky. we compare our results with those obtained from mem foreground mapswhich are formed in pixel space. we find that relative to our model independentestimates mem maps overestimates the foreground power close to galactic planeand underestimates it at high latitudes.

0903.3634	cmb polarization and temperature power spectra estimation using linear  combination of wmap 5-year maps	we estimate cmb polarization and temperature power spectra using wmap 5-yearforeground contaminated maps. the power spectrum is estimated by using a modelindependent method, which does not utilize directly the diffuse foregroundtemplates nor the detector noise model. the method essentially consists of twosteps, (i) removal of diffuse foregrounds contamination by making linearcombination of individual maps in harmonic space and (ii) cross-correlation offoreground cleaned maps to minimize detector noise bias. for temperature powerspectrum we also estimate and subtract residual unresolved point sourcecontamination in the cross-power spectrum using the point source model providedby the wmap science team. our $tt$, $te$ and $ee$ power spectra are in goodagreement with the published results of the wmap science team. the error barson the polarization power spectra, however, turn out to be smaller incomparison to what is obtained by the wmap science team. we perform detailednumerical simulations to test for bias in our procedure. we find that the biasis small in all cases. a negative bias at low $l$ in $tt$ power spectrum hasbeen pointed in an earlier publication. we find that the bias correctedquadrupole power ($l(l+1)c_l/2\pi)$ is 532 $\mu k^2$, approximately 2.5 timesthe estimate (213.4 $\mu k^2$) made by the wmap team.

0904.2518	the tensor-to-scalar ratio in punctuated inflation	recently, we have shown that scalar spectra with lower power on large scalesand certain other features naturally occur in {\it punctuated inflation}, i.e.the scenario wherein a brief period of rapid roll is sandwiched between twostages of slow roll inflation. such spectra gain importance due to the factthat they can lead to a better fit of the observed cosmic microwave background(cmb) anisotropies, when compared to the conventional, featureless, power lawspectrum. in this paper, with examples from the canonical scalar field as wellas the tachyonic models, we illustrate that, in punctuated inflation, a drop inthe scalar power on large scales is {\it always} accompanied by a rise in thetensor power and, hence, an even more pronounced increase in thetensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ on these scales. interestingly, we find that $r$actually {\it exceeds well beyond unity} over a small range of scales. {\it toour knowledge, this work presents for the first time, examples of single scalarfield inflationary models wherein $r\gg 1$.} this feature opens up interestingpossibilities. for instance, we show that the rise in $r$ on large scalestranslates to a rapid increase in the angular power spectrum, $c_{\ell}^{\rmbb}$, of the b-mode polarization of the cmb at the low multipoles. we discussthe observational implications of these results.

0706.3567	cmb anisotropy power spectrum using linear combinations of wmap maps	in recent years the goal of estimating different cosmological parametersprecisely has set new challenges in the effort to accurately measure theangular power spectrum of cmb. this has required removal of foregroundcontamination as well as detector noise bias with reliability and precision.recently, a novel {\em model-independent} method for the estimation of cmbangular power spectrum solely from multi-frequency observations has beenproposed and implemented on the first year wmap data by saha et al. 2006. allprevious estimates of power spectrum of cmb are based upon foreground templatesusing data sets from different experiments. however our methodologydemonstrates that {\em cmb angular spectrum can be reliably estimated withprecision from a self contained analysis of the wmap data}. in this work weprovide a detailed description of this method. we also study and identify thebiases present in our power spectrum estimate. we apply our methodoly toextract the power spectrum from the wmap 1 year and 3 year data.

1001.1723	statistical isotropy violation of the cmb brightness fluctuations	certain anomalies at large angular scales in the cosmic microwave backgroundmeasured by wmap have been suggested as possible evidence of breakdown ofstatistical isotropy(si). most cmb photons free-stream to the present from thesurface of last scattering. it is thus reasonable to expect statisticalisotropy violation in the cmb photon distribution observed now to haveoriginated from si violation in the baryon-photon fluid at last scattering, inaddition to anisotropy of the primordial power spectrum studied earlier inliterature.  we consider the generalized anisotropic brightness distribution fluctuations,$\delta(\vec{k}, \hat{n}, \tau)$ (at conformal time $\tau$) in contrast to thesi case where it is simply a function of $|\vec{k}|$ and $\hat{k} \cdot\hat{n}$. the brightness fluctuations expanded in bipolar spherical harmonic(biposh) series, can then be written as $\delta_{\ell_1 \ell_2}^{l m}(\vec{k},\tau)$ where $l &gt; 0$ terms encode deviations from statistical isotropy. westudy the evolution of $\delta_{\ell_1 \ell_2}^{l m}(\vec{k}, \tau)$ fromnon-zero terms $\delta_{\ell_3 \ell_4}^{l m}(\vec{k}, \tau_s)$ at lastscattering. similar to the si case, power at small spherical harmonic (sh)multipoles of $\delta_{\ell_3 \ell_4}^{l m}(\vec{k},\tau_s)$ at the lastscattering, is transferred to $\delta_{\ell_1 \ell_2}^{l m}(\vec{k}, \tau)$ atlarger sh multipoles. the structural similarity is more apparent in theasymptotic expression for large values of the final sh multipoles. thisformalism allows an elegant identification of any si violation observed todayto a possible origin in the si violation present in the baryon-photon fluid(eg., due to the presence of significant magnetic field).

1005.2175	primordial features due to a step in the inflaton potential	certain oscillatory features in the primordial scalar power spectrum areknown to provide a better fit to the outliers in the cosmic microwavebackground data near the multipole moments of $\ell=22$ and 40. these featuresare usually generated by introducing a step in the popular, quadratic potentialdescribing the canonical scalar field. such a model will be ruled out, if thetensors remain undetected at a level corresponding to a tensor-to-scalar ratioof, say, $r\simeq 0.1$. in this work, in addition to the popular quadraticpotential, we investigate the effects of the step in a small field model and atachyon model. with possible applications to future datasets (such as planck)in mind, we evaluate the tensor power spectrum exactly, and include itscontribution in our analysis. we compare the models with the wmap (five as wellas seven-year), the quad and the acbar data. as expected, a step at aparticular location and of a suitable magnitude and width is found to improvethe fit to the outliers (near $\ell=22$ and 40) in all these cases. we pointout that, if the tensors prove to be small (say, $r\lesssim 0.01$), thequadratic potential and the tachyon model will cease to be viable, and moreattention will need to be paid to examples such as the small field models.

1006.0916	foreground maps in wmap frequency bands	this paper provides full sky maps of foreground emission in all wmapchannels, with very low residual contamination from the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) anisotropies and controlled level of instrumental noise.foreground maps are obtained by subtraction of a properly filtered cmb map,obtained from linear combinations of needlet-based representations of all wmapobservations and of a 100-micron map. the error in the reconstructed foregroundmaps on large scales is significantly lower than the original error due to cmbcontamination, while remaining of the order of the original wmap noise on smallscales. the level of the noise is estimated, which permits to implement localfilters for maximising the local signal to noise ratio. an example of suchfiltering, which reduces the small scale noise using latitude dependent filtersis implemented. this enhances significantly the contrast of galactic emission,in particular on intermediate angular scales and at intermediate galacticlatitude. the clean wmap foreground maps can be used to study the galacticinterstellar medium, in particular for the highest frequency channels for whichthe proper subtraction of cmb contamination is mandatory. the foregrounds mapscan be downloaded from a dedicated web site.

0708.2728	gravitational wave radiometry: mapping a stochastic gravitational wave  background	the problem of the detection and mapping of a stochastic gravitational wavebackground (sgwb), either of cosmological or astrophysical origin, bears astrong semblance to the analysis of cmb anisotropy and polarization. the basicstatistic we use is the cross-correlation between the data from a pair ofdetectors. in order to `point' the pair of detectors at different locations onemust suitably delay the signal by the amount it takes for the gravitationalwaves (gw) to travel to both detectors corresponding to a source direction.then the raw (observed) sky map of the sgwb is the signal convolved with a beamresponse function that varies with location in the sky. we first present athorough analytic understanding of the structure of the beam response functionusing an analytic approach employing the stationary phase approximation. thetrue sky map is obtained by numerically deconvolving the beam function in theintegral (convolution) equation. we adopt the maximum likelihood framework toestimate the true sky map that has been successfully used in the broadlysimilar, well-studied cmb map making problem. we numerically implement anddemonstrate the method on simulated (unpolarized) sgwb for the radiometerconsisting of the ligo pair of detectors at hanford and livingston. we include`realistic' additive gaussian noise in each data stream based on the ligo-inoise power spectral density. the extension of the method to multiple baselinesand polarized gwb is outlined. in the near future the network of gw detectors,including the advanced ligo and virgo detectors that will be sensitive tosources within a thousand times larger spatial volume, could provide promisingdata sets for gw radiometry.

0709.1944	estimation of primordial spectrum with post-wmap 3 year data	in this paper we implement an improved (error sensitive) richardson-lucydeconvolution algorithm on the measured angular power spectrum from the wmap 3year data to determine the primordial power spectrum assuming different pointsin the cosmological parameter space for a flat lcdm cosmological model. we alsopresent the preliminary results of the cosmological parameter estimation byassuming a free form of the primordial spectrum, for a reasonably large volumeof the parameter space. the recovered spectrum for a considerably large numberof the points in the cosmological parameter space has a likelihood far betterthan a `best fit' power law spectrum up to \delta \chi^2_{eff} \approx -30. weuse discrete wavelet transform (dwt) for smoothing the raw recovered spectrumfrom the binned data. the results obtained here reconfirm and sharpen theconclusion drawn from our previous analysis of the wmap 1st year data. a sharpcut off around the horizon scale and a bump after the horizon scale seem to bea common feature for all of these reconstructed primordial spectra. we haveshown that although the wmap 3 year data prefers a lower value of matterdensity for a power law form of the primordial spectrum, for a free form of thespectrum, we can get a very good likelihood to the data for higher values ofmatter density. we have also shown that even a flat cdm model, allowing a freeform of the primordial spectrum, can give a very high likelihood fit to thedata. theoretical interpretation of the results is open to the cosmologycommunity. however, this work provides strong evidence that the data retainsdiscriminatory power in the cosmological parameter space even when there isfull freedom in choosing the primordial spectrum.

1104.3201	`standard' cosmological model &amp; beyond with cmb	observational cosmology has indeed made very rapid progress in the pastdecade. the ability to quantify the universe has largely improved due toobservational constraints coming from structure formation measurements of cmbanisotropy and, more recently, polarization have played a very important role.besides precise determination of various parameters of the `standard'cosmological model, observations have also established some important basictenets that underlie models of cosmology and structure formation in theuniverse -- `acausally' correlated initial perturbations in a flat,statistically isotropic universe, adiabatic nature of primordial densityperturbations. these are consistent with the expectation of the paradigm ofinflation and the generic prediction of the simplest realization ofinflationary scenario in the early universe. further, gravitational instabilityis the established mechanism for structure formation from these initialperturbations. the signature of primordial perturbations observed as the cmbanisotropy and polarization is the most compelling evidence for new, possiblyfundamental, physics in the early universe. the community is now looking beyondthe estimation of parameters of a working `standard' model of cosmology forsubtle, characteristic signatures from early universe physics.

1106.2798	oscillations in the inflaton potential: complete numerical treatment and  comparison with the recent and forthcoming cmb datasets	amongst the multitude of inflationary models currently available, models thatlead to features in the primordial scalar spectrum are drawing increasingattention, since certain features have been found to provide a better fit tothe cmb data than the conventional, nearly scale invariant, primordialspectrum. in this work, we carry out a complete numerical analysis of twomodels that lead to oscillations over all scales in the scalar power spectrum.we consider the model described by a quadratic potential which is superposed bya sinusoidal modulation and the recently popular axion monodromy model. sincethe oscillations continue even on to arc minute scales, in addition to the wmapdata, we also compare the models with the small scale data from act. though,both the models, broadly, result in oscillations in the spectrum,interestingly, we find that, while the monodromy model leads to a considerablybetter fit to the data in comparison to the standard power law spectrum, thequadratic potential superposed with a sinusoidal modulation does not improvethe fit to a similar extent. we also carry out forecasting of the parametersusing simulated planck data for both the models. we show that the planck mockdata performs better in constraining the model parameters as compared to thepresently available cmb datasets.

1107.0516	evolution of the cmb power spectrum across wmap data releases: a  nonparametric analysis	using a nonparametric function estimation methodology, we present acomparative analysis of the wmap 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-year data releases for thecmb angular power spectrum with respect to the following key questions: (a) howwell is the power spectrum determined by the data alone? (b) how well is the$\lambda$cdm model supported by a model-independent, data-driven analysis? (c)what are the realistic uncertainties on peak/dip locations and heights? ourresults show that the height of the power spectrum is well determined by dataalone for multipole l approximately less than 546 (1-year), 667 (3-year), 804(5-year), and 842 (7-year data). we show that parametric fits based on the$\lambda$cdm model are remarkably close to our nonparametric fits in$l$-regions where data are sufficiently precise. in contrast, the powerspectrum for an h$\lambda$cdm model gets progressively pushed away from ournonparametric fit as data quality improves with successive data realizations,suggesting incompatibility of this particular cosmological model with respectto the wmap data sets. we present uncertainties on peak/dip locations andheights at the 95% ($2 \sigma$) level of confidence, and show how theseuncertainties translate into hyperbolic "bands" on the acoustic scale ($l_a$)and peak shift ($\phi_m$) parameters. based on the confidence set for the7-year data, we argue that the low-l up-turn in the cmb power spectrum cannotbe ruled out at any confidence level in excess of about 10% ($\approx 0.12\sigma$). additional outcomes of this work are a numerical formulation forminimization of a noise-weighted risk function subject to monotonicityconstraints, a prescription for obtaining nonparametric fits that are closer tocosmological expectations on smoothness, and a method for samplingcosmologically meaningful power spectrum variations from the confidence set ofa nonparametric fit.

1108.5600	cosmological parameter estimation using particle swarm optimization  (pso)	obtaining the set of cosmological parameters consistent with observationaldata is an important exercise in current cosmological research. it involvesfinding the global maximum of the likelihood function in the multi-dimensionalparameter space. currently sampling based methods, which are in generalstochastic in nature, like markov-chain monte carlo(mcmc), are being commonlyused for parameter estimation. the beauty of stochastic methods is that thecomputational cost grows, at the most, linearly in place of exponentially (asin grid based approaches) with the dimensionality of the search space. mcmcmethods sample the full joint probability distribution (posterior) from whichone and two dimensional probability distributions, best fit (average) values ofparameters and then error bars can be computed. in the present work wedemonstrate the application of another stochastic method, named particle swarmoptimization (pso), that is widely used in the field of engineering andartificial intelligence, for cosmological parameter estimation from wmap sevenyears data. we find that there is a good agreement between the values of thebest fit parameters obtained from pso and publicly available code cosmomc.however, there is a slight disagreement between error bars mainly due to thefact that errors are computed differently in pso. apart from presenting theresults of our exercise, we also discuss the merits of pso and explain itsusefulness in more extensive search in higher dimensional parameter space.

1109.0729	statistics of bipolar representation of cmb maps	gaussianity of temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwavebackground(cmb) implies that the statistical properties of the temperaturefield can be completely characterized by its two point correlation function.the two point correlation function can be expanded in full generality in thebipolar spherical harmonic(biposh) basis. looking for significant deviationsfrom zero for bipolar spherical harmonic(biposh) coefficients derived fromobserved cmb maps forms the basis of the strategy used to detect isotropyviolation. in order to quantify "significant deviation" we need to understandthe distributions of these coefficients. we analytically evaluate the momentsand the distribution of the coefficients of expansion($a^{lm}_{l_1 l_2}$),using characteristic function approach. we show that for biposh coefficientswith m=0 an analytical form for the moments up to any arbitrary order can bederived. for the remaining biposh coefficients with $m\neq0$, the momentsderived using the characteristic function approach need to be supplemented witha correction term. the correction term is found to be important particularly atlow multipoles. we provide a general prescription for calculating thesecorrections, however we restrict the explicit calculations only up to kurtosis.we confirm our results with measurements of biposh coefficients on numericallysimulated statistically isotropic cmb maps.

1111.3357	wmap anomaly : weak lensing in disguise	statistical isotropy (si) has been one of the simplifying assumptions incosmological model building. experiments like wmap and planck are attempting totest this assumption by searching for specific signals in the cosmic microwavebackground (cmb) two point correlation function. modifications to thiscorrelation function due to gravitational lensing by the large scale structure(lss) surrounding us have been ignored in this context. gravitational lensingwill induce signals which mimic isotropy violation even in an isotropicuniverse. the signal detected in the bipolar spherical harmonic (biposh)coefficients $a^{20}_{ll}$ by the wmap team may be explained by accounting forthe lensing modifications to these coefficients. further the difference in theamplitude of the signal detected in the v-band and w-band maps can be explainedby accounting for the differences in the designed angular sensitivity of theinstrumental beams. the arguments presented in this article have crucialimplications for si violation studies. constraining si violation will only bepossible by complementing cmb data sets with all sky measurements of the largescale dark matter distribution. till that time, the signal detected in thebiposh coefficients from wmap-7 could also be yet another suggested evidence ofstrong deviations from the standard $\lambda$cdm cosmology based on homogeneousand isotropic frw models.

1210.7318	revealing non-circular beam effect in wmap-7 cmb maps with biposh  measures of statistical isotropy	mild, unavoidable deviations from circular-symmetry of instrumental beams incurrent cosmic microwave background (cmb) experiments now pose a significantchallenge to deriving high precision inferences from the high sensitivity andresolution of cmb measurements. we present analytic results, verified bynumerical simulations, that cmb maps of cosmological signal that respectunderlying statistical isotropy (si) symmetry, measured with an instrument thathas mildly non-circular (nc) beam would, nevertheless, exhibit si violation.further, we show that appropriate observable measures constructed within thebipolar spherical harmonic (biposh) representation of si violation capturesubtle nc-beam effects coupled with the scan strategy of the instrument.  accompanying their latest 7-year data release, the wmap team published veryhigh significance measurements of non-zero biposh spectra, a^{20}_{l l} anda^{20}_{l-2 l}, in the "w" and "v" band of the experiment. we present a strongcase that the biposh measurement are primarily explained by the quadrupolar(m=2) component of the nc-beams, b_{l2}, of the respective channels. the factthat subtle levels of non-circularity, e.g., wmap beams |b_{l2}|/b_{l0} &lt; 0.01,lead to measurable biposh spectra points to the immense promise and potentialof the biposh representation. the key result of this work is that using biposhmeasurements it is possible to estimate an equivalent single hit,'paralleltransported' effective nc-beam that matches both the angular power spectrum andthe non-zero biposh measurements of the observed maps. hence, biposh analysisprovides a very simple and effective characterization of cmb maps made withnc-beam.

1211.2585	from nonparametric power spectra to inference about cosmological  parameters: a random walk in the cosmological parameter space	what do the data, as distinguished from cosmological models, tell us aboutcosmological parameters that determined the model of the universe? in thispaper, we address this question in the context of the wmap angular powerspectra for the cosmic microwave background radiation. nonparametric methodsare ideally suited for this purpose because they are model-independent byconstruction, and therefore allow inferences that are as data-driven aspossible. our analysis is based on a nonparametric fit to the wmap 7-year powerspectrum data, with uncertainties characterized in the form of ahigh-dimensional confidence set centered at this fit. for the purpose of makinginferences about cosmological parameters, we have devised a sampling method toexplore the projection of this confidence set around the nonparametric fit,into the space of seven cosmological parameters omega_b, omega_c, omega_lambda,omega_k, h_0, n_s, tau). our sampling method is justified by its computationalsimplicity, and validated by the fact that well-known degeneracies in thiscosmological parameter space are correctly reproduced in our results. ourresults show that cosmological parameters are not as tightly constrained bythese data alone. however, incorporating additional prior information in theanalysis (e.g., constraining the values of h_0 or omega_k) leads to tighterconfidence intervals on parameters that are consistent with uncertaintiesestimated by the mainstream parametric methods.

1303.5336	cosmological parameter estimation with free-form primordial power  spectrum	constraints on the main cosmological parameters using cmb or large scalestructure data are usually based on power-law assumption of the primordialpower spectrum (pps). however, in the absence of a preferred model for theearly universe, this raises a concern that current cosmological parameterestimates are strongly prejudiced by the assumed power-law form of pps. in thispaper, for the first time, we perform cosmological parameter estimationallowing the free form of the primordial spectrum. this is in fact the mostgeneral approach to estimate cosmological parameters without assuming anyparticular form for the primordial spectrum. we use direct reconstruction ofthe pps for any point in the cosmological parameter space using recentlymodified richardson-lucy algorithm however other alternative reconstructionmethods could be used for this purpose as well. we use wmap 9 year data in ouranalysis considering cmb lensing effect and we report, for the first time, thatthe flat spatial universe with no cosmological constant is ruled out by morethan 4\sigma confidence limit without assuming any particular form of theprimordial spectrum. this would be probably the most robust indication for darkenergy using cmb data alone. our results on the estimated cosmologicalparameters show that higher values of baryonic and matter density and lowervalue of hubble parameter (in comparison to the estimated values by assumingpower-law pps) is preferred by the data. however, the estimated cosmologicalparameters by assuming free form of the pps have overlap at 1\sigma confidencelevel with the estimated values assuming power-law form of pps.

1307.0001	leakage of power from dipole to higher multipoles due to non-symmetric  wmap beam	a number of studies of wmap and planck have highlighted that the power at thelow multipoles in cmb power spectrum are lower than their theoreticallypredicted values. possible angular correlation between the orientations ofthese low multipoles have also been claimed. it is important to investigate thepossibility that the power deficiency at low multipoles may not be ofprimordial origin and is only an observation artifact coming from the scanprocedure adapted in the wmap or planck satellites. therefore, its alwaysimportant to investigate all the observational artifacts that can mimic them.the cmb dipole which is almost 550 times higher than the quadrupole can leak tothe higher multipoles due to the non-symmetric beam shape of the wmap. in thispaper a formalism has been developed and simulations are carried out to studythe effect of the non-symmetric beam on this power transfer. it is interestingto observed that a small but non-negligible amount of power from the dipole canget transferred to the quadrupole and the higher multipoles due to thenon-symmetric beam. it is shown that in case of wmap scan strategy the shape ofthe quadrupole coming due to this power leakage is very much similar to theobserved quadrupole from wmap data. simulations have also been carried out forplanck scan strategy. it is seen that for planck scan strategy the powertransfer is not only limited to the quadrupole but also to a few higher lowmultipoles. since the actual beam shapes of planck are not publicly availablewe present results in terms of upper limits on asymmetric beam parameters thatwould contaminate of the quadrupole power at the level of $1\mu k$.

1309.4784	cmb polarization te power spectrum estimation with non-circular beam	precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropy havebeen one of the foremost concerns in modern cosmology as it provides valuableinformation on the cosmology of the universe. however, an accurate estimationof the cmb power spectrum faces many challenges as the cmb experimentssensitivity increases. furthermore, for polarization experiments the precisionof measurement is complicated by the fact that the polarisation signal is veryfaint compared to the measured total intensity, and could be impossible todetect in the presence of high level of systematics. one of the most importantsource of errors in cmb polarization experiment is the beam asymmetry. forlarge data set the estimation of the cmb polarization power spectrum withstandard optimal maximum likelihood (ml) is prohibitive for high resolution cmbexperiments due to the enormous required computation time. in this paper, wepresent a semi-analytical framework using the pseudo-$c_{l}$ estimator tocompute the power spectrum te of the temperature anisotropy and the e-componentof the polarization radiation field using non-circular beams. we adopt a modelof beams obtained from a perturbative expansion of the beam around a circular(axisymmetric) one in harmonic space, and compute the resulting bias matrixwhich relates the true power spectrum with the observed one using an efficientalgorithm for rapid computation. we show that for a multipole up to$l_{max}=500$, the bias matrix can be computed in less than one second with asingle cpu processor at 2.53 ghz. we find that the uncertainties induced by thebeam asymmetry in the polarization power spectrum at the peak of the biasmatrix for wmap and planck experiments can be as large as a few 10 to 20%(upper limit for planck lfi 30 ghz)

1312.0025	suppressing cmb low multipoles with isw effect	recent results of planck data reveal that the power in the low multipoles ofthe cmb angular power spectrum, approximately up to $l=30$, is significantlylower than the theoretically predicted in the best fit $\lambda$cdm model. inthis paper we investigate the possibility of invoking the integratedsachs-wolfe (isw) effect to explain this power deficit at low multipoles. theisw effect that originates from the late time expansion history of the universeis rich in possibilities given the limited understanding of the origin of darkenergy (de). it is a common understanding that the isw effect adds to the powerat the low multipoles of the cmb angular power spectrum. in this paper we carryout an analytic study to show that there are some expansion histories in whichthe isw effect, instead of adding power, provides negative contribution to thepower at low multipoles. guided by the analytic study, we present examples ofthe features required in the late time expansion history of the universe thatcould explain the power deficiency through the isw effect. we also show that anisw origin of power deficiency is consistent, at present, with othercosmological observations that probe the expansion history such as distancemodulus, matter power spectrum and the evolution of cluster number count. wealso show that the isw effect may be distinguished from power deficitoriginating from features in the pps using the measurements of the cmbpolarization spectrum at low multipoles expected from planck. we conclude thatthe power at low multipoles of the cmb anisotropy could well be closely linkedto dark energy puzzle in cosmology and this observation could be actuallypointing to richer phenomenology of de beyond the cosmological constant$\lambda$.

1410.8835	estimation of inflation parameters for perturbed power law model using  recent cmb measurements	cosmic microwave background (cmb) is an important probe for understanding theinflationary era of the universe. we consider the perturbed power law (ppl)model of inflation which is a soft deviation from power law (pl) inflationarymodel. this model captures the effect of higher order derivative of hubbleparameter during inflation, which in turn leads to a non-zero effective mass$m_{\rm eff}$ for the inflaton field. the higher order derivatives of hubbleparameter at leading order sources constant difference in the spectral indexfor scalar and tensor perturbation going beyond pl model of inflation. pplmodel have two observable independent parameters, namely spectral index fortensor perturbation $\nu_t$ and change in spectral index for scalarperturbation $\nu_{st}$ to explain the observed features in the scalar andtensor power spectrum of perturbation. from the recent measurements of cmbpower spectra by wmap, planck and bicep-2 for temperature and polarization, weestimate the feasibility of ppl model with standard $\lambda$cdm model.although bicep-2 claimed a detection of $r=0.2$, estimates of dustcontamination provided by planck have left open the possibility that only upperbound on $r$ will be expected in a joint analysis. as a result we considerdifferent upper bounds on the value of $r$ and show that ppl model can explaina lower value of tensor to scalar ratio ($r&lt;0.1$ or $r&lt;0.01$) for a scalarspectral index of $n_s=0.96$ by having a non-zero value of effective mass ofthe inflaton field $\frac{m^2_{\rm eff}}{h^2}$. the analysis with wp+ plancklikelihood shows a non-zero detection of $\frac{m^2_{\rm eff}}{h^2}$ with$5.7\,\sigma$ and $8.1\,\sigma$ respectively for $r&lt;0.1$ and $r&lt;0.01$. whereas,with bicep-2 likelihood $\frac{m^2_{\rm eff}}{h^2} = -0.0237 \pm 0.0135$ whichis consistent with zero.

1412.3552	unveiling acoustic physics of the cmb using nonparametric estimation of  the temperature angular power spectrum for planck	estimation of the angular power spectrum is one of the important steps incosmic microwave background (cmb) data analysis. here, we present anonparametric estimate of the temperature angular power spectrum for the planck2013 cmb data. the method implemented in this work is model-independent, andallows the data, rather than the model, to dictate the fit. since one of themain targets of our analysis is to test the consistency of the $\lambda$cdmmodel with planck 2013 data, we use the nuisance parameters associated with thebest-fit $\lambda$cdm angular power spectrum to remove foreground contributionsfrom the data at multipoles $\ell \geq50$. we thus obtain a combined angularpower spectrum data set together with the full covariance matrix, appropriatelyweighted over frequency channels. our subsequent nonparametric analysisresolves six peaks (and five dips) up to $\ell \sim1850$ in the temperatureangular power spectrum. we present uncertainties in the peak/dip locations andheights at the $95\%$ confidence level. we further show how these reflect theharmonicity of acoustic peaks, and can be used for acoustic scale estimation.based on this nonparametric formalism, we found the best-fit $\lambda$cdm modelto be at $36\%$ confidence distance from the center of the nonparametricconfidence set -- this is considerably larger than the confidence distance($9\%$) derived earlier from a similar analysis of the wmap 7-year data.another interesting result of our analysis is that at low multipoles, theplanck data do not suggest any upturn, contrary to the expectation based on theintegrated sachs-wolfe contribution in the best-fit $\lambda$cdm cosmology.

1501.02647	joint planck and wmap assessment of low cmb multipoles	the remarkable progress in cosmic microwave background (cmb) studies overpast decade has led to the era of precision cosmology in striking agreementwith the $\lambda$cdm model. however, the lack of power in the cmb temperatureanisotropies at large angular scales (low-$\ell$), as has been confirmed by therecent planck data also (up to $\ell=40$), although statistically not verystrong (less than $3\sigma$), is still an open problem. one can avoid to seekan explanation for this problem by attributing the lack of power to cosmicvariance orcan look for explanations i.e., different inflationary potentials orinitial conditions for infl ation to begin with, non-trivial topology, isweffect etc. features in the primordial power spectrum (pps) motivated by theearly universe physics has been the most common solution to address thisproblem. in the present work we also follow this approach and consider a set ofpps which have features and constrain the parameters of those using wmap 9 yearand planck data employing markov-chain monte carlo (mcmc) analysis. theprominent feature of all the models of pps that we consider is an infra-red cutoff which leads to suppression of power at large angular scales. we considermodels of pps with maximum three extra parameters and use akaike informationcriterion ($aic$) and bayesian information criterion ($bic$) of model andbayesian information criterion ($bic$) of model selection to compare themodels. for most models, we find good constraints for the cut off scale $k_c$,however, for other parameters our constraints are not that good. we find thatsharp cut off model gives best likelihood value for the wmap 9 year data, butis as good as power law model according to $aic$. for the joint wmap 9+planckdata set, starobinsky model is slightly preferred by $aic$ which is also ableto produce cmb power suppression up to $\ell\leq30$ to some extent.

1511.03672	estimating si violation in cmb due to non-circular beam and complex scan  in minutes	mild, unavoidable deviations from circular-symmetry of instrumental beamsalong with scan strategy can give rise to measurable statistical isotropy (si)violation in cosmic microwave background (cmb) experiments. if not accountedproperly, this spurious signal can complicate the extraction of other siviolation signals (if any) in the data. however, estimation of this effectthrough exact numerical simulation is computationally intensive and timeconsuming. a generalized analytical formalism not only provides a quick way ofestimating this signal, but also gives a detailed understanding connecting theleading beam anisotropy components to a measurable biposh characterisation ofsi violation. in this paper, we provide an approximate generic analyticalmethod for estimating the si violation generated due to a non-circular (nc)beam and arbitrary scan strategy, in terms of the bipolar spherical harmonic(biposh) spectra. our analytical method can predict almost all the featuresintroduced by a nc beam in a complex scan and thus reduces the need forextensive numerical simulation worth tens of thousands of cpu hours intominutes long calculations. as an illustrative example, we use wmap beams andscanning strategy to demonstrate the easability, usability and efficiency ofour method. we test all our analytical results against that from exactnumerical simulations.

astro-ph;0608199	angular power spectrum of cmb anisotropy from wmap	the remarkable improvement in the estimates of different cosmologicalparameters in recent years has been largely spearheaded by accuratemeasurements of the angular power spectrum of cosmic microwave background (cmb)radiation. this has required removal of foreground contamination as well asdetector noise bias with reliability and precision. recently, a novelmodel-independent method for the estimation of cmb angular power spectrum frommulti-frequency observations has been proposed and implemented on the firstyear wmap (wmap-1) data by saha et al.~2006. we review the results from wmap-1and also present the new angular power spectrum based on three years of thewmap data (wmap-3). previous estimates have depended on foreground templatesbuilt using extraneous observational input to remove foreground contamination.this is the first demonstration that the cmb angular spectrum can be reliablyestimated with precision from a self contained analysis of the wmap data. theprimary product of wmap are the observations of cmb in 10 independentdifference assemblies (da) distributed over 5 frequency bands that haveuncorrelated noise. our method utilizes maximum information available withinwmap data by linearly combining da maps from different frequencies to removeforegrounds and estimating the power spectrum from the 24 cross power spectraof clean maps that have independent noise. an important merit of the method isthat the expected residual power from unresolved point sources is significantlytempered to a constant offset at large multipoles (in contrast to the ~l^2contribution expected from a poisson distribution) leading to a smallcorrection at large multipoles. hence, the power spectrum estimates are lesssusceptible to uncertainties in the model of point sources.

astro-ph;0611352	features in the primordial spectrum from wmap: a wavelet analysis	precise measurements of the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave backgroundenable us to do an accurate study on the form of the primordial power spectrumfor a given set of cosmological parameters. in a previous paper (shafieloo andsouradeep 2004), we implemented an improved (error sensitive) richardson-lucydeconvolution algorithm on the measured angular power spectrum from the firstyear of wmap data to determine the primordial power spectrum assuming aconcordance cosmological model. this recovered spectrum has a likelihood farbetter than a scale invariant, or, `best fit' scale free spectra (\delta ln l =25 w.r.t. harrison zeldovich, and, \delta ln l = 11 w.r.t. power law withn_s=0.95). in this paper we use discrete wavelet transform (dwt) to decomposethe local features of the recovered spectrum individually to study their effectand significance on the recovered angular power spectrum and hence thelikelihood. we show that besides the infra-red cut off at the horizon scale,the associated features of the primordial power spectrum around the horizonhave a significant effect on improving the likelihood. the strong features arelocalised at the horizon scale.

astro-ph;0702100	cmb power spectrum estimation with non-circular beam and incomplete sky  coverage	over the last decade, measurements of the cmb anisotropy has spearheaded theremarkable transition of cosmology into a precision science. however,addressing the systematic effects in the increasingly sensitive, highresolution, `full' sky measurements from different cmb experiments pose a stiffchallenge. the analysis techniques must not only be computationally fast tocontend with the huge size of the data, but, the higher sensitivity also limitsthe simplifying assumptions which can then be invoked to achieve the desiredspeed without compromising the final precision goals. while maximum likelihoodis desirable, the enormous computational cost makes the suboptimal method ofpower spectrum estimation using pseudo-c_l unavoidable for high resolutiondata. we provide a (semi)analytic framework to estimate bias in the powerspectrum due to the effect of beam non-circularity and non-uniform sky coverageincluding incomplete/masked sky maps and scan strategy. the approach isperturbative in the distortion of the beam from non-circularity, allowing forrapid computations when the beam is mildly non-circular. we advocate that it iscomputationally advantageous to employ `soft' azimuthally apodized masks whosespherical harmonic transform die down fast with m. we numerically implement ourmethod for non-rotating beams. we present preliminary estimates of thecomputational cost to evaluate the bias for the upcoming cmb anisotropy probesl_max~3000, with angular resolution comparable to the planck surveyor mission.we further show that this implementation and estimate is applicable forrotating beams on equal declination scans and possibly can be extended tosimple approximations to other scan strategies.

astro-ph;9702212	constraints on compact hyperbolic spaces from cobe	the (large angle) cobe dmr data can be used to probe the global topology ofour universe on scales comparable to and just beyond the present ``horizon''.for compact topologies, the two main effects on the cmb are: [1] the breakingof statistical isotropy in characteristic patterns determined by the photongeodesic structure of the manifold and [2] an infrared cutoff in the powerspectrum of perturbations imposed by the finite spatial extent. to make adetailed confrontation of these effects with the cobe maps requires thecomputation of the pixel-pixel temperature correlation function for eachtopology and for each orientation of it relative to the sky. we present ageneral technique using the method of images for doing this in compacthyperbolic (ch) topologies which does not require spatial eigenmodedecomposition. we demonstrate that strong constraints on compactness followfrom [2] and that these limits can be improved by exploiting the details of thegeodesic structure for each individual topology ([1]), as we show for the flat3-torus and selected ch models.

astro-ph;9708015	skewness in the cosmic microwave background anisotropy from inflationary  gravity wave background	in the context of inflationary scenarios, the observed large angle anisotropyof the cosmic microwave background (cmb) temperature is believed to probe theprimordial metric perturbations from inflation. although the perturbations frominflation are expected to be gaussian random fields, there remains thepossibility that nonlinear processes at later epochs induce ``secondary''non-gaussian features in the corresponding cmb anisotropy maps. thenon-gaussianity induced by nonlinear gravitational instability of scalar(density) perturbations has been investigated in existing literature. in thispaper, we highlight another source of non-gaussianity arising out of higherorder scattering of cmb photons off the metric perturbations. we provide asimple and elegant formalism for deriving the cmb temperature fluctuationsarising due to the sachs-wolfe effect beyond the linear order. in particular,we derive the expression for the second order cmb temperature fluctuations. themultiple scattering effect pointed out in this paper leads to the possibilitythat tensor metric perturbation, i.e., gravity waves (gw) which do not exhibitgravitational instability can still contribute to the skewness in the cmbanisotropy maps. we find that in a flat $\omega =1$ universe, the skewness incmb contributed by gravity waves via multiple scattering effect is comparableto that from the gravitational instability of scalar perturbations for equalcontribution of the gravity waves and scalar perturbations to the total rms cmbanisotropy. the secondary skewness is found to be smaller than the cosmicvariance leading to the conclusion that inflationary scenarios do predict thatthe observed cmb anisotropy should be statistically consistent with a gaussianrandom distribution.

astro-ph;9804041	computing cmb anisotropy in compact hyperbolic spaces	the measurements of cmb anisotropy have opened up a window for probing theglobal topology of the universe on length scales comparable to and beyond thehubble radius. for compact topologies, the two main effects on the cmb are: (1)the breaking of statistical isotropy in characteristic patterns determined bythe photon geodesic structure of the manifold and (2) an infrared cutoff in thepower spectrum of perturbations imposed by the finite spatial extent. wepresent a completely general scheme using the regularized method of images forcalculating cmb anisotropy in models with nontrivial topology, and apply it tothe computationally challenging compact hyperbolic topologies. this newtechnique eliminates the need for the difficult task of spatial eigenmodedecomposition on these spaces. we estimate a bayesian probability for aselection of models by confronting the theoretical pixel-pixel temperaturecorrelation function with the cobe-dmr data. our results demonstrate thatstrong constraints on compactness arise: if the universe is small compared tothe `horizon' size, correlations appear in the maps that are irreconcilablewith the observations. if the universe is of comparable size, the likelihoodfunction is very dependent upon orientation of the manifold wrt the sky. whilemost orientations may be strongly ruled out, it sometimes happens that for aspecific orientation the predicted correlation patterns are preferred over theconventional infinite models.

0809.3915	punctuated inflation and the low cmb multipoles	we investigate inflationary scenarios driven by a class of potentials whichare similar in form to those that arise in certain minimal supersymmetricextensions of the standard model. we find that these potentials allow a briefperiod of departure from inflation sandwiched between two stages of slow rollinflation. we show that such a background behavior leads to a step like featurein the scalar power spectrum. we set the scales such that the drop in the powerspectrum occurs at a length scale that corresponds to the hubble radiustoday--a feature that seems necessary to explain the lower power observed inthe quadrupole moment of the cosmic microwave background (cmb) anisotropies. weperform a markov chain monte carlo analysis to determine the values of themodel parameters that provide the best fit to the recent wmap 5-year data forthe cmb angular power spectrum. we find that an inflationary spectrum with asuppression of power at large scales that we obtain leads to a much better fit(with just one extra parameter, $\chi_{\rm eff}^{2}$ improves by 6.62) of theobserved data when compared to the best fit reference $\lambda$cdm model with afeatureless, power law, primordial spectrum.

astro-ph;9912124	cmb anisotropy in compact hyperbolic universes i: computing correlation  functions	cmb anisotropy measurements have brought the issue of global topology of theuniverse from the realm of theoretical possibility to within the grasp ofobservations. the global topology of the universe modifies the correlationproperties of cosmic fields. in particular, strong correlations are predictedin cmb anisotropy patterns on the largest observable scales if the size of theuniverse is comparable to the distance to the cmb last scattering surface. wedescribe in detail our completely general scheme using a regularized method ofimages for calculating such correlation functions in models with nontrivialtopology, and apply it to the computationally challenging compact hyperbolicspaces. our procedure directly sums over images within a specified radius,ideally many times the diameter of the space, effectively treats more distantimages in a continuous approximation, and uses cesaro resummation to furthersharpen the results. at all levels of approximation the symmetries of the spaceare preserved in the correlation function. this new technique eliminates theneed for the difficult task of spatial eigenmode decomposition on these spaces.although the eigenspectrum can be obtained by this method if desired, at agiven level of approximation the correlation functions are more accuratelydetermined. we use the 3-torus example to demonstrate that the method worksvery well. we apply it to power spectrum as well as correlation functionevaluations in a number of compact hyperbolic (ch) spaces. application to thecomputation of cmb anisotropy correlations on ch spaces, and the observationalconstraints following from them, are given in a companion paper.

astro-ph;9912144	cmb anisotropy in compact hyperbolic universes ii: cobe maps and limits	we calculate the cmb anisotropy in compact hyperbolic universe models usingthe regularized method of images described in paper-i, including the'line-of-sight `integrated sachs-wolfe' effect, as well as the last-scatteringsurface terms. we calculate the bayesian probabilities for a selection ofmodels by confronting our theoretical pixel-pixel temperature correlationfunctions with the cobe-dmr data. our results demonstrate that strongconstraints on compactness arise: if the universe is small compared to the`horizon' size, correlations appear in the maps that are irreconcilable withthe observations. this conclusion is qualitatively insensitive to the mattercontent of the universe, in particular, the presence of a cosmologicalconstant. if the universe is of comparable size to the 'horizon', thelikelihood function is very dependent upon orientation of the manifold wrt thesky. while most orientations may be strongly ruled out, it sometimes happensthat for a specific orientation the predicted correlation patterns arepreferred over those for the conventional infinite models. the full bayesiananalysis we use is the most complete statistical test that can be done on thecobe maps, taking into account all possible signals and their variances in thetheoretical skies, in particular the high degree of anisotropic correlationthat can exist. we show that standard visual measures for comparing theoreticalpredictions with the data such as the isotropized power spectrum $c_\ell$ arenot so useful in small compact spaces because of enhanced cosmic varianceassociated with the breakdown of statistical isotropy.

gr-qc;0105121	relic gravity waves from braneworld inflation	we discuss a scenario in which extra dimensional effects allow a scalar fieldwith a steep potential to play the dual role of the inflaton as well as darkenergy (quintessence). the post-inflationary evolution of the universe in thisscenario is generically characterised by a `kinetic regime' during which thekinetic energy of the scalar field greatly exceeds its potential energyresulting in a `stiff' equation of state for scalar field matter $p_\phi \simeq\rho_\phi$. the kinetic regime precedes the radiation dominated epoch andintroduces an important new feature into the spectrum of relic gravity wavescreated quantum mechanically during inflation. the gravity wave spectrumincreases with wavenumber for wavelengths shorter than the comoving horizonscale at the commencement of the radiative regime. this `blue tilt' is ageneric feature of models with steep potentials and imposes strong constraintson a class of inflationary braneworld models. prospects for detection of thegravity wave background by terrestrial and space-borne gravity waveobservatories such as ligo ii and lisa are discussed.

hep-ph;9208219	quantum effects near a point mass in 2+1 dimensional gravity	we investigate the behaviour of classical and quantum fields in the conicalspace-time associated with a point mass in 2+1 dimensions. we show that thepresence of conical boundary conditions alters the electrostatic field of apoint charge leading to the presence of a finite self-force on the charge fromthe direction of the point mass exactly as if the point mass itself werecharged. the conical space-time geometry also affects the zero pointfluctuations of a quantum scalar field leading to the existence of a vacuumpolarisation --- $\langle t_\mn \rangle$, in the 2+1 dimensional analog of theschwarzschild metric. the resulting linearised semi-classical einsteinequations --- $g_\mn = 8 \pi g \langle t_\mn \rangle$, possess a well definednewtonian limit, in marked contrast to the classical case for which nonewtonian limit is known to exist. an elegant reformulation of our results interms of the method of images is also presented.  our analysis also covers the non-static de sitter--schwarzschild metric in2+1 dimensions, in which in addition to the vacuum polarisation, a non-zerovacuum flux ofenergy -- $\langle t_{rt} \rangle $ is also found to exist.aspart of this analysis, we evaluate the scalar field propagator in an$n$-dimensional de sitter space,

hep-ph;9303285	post-cobe predictions for inflationary gravity wave and density  perturbation spectra	we assess the relative contribution to the cobe - measured microwaveanisotropy arising both from relic gravity waves as well as primordial densityperturbations originating during inflation. we show that the gravity wavecontribution to the cmbr anisotropy depends sensitively upon $n$ -- theprimordial spectral index ($\dk^2 \propto k^n$), increasing as $n$ deviatesfrom a harrison - zeldovich spectrum (n = 1). as a result, for $n &lt; 0.84$ thecontribution from gravity waves towards $\delta t/ t $ is greater than thecorresponding contribution from density perturbations, whereas for $n &gt; 0.84$the reverse is true. ($ n = 0.84$ corresponds to an expansion index $p = 13.5$in models with power-law inflation $a \propto t^p$. ) our results show that fora scale-invariant harrison-zeldovich spectrum generated by chaotic inflation,gravity waves contribute approximately $24\%$ to the cmbr anisotropy measuredby cobe. applying our results to the cold dark matter scenario for galaxyformation, we find that in general cdm models with tilted power spectra ($n &lt;1$), require the biasing parameter to be greater than unity, on scales of$16h_{50}^{-1} mpc$. we also obtain an expression for the cobe - normalisedamplitude and spectrum of the stochastic gravity wave background and compare itwith the sensitivity of planned laser-interferometer gravity wave detectors.
