0901.3357	a candidate tidal disruption event in the galaxy cluster abell 3571	tidal disruption events are possible sources of temporary nuclear activity ingalactic nuclei and can be considered as good indicators of the existence ofsuper massive black holes in the centers of galaxies. a new x-ray source hasbeen serendipitously detected with rosat in a pspc pointed observation of thegalaxy cluster a3571. given the strong flux decay of the object in subsequentdetections, the tidal disruption scenario is investigated as possibleexplanationof the event. we followed up the evolution of the x-ray transientwith rosat, xmm-newton and chandra for a total period of ~13 years. we alsoobtained 7-band optical/nir photometry with grond at the eso/mpi 2.2mtelescope. we report a very large decay of the x-ray flux of rosat sourceidentified with the galaxy leda 095953 a member of the cluster abell 3571. wemeasured a maximum 0.3-2.4 kev luminosity log(l_x)=42.8 erg s^-1. the highstate of the source lasted at least 150 ks, afterwards l_x declined as ~t^-2.the spectrum of the brightest epoch is consistent with a black body withtemperature kt ~0.12 kev. the total energy released by this event in 10 yr wasestimated to be delta_e&gt;2x10^50 erg. we interpret this event as a tidaldisruption of a solar type star by the central supermassive black hole (i.e.~10^7 m_sun) of the galaxy.

0901.3378	black hole masses of intermediate-redshift quasars: near infrared  spectroscopy	we present near-infrared spectra of ten luminous, intermediate redshiftquasars observed with sofi at the ntt of eso/la silla. with these rest-frameoptical spectra we probe the hb -[oiii] emission line region. using thestandard scaling relation involving the width of the hb line and the continuumluminosity, we measure black hole masses in the range of ~2x10^9 to 10^10 msol.we also used sdss spectra to probe mgii2798 and civ1549 emission lines and usedthese for black hole mass measurements as well. the massive black holes weobserve could not have grown by simple radiatively efficient accretion at theobserved accretion rate starting from seeds of up to thousand solar masses.about 10% of the observed black hole mass must have been accumulated by earliermerger events and radiatively inefficient accretion. radiatively efficientaccretion would further grow these bhs to masses of several 10^9 msol in 2 to 3e-folding times i.e. in several 10^8yrs. the hb-based eddington luminosityratios are in the range of ~0.2 to ~0.7, with an average of (lbol/ledd) =0.39+-0.05. the lbol/ledd ratio distribution follows a log-normal distributionwhich is consistent with prior studies of quasars with comparable luminosity.the lbol/ledd ratio distribution of less luminous quasars tend to be shifted tolower eddington ratios. we also find that the gas metallicity of the broad-lineregion is ~3z/zsol, using niii]/oiii] and nv/civ emission line ratios. we findno correlation of the gas metallicity with the optical feii emission linestrength.

0902.3248	ntt, spitzer and chandra spectroscopy of sdssj095209.56+214313.3: the  most luminous coronal-line supernova ever observed, or a stellar tidal  disruption event ?	the galaxy sdssj0952+2143 showed remarkable emission-line properties firstreported in 2008 (paper i), which are the consequence of a powerful high-energyflare. here we report follow-up observations of sdssj0952+2143, and discussoutburst scenarios in terms of stellar tidal disruption by a smbh, peculiarvariability of an agn, and a supernova explosion. the optical spectrum ofsdssj0952+2143 exhibits several peculiarities: an exceptional ratio of [fevii]transitions over [oiii], a dramatic decrease by a factor of 10 of thehighest-ionization lines, a very unusual and variable balmer line profileincluding a triple-peaked narrow component with two unresolved horns, and alarge balmer decrement. the mir emission measured with the spitzer irs in thenarrow 10-20mu band is extraordinarily luminous (3.5 x 10^{43} erg\s). the irsspectrum shows a bump around ~11mu and an increase towards longer wavelengths,reminiscent of silicate emission. the strong mir excess over the nir impliesthe dominance of relatively cold dust. the x-ray luminosity of 10^{41} erg\smeasured with chandra is below that typically observed in agn. similarities ofsdssj0952+2143 with some extreme supernovae suggest the explosion of asupernova of type iin. however, an extreme accretion event in a low-luminosityagn or inactive galaxy, especially stellar tidal disruption, remainpossibilities, which could potentially produce a very similar emission-lineresponse. if indeed a supernova, sdssj0952+2143 is one of the most distantx-ray and mir detected sne known so far, the most mir luminous, and one of themost x-ray luminous. it is also by far the most luminous (&gt;10^{40} erg\s) inhigh-ionization coronal lines, exceeding previous sne by at least a factor of100 [abridged].

1001.3140	the simultaneous optical-to-x-ray spectral energy distribution of soft  x-ray selected agn observed by swift	we report swift observations of a sample of 92 bright soft x-ray selectedactive galactic nuclei (agn). this sample represents the largest number of agnobserved to study the spectral energy distribution (sed) of agn withsimultaneous optical/uv and x-ray data. the principal motivation of this studyis to understand the seds of agn in the optical/uv to x-ray regime and toprovide bolometric corrections which are important in determining the eddingtonratio l/ledd. in particular, we rigorously explore the dependence of the uv-euvcontribution to the bolometric correction on the assumed euv spectral shape. wefind strong correlations of the spectral slopes alpha-x and alpha-uv withl/ledd. although narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies (nls1s) have steeper alpha-xand higher l/ledd than broad-line seyfert 1 galaxies (bls1s), their optical/uvto x-ray spectral slopes alpha-ox and optical/uv slopes alpha-uv are verysimilar. the mean sed of nls1s shows that in general this type of agn appearsto be fainter in the uv and at hard x-ray energies than bls1s. we find a strongcorrelation between alpha-x and alpha-uv for agn with x-ray spectral slopesalpha-x&lt;1.6. for agn with steeper x-ray spectra, both this relation and therelation between alpha-x and l/ledd break down. at alpha-x$\approx$1.6, l/leddreaches unity. we note an offset in the alpha-uv - l/ledd relation betweennls1s and bls1s. we argue that alpha-uv is a good estimator of l/ledd andsuggest that alpha-uv can be used to estimate l/ledd in high-redshift qsos.although nls1s appear to be highly variable in x-rays they only vary marginallyin the uv.

1002.3152	demystifying the coronal line region of active galactic nuclei:  spatially resolved spectroscopy with hst	we present an analysis of stis/hst optical spectra of a sample of ten seyfertgalaxies aimed at studying the structure and physical properties of thecoronal-line region (clr). the high-spatial resolution provided by stis allowedus to resolve the clr and obtain key information about the kinematics of thecoronal-line gas, measure directly its spatial scale, and study the mechanismsthat drive the high-ionisation lines. we find clrs extending from just a fewparsecs (~10 pc) up to 230 pc in radius, consistent with the bulk of thecoronal lines (cls) originating between the blr and nlr, and extending into thenlr in the case of [fevii] and [nev] lines. the cl profiles strongly vary withthe distance to the nucleus. we observed line splitting in the core of some ofthe galaxies. line peak shifts, both red- and blue-shifts, typically reached500 km/s, and even higher velocities (1000 km/s) in some of the galaxies. ingeneral, cls follow the same pattern of rotation curves as low-ionisation lineslike [oiii]. from a direct comparison between the radio and the cl emission wefind that neither the strength nor the kinematics of the cls scale in anyobvious and strong way with the radio jets. moreover, the similarity of theflux distributions and kinematics of the cls and low-ionisation lines, the lowtemperatures derived for the gas, and the success of photoionisation models toreproduce, within a factor of few, the observed line ratios, point towardsphotoionisation as the main driving mechanism of cls.

1104.5023	the role of secular evolution in the black hole growth of narrow-line  seyfert 1 galaxies	narrow-line seyfert 1 (nls1) galaxies show extreme properties with respect tothe other seyfert galaxies. indeed, they are thought to be accreting ateddington rates and to possess low mass black holes. therefore, they mayrepresent a key class of objects for understanding the co-evolution of blackholes and their host galaxies. we propose that nls1s represent a class of agnin which the black hole growth is, and has always been, dominated by secularevolution. firstly, by looking at the nls1 host galaxy properties in theliterature, we show that the evolution of nls1s is presently driven by secularprocesses, much more so than for broad-line seyfert 1s (bls1s). secondly, westudy the bulges of nls1 and bls1 galaxies. our results demonstrate that nls1host bulges are pseudo-bulges and are statistically different from bls1 bulges.this difference points to the particular importance of secular processes in thepast evolution of their hosts. we build on this result to understand theimplications on their evolution and the duration of their duty cycle. we showthat nls1s are not necessarily in a special phase of black hole growth and thatseveral gyr are required for their black hole masses to become similar tobls1s. finally, in the light of our results, we discuss the location of nls1galaxies on the mbh-\sigma plane and speculate about the connection between thenls1 galaxy properties and their black hole spin.

1202.1064	extreme coronal line emitters: tidal disruption of stars by massive  black holes in galactic nuclei?	tidal disruption of stars by supermassive black holes at the centers ofgalaxies is expected to produce unique emission line signatures, which have notyet been explored adequately. here we report the discovery of extremely strongcoronal lines from [fe x] up to [fe xiv] in a sample of seven galaxies(including two recently reported cases), that we interpret as such signatures.this is the first systematic search for objects of this kind, by making use ofthe immense database of the sloan digital sky survey. the galaxies, which arenon-active as evidenced by the narrow-line ratios, show broad emission lines ofcomplex profiles in more than half of the sample. both the high ionizationcoronal lines and the broad lines turn out to be fading on time scales of yearsin objects observed with spectroscopic follow-ups, suggesting their transientnature. variations of inferred non-stellar continua, which have absolutemagnitudes of at least -16 to -18 mag in the g band, are also detected in morethan half of the sample. these extreme coronal line emitters reside in sub-l_*disk galaxies (-21.3 &lt; m_i &lt; -18.5) with small stellar velocity dispersions.the sample seems to form two distinct types based on the presence or absence ofthe [fe vii] lines, with the latter having relatively low luminosities of [oiii], [fe xi], and the host galaxies. these characteristics can most naturallybe understood in the context of transient accretion onto intermediate massblack holes at galactic centers following tidal disruption of stars in agas-rich environment. we estimate the incidence of such events to be around10^-5 per year for a galaxy with -21.5 &lt; m_i &lt; -18.5.

(2010).two scenarios have been proposed to explain the properties of cid-42: a gwrecoiling smbh and a double type 1/ type 2 agn system, where one of the two isrecoiling because of slingshot effect. in both scenario, one of the opticalnuclei hosts an unobscured agn, while the other one, either an obscured agn ora star forming compact region. the x-ray chandra data allow to unambiguouslyresolve the x-ray emission, and unveil the nature, of the two optical sourcesin cid-42. we find that only one of the optical nuclei is responsible for thewhole x-ray unobscured emission observed and a 3sigma upper limit on the fluxof the second optical nucleus is measured. the upper limit on the x-rayluminosity plus the analysis of the multiwavelength spectral energydistribution indicate the presence of a starforming region in the second sourcerather than an obscured smbh, thus favoring the gw recoil scenario. however thepresence of a very obscured smbh cannot be fully ruled-out. a new x-rayfeature, in a sw direction with respect to the main source, is discovered anddiscussed.

1210.0855	a blurred reflection interpretation for the intermediate flux state in  mrk 335	as part of a long term monitoring campaign of mrk 335, deep xmm-newtonobservations catch the narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy (nls1) in a complex,intermediate flux interval as the active galaxy is transiting from low- tohigh-flux. other works on these same data examined the general behaviour of thenls1 (grupe et al.) and the conditions of its warm absorber (longinotti etal.). the analysis presented here demonstrates the x-ray continuum and timingproperties can be described in a self-consistent manner adopting a blurredreflection model with no need to invoke partial covering. the rapid spectralvariability appears to be driven by changes in the shape of the primary emitterthat is illuminating the inner accretion disc around a rapidly spinning blackhole (a &gt; 0.7). while light bending is certainly prominent, the rather constantemissivity profile and break radius obtained in our spectral fitting suggestthat the blurring parameters are not changing as would be expected if theprimary source is varying its distance from the disc. instead changes could beintrinsic to the power law component. one possibility is that material in anunresolved jet above the disc falls to combine with material at the base of thejet producing the changes in the primary emitter (spectral slope and flux)without changing its distance from the disc.

1212.4842	resolving the coronal line region of ngc1068 with near-infrared integral  field spectroscopy	we present adaptive optics-assisted j- and k-band integral field spectroscopyof the inner 300 x 300 pc of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc1068. the data wereobtained with the gemini nifs integral field unit spectrometer, which providedus with high-spatial and -spectral resolution sampling. the wavelength rangecovered by the observations allowed us to study the [caviii], [sivi], [sivii],[alix] and [six] coronal-line (cl) emission, covering ionization potentials upto 328 ev. the observations reveal very rich and complex structures, both interms of velocity fields and emission-line ratios. the cl emission is elongatedalong the ne-sw direction, with the stronger emission preferentially localizedto the ne of the nucleus. cls are emitted by gas covering a wide range ofvelocities, with maximum blueshifts/redshifts of ~ -1600/1000 km/s. there is atrend for the gas located on the ne side of the nucleus to be blueshifted whilethe gas located towards the sw is redshifted. the morphology and the kinematicsof the near-infrared cls are in very good agreement with the ones displayed bylow-ionization lines and optical cls, suggesting a common origin. the line fluxdistributions, velocity maps, ionization structure (traced by the[sivii]/[sivi] emission-line ratio) and low ionization emission-line ratios(i.e., [feii]/pa\beta\ and [feii]/[pii]) suggest that the radio jet plays animportant role in the structure of the coronal line region of this object, andpossibly in its kinematics.

1301.5463	the rise of an ionized wind in the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy mrk 335  observed by xmm-newton and hst	we present the discovery of an outflowing ionized wind in the seyfert 1galaxy mrk 335. despite having been extensively observed by most of the largestx-ray observatories in the last decade, this bright source was not known tohost warm absorber gas until recent xmm-newton observations in combination witha long-term swift monitoring program have shown extreme flux and spectralvariability. high resolution spectra obtained by the xmm-newton rgs detectorreveal that the wind consists of three distinct ionization components, alloutflowing at a velocity of 5000 km/s. this wind is clearly revealed when thesource is observed at an intermediate flux state (2-5e-12 ergs cm^-2 s^-1). theanalysis of multi-epoch rgs spectra allowed us to compare the absorberproperties at three very different flux states of the source. no correlationbetween the warm absorber variability and the x-ray flux has been determined.the two higher ionization components of the gas may be consistent withphotoionization equilibrium, but we can exclude this for the only ionizationcomponent that is consistently present in all flux states (log(xi)~1.8). wehave included archival, non-simultaneous uv data from hst (fos, stis, cos) withthe aim of searching for any signature of absorption in this source that so farwas known for being absorption-free in the uv band. in the cos spectra obtaineda few months after the x-ray observations we found broad absorption in civlines intrinsic to the agn and blueshifted by a velocity roughly comparable tothe x-ray outflow. the global behavior of the gas in both bands can beexplained by variation of the covering factor and/or column density, possiblydue to transverse motion of absorbing clouds moving out of the line of sight atbroad line region scale.

1305.1509	the radio structure of 3c 316, a galaxy with double-peaked narrow  optical emission lines	the galaxy 3c\,316 is the brightest in the radio band among theoptically-selected candidates exhibiting double-peaked narrow optical emissionlines. observations with the very large array (vla), multi-element remotelylinked interferometer network (e-merlin), and the european vlbi network (evn)at 5\,ghz have been used to study the radio structure of the source in order todetermine the nature of the nuclear components and to determine the presence ofradio cores. the e-merlin image of 3c 316 reveals a collimated coherenteast-west emission structure with a total extent of about 3 kpc. the evn imageshows seven discrete compact knots on an s-shaped line. however, none of theseknots could be unambiguously identified as an agn core. the observationssuggest that the majority of the radio structure belongs to a powerful radioagn, whose physical size and radio spectrum classify it as a compactsteep-spectrum source. given the complex radio structure with radio blobs andknots, the possibility of a kpc-separation dual agn cannot be excluded if thesecondary is either a naked core or radio quiet.

1307.7713	strong uv and x-ray variability of the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy wpvs  007 -- on the nature of the x-ray low state	we report on multi-wavelength observations of the x-ray transient narrow lineseyfert 1 (nls1) galaxy wpvs 007. the galaxy was monitored with swift betweenoctober 2005 and july 2013, after it had undergone a dramatic drop in its x-rayflux earlier. for the first time, we are able to repeatedly detect this nls1 inx-rays again. this increased number of detections in the last couple of yearsmay suggest that the strong absorber that has been found in this agn isstarting to become leaky, and may eventually disappear. the x-ray spectraobtained for wpvs 007 are all consistent with a partial covering absorbermodel. a spectrum based on the data during the extreme low x-ray flux statesshows that the absorption column density is of the order of 4 x 10^23 cm^-2with a covering fraction of 95%. wpvs 007 also displays one of the strongest uvvariabilities seen in narrow line seyfert 1s. the uv continuum variabilityanti-correlates with the optical/uv slope alpha-uv which suggests that thevariability primarily may be due to reddening. the uv variability time scalesare consistent with moving dust `clouds' located beyond the dust sublimationradius of approximately 20 ld. we present for the first time near infrared jhkdata of wpvs 007, which reveal a rich emission-line spectrum. recent opticalspectroscopy does not indicate significant variability in the broad and feiiemission lines, implying that the ionizing continuum seen by those gas cloudshas not significantly changed over the last decades. all x-ray and uvobservations are consistent with a scenario in which an evolving broadabsorption line (bal) flow obscures the continuum emission. as such, wpvs 007is an important target for our understanding of bal flows in low-mass activegalactic nuclei (agn).

1310.1399	the xmm-newton spectrum of a candidate recoiling supermassive black  hole: an elusive inverted p-cygni profile	we present a detailed spectral analysis of new xmm-newton data of the sourcecxoc j100043.1+020637, also known as cid-42, detected in the cosmos survey at z= 0.359. previous works suggested that cid-42 is a candidate recoilingsupermassive black holes showing also an inverted p-cygni profile in the x- rayspectra at ~6 kev (rest) with an iron emission line plus a redshiftedabsorption line (detected at 3sigma in previous xmm-newton and chandraobservations). detailed analysis of the absorption line suggested the presenceof ionized material inflowing into the black hole at high velocity. in the newlong xmm-newton observation, while the overall spectral shape remains constant,the continuum 2-10 kev flux decreased of ~20% with respect to previousobservation and the absorption line is undetected. the upper limit on theintensity of the absorption line is ew&lt;162 kev. extensive monte carlosimulations show that the non detection of the line is solely due to variationin the properties of the inflowing material, in agreement with the transientnature of these features, and that the intensity of the line is lower than thepreviously measured with a probability of 98.8%. in the scenario of cid-42 asrecoiling smbh, the absorption line can be interpreted as due to inflow of gaswith variable density and located in the proximity of the smbh and recoilingwith it. new monitoring observations will be requested to further characterizethis line.

1310.2241	the man behind the curtain: x-rays drive the uv through nir variability  in the 2013 agn outburst in ngc 2617	after the all-sky automated survey for supernovae (asas-sn) discovered asignificant brightening of the inner region of ngc 2617, we began a ~70 dayphotometric and spectroscopic monitoring campaign from the x-ray throughnear-infrared (nir) wavelengths. we report that ngc 2617 went through adramatic outburst, during which its x-ray flux increased by over an order ofmagnitude followed by an increase of its optical/ultraviolet (uv) continuumflux by almost an order of magnitude. ngc 2617, classified as a seyfert 1.8galaxy in 2003, is now a seyfert 1 due to the appearance of broad opticalemission lines and a continuum blue bump. such "changing look active galacticnuclei (agn)" are rare and provide us with important insights about agnphysics. based on the hbeta line width and the radius-luminosity relation, weestimate the mass of central black hole to be (4 +/- 1) x 10^7 m_sun. when wecross-correlate the light curves, we find that the disk emission lags thex-rays, with the lag becoming longer as we move from the uv (2-3 days) to thenir (6-9 days). also, the nir is more heavily temporally smoothed than the uv.this can largely be explained by a simple model of a thermally emitting thindisk around a black hole of the estimated mass that is illuminated by theobserved, variable x-ray fluxes.

1401.3042	a sub-kpc-scale binary agn with double narrow-line regions	we present the kinematic properties of a type-2 qso, sdss j132323.33-015941.9at z~0.35, based on the analysis of very large telescope integral fieldspectroscopy and hubble space telescope (hst) imaging, which suggest that thetarget is a binary active galactic nucleus (agn) with double narrow-lineregions. the qso features double-peaked emission lines ([oiii] and hb) whichcan be decomposed into two kinematic components. the flux-weighted centroids ofthe blue and red components are separated by ~0.2" (0.8 kpc in projection) andcoincide with the location of the two stellar cores detected in the hstbroad-band images, implying that both stellar cores host an active black hole.the line-of-sight velocity of the blue component is comparable to theluminosity-weighted velocity of stars in the host galaxy while the redcomponent is redshifted by ~240 km/s, consistent with typical velocity offsetsof two cores in a late stage of a galaxy merger. if confirmed, the target isone of the rare cases of sub-kpc scale binary agns, providing a test-bed forunderstanding the binary agn population.

1404.4933	a milliparsec supermassive black hole binary candidate in the galaxy  sdss j120136.02+300305.5	galaxy mergers play a key role in the evolution of galaxies and the growth oftheir central supermassive black holes (smbhs). a search for (active) smbhbinaries (smbhbs) at the centers of the merger remnants is currently ongoing.perhaps the greatest challenge is to identify the inactive smbhbs, which mightbe the most abundant, but are also the most difficult to identify. liu et al.predicted characteristic drops in the light curves of tidal disruption events(tdes), caused by the presence of a secondary smbh. here, we apply that modelto the light curve of the optically inactive galaxy sdss j120136.02+300305.5,which was identified as a candidate tde with xmm-newton. we show that the deepdips in its evolving x-ray light curve can be well explained by the presence ofa smbhb at its core. a smbhb model with a mass of the primary of m_bh = 10^7m_sun, a mass ratio q=0.08, and a semimajor axis a_b = 0.6 mpc is in goodagreement with the observations. given that primary mass, introducing anorbital eccentricity is needed, with e_b = 0.3. alternatively, a lower massprimary of m_bh = 10^6 m_sun in a circular orbit fits the light curve well.tight binaries like this one, which have already overcome the "final parsecproblem," are prime sources of gravitational wave radiation once the two smbhscoalesce. future transient surveys, which will detect tdes in large numbers,will place tight constraints on the smbhb fraction in otherwise non-activegalaxies.

0803.0240	on the nature of seyfert galaxies with high [oiii]5007 blueshifts	we have studied the properties of seyfert galaxies with high [oiii]5007blueshifts (`blue outliers'), originally identified because of their strongdeviation from the m_bh - sigma relation of normal, narrow-line seyfert 1(nls1) and broad-line seyfert 1 (bls1) galaxies. these blue outliers turn outto be important test-beds for models of the narrow-line region (nlr), formechanisms of driving large-scale outflows, for links between nls1 galaxies andradio galaxies, and for orientation-dependent nls1 models. we report thedetection of a strong correlation of line blueshift with ionization potentialin each galaxy, including the measurement of coronal lines with radialvelocities up to 500--1000 km/s. all [oiii] blue outliers have narrow widths oftheir broad balmer lines and high eddington ratios. while the presence ofnon-shifted low-ionization lines signifies the presence of a classical outerquiescent nlr in blue outliers, we also report the absence of any second,non-blueshifted [oiii] component from a classical inner nlr. these resultsplace tight constraints on nlr models. we favor a scenario in which the nlrclouds are entrained in a decelerating wind which explains the strongstratification and the absence of a zero-blueshift inner nlr of blue outliers.the origin of the wind remains speculative at this time (collimated radioplasma, thermal winds, radiatively accelerated clouds). it is perhaps linked tothe high eddington ratios of blue outliers. similar, less powerful winds couldbe present in all seyfert galaxies, but would generally only affect the coronalline region (clr), or level off even before reaching the clr. similaritiesbetween blue outliers in nls1 galaxies and (compact) radio sources are brieflydiscussed.

1407.8223	the nustar spectrum of mrk 335: extreme relativistic effects within 2  gravitational radii of the event horizon?	we present 3-50 kev nustar observations of the agn mrk 335 in a very low fluxstate. the spectrum is dominated by very strong features at the energies of theiron line at 5-7 kev and compton hump from 10-30 kev. the source is variableduring the observation, with the variability concentrated at low energies,which suggesting either a relativistic reflection or a variable absorptionscenario. in this work we focus on the reflection interpretation, making use ofnew relativistic reflection models that self consistently calculate thereflection fraction, relativistic blurring and angle-dependent reflectionspectrum for different coronal heights to model the spectra. we find that thespectra can be well fit with relativistic reflection, and that the lowest fluxstate spectrum is described by reflection alone, suggesting the effects ofextreme light-bending occurring within ~2 gravitational radii of the eventhorizon. the reflection fraction decreases sharply with increasing flux,consistent with a point source moving up to above 10 rg as the sourcebrightens. we constrain the spin parameter to greater than 0.9 at the 3 sigmaconfidence level. by adding a spin-dependent upper limit on the reflectionfraction to our models, we demonstrate that this can be a powerful way ofconstraining the spin parameter, particularly in reflection dominated states.we also calculate a detailed emissivity profile for the iron line, and findthat it closely matches theoretical predictions for a compact source within afew rg of the black hole.

1409.1244	a partial eclipse of the heart: the absorbed x-ray low state in mrk 1048	we present two new xmm-newton observations of an unprecedented low flux statein the seyfert 1 mrk 1048 (ngc 985), taken in 2013. the x-ray flux below 1 kevdrops by a factor of 4-5, whereas the spectrum above 5 kev is essentiallyunchanged. this points towards an absorption origin for the low state, and weconfirm this with spectral fitting, finding that the spectral differences canbe well modelled by the addition of a partial covering neutral absorber, with acolumn density of $\sim3\times 10^{22}$~cm$^{-2}$ and a covering fraction of$\sim0.6$. the optical and uv fluxes are not affected, and indeed aremarginally brighter in the more recent observations, suggesting that only theinner regions of the disk are affected by the absorption event. this indicateseither that the absorption is due to a cloud passing over the inner disk,obscuring the x-ray source but leaving the outer disk untouched, or that theabsorber is dust-free so the uv continuum is unaffected. we use arguments basedon the duration of the event and the physical properties of the absorber toconstrain its size and location, and conclude that it is most likely a smallcloud at $\sim10^{18}$cm from the source.

1409.3716	properties of flat-spectrum radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies	we have conducted a multiwavelength survey of 42 radio loud narrow-1ineseyfert 1 galaxies (rlnls1s), selected by searching among all the known sourcesof this type and omitting those with steep radio spectra. we analyse data fromradio frequencies to x-rays, and supplement these with information availablefrom online catalogs and the literature in order to cover the fullelectromagnetic spectrum. this is the largest known multiwavelength survey forthis type of source. we detected 90% of the sources in x-rays and found 17% atgamma rays. extreme variability at high energies was also found, down totimescales as short as hours. in some sources, dramatic spectral and fluxchanges suggest interplay between a relativistic jet and the accretion disk.the estimated masses of the central black holes are in the range $\sim10^{6-8}m_{\odot}$, smaller than those of blazars, while the accretionluminosities span a range from $\sim 0.01$ to $\sim 0.49$ times the eddingtonlimit, with an outlier at $0.003$. the distribution of the calculated jet powerspans a range from $\sim 10^{42.6}$ to $\sim 10^{45.6}$ erg s$^{-1}$, generallylower than quasars and bl lac objects, but partially overlapping with thelatter. once normalised by the mass of the central black holes, the jet powerof the three types of active galactic nuclei are consistent with each other,indicating the scalability of the jet. despite the observational differences,the central engine of rlnls1s is apparently quite similar to that of blazars.the historical difficulties in finding radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1galaxies might be due to their low power and to intermittent jet activity.

1410.2330	suzaku observations of mrk 335: confronting partial covering and  relativistic reflection	we report on the deepest x-ray observation of the narrow-line seyfert 1galaxy mrk 335 in the low-flux state obtained with suzaku. the data arecompared to a 2006 high-flux suzaku observation when the source was ~10-timesbrighter. describing the two flux levels self-consistently with partialcovering models would require extreme circumstances, as the source would besubject to negligible absorption during the bright state and ninety-five percent covering with near compton-thick material when dim. blurred reflectionfrom an accretion disc around a nearly maximum spinning black hole (a&gt;0.91,with preference for a spin parameter as high as ~ 0.995) appears more likelyand is consistent with the long-term and rapid variability. measurements of theemissivity profile and spectral modelling indicate the high-flux suzakuobservation of mrk 335 is consistent with continuum-dominated, jet-likeemission (i.e. beamed away from the disc). it can be argued that the ejectamust be confined to within ~25 rg if it does not escape the system. during thelow-flux state the corona becomes compact and only extends to about 5 rg fromthe black hole, and the spectrum becomes reflection-dominated. thelow-frequency lags measured at both epochs are comparable indicating that theaccretion mechanism is not changing between the two flux levels. varioustechniques to study the spectral variability (e.g. principal componentanalysis, fractional variability, difference spectra, and hardness ratioanalysis) indicate that the low-state variability is dominated by changes inthe power law flux and photon index, but that changes in the ionisation stateof the reflector are also required. most notably, the ionisation parameterbecomes inversely correlated with the reflected flux after a long-durationflare-like event during the observation.

1501.02158	radio jet emission from gev-emitting narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies	we studied the radio emission from four radio-loud and gamma-ray-loudnarrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies. the goal was to investigate whether arelativistic jet is operating at the source, and quantify its characteristics.we relied on the most systematic monitoring of such system in the cm and mmradio bands which is conducted with the effelsberg 100 m and iram 30 mtelescopes and covers the longest time-baselines and the most radio frequenciesto date. we extract variability parameters and compute variability brightnesstemperatures and doppler factors. the jet powers were computed from the lightcurves to estimate the energy output. the dynamics of radio spectral energydistributions were examined to understand the mechanism causing thevariability. all the sources display intensive variability that occurs at apace faster than what is commonly seen in blazars. the flaring events showintensive spectral evolution indicative of shock evolution. the brightnesstemperatures and doppler factors are moderate, implying a mildly relativisticjet. the computed jet powers show very energetic flows. the radio polarisationin one case clearly implies a quiescent jet underlying the recursive flaringactivity. despite the generally lower flux densities, the sources appear toshow all typical characteristics seen in blazars that are powered byrelativistic jets.

1501.04640	ska as a powerful hunter of jetted tidal disruption events	observational consequences of the tidal disruption of stars by supermassiveblack holes (smbhs) can enable us to discover quiescent smbhs and constraintheir mass function. moreover, observing jetted tdes (from previouslynon-active galaxies) provides us with a new means of studying the early phasesof jet formation and evolution in an otherwise "pristine" environment. althoughseveral (tens) tdes have been discovered since 1999, only two jetted tdes havebeen recently discovered in hard x-rays, and only one, swift j1644+57, has aprecise localization which further supports the tde interpretation. theseevents alone are not sufficient to address those science issues, which requirea substantial increase of the current sample. despite the way they werediscovered, the highest discovery potential for {\em jetted} tdes is not heldby current and up-coming x-ray instruments, which will yield only a few to afew tens events per year. in fact, the best strategy is to use the squarekilometer array to detect tdes and trigger multi-wavelength follow-ups,yielding hundreds candidates per year, up to $z \sim 2$. radio and x-raysynergy, however, can in principle constrain important quantities such as theabsolute rate of jetted tdes, their jet power, bulk lorentz factor, the blackhole mass function, and perhaps discover massive black holes (mbh) with$&lt;10^{5} m_{\odot}$. finally, when comparing ska results with information fromoptical surveys like lsst, one can more directly constrain the efficiency ofjet production.

1502.05720	compact object mergers: observations of supermassive binary black holes  and stellar tidal disruption events	the capture and disruption of stars by supermassive black holes (smbhs), andthe formation and coalescence of binaries, are inevitable consequences of thepresence of smbhs at the cores of galaxies. pairs of active galactic nuclei(agn) and binary smbhs are important stages in the evolution of galaxy mergers,and an intense search for these systems is currently ongoing. in the early andadvanced stages of galaxy merging, observations of the triggering of accretiononto one or both bhs inform us about feedback processes and bh growth.identification of the compact binary smbhs at parsec and sub-parsec scalesprovides us with important constraints on the interaction processes that governthe shrinkage of the binary beyond the "final parsec". coalescing binary smbhsare among the most powerful sources of gravitational waves (gws) in theuniverse. stellar tidal disruption events (tdes) appear as luminous, transient,accretion flares when part of the stellar material is accreted by the smbh.about 30 events have been identified by multi-wavelength observations by now,and they will be detected in the thousands in future ground-based orspace-based transient surveys. the study of tdes provides us with a variety ofnew astrophysical tools and applications, related to fundamental physics orastrophysics. here, we provide a review of the current status of observationsof smbh pairs and binaries, and tdes, and discuss astrophysical implications.

1508.01257	variable reddening and broad absorption lines in the narrow-line seyfert  1 galaxy wpvs 007: an origin in the torus	we report the discovery of an occultation event in the low-luminositynarrow-line seyfert 1 galaxy wpvs 007 in 2015 february and march. in concertwith longer timescale variability, these observations place strong constraintson the nature and location of the absorbing material. swift monitoring hasrevealed a secular decrease since ~2010 accompanied by flattening of theoptical and uv photometry that suggests variable reddening. analysis of fourhubble space telescope cos observations since 2010, including a director'sdiscretionary time observation during the occultation, shows that thebroad-absorption-line velocity offset and the civ emission-line width bothdecrease as the reddening increases. the occultation dynamical timescale, thebal variability dynamical timescale, and the density of the bal gas show thatboth the reddening material and the broad-absorption-line gas are consistentwith an origin in the torus. these observations can be explained by a scenarioin which the torus is clumpy with variable scale height, and the bal gas isblown from the torus material like spray from the crest of a wave. as theobscuring material passes into our line of sight, we alternately seehigh-velocity broad absorption lines and a clear view to the central engine, orlow-velocity broad absorption lines and strong reddening. wpvs 007 has a smallblack hole mass, and correspondingly short timescales, and so we may beobserving behavior that is common in balqsos, but is not typically observable.

1509.00840	an ultrasoft x-ray flare from 3xmm j152130.7+074916: a tidal disruption  event candidate	we report on the discovery of an ultrasoft x-ray transient source, 3xmmj152130.7+074916. it was serendipitously detected in an xmm-newton observationon 2000 august 23, and its location is consistent with the center of the galaxysdss j152130.72+074916.5 (z=0.17901 and d_l=866 mpc). the high-quality x-rayspectrum can be fitted with a thermal disk with an apparent inner disktemperature of 0.17 kev and a rest-frame 0.24-11.8 kev unabsorbed luminosity of~5e43 erg/s, subject to a fast-moving warm absorber. short-term variability wasalso clearly observed, with the spectrum being softer at lower flux. the sourcewas covered but not detected in a chandra observation on 2000 april 3, a swiftobservation on 2005 september 10, and a second xmm-newton observation on 2014january 19, implying a large variability (&gt;260) of the x-ray flux. the opticalspectrum of the candidate host galaxy, taken ~11 yrs after the xmm-newtondetection, shows no sign of nuclear activity. this, combined with its transientand ultrasoft properties, leads us to explain the source as tidal disruption ofa star by the supermassive black hole in the galactic center. we attribute thefast-moving warm absorber detected in the first xmm-newton observation to thesuper-eddington outflow associated with the event and the short-termvariability to a disk instability that caused fast change of the inner diskradius at a constant mass accretion rate.

1509.01889	the radio properties of radio-loud narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies on  parsec scales	we present the detection of compact radio structures of fourteen radio-loudnarrow line seyfert 1 (nls1) galaxies from very long baseline arrayobservations at 5 ghz, which were performed in 2013. while 50\% of the sourcesof our sample show a compact core only, the remaining 50\% exhibit a core-jetstructure. the measured brightness temperatures of the cores range from$10^{8.4}$ to $10^{11.4}$ k with a median value of $10^{10.1}$ k, indicatingthat the radio emission is from non-thermal jets, and that, likely, mostsources are not strongly beamed, then implying a lower jet speed in theseradio-loud nls1 galaxies. in combination with archival data taken at multiplefrequencies, we find that seven sources show flat or even inverted radiospectra, while steep spectra are revealed in the remaining seven objects.although all these sources are very radio-loud with $r &gt; 100$, their jetproperties are diverse, in terms of their milli-arcsecond (mas) scale (pcscale) morphology and their overall radio spectral shape. the evidence for slowjet speeds (i.e., less relativistic jets), in combination with the lowkinetic/radio power, may offer an explanation for the compact vlba radiostructure in most sources. the mildly relativistic jets in these high accretionrate systems are consistent with a scenario, where jets are accelerated fromthe hot corona above the disk by the magnetic field and the radiation force ofthe accretion disk. alternatively, a low jet bulk velocity can be explained bylow spin in the blandford-znajek mechanism.

1510.07656	flaring from the supermassive black hole in mrk 335 studied with swift  and nustar	monitoring of the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy markarian 335 (mrk 335) withthe swift satellite discovered an x-ray flare beginning 2014 august 29. at thepeak, the 0.5-5kev count rate had increased from that in the low flux state bya factor of 10. a target of opportunity observation was triggered with nustar,catching the decline of the flare on 2014 september 20. we present a jointanalysis of swift and nustar observations to understand the cause of thisflare. the x-ray spectrum shows an increase in directly observed continuum fluxand the softening of the continuum spectrum to a photon index of 2.49(-0.07,+0.08) compared to the previous low flux observations. the x-rayspectrum remains well-described by the relativistically blurred reflection ofthe continuum from the accretion disc whose emissivity profile suggests that itis illuminated by a compact x-ray source, extending at most 5.2rg over thedisc. a very low reflection fraction of 0.41 (-0.15,+0.15) is measured,unexpected for such a compact corona. the x-ray flare is, hence, interpreted asarising from the vertical collimation and ejection of the x-ray emitting coronaat a mildly relativistic velocity, causing the continuum emission to be beamedaway from the disc. as the flare subsides, the base of this jet-like structurecollapses into a compact x-ray source that provides the majority of theradiation that illuminates the disc while continuum emission is still detectedfrom energetic particles further out, maintaining the low reflection fraction.

0807.4452	evolution of tidal disruption candidates discovered by xmm-newton	it has been demonstrated that active galactic nuclei are powered by gasaccretion onto supermassive black holes located at their centres. the paradigmthat the nuclei of inactive galaxies are also occupied by black holes waspredicted long ago by theory. in the last decade, this conjecture was confirmedby the discovery of giant-amplitude, non-recurrent x-ray flares from suchinactive galaxies and explained in terms of outburst radiation from starstidally disrupted by a dormant supermassive black hole at the nuclei of thosegalaxies. due to the scarcity of detected tidal disruption events, theconfirmation and follow-up of each new candidate is needed to strengthen thetheory through observational data, as well as to shed new light on thecharacteristics of this type of events. two tidal disruption candidates havebeen detected with xmm-newton during slew observations. optical and x-rayfollow-up, post-outburst observations were performed on these highly variableobjects in order to further study their classification and temporal evolution.we show that the detected low-state x-ray emission for these two candidates hasproperties such that it must still be related to the flare. the x-rayluminosity of the objects decreases according to theoretical predictions fortidal disruption events. at present, optical spectra of the sources do notpresent any evident signature of the disruption event. in addition, the tidaldisruption rate as derived from the xmm-newton slew survey has been computedand agrees with previous studies.

astro-ph;0304063	follow-up hst/stis spectroscopy of three candidate tidal disruption  events	large amplitude, high luminosity soft x-ray flares were detected by the rosatall-sky survey in several galaxies with no evidence for seyfert activity intheir ground-based optical spectra. these flares had the properties predictedfor a tidal disruption event by a central supermassive black hole: soft x-rayspectrum, time-scale of months, and large x-ray luminosity (10^42 - 10^44 ergss^-1). in order to evaluate the alternative hypothesis that these flares couldhave been some form of extreme agn variability, we obtained follow-up opticalspectroscopy of three of the flaring galaxies a decade later with the spacetelescope imaging spectrograph (stis) and a narrow slit to search for or placestringent limits on the presence of any persistent seyfert-like emission intheir nuclei. two of the galaxies, rx j1624.9+7554 and rx j1242.6-1119, show noevidence for emission lines or a non-stellar continuum in their hubble spacetelescope (hst) nuclear spectra, consistent with their ground-basedclassification as inactive galaxies. they remain the most convincing as hostsof tidal disruption events. ngc 5905, previously known as a starburst h iigalaxy due to its strong emission lines, has in its inner 0."1 a nucleus withnarrow emission-line ratios requiring a seyfert 2 classification. this weakseyfert 2 nucleus in ngc 5905, which was masked by the many surrounding h iiregions in ground-based spectra, requires a low level of prior non-stellarphotoionization, thus raising some uncertainty about the nature of its x-rayflare, which may or may not have been a tidal disruption event. the absence ofboth broad emission lines and nuclear x-ray absorption in ngc 5905 alsocharacterizes it as a ``true'' seyfert 2 galaxy, yet one that has varied bymore than a factor of 100 in x-rays.

astro-ph;0402497	follow-up chandra observations of three candidate tidal disruption  events	large-amplitude, high-luminosity soft x-ray flares were detected by the rosatall-sky survey in several galaxies with no evidence of seyfert activity intheir ground-based optical spectra. these flares had the properties predictedfor a tidal disruption of a star by a central supermassive black hole. wereport chandra observations of three of these galaxies taken a decade aftertheir flares that reveal weak nuclear x-ray sources that are from 240 to 6000times fainter than their luminosities at peak, supporting the theory that thesewere special events and not ongoing active galactic nucleus (agn) variability.the decline of rx j1624.9+7554 by a factor of 6000 is consistent with the(t-t_d)^(-5/3) decay predicted for the fall-back phase of a tidal disruptionevent, but only if rosat was lucky enough to catch the event exactly at itspeak in 1990 october. rx j1242.6-1119a has declined by a factor of 240, alsoconsistent with (t-t_d)^(-5/3). in the h ii galaxy ngc 5905 we find onlyresolved, soft x-ray emission that is undoubtedly associated with starburstactivity. when accounting for the starburst component, the rosat observationsof ngc 5905, as well as the chandra upper limit on its nuclear flux, areconsistent with a (t-t_d)^(-5/3) decay by at least a factor of 1000. althoughwe found weak seyfert~2 emission lines in hubble space telescope spectra of ngc5905, indicating that a low-luminosity agn was present prior to the x-rayflare, we favor a tidal disruption explanation for the flare itself.

astro-ph;0511496	the radio loud narrow-line quasar sdssj172206.03+565451.6	we report identification of the radio loud narrow-line quasar sdssj172206.03+565451.6 which we found in the course of a search for radio loudnarrow-line active galactic nuclei (agn). sdssj172206.03+565451.6 is only the~4th securely identified radio loud narrow-line quasar and the second-mostradio loudest with a radio index r_1.4 ~ 100-700. its black hole mass, m_bh =(2-3) 10^7 m_sun, is unusually small given its radio loudness, and thecombination of mass and radio index puts sdssj172206.03+565451.6 in a scarcelypopulated region of m_bh-r diagrams. sdssj172206.03+565451.6 is a classicalnarrow-line seyfert1-type object with fwhm_hbeta = 1490 km/s, an intensityratio of [oiii]/hbeta = 0.7 and feii emission complexes with feii4570/hbeta =0.7. the ionization parameter of its narrow-line region, estimated from theline ratio [oii]/[oiii], is similar to seyferts and its high ratio of[nev]/[neiii] indicates a strong euv to soft-x-ray excess. we advertise thecombined usage of [oii]/[oiii] and [nev]/[neiii] diagrams as a usefuldiagnostic tool to estimate ionization parameters and to constrain the euvcontinuum shape relatively independent from other parameters.

astro-ph;0603680	radio-loud narrow-line type 1 quasars	we present the first systematic study of (non-radio-selected) radio-loudnarrow-line seyfert 1 (nls1) galaxies. cross-correlation of the `catalogue ofquasars and active nuclei' with several radio and optical catalogues led to theidentification of 11 radio-loud nls1 candidates including 4 previously knownones. most of the radio-loud nls1s are compact, steep spectrum sourcesaccreting close to, or above, the eddington limit. the radio-loud nls1s of oursample are remarkable in that they occupy a previously rarely populated regimein nls1 multi-wavelength parameter space. while their [oiii]/h_beta andfeii/h_beta intensity ratios almost cover the whole range observed in nls1galaxies, their radio properties extend the range of radio-loud objects tothose with small widths of the broad balmer lines. among the radio-detectednls1 galaxies, the radio index r distributes quite smoothly up to the criticalvalue of r ~ 10 and covers about 4 orders of magnitude in total. statisticsshow that ~7% of the nls1 galaxies are formally radio-loud while only 2.5%exceed a radio index r &gt; 100. several mechanisms are considered as explanationsfor the radio loudness of the nls1 galaxies and for the lower frequency ofradio-louds among nls1s than quasars. while properties of most sources (with2-3 exceptions) generally do not favor relativistic beaming, the combination ofaccretion mode and spin may explain the observations.

astro-ph;9512010	four new active galaxies with steep soft x-ray spectra	we have discovered four agn in the rosat all-sky-survey data with very steepx-ray spectra. we apply several models to these x-ray spectra with emphasis onwarm absorber models which give an adequate description of the data. we reporton the follow-up optical and radio observations which allow the identificationof three of these objects as narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies, and the fourth asbl lac object. we have measured small-fwhm hbeta lines, strong feii emissionand weak [oiii] emission in the three narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies, in linewith known correlations with respect to the steepness of the x-ray spectra. wehave discovered strong optical variability in the bl lac object and two of theseyfert galaxies using photographic plates of the sonneberg observatory fieldpatrol. we finally discuss the statistical implications of our search algorithmon the expected number density of soft x-ray selected agn and conclude that upto 30% of x-ray selected agn might have supersoft x-ray spectra.
