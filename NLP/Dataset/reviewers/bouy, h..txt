0902.0305	the triple system hip96515: a low-mass eclipsing binary with a db white  dwarf companion	hip96515a is a double-lined spectroscopic binary with a visual companion(hip96515b) at 8.6 arcsec. it is included in the sacy catalog as a potentialyoung star and classified as an eclipsing binary in the asas catalog. we haveanalyzed spectroscopic and photometric observations of the triple system. thehigh-resolution optical spectrum of hip96515a has been used to derive a massratio, m_2/m_1, close to 0.9, with the sb2 components showing spectral types ofm1 and m2. the asas and hipparcos light-curves of hip96515a show periodicvariations with p=2.3456 days, confirming that hip96515a is an eclipsing binarywith preliminary parameters of i=89, m_aa=0.59+-0.03 msun and m_ab=0.54+-0.03msun, for the primary and secondary, respectively, at an estimated distance of42+-3 pc. this is a new eclipsing binary with component masses below 0.6 msun.multi-epoch observations of hip 96515 a&amp;b show that the system is a commonproper motion pair. the optical spectrum of hip 96515b is consistent with apure helium atmosphere (db) white dwarf. we estimate a total age (main-sequencelifetime plus cooling age) of 400 myr for the white dwarf. if hip 96515 a&amp;b arecoeval, and assuming a common age of 400 myr, the comparison of the masses ofthe eclipsing binary members with evolutionary tracks shows that they areunderestimated by ~15% and ~10%, for the primary and secondary, respectively.

physics;0605042	resolved hubble space spectroscopy of ultracool binary systems	using the low-resolution mode of the space telescope imaging spectrograph(stis) aboard the \emph{hubble space telescope} (hst), we have obtainedspatially resolved spectra of 20 ultracool dwarfs. 18 of them belong to 9 knownvery low-mass binary systems with angular separations in the range 0.37-0.098arcseconds. we have derived spectral types in the range dm7.5 to dl6 from thepc3 index, and by comparing our stis spectra with ground-based spectra ofsimilar spectral resolution from mart{\'\i}n et al. (1999). we have searchedfor h$_\alpha$ emission in each object but it was clearly detected in only 2 ofthem. we find that the distribution of h$_\alpha$ emission in our sample isstatistically different from that of single field dwarfs, suggesting anintriguing anticorrelation between chromospheric activity and binarity form7--m9.5 dwarfs. we provide measuments of the strength of the main photosphericfeatures and the pc3 index, and we derive calibrations of spectral subclassesversus f814w and k-band absolute magnitudes for a subset of 10 dwarfs in 5binaries that have known trigonometric parallaxes.

0907.0322	a deep look into the core of young clusters. ii. lambda-orionis	over the past years, the lambda-orionis cluster has been a prime location forthe study of young very low mass stars, substellar and isolated planetary massobjects and the determination of the initial mass function and other propertiesof low mass cluster members. in the continuity of our previous studies of youngassociations cores, we search for ultracool members and new multiple systemswithin the central 5.3' (~0.6pc) of the cluster. we obtained deep seeinglimited j, ks-band images of the 5.3' central part of the cluster with ntt/sofiand h-band images with caha/omega2000. these images were complemented bymulti-conjugate adaptive optics (mcao) h and ks images of the 1.5' centralregion of the lambda-orionis cluster obtained with the prototype mcao facilitymad at the vlt. the direct vicinity of the massive lambda-ori o8iii-star wasprobed using naco/sdi at the vlt. finally, we also retrieved spitzer iracimages of the same area and used archival subaru suprime-cam and cfht cfht12ki-band images. we report the detection of 9 new member candidates selected fromoptical and near-ir color-color and color-magnitude diagrams and 7 previouslyknown members. the high spatial resolution images resolve 3 new visual multiplesystems. two of them are most likely not members of the association. the thirdone is made of a brown dwarf candidate companion to the f8v star hd36861c. thesimultaneous differential images allow us to rule out the presence of visualcompanions more massive than m&gt;0.07msun in the range 1-2.5", and m&gt;0.25msun inthe range 0.5-2.5"

1003.2205	the low-mass population of the rho ophiuchi molecular cloud	star formation theories are currently divergent regarding the fundamentalphysical processes that dominate the substellar regime. observations of nearbyyoung open clusters allow the brown dwarf (bd) population to be characteriseddown to the planetary mass regime, which ultimately must be accommodated by asuccessful theory. we hope to uncover the low-mass population of the rhoophiuchi molecular cloud and investigate the properties of the newly foundbrown dwarfs. we use near-ir deep images (reaching completeness limits ofapproximately 20.5 mag in j, and 18.9 mag in h and ks) taken with the widefield ir camera (wircam) at the canada france hawaii telescope (cfht) toidentify candidate members of rho oph in the substellar regime. a spectroscopicfollow-up of a small sample of the candidates allows us to assess theirspectral type, and subsequently their temperature and membership. we select 110candidate members of the rho ophiuchi molecular cloud, from which 80 have notpreviously been associated with the cloud. we observed a small sample of theseand spectroscopically confirm six new brown dwarfs with spectral types rangingfrom m6.5 to m8.25.

1008.5065	multi-wavelength study of the disk around the very low-mass star  par-lup3-4	par-lup3-4 is a very low-mass star (spectral type m5) in the lupus iiistar-forming region. the object is underluminous by ~4 mag when compared toobjects of similar mass in the same association. to better understand theorigin of its underluminosity, we have analyzed high angular resolution near-irimaging data and mid-ir spectroscopy. we have also compared the sed of thetarget (from the optical to the sub-millimeter regime) to a grid of radiativetransfer models of circumstellar disks. the diffraction-limited infraredobservations do not show obvious extended emission, allowing us to put an upperlimit to the disk outer radius of ~20au. the lack of extended emission,together with the non detection of a strong 9.8 microns silicate in absorptionindicates that par-lup3-4 is probably in a class ii (rather than class i)evolutionary stage. the sed of par-lup3-4 resembles that of objects withedge-on disks seen in scattered light, that is, a double peaked-sed and a dipat ~10 microns. we can fit the whole sed with a single disk model with aninclination of 81+/-6 degrees which provides a natural explanation for theunder-luminosity of the target. our analysis allows to put constraints on thedisk inner radius, rin &lt; 0.05 au, which is very close to the dust sublimationradius, and the maximum size of the dust grains, a_max &gt; 10 microns, whichindicates that dust processing has already taken place in par-lup3-4.

1211.4029	spectroscopy of brown dwarf candidates in ic 348 and the determination  of its substellar imf down to planetary masses	context. brown dwarfs represent a sizable fraction of the stellar content ofour galaxy and populate the transition between the stellar and planetary massregime. there is however no agreement on the processes responsible for theirformation. aims. we have conducted a large survey of the young, nearby clusteric 348, to uncover its low-mass brown dwarf population and study the clusterproperties in the substellar regime. methods. deep optical and near-ir imagestaken with megacam and wircam at the canada-france-hawaii telescope (cfht) wereused to select photometric candidate members. a spectroscopic follow-up of alarge fraction of the candidates was conducted to assess their youth andmembership. results. we confirmed spectroscopically 16 new members of the ic348 cluster, including 13 brown dwarfs, contributing significantly to thesubstellar census of the cluster, where only 30 brown dwarfs were previouslyknown. five of the new members have a l0 spectral type, the latest-type objectsfound to date in this cluster. at 3 myr, evolutionary models estimate thesebrown dwarfs to have a mass of ~13 jupiter masses. combining the new memberswith previous census of the cluster, we constructed the imf complete down to 13jupiter masses. conclusions. the imf of ic 348 is well fitted by a log-normalfunction, and we do not see evidence for variations of the mass function downto planetary masses when compared to other young clusters.

1303.4738	identification of transitional disks in chamaeleon with herschel	transitional disks are circumstellar disks with inner holes that in somecases are produced by planets and/or substellar companions in these systems.for this reason, these disks are extremely important for the study of planetarysystem formation. the herschel space observatory provides an unique opportunityfor studying the outer regions of protoplanetary disks. in this work we updateprevious knowledge on the transitional disks in the chamaeleon i and ii regionswith data from the herschel gould belt survey. we propose a new method fortransitional disk classification based on the wise 12 micron-pacs 70 microncolor, together with inspection of the herschel images. we applied this methodto the population of class ii sources in the chamaeleon region and studied thespectral energy distributions of the transitional disks in the sample. we alsobuilt the median spectral energy distribution of class ii objects in theseregions for comparison with transitional disks. the proposed method allows aclear separation of the known transitional disks from the class ii sources. wefind 6 transitional disks, all previously known, and identify 5 objectspreviously thought to be transitional as possibly non-transitional. we findhigher fluxes at the pacs wavelengths in the sample of transitional disks thanthose of class ii objects. we show the herschel 70 micron band to be anefficient tool for transitional disk identification. the sensitivity andspatial resolution of herschel reveals a significant contamination level amongthe previously identified transitional disk candidates for the two regions,which calls for a revision of previous samples of transitional disks in otherregions. the systematic excess found at the pacs bands could be a result of themechanism that produces the transitional phase, or an indication of differentevolutionary paths for transitional disks and class ii sources.

1306.4122	substellar multiplicity in the hyades cluster	we present the first high-angular resolution survey for multiple systemsamong very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the hyades open cluster. usingthe keck\,ii adaptive optics system, we observed a complete sample of 16objects with estimated masses $\lesssim$0.1 msun. we have identified threeclose binaries with projected separation $\lesssim$0.11", or $\lesssim$5 au. anumber of wide, mostly faint candidate companions are also detected in ourimages, most of which are revealed as unrelated background sources based onastrometric and/or photometric considerations. the derived multiplicityfrequency, 19+13/-6 % over the 2-350 au range, and the rarity of systems widerthan 10 au are both consistent with observations of field very low-massobjects. in the limited 3-50 au separation range, the companion frequency isessentially constant from brown dwarfs to solar-type stars in the hyadescluster, which is also in line with our current knowledge for field stars.combining the binaries discovered in this surveys with those already known inthe pleiades cluster reveals that very low-mass binaries in open clusters, aswell as in star-forming regions, are skewed toward lower mass ratios ($0.6\lesssim q \lesssim 0.8$) than are their field counterparts, a result thatcannot be accounted for by selection effects. although the possibility ofsevere systematic errors in model-based mass estimates for very low-mass starscannot be completely excluded, it is unlikely to explain this difference. wespeculate that this trend indicates that surveys among very low-mass fieldstars may have missed a substantial population of intermediate mass ratiosystems, implying that these systems are more common and more diverse thanpreviously thought.

1306.4446	dynamical analysis of nearby clusters. automated astrometry from the  ground: precision proper motions over wide field	the kinematic properties of the different classes of objects in a givenassociation hold important clues about its member's history, and offer a uniqueopportunity to test the predictions of the various models of stellar formationand evolution. dance (standing for dynamical analysis of nearby clusters) is asurvey program aimed at deriving a comprehensive and homogeneous census of thestellar and substellar content of a number of nearby (&lt;1kpc) young (&lt;500myr)associations. whenever possible, members will be identified based on theirkinematics properties, ensuring little contamination from background andforeground sources. otherwise, the dynamics of previously confirmed memberswill be studied using the proper motion measurements. we present here themethod used to derive precise proper motion measurements, using the pleiadescluster as a test bench. combining deep wide field multi-epoch panchromaticimages obtained at various obervatories over up to 14 years, we derive accurateproper motions for the sources present in the field of the survey. the datasetscover ~80 square degrees, centered around the seven sisters. using new tools,we have computed a catalog of 6116907 unique sources, including proper motionmeasurements for 3577478 of them. the catalogue covers the magnitude rangebetween i=12~24mag, achieving a proper motion accuracy &lt;1mas/yr for sources asfaint as i=22.5mag. we estimate that our final accuracy reaches 0.3mas/yr inthe best cases, depending on magnitude, observing history, and the presence ofreference extragalactic sources for the anchoring onto the icrs.

0801.4424	follow-up observations of binary ultra-cool dwarfs	astrometric observations of resolved binaries provide estimates of orbitalperiods and will eventually lead to measurement of dynamical masses. only a fewvery low mass star and brown dwarf masses have been measured to date, and themass-luminosity relation still needs to be calibrated.  we have monitored 14 very low mass multiple systems for several years toconfirm their multiplicity and, for those with a short period, derive accurateorbital parameters and dynamical mass estimates.  we have used high spatial resolution images obtained at the paranal, lick andhst observatories to obtain astrometric and photometric measurements of themultiple systems at several epochs. the targets have periods ranging from 5 to200 years, and spectral types in the range m7.5 - t5.5.  all of our 14 multiple systems are confirmed as common proper motion pairs.one system (2massw j0920122+351742) is not resolved in our new images, probablybecause the discovery images were taken near maximum elongation. six systemshave periods short enough to allow dynamical mass measurements within the next15 to 20years. we estimate that only 8% of the ultracool dwarfs in the solarneighborhood are binaries with separations large enough to be resolved, and yetperiods short enough to derive astrometric orbital fits over a reasonable timeframe with current instrumentation. a survey that doubles the number ofultracool dwarfs observed with high angular resolution is called for todiscover enough binaries for a first attempt to derive the mass-luminosityrelationship for very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.

1310.3209	characteristics and large bulk density of the c-type main-belt triple  asteroid (93) minerva	from a set of adaptive optics (ao) observations collected with the w.m. kecktelescope between august and september 2009, we derived the orbital parametersof the most recently discovered satellites of the large c-type asteroid (93)minerva. the satellites of minerva, which are approximately 3 and 4 km indiameter, orbit very close to the primary $\sim$5 &amp; $\sim$8 $\times$ rp and$\sim$1% &amp; $\sim$2% $\times$ rhill) in a circular manner, sharing commoncharacteristics with most of the triple asteroid systems in the main-belt.combining these ao observations with lightcurve data collected since 1980 andtwo stellar occultations in 2010 &amp; 2011, we removed the ambiguity of the polesolution of minerva's primary and showed that it has an almost regular shapewith an equivalent diameter deq = 154 $\pm$ 6 km in agreement with irasobservations. the surprisingly high bulk density of 1.75 $\pm$ 0.30 g/cm$\^3$for this c-type asteroid, suggests that this taxonomic class is composed ofasteroids with different compositions, for instance, minerva could be made ofthe same material as dry cr, co, and cv meteorites. we discuss possiblescenarios on the origin of the system and conclude that future observations mayshine light on the nature and composition of this fifth known triple main-beltasteroid.

1312.3943	kepler-91b: a planet at the end of its life. planet and giant host star  properties via light-curve variations	the evolution of planetary systems is intimately linked to the evolution oftheir host star. our understanding of the whole planetary evolution process isbased on the large planet diversity observed so far. to date, only few tens ofplanets have been discovered orbiting stars ascending the red giant branch.although several theories have been proposed, the question of how planets dieremains open due to the small number statistics. in this work we study thegiant star kepler-91 (koi-2133) in order to determine the nature of atransiting companion. this system was detected by the kepler space telescope.however, its planetary confirmation is needed. we confirm the planetary natureof the object transiting the star kepler-91 by deriving a mass of $m_p=0.88^{+0.17}_{-0.33} ~m_{\rm jup}$ and a planetary radius of$r_p=1.384^{+0.011}_{-0.054} ~r_{\rm jup}$. asteroseismic analysis produces astellar radius of $r_{\star}=6.30\pm 0.16 ~r_{\odot}$ and a mass of$m_{\star}=1.31\pm 0.10 ~ m_{\odot} $. we find that its eccentric orbit($e=0.066^{+0.013}_{-0.017}$) is just $1.32^{+0.07}_{-0.22} ~ r_{\star}$ awayfrom the stellar atmosphere at the pericenter. kepler-91b could be the previousstage of the planet engulfment, recently detected for bd+48 740. ourestimations show that kepler-91b will be swallowed by its host star in lessthan 55 myr. among the confirmed planets around giant stars, this is theplanetary-mass body closest to its host star. at pericenter passage, the starsubtends an angle of $48^{\circ}$, covering around 10% of the sky as seen fromthe planet. the planetary atmosphere seems to be inflated probably due to thehigh stellar irradiation.

1401.7427	cluster membership probabilities from proper motions and multiwavelength  photometric catalogues: i. method and application to the pleiades cluster	we present a new technique designed to take full advantage of the highdimensionality (photometric, astrometric, temporal) of the dance survey toderive self-consistent and robust membership probabilities of the pleiadescluster. we aim at developing a methodology to infer membership probabilitiesto the pleiades cluster from the dance multidimensional astro-photometric dataset in a consistent way throughout the entire derivation. the determination ofthe membership probabilities has to be applicable to censored data and mustincorporate the measurement uncertainties into the inference procedure.  we use bayes' theorem and a curvilinear forward model for the likelihood ofthe measurements of cluster members in the colour-magnitude space, to inferposterior membership probabilities. the distribution of the cluster membersproper motions and the distribution of contaminants in the fullmultidimensional astro-photometric space is modelled with amixture-of-gaussians likelihood. we analyse several representation spacescomposed of the proper motions plus a subset of the available magnitudes andcolour indices. we select two prominent representation spaces composed ofvariables selected using feature relevance determination techniques based inrandom forests, and analyse the resulting samples of high probabilitycandidates. we consistently find lists of high probability (p &gt; 0.9975)candidates with $\approx$ 1000 sources, 4 to 5 times more than obtained in themost recent astro-photometric studies of the cluster.  the methodology presented here is ready for application in data sets thatinclude more dimensions, such as radial and/or rotational velocities, spectralindices and variability.

1402.1034	orion revisited. ii. the foreground population to orion a	following the recent discovery of a large population of young stars in frontof the orion nebula, we carried out an observational campaign with the decamwide-field camera covering ~10~deg^2 centered on ngc 1980 to confirm, probe theextent of, and characterize this foreground population of pre-main-sequencestars. we confirm the presence of a large foreground population towards theorion a cloud. this population contains several distinct subgroups, includingngc1980 and ngc1981, and stretches across several degrees in front of the oriona cloud. by comparing the location of their sequence in various color-magnitudediagrams with other clusters, we found a distance and an age of 380pc and5~10myr, in good agreement with previous estimates. our final sample includes2123 candidate members and is complete from below the hydrogen-burning limit toabout 0.3msun, where the data start to be limited by saturation. extrapolatingthe mass function to the high masses, we estimate a total number of ~2600members in the surveyed region. we confirm the presence of a rich, contiguous,and essentially coeval population of about 2600 foreground stars in front ofthe orion a cloud, loosely clustered around ngc1980, ngc1981, and a new groupin the foreground of the omc-2/3. for the area of the cloud surveyed, thisresult implies that there are more young stars in the foreground populationthan young stars inside the cloud. assuming a normal initial mass function, weestimate that between one to a few supernovae must have exploded in theforeground population in the past few million years, close to the surface oforion a, which might be responsible, together with stellar winds, for thestructure and star formation activity in these clouds. this long-overlookedforeground stellar population is of great significance, calling for a revisionof the star formation history in this region of the galaxy.

1405.1046	star formation in the massive cluster merger abell 2744	we present a comprehensive study of star-forming (sf) galaxies in the hstfrontier field recent cluster merger a2744 (z=0.308). wide-field,ultraviolet-infrared (uv-ir) imaging enables a direct constraint of the totalstar formation rate (sfr) for 53 cluster galaxies, with sfr{uv+ir}=343+/-10msun/yr. within the central 4 arcmin (1.1 mpc) radius, the integrated sfr iscomplete, yielding a total sfr{uv+ir}=201+/-9 msun/yr. focussing on obscuredstar formation, this core region exhibits a total sfr{ir}=138+/-8 msun/yr, amass-normalised sfr{ir} of sigma{sfr}=11.2+/-0.7 msun/yr per 10^14 msun and afraction of ir-detected sf galaxies f{sf}=0.080(+0.010,-0.037). overall, thecluster population at z~0.3 exhibits significant intrinsic scatter in irproperties (total sfr{ir}, tdust distribution) apparently unrelated to thedynamical state: a2744 is noticeably different to the merging bullet cluster,but similar to several relaxed clusters. however, in a2744 we identify a trailof sf sources including jellyfish galaxies with substantial unobscured sf dueto extreme stripping (sfr{uv}/sfr{ir} up to 3.3). the orientation of the trail,and of material stripped from constituent galaxies, indicates that the passingshock front of the cluster merger was the trigger. constraints on starformation from both ir and uv are crucial for understanding galaxy evolutionwithin the densest environments.

1405.3120	high-resolution imaging of $kepler$ planet host candidates. a  comprehensive comparison of different techniques	the kepler mission has discovered thousands of planet candidates. currently,some of them have already been discarded; more than 200 have been confirmed byfollow-up observations, and several hundreds have been validated. however, mostof them are still awaiting for confirmation. thus, priorities (in terms of theprobability of the candidate being a real planet) must be established forsubsequent observations. the motivation of this work is to provide a set ofisolated (good) host candidates to be further tested by other techniques. weidentify close companions of the candidates that could have contaminated thelight curve of the planet host. we used the astralux north instrument locatedat the 2.2 m telescope in the calar alto observatory to obtaindiffraction-limited images of 174 kepler objects of interest. the lucky-imagingtechnique used in this work is compared to other ao and speckle imagingobservations of kepler planet host candidates. we define a new parameter, theblended source confidence level (bsc), to assess the probability of an objectto have blended non-detected eclipsing binaries capable of producing thedetected transit. we find that 67.2% of the observed kepler hosts are isolatedwithin our detectability limits, and 32.8% have at least one visual companionat angular separations below 6 arcsec. we find close companions (below 3arcsec) for the 17.2% of the sample. the planet properties of this sample ofnon-isolated hosts are revised. we report one possible s-type binary(koi-3158). we also report three possible false positives (kois 1230.01,3649.01, and 3886.01) due to the presence of close companions. the bscparameter is calculated for all the isolated targets and compared to both thevalue prior to any high-resolution image and, when possible, to observationsfrom previous high-spatial resolution surveys in the kepler sample.

1502.05747	the echo science case	the discovery of almost 2000 exoplanets has revealed an unexpectedly diverseplanet population. observations to date have shown that our solar system iscertainly not representative of the general population of planets in our milkyway. the key science questions that urgently need addressing are therefore:what are exoplanets made of? why are planets as they are? what causes theexceptional diversity observed as compared to the solar system?  echo (exoplanet characterisation observatory) has been designed as adedicated survey mission for transit and eclipse spectroscopy capable ofobserving a large and diverse planet sample within its four-year missionlifetime. echo can target the atmospheres of super-earths, neptune-like, andjupiter-like planets, in the very hot to temperate zones (planet temperaturesof 300k-3000k) of f to m-type host stars. over the next ten years, several newground- and space-based transit surveys will come on-line (e.g. ngts, cheops,tess, plato), which will specifically focus on finding bright, nearby systems.the current rapid rate of discovery would allow the target list to be furtheroptimised in the years prior to echo's launch and enable the atmosphericcharacterisation of hundreds of planets. placing the satellite at l2 provides acold and stable thermal environment, as well as a large field of regard toallow efficient time-critical observation of targets randomly distributed overthe sky. a 1m class telescope is sufficiently large to achieve the necessaryspectro-photometric precision. the spectral coverage (0.5-11 micron, goal 16micron) and snr to be achieved by echo, thanks to its high stability anddedicated design, would enable a very accurate measurement of the atmosphericcomposition and structure of hundreds of exoplanets.

1504.04824	spectro-astrometry of lkca 15 with x-shooter: searching for emission  from lkca 15b	planet formation is one explanation for the partial clearing of dust observedin the disks of some t tauri stars. indeed studies using state-of-the-art highangular resolution techniques have very recently begun to observe planetarycompanions in these so-called transitional disks. the goal of this work is touse spectra of the transitional disk object lkca 15 obtained with x-shooter onthe very large telescope to investigate the possibility of usingspectro-astrometry to detect planetary companions to t tauri stars. it isargued that an accreting planet should contribute to the total emission ofaccretion tracers such as h$\alpha$ and therefore planetary companions could bedetected with spectro-astrometry in the same way as it has been used to detectstellar companions to young stars. a probable planetary-mass companion wasrecently detected in the disk of lkca 15. therefore, it is an ideal target forthis pilot study. we studied several key accretion lines in the wavelengthrange 300 nm to 2.2 $\mu$m with spectro-astrometry. while nospectro-astrometric signal is measured for any emission lines the accuracyachieved in the technique is used to place an upper limit on the contributionof the planet to the flux of the h$\alpha$, pa$\gamma$, and pa$\beta$ lines.the derived upper limits on the flux allows an upper limit of the massaccretion rate, log($\dot{m}_{acc}$) = -8.9 to -9.3 for the mass of thecompanion between 6 m$_{jup}$ and 15 m$_{jup}$, respectively, to be estimated(with some assumptions).

1505.07586	first detection of thermal radio jets in a sample of proto-brown dwarf  candidates	we observed with the jvla at 3.6 and 1.3 cm a sample of 11 proto-brown dwarfcandidates in taurus in a search for thermal radio jets driven by the mostembedded brown dwarfs. we detected for the first time four thermal radio jetsin proto-brown dwarf candidates. we compiled data from ukidss, 2mass, spitzer,wise and herschel to build the spectral energy distribution (sed) of theobjects in our sample, which are similar to typical class~i seds of youngstellar objects (ysos). the four proto-brown dwarf candidates driving thermalradio jets also roughly follow the well-known trend of centimeter luminosityagainst bolometric luminosity determined for ysos, assuming they belong totaurus, although they present some excess of radio emission compared to theknown relation for ysos. nonetheless, we are able to reproduce the fluxdensities of the radio jets modeling the centimeter emission of the thermalradio jets using the same type of models applied to ysos, but withcorresponding smaller stellar wind velocities and mass-loss rates, andexploring different possible geometries of the wind or outflow from the star.moreover, we also find that the modeled mass outflow rates for the bolometricluminosities of our objects agree reasonably well with the trends found betweenthe mass outflow rates and bolometric luminosities of ysos, which indicatesthat, despite the "excess" centimeter emission, the intrinsic properties ofproto-brown dwarfs are consistent with a continuation of those of very low massstars to a lower mass range. overall, our study favors the formation of browndwarfs as a scaled-down version of low-mass stars.

1505.07837	search for associations containing young stars (sacy). vi. is  multiplicity universal? stellar multiplicity in the range 3-1000 au from  adaptive-optics observations	context. young loose nearby associations are unique samples of close (&lt;150pc), young (approx 5-100 myr) pre-main sequence (pms) stars. a significantnumber of members of these associations have been identified in the sacycollaboration. we can use the proximity and youth of these members toinvestigate key ingredients in star formation processes, such as multiplicity.  aims. we present the statistics of identified multiple systems from 113confirmed sacy members. we derive multiplicity frequencies, mass-ratio, andphysical separation distributions in a consistent parameter space, and compareour results to other pms populations and the field.  methods. we have obtained adaptive-optics assisted near-infrared observationswith naco (eso/vlt) and ircal (lick observatory) for at least one epoch of all113 sacy members. we have identified multiple systems using co-movingproper-motion analysis and using contamination estimates. we have exploredranges in projected separation and mass-ratio of a [3-1000 au], and q [0.1-1],respectively.  results. we have identified 31 multiple systems (28 binaries and 3 triples).we derive a multiplicity frequency (mf) of mf_(3-1000au)=28.4 +4.7, -3.9% and atriple frequency (tf) of tf_(3-1000au)=2.8 +2.5, -0.8% in the separation rangeof 3-1000 au. we do not find any evidence for an increase in the mf withprimary mass. the estimated mass-ratio of our statistical sample (withpower-law index gamma=-0.04 +/- 0.14) is consistent with a flat distribution(gamma = 0).  conclusions. we show further similarities (but also hints of discrepancies)between sacy and the taurus region: flat mass-ratio distributions andstatistically similar mf and tf values. we also compared the sacy sample to thefield (in the separation range of 19-100 au), finding that the twodistributions are indistinguishable, suggesting a similar formation mechanism.

0805.2201	from shock breakout to peak and beyond: extensive panchromatic  observations of the type ib supernova 2008d associated with swift x-ray  transient 080109	we present extensive early photometric (ultraviolet through near-infrared)and spectroscopic (optical and near-infrared) data on supernova (sn) 2008d aswell as x-ray data analysis on the associated swift/x-ray transient (xrt)080109. our data span a time range of 5 hours before the detection of the x-raytransient to 150 days after its detection, and detailed analysis allowed us toderive constraints on the nature of the sn and its progenitor; throughout wedraw comparisons with results presented in the literature and find several keyaspects that differ. we show that the x-ray spectrum of xrt 080109 can be fitequally well by an absorbed power law or a superposition of about equal partsof both power law and blackbody. our data first established that sn 2008d is aspectroscopically normal sn ib (i.e., showing conspicuous he lines), and showthat sn 2008d had a relatively long rise time of 18 days and a modest opticalpeak luminosity. the early-time light curves of the sn are dominated by acooling stellar envelope (for \delta t~0.1- 4 day, most pronounced in the bluebands) followed by 56^ni decay. we construct a reliable measurement of thebolometric output for this stripped-envelope sn, and, combined with estimatesof e_k and m_ej from the literature, estimate the stellar radius r_star of itsprobable wolf-rayet progenitor. according to the model of waxman et al. and ofchevalier &amp; fransson, we derive r_star^{w07}= 1.2+/-0.7 r_sun andr_star^{cf08}= 12+/-7 r_sun, respectively; the latter being more in line withtypical wn stars. spectra obtained at 3 and 4 months after maximum light showdouble-peaked oxygen lines that we associate with departures from sphericalsymmetry, as has been suggested for the inner ejecta of a number of sn ibcores.

1509.08718	parallax of the l4.5 dwarf 2m1821$+$14 from high-precision astrometry  with osiris at gtc	we used the osiris camera at the 10.4 m gran telescopio canarias (gtc) tomonitor the astrometric motion of the l4.5 dwarf 2m1821$+$14 over 17 months.the astrometric residuals of eleven epochs have a r.m.s. dispersion of 0.4 mas,which is larger than the average precision of 0.23 mas per epoch and hintstowards an additional signal or excess noise. comparison of thepoint-spread-functions in osiris and fors2/vlt images reveals no differencescritical for high-precision astrometry, despite the gtc's segmented primarymirror. we attribute the excess noise to an unknown effect that may beuncovered with additional data. for 2m1821$+$14, we measured a relativeparallax of $106.15 \pm 0.18$ mas and determined a correction of $0.50\pm0.05$mas to absolute parallax, leading to a distance of $9.38 \pm0.03$ pc. weexcluded at 3-$\sigma$ confidence the presence of a companion to 2m1821$+$14down to a mass ratio of 0.1 ($\approx 5\, m_\mathrm{jupiter}$) with a period of50--1000 days and a separation of 0.1--0.7 au. the accurate parallax allowed usto estimate the age and mass of 2m1821$+$14 of 120--700 myr and0.049$^{+0.014}_{-0.024}$ m$_\odot$, thus confirming its intermediate age andsubstellar mass. we complement our study with a parallax and proper motioncatalogue of 587 stars ($i'\simeq15.5-22$) close to 2m1821$+$14, used asastrometric references. this study demonstrates sub-mas astrometry with thegtc, a capability applicable for a variety of science cases including thesearch for extrasolar planets and relevant for future astrometric observationswith e-elt and tmt.

1512.00418	a submillimeter search for pre- and proto-brown dwarfs in chamaeleon ii	context. chamaeleon ii molecular cloud is an active star forming region thatoffers an excellent opportunity for studying the formation of brown dwarfs inthe southern hemisphere. aims. our aims are to identify a population of pre-and proto- brown dwarfs (5 sigma mass limit threshold of ~0.015 msun) andprovide information on the formation mechanisms of substellar objects. methods.we performed high sensitivity observations at 870 microns using the labocabolometer at the apex telescope towards an active star forming region inchamaeleon ii. the data are complemented with an extensive multiwavelengthcatalogue of sources from the optical to the far-infrared to study the natureof the laboca detections. results. we detect fifteen cores at 870 microns, andeleven of them show masses in the substellar regime. the most intense objectsin the surveyed field correspond to the submillimeter counterparts of the wellknown young stellar objects dk cha and iras 12500-7658. we identify a possibleproto-brown dwarf candidate (chaii-apex-l) with irac emission at 3.6 and 4.5microns. conclusions. our analysis indicates that most of the spatiallyresolved cores are transient, and that the point-like starless cores in thesub-stellar regime (with masses between 0.016 msun and 0.066 msun) could bepre-brown dwarfs cores gravitationally unstable if they have radii smaller than220 au to 907 au (1.2" to 5" at 178 pc) respectively for different masses. almaobservations will be the key to reveal the energetic state of these pre-browndwarfs candidates.

0808.3890	a deep look into the cores of young clusters i. sigma-orionis	nearby young clusters are privileged places to study the star formationhistory. over the last decade, the sigma-orionis cluster has been a primelocation for the study of young very low mass stars, substellar and isolatedplanetary mass objects and the determination of the initial mass function.  to extend previous studies of this association to its core, we searched forultracool members and new multiple systems within the 1.5'x1.5' central regionof the cluster.  we obtained deep multi-conjugate adaptive optics (mcao) images of the core ofthe sigma-orionis cluster with the prototype mcao facility mad at the vlt usingthe h and ks filters. these images allow us to reach delta h~5mag as close as0.2" on a typical source with h=14.5mag. these images were complemented byarchival sofi ks-band images and spitzer irac and mips mid-infrared images.  we report the detection of 2 new visual multiple systems, one being acandidate binary proplyd and the other one a low mass companion to the massivestar sigma ori e. of the 36 sources detected in the images, 25 have a h-bandluminosity lower than the expected planetary mass limit for members, and h-kscolor consistent with the latest theoretical isochrones. nine objects haveadditional spitzer photometry and spectral energy distribution consistent withthem being cluster members. one of them has a spectral energy distribution fromh to 3.6micron consistent with that of a 5.5 mjup cluster member. complementaryntt/sofi and spitzer photometry allow us to confirm the nature and membershipof two l-dwarf planetary mass candidates.

astro-ph;0603194	spectroscopic rotational velocities of brown dwarfs	we have obtained projected rotation velocities (vsini) of a sample of 19ultracool dwarfs with spectral types in the interval m6.5-t8 usinghigh-resolution, near-infrared spectra obtained with nirspec and the keck iitelescope. among our targets there are two young brown dwarfs, two likely fieldstars, and fifteen likely brown dwarfs (30-72 mjup) of the solar neighborhood.our results indicate that the t-type dwarfs are fast rotators in markedcontrast to m-type stars. we have derived vsini velocities between &lt;15 and 40km/s for them, and have found no clear evidence for t dwarfs rotating stronglyfaster than l dwarfs. however, there is a hint for an increasing lower envelopeon moving from mid-m to the l spectral types in the vsini-spectral type diagramthat was previously reported in the literature; our vsini results extend it toeven cooler types. assuming that field brown dwarfs have a size of 0.08-0.1rsol, we can place an upper limit of 12.5 h on the equatorial rotation periodof t-type brown dwarfs. in addition, we have compared our vsini measurements tospectroscopic rotational velocities of very young brown dwarfs of similar massavailable in the literature. the comparison, although model-dependent, suggeststhat brown dwarfs lose some angular momentum during their contraction; however,their spin down time seems to be significantly longer than that of solar-typeto early-m stars.

0810.0099	binarity at the l/t brown dwarf transition	current atmospheric models cannot reproduce some of the characteristics ofthe transition between the l dwarfs with cloudy atmospheres and the t dwarfswith dust-depleted photospheres. it has been proposed that a majority of thel/t transition brown dwarfs could actually be a combinaison of a cloudy l dwarfand a clear t dwarf. indeed binarity seems to occur more frequently among l/ttransition brown dwarfs.  we aim to refine the statistical significance of the seemingly higherfrequency of binaries. co-eval binaries would also be interesting test-beds forevolutionary models. we obtained high-resolution imaging for six mid-l tolate-t dwarfs, with photometric distances between 8 and 33pc, using theadaptive optics systems naco at the vlt, and the lick system, both with thelaser guide star.  we resolve none of our targets. combining our data with published results, weobtain a frequency of resolved l/t transition brown dwarfs of (31+21-15)%,compared to (21+10-7)% and (14+14-7)% for mid-l and t dwarfs (90% of confidencelevel). these fractions do not significantly support, nor contradict, thehypothesis of a larger binary fraction in the l/t transition. none of ourtargets has companions with effective temperatures as low as 360-1000k atseparations larger than 0.5".

0810.4042	an iphas-based search for accreting very low-mass objects using vo tools	the main goal of this paper is to prove that accreting very low-mass starsand brown dwarfs can be identified in iphas, a halpha emission survey of thenorthern milky way.full exploitation of the iphas database and a futureextension of it in the southern hemisphere will be useful to identify verylow-mass accreting objects near and far well-known star forming regions. wehave used virtual observatory tools to cross-match the iphas catalogue with the2mass catalogue. we defined photometric criteria to identify halpha emissionsources with near-infrared colours similar to known young very low-mass starsand brown dwarfs. 4000 candidates were identified that met our criteria over anarea of 1600 square degrees. we present low-resolution optical spectra of 113candidates. spectral types have been derived for the 33 candidates that havespectroscopically confirmed halpha emission, negligible reddening and mspectral class. we have also measured halpha emission and investigated the naidoublet (818.3 nm, 819.5 nm) in these 33 objects. we confirm that 33 iphascandidates have strong halpha indicative of disk accretion for their spectraltype. 23 of them have spectral class m4 or later, of which 10 have classes inthe range m5.5-m7.0 and thus could be very young brown dwarfs. also manyobjects have weak nai doublet, an indication of low surface gravity.we concludethat iphas provides a very valuable database to identify accreting verylow-mass stars and brown dwarfs, and that virtual observatory tools provide anefficient method for identifying these objects over large areas of the sky.based on our success rate of 23 halpha emission objects with spectral type inthe range m4-m7 out of 113 candidates with spectroscopic follow-up, we estimatethat there could be hundreds of such objects in the full iphas survey.

0706.0784	space velocities of l- and t-type dwarfs	(abridged) we have obtained radial velocities of a sample of 18 ultracooldwarfs (m6.5-t8) using high-resolution, near-infrared spectra obtained withnirspec and the keck ii telescope. we have confirmed that the radial velocityof gl 570 d is coincident with that of the k-type primary star gl 570 a, thusproviding additional support for their true companionship. the presence ofplanetary-mass companions around 2mass j05591914-1404488 (t4.5v) has beenanalyzed using five nirspec radial velocity measurements obtained over a periodof 4.37 yr. we have computed uvw space motions for a total of 21 l and t dwarfswithin 20 pc of the sun. this population shows uvw velocities that nicelyoverlap the typical kinematics of solar to m-type stars within the same spatialvolume. however, the mean galactic (44.2 km/s) and tangential (36.5 km/s)velocities of the l and t dwarfs appear to be smaller than those of g to mstars. a significant fraction (~40%) of the l and t dwarfs lies near the hyadesmoving group (0.4-2 gyr), which contrasts with the 10-12% found forearlier-type stellar neighbors. additionally, the distributions of all threeuvw components (sigma_{uvw} = 30.2, 16.5, 15.8 km/s) and the distributions ofthe total galactic (sigma_{v_tot} = 19.1 km/s) and tangential (sigma_{v_t} =17.6 km/s) velocities derived for the l and t dwarf sample are narrower thanthose measured for nearby g, k, and m-type stars, but similar to thedispersions obtained for f stars. this suggests that, in the solarneighborhood, the l- and t-type ultracool dwarfs in our sample (including browndwarfs) is kinematically younger than solar-type to early m stars with likelyages in the interval 0.5-4 gyr.
